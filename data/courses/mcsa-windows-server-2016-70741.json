Absolutely, so\n\n7\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.700\nit's an exciting conversation we're gonna\nhave around Server 2016 networking.\n\n8\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.430\nWe'll be talking about things\nlike implementing DNS,\n\n9\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.160\nDHDP, technology called IPAM,\nIP address management.\n\n10\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.840\nHow we integrate that with DHDP and DNS.\n\n11\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.680\nTake a look at implementing network\nconnectivity and routing remote access,\n\n12\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.180\nso take a look at remote\ncapabilities there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.890\nTalk about core and distributed networking\nsolutions, software defined networking.\n\n14\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.750\nTake a look at VPNs and\ntunneling and IPv4 and\n\n15\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.680\nIPv6 and all other forums and\nmechanisms of networking, start to finish.\n\n16\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.910\nNew, old and current for Server 16.\n\n17\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.390\nWe got some new features, got some\noldies but goodies that come back, and\n\n18\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.420\nsome things that are not necessarily the\nsame way they're been in prior versions.\n\n19\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.830\nAnd we'll talk about those updates and\n\n20\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.270\nhow they affect you as you look to get\nready to take the 7741 exam, right,\n\n21\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.530\ncuz that's gonna be hopefully the goal of\none of the things you wanna do with this.\n\n22\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.050\nAnd it's going to give you credit for\nthe Windows Server 2016 MCSA.\n\n23\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.010\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.770\nNow who would be the audience,\nthe intended audience for this series?\n\n25\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.372\n&gt;&gt; Well, certainly as I just mentioned,\nbut you may want to go out and\n\n26\n00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:32.080\ntake a look at gaming and\ngetting the MCSA credential on Server 16.\n\n27\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.920\nSo certainly those people\nthat are pursuing that.\n\n28\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600\nAny IT professional that wants to learn\nmore about networking and prove and\n\n29\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.720\nvalidate those skills can take this exam,\n\n30\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.550\nwhether they're ultimately\npursuing the MCSA or not.\n\n31\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.700\nBut an IT professional, somebody who's\nhands on in the trenches day in,\n\n32\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.070\nday out with server administration\non the Server 16 platform\n\n33\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.820\nwill be a prime candidate for this exam.\n\n34\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\nNow, you've mentioned the exam a couple of\n\n35\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.370\ntimes, maybe you could give us\na couple of details about that.\n\n36\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, so the exam, like all\nMicrosoft's exams will be interactive,\n\n37\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.440\nin a sense you have a series of\ndifferent kinds of questions,\n\n38\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.780\ntraditional multiple choice questions,\nscenario based questions,\n\n39\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.490\nthere may be interactive\nquestions of a variety of types.\n\n40\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.720\nYou may have drag and drops for instance.\n\n41\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.190\nYou may have hot spot\nquestions where you have to\n\n42\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730\nselect something in a console shot or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n43\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.070\nHey, what's wrong with this\nparticular console interface.\n\n44\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.500\nClick on the area, you know you\nusually put a little cross-hair or\n\n45\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.230\nsomething like that on the area\nthat you may want to change.\n\n46\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.240\nYou may be asked to go in to\nexamine a diagram of some kind and\n\n47\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.890\ndocument or diagnose a problem\nas a result of what you see.\n\n48\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.070\nThere's a variety of different ways that\nquestions can get asked today, and any or\n\n49\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.180\nall of those could potentially\nshow up on this exam.\n\n50\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.330\nThey do on many other,\nindeed most Microsoft exams these days.\n\n51\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam thank you for that\nand if that sounds like something that may\n\n52\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.977\nbe interesting to you, we look forward\nto seeing you in the upcoming series.\n\n53\n00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.707\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:08.268\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:12.103\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.811\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're coming back at you with more\n\n7\n00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:21.107\nof that networking with\nWindows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:24.674\nAnd we're looking at probably one of the\nmost important services you have in your\n\n9\n00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:28.400\nnetworks, across the backbone of the\nInternet when it comes to finding things.\n\n10\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.180\nJoining me for this very subject is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.907\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:35.995\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, thanks for having\nme back, and you are right, you know, DNS,\n\n13\n00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.550\nDomain Name System, it's one of\nmy favorite topics to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.790\nI know I say that about half the topics\nI talk about, but DNS is, as Wes pointed\n\n15\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.910\nout, it's an extremely important service,\nreally makes everything we do possible.\n\n16\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.970\nAnd people are saying aw,\n\n17\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.700\nyou don't need DNS, I mean, you can\nconnect with IP addresses, right, Wes?\n\n18\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\ngood luck at that, though.\n\n19\n00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:56.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.515\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n21\n00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:02.566\ntry to imagine remembering the IP address\nof every website you wanted to go to,\n\n22\n00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:07.460\nhow to get to your bank account, just at\nwork, how to get to all the different\n\n23\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.732\nservers, craziness.\nAnd if you think about the corporate\n\n24\n00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:14.738\nenvironment, if I need to get to a client\nmachine, which is typically using DHCP,\n\n25\n00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:16.934\nthat means their IP\naddresses are changing.\n\n26\n00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:17.900\nNow what do I do, right?\n\n27\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.578\nSo that's why DNS is so important.\n\n28\n00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:24.809\nDNS, Domain Name System, allows us to\nassign friendly names to IP addresses\n\n29\n00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:30.210\nthat get resolved through a process that\nwe're going to go over and talk about.\n\n30\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860\nAnd at this point, when we're studying for\nthis exam, we really should be familiar\n\n31\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.843\nwith the concept of DNS and what it's\ndoing, so I'm gonna go over it briefly,\n\n32\n00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:46.940\ntalk about kind of the way it's set\nup to help us resolve external names.\n\n33\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.030\nBecause that's gonna help us\nunderstand what we're doing internally.\n\n34\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.390\nIf we don't know what's going on\nout there in the big bad world,\n\n35\n00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.185\nwhy do I need forwarders,\nwhy do I need conditional forwarders,\n\n36\n00:01:57.185 --> 00:01:59.510\nwhy do I need root hints,\nI don't understand this.\n\n37\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.530\nBecause you need to understand\nwhat's going on out there, right?\n\n38\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.950\nIt's not just your little DNS server\nproviding name resolution for\n\n39\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.660\nyour company's network,\nthere's a lot more to it.\n\n40\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.056\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike, when you say DNS,\nI think of just this acronym, and\n\n41\n00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:13.000\nis this a place or something like this?\n\n42\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.194\nBut when it comes down to it, DNS, we're\ntalking about a lot of infrastructure,\n\n43\n00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:19.621\nright, a lot of infrastructure that, thank\ngoodness, most of it's already set up and\n\n44\n00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.920\nin place for us so\nwe can just take advantage of it, right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.071\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely, all we gotta\ndo is tie into it, and we're good to go.\n\n46\n00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.381\nI mean, I can't remember, I saw\na statistic a little while ago about how\n\n47\n00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.697\nmany names are actually registered\nper hour, and it's just phenomenal\n\n48\n00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:39.030\nthe growth of the Internet, and\neverybody's coming up with websites.\n\n49\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850\nEvery business has to have a website,\n\n50\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.402\nnew businesses are popping up, new web\nfront-ends are popping up, it's amazing.\n\n51\n00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.230\nAll right, so let's get into it, cuz we\nreally need to get into what we need to\n\n52\n00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.790\nknow about Microsoft's DNS for the exam.\n\n53\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.480\nBut like I said, I do wanna talk a little\nbit about just DNS in general first to\n\n54\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.010\ngive us that background knowledge, make\nsure we're all playing on the same page.\n\n55\n00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.330\nAnd I will also mention,\nwhich you should probably already know,\n\n56\n00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.540\nMicrosoft is not the only\nsolution when it comes to DNS.\n\n57\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.726\nYou've got your BIND,\nyour Berkeley Internet Name server,\n\n58\n00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:14.811\nis a very popular flavor, if you will,\nof DNS, or implementation of DNS.\n\n59\n00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:19.632\nMy DNS is not a Microsoft thing, Microsoft\njust likes to use those names, right?\n\n60\n00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:23.190\nWe have Microsoft DNS Server, well,\nDNS is not a Microsoft thing.\n\n61\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.982\nYou've got Microsoft SQL Server, well,\nSQL is not a Microsoft thing, right?\n\n62\n00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:29.670\nBut that's their registered name for\ntheir database product, so\n\n63\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.450\nit's kinda the same thing with DNS.\n\n64\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.220\nMost of the servers you see out on\nthe Internet that are providing this name\n\n65\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.939\nresolution for us when we surf the Web or\nprobably running by, and\n\n66\n00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.675\nthey're probably not running Windows.\n\n67\n00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:43.943\nBut Windows is a very popular, Microsoft's\nDNS server is a very popular one to\n\n68\n00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:47.954\nrun in-house because we've got our\nlicences, we've got our servers,\n\n69\n00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:52.092\nit's much easier to work with I think\nthan for a lot of people that don't have\n\n70\n00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:55.486\nthat training in Linux, or\nwhat have you, to work with BIND.\n\n71\n00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:58.495\nSo you do see it very commonly in\nthe enterprise environment, but\n\n72\n00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:01.775\nit is a standard, so these DNS servers\ntalk to each other, no problem,\n\n73\n00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.538\nwhether one's running Microsoft or\none's running BIND.\n\n74\n00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:10.660\nAll right, now, so when we talk about DNS,\nthe idea is that we need to be\n\n75\n00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.180\nable to resolve names into IP addresses,\nwe need to take a hostname that I know.\n\n76\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.463\nI know I wanna connect to Server1, or\nI wanna connect to www.google.com, right?\n\n77\n00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:26.357\nI don't know the IP address, but\nin my browser I type that name, and in\n\n78\n00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:31.130\nthe background DNS query gets generated,\nit gets sent out to these DNS servers.\n\n79\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.780\nThey end up turning that\nname back into an IP address\n\n80\n00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.580\nthat my browser can then connect to.\n\n81\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.040\nOne thing we've gotta remember is\nyou cannot connect to a name, right?\n\n82\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.024\nIf you can't take the name, or\nsomething is behind the scenes,\n\n83\n00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:45.284\nyour application can't take that name and\nturn it into an IP address,\n\n84\n00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.855\nyou're not gonna connect to it.\n\n85\n00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:49.720\nYou have to have the IP address\nin order to make a socket.\n\n86\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.975\nA socket is a connection between two\nnodes that's made up of a protocol,\n\n87\n00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:56.170\nan IP address, and a port.\n\n88\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.800\nThere's no mention of name in there,\nright, so\n\n89\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.430\nwe have to have this\nto be able to connect,\n\n90\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.270\ncuz we type in names into our applications\ncuz they're easier for us to remember.\n\n91\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.950\nI can remember Google means search,\nNewegg means computer parts.\n\n92\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.879\nI can't remember, 4.2.17.123 is\nmy favorite search engine, right?\n\n93\n00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.770\nIf I had to do that,\nI would never get anywhere.\n\n94\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.440\nSo how do we do it?\n\n95\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.590\nWell, we can just have a list,\nright, a huge list of names and\n\n96\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.270\nIP addresses, every single name out\nthere and every single IP address.\n\n97\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.370\nAnd we just look it up in that list,\nand we find it.\n\n98\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.991\nThat would work, but\nit's not gonna be very efficient,\n\n99\n00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.392\nI guess is the word we're looking for.\n\n100\n00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:37.596\nThat list would be massive and\nmonstrous, and\n\n101\n00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:41.219\ntrying to replicate that\nlist would be impossible.\n\n102\n00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.239\nTrying to make it update to that list\nwould be extremely inefficient and\n\n103\n00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:48.120\ntime consuming, so\nit's not gonna work that way.\n\n104\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.645\nSo what DNS does is it's\na distributed hierarchical database,\n\n105\n00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:56.665\nbasically, that takes it and\nbreaks it up into chunks and\n\n106\n00:05:56.665 --> 00:06:00.840\nallows that workload to be\nspread out across servers.\n\n107\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.630\nAnd let's see how that works.\n\n108\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.516\nAll right, so\nif we take a look at my screen here,\n\n109\n00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.644\nI'm gonna try to do a drawing\non the fly as we talk here.\n\n110\n00:06:06.644 --> 00:06:08.370\nWe'll see how that goes.\n\n111\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.430\nAt the very top of the DNS infrastructure,\n\n112\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.230\nthat DNS hierarchy,\nis a server known as the root.\n\n113\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.151\nAnd let's change that to something\nother than black on black.\n\n114\n00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:26.230\nThe root, the root is at the very top,\nit represents the very\n\n115\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.380\ntop of this pyramid, if you will, or that\nDNS hierarchy, there's nothing above it.\n\n116\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.130\nIt's represented by a dot when we look at\na Fully Qualified Domain Name, or an FQDN.\n\n117\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.860\nThat's the very top, and\njust imagine he had everything.\n\n118\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.590\nLet's say that the root has the entire\nlist of every single machine and\n\n119\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.925\nIP address out there in the world,\nall right, if that was even possible,\n\n120\n00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:48.884\nbut let's pretend,\nlet's use our imagination.\n\n121\n00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:53.768\nSo the root's saying hey look, I can't\nhandle this, this is too much work for\n\n122\n00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:57.472\nme, this list is too huge,\nit takes too long to go through.\n\n123\n00:06:57.472 --> 00:06:59.886\nSo every time somebody asks me a question,\n\n124\n00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:04.130\nit takes me an hour to go through the list\nat my speeds, at computer speeds.\n\n125\n00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.080\nSo let's figure out how\nwe can break this up.\n\n126\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.210\nSo they did, they said you know what\nwe'll do is we'll divide those names up\n\n127\n00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.880\ninto more meaningful chunks.\n\n128\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.652\nLet's get rid of that, and\nlet's just copy this one,\n\n129\n00:07:15.652 --> 00:07:20.501\nwe're gonna take a server over here,\nand we're gonna call this COM.\n\n130\n00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:26.341\nI'm gonna take another one,\nand let's call this GOV,\n\n131\n00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:33.310\nand maybe even take one more, and\nwe'll call this AU, all right?\n\n132\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.601\nThese are what's known as top-level\ndomains, and these are set aside by the,\n\n133\n00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:41.146\nis it the IANA now or is it?\n\n134\n00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:44.635\nOkay, I always get that confused,\ncuz I know one of them got folded into\n\n135\n00:07:44.635 --> 00:07:47.619\nthe other, but\nthe Internet Assigned Names and Addresses?\n\n136\n00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:51.583\n&gt;&gt; Internet Assigned Numbering Authority,\nand now that I thought about it, Mike,\n\n137\n00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.313\nyou are right because it's ICANN.\n\n138\n00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:56.077\nTechnically, it's switched over\nto the Internet Corporation for\n\n139\n00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:57.781\nAssigned Names and Numbers in 2003.\n\n140\n00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:02.069\n&gt;&gt; In 2003, okay yeah, I knew at one point\nthat one had folded into the other, so\n\n141\n00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:05.054\nGood to go, but this company,\nthis non-for-profit,\n\n142\n00:08:05.054 --> 00:08:07.063\nI think they're non-for-profit.\n\n143\n00:08:07.063 --> 00:08:10.955\nBut anyway, they're the ones that\nare responsible for setting up these,\n\n144\n00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:15.090\nwhat we call, top level domains, like com\nand gub and biz and .net and .edu and\n\n145\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.229\n.au for Australia.\n\n146\n00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.350\nAll those company country codes and\nthings like that.\n\n147\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.860\nThey will allow new top-level domains when\nthey see necessary or deem necessary.\n\n148\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.345\nAnd we've see the few recently,\nlike .top, top, and .place, and\n\n149\n00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:31.880\n.show, and\nthey're always coming up with new ones.\n\n150\n00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.818\nSo the root dealers said, look this was so\nbig that I'm gonna divide it up, and\n\n151\n00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:37.350\nhow can I divide it up?\n\n152\n00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.910\nI can look at that top level domain and\nsay, I'm gonna take all the names from\n\n153\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.480\nthis list,\nthe massive list that contains everything.\n\n154\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.230\nAnd I'm gonna take all\nthe ones that end in .com and\n\n155\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.390\nI'm gonna give them to\nthis DNS server over here.\n\n156\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.320\nHe can maintain that list that way\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n157\n00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.837\nAnd then I'm gonna take all the names that\nend in .gov and give them to this guy.\n\n158\n00:08:53.837 --> 00:08:57.971\nAll the guys that end in .au and give them\nto this guy, and go through the list and\n\n159\n00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:58.780\ndivide it up.\n\n160\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.264\nSo there are top-level DNS servers for\neach one of those top-level domains.\n\n161\n00:09:02.264 --> 00:09:08.101\nAny one you can think of, .bizz,\n.edu, .net, all of them, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.621\nAnd so now the root is\nactually doing pretty good.\n\n163\n00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:13.980\nIt's, like, hey, I chopped up my list.\n\n164\n00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.050\nI gave it to all these other people.\n\n165\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.640\nI don't have anything left for me.\n\n166\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.520\nThe only thing the root has to know\nis where you gave those lists to.\n\n167\n00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.774\nIf somebody sends a query to you, and\nsays I'm looking for www.microsoft.com,\n\n168\n00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:29.741\nhe says, I don't have a list, but I know\nwho I gave all the dot.com names to.\n\n169\n00:09:29.741 --> 00:09:31.640\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n170\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.590\nThat's it, that's all the root has to\ndo now is basically start you off in\n\n171\n00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.860\nthe right direction.\n\n172\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.070\nI don't know, but\nI can tell you who should know, all right?\n\n173\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.780\nSo the root maintains a list of these\ntop-level domains, and he knows the IP\n\n174\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.340\naddresses of these top-level domain or\nDNS servers, all right?\n\n175\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.060\nThat's all he knows.\n\n176\n00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.930\nHe doesn't know IP addresses of\nMicrosoft's DNS, Microsoft's Google Web\n\n177\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.080\nserver, if I can get that out, or Google's\nWeb server, or anything like that.\n\n178\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.500\nHe just knows the top level domains.\n\n179\n00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.160\nSo that works pretty good.\n\n180\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.062\nWe divide it up that way, again,\nto split up that work load, all right?\n\n181\n00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:09.560\nNow that .com list is still pretty big.\n\n182\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.590\nThere's a lot of .com names.\n\n183\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.966\nStill not all that efficient when it\ncomes to trying to resolve a name,\n\n184\n00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.832\nlike www.microsoft.com.\n\n185\n00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:20.323\nSo what the .com server do,\nwhat we did next, we said,\n\n186\n00:10:20.323 --> 00:10:22.630\nwe're gonna divide it up even further.\n\n187\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.030\nLet's just focus on .com and\nwe'll put gov and edu way over here,\n\n188\n00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.510\nand we'll focus in on just .com because\nthey're all gonna work the same.\n\n189\n00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.198\nSo what we do now is we say, all right.\n\n190\n00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:38.184\nAnd I had this arrow here, let's dump\nhim in there just to make our drawing\n\n191\n00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:42.430\ncomplete, As I try to do this on the fly.\n\n192\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.430\nSo we take the .com and\nwe're gonna divide that up, right?\n\n193\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.170\nWell, how do we divide that up?\n\n194\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.098\nWe divide that up by registered names.\n\n195\n00:10:50.098 --> 00:10:57.156\nWhen you wanna run a website, or\nyou wannna own a portion of a name space,\n\n196\n00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:03.431\nyou go to a reseller or straight to,\ngosh, brain cramp here.\n\n197\n00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:06.340\nIt'll pop back in my head in a minute.\n\n198\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.054\nIt would go straight to-\n&gt;&gt; Is it RIRs?\n\n199\n00:11:09.054 --> 00:11:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, the registrars.\n\n200\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.984\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Regional Internet Registrars.\n\n201\n00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, [LAUGH] could\nnot remember that to save my life.\n\n202\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.700\nYou go to a registrar, but usually you're\ngoing to a reseller, like GoDaddy or\n\n203\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.350\nsome other place that can resell these\nnames, and you register your name.\n\n204\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.980\nI wanna own mikeroderick.com, all right?\n\n205\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.972\nWhat that allows me to do is make sure\nthat, hey, I own it, I can use it,\n\n206\n00:11:30.972 --> 00:11:32.648\nand nobody else can, right?\n\n207\n00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:36.549\nNobody else can use mikerodrick.com\nbecause I have registered that name.\n\n208\n00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:39.680\nIt's now mine, for\nas long as I pay my bill, all right?\n\n209\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.060\nIf I don't pay my bill,\nthen it goes back into public domain and\n\n210\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.440\nanybody can register it.\n\n211\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.076\nSo we said, all right, you know what since\nthat's still too much work for the .com,\n\n212\n00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:49.469\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna divide it up again.\n\n213\n00:11:49.469 --> 00:11:52.624\nAnd we're gonna say, hey,\nyou take care of your own records for\n\n214\n00:11:52.624 --> 00:11:54.560\nyour little portion of the name space.\n\n215\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.450\nSo Microsoft, and I'm gonna have to make\ntheir server wider to make their name fit\n\n216\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.040\nthere in this drawing,\nthey're a fat company anyway.\n\n217\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.713\nOop, I can't put a ITPro,\nwe're not a .com.\n\n218\n00:12:05.713 --> 00:12:09.505\nGoogle, who else would be another .com?\n\n219\n00:12:09.505 --> 00:12:10.577\n&gt;&gt; Might as well put Apple in there.\n\n220\n00:12:10.577 --> 00:12:11.378\n&gt;&gt; Let's put Apple.\n\n221\n00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:14.493\nThey probably got a .com name as well,\nall right?\n\n222\n00:12:14.493 --> 00:12:19.640\nSo what happens is we're gonna divide that\nname space up even further, and so this\n\n223\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.481\nDNS service says, I'm not gonna keep track\nof www.microsoft.com and www.apple.com.\n\n224\n00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.512\nI'm gonna let these companies,\nwhen you register that name,\n\n225\n00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:31.435\nyou take responsibility for\nthat portion of the name space.\n\n226\n00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:36.840\nYou have to run a DNS server to that host,\nthe Microsoft.com name space all right?\n\n227\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.405\nSo this guy now kinda\ndid what the root did.\n\n228\n00:12:39.405 --> 00:12:42.600\nHe says, I'm not gonna maintain\nall these names and IP addresses.\n\n229\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.950\nI'm just gonna tell you where\nyou can go to get those names.\n\n230\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.000\nI know the IP address of\nthe Google's DNS server.\n\n231\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.600\nI know the IP address\nof Apple's DNS server.\n\n232\n00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.330\nSo if somebody says,\nI need the IP address of www.apple.com.\n\n233\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.314\nThe .com server can simply say,\nhey, go check with apple.com's DNS\n\n234\n00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:06.811\nserver because it's the one\nthat's gonna have those records.\n\n235\n00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:09.190\nAnd somehow that did not attach.\n\n236\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.830\nWe'll stick it over there, all right?\n\n237\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.830\nApple, their DNS server that they\nmaintain, now they could pay somebody.\n\n238\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.410\nThat could be a third party\nthat's hosting it for them, but\n\n239\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.930\nit's still Apple that's responsible for\nthat.\n\n240\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.500\nThey maintain just their\nportion of a name space.\n\n241\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.869\nSo they don't have to worry about\nanybody else's names, just theirs.\n\n242\n00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:29.090\n&gt;&gt; So as a user,\nthis is transparent to me.\n\n243\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.919\nRegardless of who is actually hosting\nthe DNS, the concept's the same and\n\n244\n00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:35.551\nI'm not really gonna see\nit as an end user, right?\n\n245\n00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:39.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, unless there's a problem,\nthen you might see some of this.\n\n246\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.630\nBut yeah, to us, we just type in\nwww.apple.com in our browser and it goes.\n\n247\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.860\nBut what's really happening in the\nbackground is your computer is starting at\n\n248\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:53.550\nthe very top because it has no idea\nwhat the IP address of www.Apple.com is.\n\n249\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.340\nIt has no idea how to find\nApple.com's DNS server.\n\n250\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.280\nYour computer doesn't know that, right?\n\n251\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.520\nSo how could it ever get an IP address for\none of Apple's server.\n\n252\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.480\nWell, you start at the root.\n\n253\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.583\nYou say, root, I need www.apple.com.\n\n254\n00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:11.910\nThe root says, I don't know, but\nI know who I gave all the .com names to.\n\n255\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.410\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n256\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.442\nSo your computer says, thank you, sends\na new query to the .com server and says,\n\n257\n00:14:17.442 --> 00:14:19.970\nhey, do you know\nwww.apple.com's IP address?\n\n258\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.654\nThe .com server says, no, I don't know\nevery single IP address for all this\n\n259\n00:14:24.654 --> 00:14:30.100\ncomputers at in.com, but I do know the DNS\nserver that's responsible for apple.com.\n\n260\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.586\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n261\n00:14:31.586 --> 00:14:34.389\nAnd then my computer says,\nthank you very much, and\n\n262\n00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:38.915\nchecks with apple.com's DNS server or\nApple's DNS server I should say, and say,\n\n263\n00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:41.830\nhey, do you know the IP\naddress of www.apple.com?\n\n264\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.050\nWell, Apple's DNS server says, yes I do.\n\n265\n00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.640\nI have all the resource records for\napple.com.\n\n266\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.030\nHere's the IP address.\n\n267\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.720\nMy computer says, thank you very much.\n\n268\n00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.280\nAnd bada bing,\nmy browser opens up to www.apple.com.\n\n269\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.160\nSo it's this hierarchy of DNS\nservers that's getting the job done.\n\n270\n00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.420\nSo a couple of things that I wanna point\nout that we really want to pay attention\n\n271\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.620\nto here is the fact that there's no\none DNS server that knows everything.\n\n272\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.070\nIt's a hierarchy of DNS servers that\nwork in conjunction to resolve names and\n\n273\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.110\nIP addresses.\n\n274\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:18.460\nIt's extremely scalable because the .com\nserver doesn't care if there's one or\n\n275\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.090\na million .coms names tomorrow.\n\n276\n00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:26.790\nHe needs one record that says, wes.com,\nhere's the IP address of Wes' DNS server.\n\n277\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.967\nThat's all he has to add.\n\n278\n00:15:27.967 --> 00:15:30.849\nHe doesn't care if Wes'\ncompany has 100 nodes or\n\n279\n00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:35.020\na million nodes because Wes' DNS\nserver's gonna take care of that.\n\n280\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.570\nSo as the Internet explodes,\nit doesn't put that much\n\n281\n00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.950\nmore of a workload on these DNS\nservers in this respect, right?\n\n282\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.312\nNow overall workload, queries per second,\nthings like that, of course, goes up.\n\n283\n00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:48.469\n&gt;&gt; Thinking back to my network\nbasics there, I would say, Mike,\n\n284\n00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:52.475\nwouldn't this be kind of like what we\nwould call that, logical tree topology?\n\n285\n00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:55.393\nAnd as far as scalability goes,\nyou need a little bit more to the tree,\n\n286\n00:15:55.393 --> 00:15:56.494\njust Add another branch.\n\n287\n00:15:56.494 --> 00:15:58.839\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, you don't have to\nworry about the root, the trunk,\n\n288\n00:15:58.839 --> 00:15:59.983\nnone of that good stuff, right?\n\n289\n00:15:59.983 --> 00:16:03.160\nIf we follow that tree analogy there.\n\n290\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.440\nAll right, so that way you see, now\nthis is what we're gonna be setting up.\n\n291\n00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.740\nThis is what we need to work with.\n\n292\n00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.010\nAs an organization I need to set up DNS\nto handle my portion of the name space.\n\n293\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.202\nBecause if I don't, nobody's gonna\nbe able to come to my website.\n\n294\n00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:19.750\nNobody's gonna be able to\naccess my network externally.\n\n295\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.250\nWhen my sales people are traveling,\nhow do they get back to that VPN server?\n\n296\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.970\nThe dot com server doesn't know\nthe IP address of my VPN server.\n\n297\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.150\nThe root doesn't know the IP address,\nright?\n\n298\n00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.060\nMy DNS server does.\n\n299\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.040\nSo I've got to set this up so\nall of this works.\n\n300\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.835\nWell, at least I gotta\nset it up from here down.\n\n301\n00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:38.070\nNow again, these, I just wanna\nmake another quick note are the,\n\n302\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.480\nwhat we call second level domains.\n\n303\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.220\nThis is the root.\n\n304\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.340\nThese are top level domains, and\nthese are second level domains.\n\n305\n00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.235\nWe have to register second level domains,\nyou can't just start using Mike.com\n\n306\n00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:54.165\nbecause somebody might\nalready be using it.\n\n307\n00:16:54.165 --> 00:16:56.875\nAnd we wanna make sure that we\nregister it and it's ours, and\n\n308\n00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.265\nnobody else is gonna use it.\n\n309\n00:16:58.265 --> 00:17:02.985\nSo you have to register\nyour second level domains.\n\n310\n00:17:02.985 --> 00:17:05.893\nAnd then you can do whatever\nyou want underneath that.\n\n311\n00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.710\nIf I wanna make training that app.\n\n312\n00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.202\nIf, once I've registered apple.com,\nI can make training.apple.com,\n\n313\n00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:17.950\nlab.apple.com,\nsales.west.us.partfree.apple.com.\n\n314\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.310\nI can go as far as I want to\nthe left-hand side of that name.\n\n315\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.260\nI don't have to register anything else.\n\n316\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.630\nBecause I've registered that second\nlevel domain, and I basically,\n\n317\n00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.120\nif we think about the hierarchy,\nI now have control over everything\n\n318\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.080\nthat would show up underneath\nApple in this case, all right?\n\n319\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.920\nSo that's the way that hierarchy works.\n\n320\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.930\nThat's what we're trying to set\nup is this part, down here.\n\n321\n00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.700\nSo hopefully that gets\nus all on the same page.\n\n322\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.030\nAll right, next thing we gotta\ntalk about is installing DNS.\n\n323\n00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.770\nAnd how do I get it installed\nin a Windows environment?\n\n324\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.630\nThere's really two ways\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n325\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:58.690\nI say two ways, one would be through\neither my admirals and features wizard.\n\n326\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.940\nAll right, or I could use PowerShell,\nI'm gonna consider those the same.\n\n327\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.610\nEither I'm gonna use the GUI or not,\nbut you're just installing a role.\n\n328\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.680\nDNS is a role that's freely available\non your server once you've paid for\n\n329\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.630\nyour license, you now have access to DNS.\n\n330\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.560\nSo you can install the role\non any one of your servers.\n\n331\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.090\nYou can also install DNS when\nyou install Active Directory.\n\n332\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.710\nBecause Active Directory relies on DNS.\n\n333\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.720\nActive Directory cannot\nfunction without DNS.\n\n334\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.850\nSo when you install Active Directory,\nit's gonna check your network and\n\n335\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:31.810\nsee if you have DNS.\n\n336\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.850\nIf you have it,\nit'll let you skip DNS installation.\n\n337\n00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.655\nIf you don't have it,\nit's gonna force you to.\n\n338\n00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:42.160\nI don't even think it'll\nlet you go beyond that.\n\n339\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.160\nIf it doesn't force you to,\n\n340\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.000\nit's gonna fail because\nthe installation might succeed, but\n\n341\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.030\nactive directory's not gonna work\nbecause it relies on that information.\n\n342\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.780\nWhen you go to log in,\nyou open up your computer, you sit down,\n\n343\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.110\nyou hit the control, alt, delete dialog\nbox, you type in your username and\n\n344\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.810\npassword, where does it\nsend that information?\n\n345\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.490\nTo your domain controller to be verified.\n\n346\n00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.210\nMake sure you type in the right password.\n\n347\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.210\nHow does your computer know\nwhere the main controller is?\n\n348\n00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.585\nIt talked to DNS and said, hey, I need\nthe IP address of somebody that's running\n\n349\n00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.690\nKerberos so\nI can verify this user's credentials, and\n\n350\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.460\ndecide whether or\nnot I should allow him to log on or not.\n\n351\n00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.920\nSo without DNS, you'd never get\npast the logon screen, right?\n\n352\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.450\nEverything relies, and Active Directory\nespecially relies, on DNS.\n\n353\n00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.390\nSo you can install it when you\ninstall Active Directory as well.\n\n354\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.940\nSo let's take a look at it,\nit's not too terribly difficult.\n\n355\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.230\nI'm gonna jump over to,\n\n356\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.560\nif I could remember which one Well,\nlet's do Dev-dc01.\n\n357\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.940\nI think this is the guy.\n\n358\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.370\nWhat I did was, I went ahead and\nstarted installing Active DIrectory.\n\n359\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.610\nI installed the binaries.\n\n360\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.640\nRight?\nI went through the Add Rules and\n\n361\n00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.830\nFeatures wizard, installed the binaries,\nand then it said,\n\n362\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.090\nonce I got all that done, do you want\nto make this a domain controller?\n\n363\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.290\nThat's where I stopped.\n\n364\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.320\nSo I'm going to fire\nup that process again.\n\n365\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.026\nPromote this server to a domain controller\nand I'll go through the wizard and\n\n366\n00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:06.590\nI'm gonna be adding a new forest,\nlet's do a new forest, I'm feeling crazy.\n\n367\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.470\nI will do dev dot-\n\n368\n00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:18.613\nActually, you know what, let's do\na new domain in an existing forest.\n\n369\n00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:21.638\nAnd we're gonna do, and if you don't\nunderstand what I'm doing here,\n\n370\n00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:22.600\nthat's okay.\n\n371\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.230\nWe've got episodes to do on\nActive Directory, so don't fear.\n\n372\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.990\nWe'll go back over this.\n\n373\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.030\nMy forest name is lab,\nmy new domain name is going to be dev.\n\n374\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.550\nThink that'll work.\n\n375\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.908\nI'm trying to decide if what I\nneed to show you guys later, so\n\n376\n00:20:39.908 --> 00:20:41.734\nI'm gonna make sure we\nget everything setup.\n\n377\n00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:44.650\nActually, we'll want a separate forest,\nso lets do a separate forest.\n\n378\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.457\nAnd we'll do\n\n379\n00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:54.704\ndev.itpro.\n\n380\n00:20:54.704 --> 00:20:57.635\nI don't want it to conflict with my\nother one, I'm gonna do dev.itpro.us.\n\n381\n00:20:57.635 --> 00:21:00.670\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n382\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:06.457\n[COUGH] Again, this is not part of it.\n\n383\n00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:10.110\nI'm just trying to get through the,\nthis is what I wanna show you,\n\n384\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.070\nis right here I can choose to install DNS,\nall right?\n\n385\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.900\nI could uncheck that, but it would\nprobably scream at me because I don't\n\n386\n00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.910\nhave DNS set up on this network, and\nit's gonna be really upset about that.\n\n387\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.170\nAnd Active Directory\nwould most likely fail.\n\n388\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.520\nSo that's where we do that.\n\n389\n00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.940\nWe just simply put a check mark there.\n\n390\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.580\nAnd then you go along with\nthe rest of the defaults.\n\n391\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.630\nI'll show you all of this\nin our Active Directory.\n\n392\n00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.540\nLet me go ahead and finish it so\nwe'll have this server available for\n\n393\n00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.700\nsome demos coming up.\n\n394\n00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.109\nSo we'll let it verify\nthe uniqueness of my NetBIOS name.\n\n395\n00:21:43.544 --> 00:21:44.565\nWe'll accept all of our default paths.\n\n396\n00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:52.029\nAnd we'll go ahead and install.\n\n397\n00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:54.313\nOnce we get our pre-req checks done,\n\n398\n00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:01.365\nAnd then we'll click Install and\nit will require a reboot.\n\n399\n00:22:01.365 --> 00:22:04.810\nAnytime you install Active Directory,\nthat machine is gonna reboot.\n\n400\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:05.430\nAll right.\n\n401\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.090\nSo now let's take a look\nat another machine.\n\n402\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.940\nI'm gonna go back to our Remote Desktop.\n\n403\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.760\nAnd I'm gonna connect to server one.\n\n404\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.740\nAnd server one is a member server.\n\n405\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.630\nI remember my password.\n\n406\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.600\nI connect to this guy.\n\n407\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.060\nSo it's part of the domain, but\nit's not running Active Directory.\n\n408\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.700\nIt's just a member server and\nI want to install Active Directory.\n\n409\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.950\nNow my domain controller for this\nparticular domain already has DNS on it.\n\n410\n00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.450\nBut I want to create a second DNS server,\nbut\n\n411\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.210\nI don't have another domain controller.\n\n412\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.170\nSo I'm simply going to install DNS here.\n\n413\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.140\nWe'll let it boot up,\nlet Server Manager do its thing.\n\n414\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:54.380\nHonestly, in your corporate environments,\nyou're gonna find most of the time,\n\n415\n00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.230\nyou install DNS on your\ndomain controllers.\n\n416\n00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:01.720\nInternally, we don't see a lot of\nstandalone DNS servers like this\n\n417\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.480\nwhere it's a server that's running DNS but\nnot Active Directory.\n\n418\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.600\nBecause Active Directory relies on DNS.\n\n419\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.150\nIt has to have it, so\nif I put Active Directory and\n\n420\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.150\nDNS on the same machine I know, unless\nsome service doesn't start up or something\n\n421\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.920\nlike that, that Active Directory's\nalways gonna have access to DNS.\n\n422\n00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.480\nSo put them on the same machine,\n\n423\n00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.410\nthey go together like,\nwell what's a good, like salt and pepper.\n\n424\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.970\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say peas and carrots.\n\n425\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.620\nBut the other thing too, Mike,\nnow correct me if I'm wrong on this,\n\n426\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.580\nwhen you do decide to create one of\nthose Active Directory integrated zones.\n\n427\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.590\nAnd I know this is isn't an episode\non Active Directory, but\n\n428\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.720\nyou get the benefit of the replication\nthat happens with that database, as well.\n\n429\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; So you get\n\n430\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.770\na little bit more redundancy.\n\n431\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.225\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of good benefits from\ndoing Active Directory integrated zones.\n\n432\n00:23:44.225 --> 00:23:46.735\nAnd we'll definitely come back to that.\n\n433\n00:23:46.735 --> 00:23:48.970\nAlright, so I'm back on my server, here.\n\n434\n00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.676\nI'm just gonna go add roles and features.\n\n435\n00:23:51.676 --> 00:23:53.035\nMove this wizard up so we can see it.\n\n436\n00:23:53.035 --> 00:23:56.458\nI'll click next, next, next.\n\n437\n00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:57.766\nAll right, it's on server one.\n\n438\n00:23:57.766 --> 00:24:02.100\nAnd then I'm just gonna choose DNS\nas the role I want to install.\n\n439\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.860\nIt's gonna include my\nremote server admin tools.\n\n440\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:11.780\nAnd then I'll just basically Next,\nNext, Next, and Install.\n\n441\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.910\nI could have checked reboot if necessary,\nDNS does not need a reboot\n\n442\n00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.470\non installation, so\nwe should be good to go there.\n\n443\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.230\nSo just another way I can install it,\nright?\n\n444\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.450\nIf it's not installed as it would,\nif I can talk today,\n\n445\n00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.120\nif it's not installed during\nthe installation of Active Directory\n\n446\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.110\nthen you can always go back and\ninstall it.\n\n447\n00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.630\nAnd let's say I had a domain controller,\n\n448\n00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.860\nand I chose to uncheck DNS during\ninstallation of Active Directory.\n\n449\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.420\nNothing preventing me from\ngoing back to the Add Roles and\n\n450\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.090\nFeatures Wizard and adding DNS to\nthat domain controller, right?\n\n451\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.690\nSo it's not the end of\nthe world if you don't check it\n\n452\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.530\nduring the installation\nof Active Directory.\n\n453\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.810\nBut you are going to need it at some\npoint somewhere on your network,\n\n454\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.050\nif not on that machine.\n\n455\n00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.590\nAnd back to the point I was making here.\n\n456\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.580\nNormally, your domain controllers\nare also DNS servers, and\n\n457\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.830\nyou usually have at least two domain\ncontrollers, which means, you're gonna\n\n458\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.800\nhave at least two DNS servers, and\nthat's plenty for most networks.\n\n459\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.804\nIf you need external name resolution,\n\n460\n00:25:06.804 --> 00:25:10.710\nthat's when we'll start to see\nnon-domain controller's running DNS,\n\n461\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.820\ncuz I'm not putting a domain\ncontroller out there in my DMZ.\n\n462\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.230\nBut I need DNS out there for\n\n463\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:20.080\nthe public to access resolve names of\nexternal resources and things like that.\n\n464\n00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.350\nSo, that's typically where you see\nmachines that are installed this way where\n\n465\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.827\nit's not included with active directory.\n\n466\n00:25:24.827 --> 00:25:27.200\nIt's just its own role, all right.\n\n467\n00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.690\nBut either way, you go,\nit's running the exact same DNS.\n\n468\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.910\nI mean, there is no difference there,\n\n469\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.500\nother than where it can\nstore its information.\n\n470\n00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.840\nWes alluded to something called\nActive Directory integrated zones.\n\n471\n00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.810\nAnd we're gonna talk about that later in\nanother episode, cuz it's really cool.\n\n472\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.209\nBut if I'm gonna integrate\nDNS with Active Directory,\n\n473\n00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:47.028\nkind of makes sense that\nActive Directory would need to be there.\n\n474\n00:25:47.028 --> 00:25:50.466\nSo if I've got a server out my DMZ\nthat doesn't have Active Directory,\n\n475\n00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:53.983\nthen I won't be making any\nActive Directory integrated zones, right?\n\n476\n00:25:53.983 --> 00:25:57.570\nThere's no Active Directory\nto integrate it with.\n\n477\n00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:58.430\nThere we go.\n\n478\n00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.260\nInstallation has finished.\n\n479\n00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.980\nI'll click Close on that.\n\n480\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.540\nAll right, so easy enough to install it.\n\n481\n00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.860\nI should mention another one\nthat's brand new to 2016.\n\n482\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.260\nAnd that's nano server.\n\n483\n00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.660\nYou guys have seen me if you\nwatched the episodes on our other\n\n484\n00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:18.040\nMCSA track class 70-740,\nyou've seen me install nano server.\n\n485\n00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.050\nAnd there's a simply a parameter that\nI add to that creation of that nano\n\n486\n00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:27.270\nserver VHD that adds the package for\nDNS, and I can run a DNS server.\n\n487\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.880\nAnd honestly, that's a great solution.\n\n488\n00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.060\nI mean if I just need a DNS server,\nnothing else, strip out the GUIs,\n\n489\n00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.345\nstrip out everything.\n\n490\n00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:37.810\nNano's, a tiny light\nweight version of server,\n\n491\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.130\nit makes a perfect standalone DNS server.\n\n492\n00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.200\nAll right, Wes,\nnext thing that we need to do.\n\n493\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.980\nHow we doing on time?\n\n494\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.940\nWe are good.\n\n495\n00:26:47.335 --> 00:26:50.880\nWe've installed DNS,\nwe talked about the scenarios.\n\n496\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.530\nTell you what, this is probably, and\nwe just got a couple minutes left.\n\n497\n00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.561\nLet's open up the console at least and\ntake a look at it.\n\n498\n00:26:57.561 --> 00:26:59.698\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this the,again,\n\n499\n00:26:59.698 --> 00:27:02.286\nthe one that I just installed.\n\n500\n00:27:02.286 --> 00:27:05.348\nI'm opening up DNS,\nI don't have a whole lot of anything,\n\n501\n00:27:05.348 --> 00:27:06.890\nbecause I just installed it.\n\n502\n00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.920\nI tried to expand this out,\nI don't have anything.\n\n503\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.860\nWe're gonna talk what these\nare in an upcoming episode.\n\n504\n00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.038\nIf I go over to my domain controller,\nLet's\n\n505\n00:27:18.038 --> 00:27:23.384\ndo DCO1 here, and\nI open up DNS on this guy.\n\n506\n00:27:26.856 --> 00:27:28.878\nWe'll see a lot more interesting stuff.\n\n507\n00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:33.404\nI've got forward lookup zones, I've got\nrecords down here, I've got names and\n\n508\n00:27:33.404 --> 00:27:36.957\nIP addresses all of which we gonna\ntalk about in future episode.\n\n509\n00:27:36.957 --> 00:27:40.230\nRight now, we are just getting our\nbearings straight with getting\n\n510\n00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.050\nDNS installed and configuring DNS.\n\n511\n00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.510\nBut this is what my console looks like.\n\n512\n00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.600\nWe can open up,\nwe can work with it in here.\n\n513\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.120\nWe've got forward lookups, we've got\nreverse lookups, conditional forwarding,\n\n514\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.050\ntrust points.\n\n515\n00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.960\nAll of this is gonna happen or we're gonna\ngo over all of this in upcoming episodes.\n\n516\n00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.120\nBut I think that's a good place to stop,\n\n517\n00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.560\nbecause we're gonna start getting\ninto some of the configuring.\n\n518\n00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.120\nAnd I don't really want to\nrush through any of that.\n\n519\n00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.950\n&gt;&gt; That sounds really good.\n\n520\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.420\nIn fact, I look forward to seeing those.\n\n521\n00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.950\nAnd as Mike has already said, we have\ncome to the end of another episode.\n\n522\n00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.900\nSo I'll tell you what.\n\n523\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.500\nWe'll go ahead, just like Mike said.\n\n524\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.960\nWe'll cut it off right here.\n\n525\n00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.180\nWe'll come back in part two.\n\n526\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.680\nYou'll get to see more of the hands on.\n\n527\n00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.840\nMike, before we part, do you got anything\nyou'd like to throw into this one?\n\n528\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.270\nOr are you gonna cliff hanger this one.\n\n529\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna leave it as a cliff hanger.\n\n530\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:20.800\nMake sure you come back.\n\n531\n00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.910\nDNS is exciting.\n\n532\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nwe thank you for joining us.\n\n533\n00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.410\nAnd we thank you,\nthe viewer, for joining us.\n\n534\n00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.110\nSigning out at ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n535\n00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.766\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n536\n00:28:28.766 --> 00:28:29.648\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n537\n00:28:29.648 -->

00:00:11.943\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:12.845\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n5\n00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.630\ngentlemen to your networking with\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.180\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.390\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at, well, how to plan and\n\n8\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.030\nimplement IPv4 networks.\n\n9\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.540\nIn studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.390\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always glad to be here,\nIP version 4 networks.\n\n12\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.761\nSo we're gonna talk about IPv4 or\nversion 4 as was just describing.\n\n13\n00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.200\nInteresting this week,\nit started with networking in Server 16.\n\n14\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.010\nThe ideas, and if you can wrap your head\naround this right as we get started,\n\n15\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.660\nit's probably going to be a lot easier for\nyou.\n\n16\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.280\nThe ideas are gonna be very\nsimilar to what you already know.\n\n17\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.320\nIf you are familiar with networking\nin Server 12, and 12 R2,\n\n18\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.890\nany of the prior versions of Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160\nWe had NT4 come up out of the blue.\n\n20\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.140\nAs we were talking about\ngetting started this morning.\n\n21\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.940\nYou know the nice thing about networking\nis that things don't really change\n\n22\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.840\nall that much.\n\n23\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.370\nMeaning, TCP/IP as a network set of, or\nsuite of protocols and standards and\n\n24\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.670\ntools, hasn't really undergone a major\nrevision in probably close to 40 years.\n\n25\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.580\nAnd so, the concepts of IPv4, at least\nin this particular area that we're gonna\n\n26\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120\ntalk about,\nhave pretty much stayed the same.\n\n27\n00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.450\nWe do have some new features,\n\n28\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.820\nand functions,\nwe have remote access capabilities.\n\n29\n00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.660\nWe'll talk about things like,\ndirect access, and\n\n30\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.130\nweb application proxies,\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.380\nAnd those are new concepts by way of\nsome of the new features we talk about\n\n32\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.560\ncompared to what we may\nhave known years ago.\n\n33\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.900\nBut the concept of remote\naccess is still there.\n\n34\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.130\nYou get in from the outside,\n\n35\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270\nhopefully securely, coming through\nsome sort of gateway device.\n\n36\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.220\nAnd you connect once you authenticate and\n\n37\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.310\nyou access resources as if you\nare sitting in the local area network.\n\n38\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.400\nSo those general ideas haven't changed.\n\n39\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.710\nThe ideas of IP before have\nnot really been modified or\n\n40\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.420\nsignificantly changed in quiet some time.\n\n41\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.515\nWhen we add in to the we\nwill a little bit later.\n\n42\n00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:09.710\nIPV6, we have some new stuff to talk\nabout but it's a essentially an update\n\n43\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.169\nof what we already know, IPV4,\n32 bit address, IPV6 128 bit address.\n\n44\n00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.982\nIf you're not sure how we get\nthat come back and see us for\n\n45\n00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:18.960\nthat episode because we are not\ngoing to talk about that now.\n\n46\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.980\nBut we are going to get there eventually,\nright?\n\n47\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.620\nBut, the logic is really standardized.\n\n48\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.460\nAnd what I want you to be comfortable\nwith as we get started is\n\n49\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.960\nthinking about the things you already\nknow, being comfortable with them.\n\n50\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.050\nAnd not getting uptight,\nor concerned, or confused\n\n51\n00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.240\nabout having to learn an whole brand new\nset of items relating to networking.\n\n52\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.140\nJust to be able to understand\neither Server 16 or\n\n53\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.880\ncertainly networking within the Windows\nServer 16 stack, or more broadliness.\n\n54\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.180\nIf you think about, not just knowledge,\nbut how we apply it in the real world.\n\n55\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.670\nHow do we stand up in network?\n\n56\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.750\nHow do we configure remote access?\n\n57\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.370\nHow do we link one or more machines\ntogether to let them communicate?\n\n58\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.820\nAnd perhaps, and\ncertainly you wanna acknowledge the fact\n\n59\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.840\nthat some of this may be exam driven\nat some point for you, as well.\n\n60\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.730\nIf you want to pursue\nyour MCSA on Server 16,\n\n61\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.520\nthis is one of the three exams that\nyou're gonna have to take a look at.\n\n62\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:18.180\nThe 7740, 7741, 7742 exams all together\nmake up the MCSE for Server 16.\n\n63\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.380\nAnd so when we think about this, exam\ncertification, may be part of the mix and\n\n64\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.240\nyou want to understand that you could\ntake that knowledge you already possess.\n\n65\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.140\nAnd apply that going forward and\njust make sure that you are familiar with\n\n66\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.220\nsome of the details and remind yourself\nof the things we're gonna talk about.\n\n67\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.660\nI'm gonna show you some interesting\nways to look at the world,\n\n68\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.090\ngive you some resources that may or\nmay not make sense to you.\n\n69\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.070\nIf it's a new way of looking at how you\ndo subnetting, how you borrow bits.\n\n70\n00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.620\nHow you figure out the total\nnumber of usable hosts, great.\n\n71\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.530\nUse those resources, no problem.\n\n72\n00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.680\nIf you like them, I made them.\n\n73\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.290\nIf you don't well we know who we can\nthank for that right over there.\n\n74\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.890\nBut between Cherokee and I, we're gonna go\nthrough this with you, talk about this.\n\n75\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.690\nI know Cherokee's gonna ask some really\ninteresting questions along the way.\n\n76\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.600\nBecause I never doubt\nthe fact that she does and\n\n77\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.820\nshe never,\nnever disappoints when it comes to that.\n\n78\n00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.510\nAnd along the way, we're gonna show you\nhopefully in an easy to understand.\n\n79\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.750\nJust comfortable fashion how\nto engage in the concepts\n\n80\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.100\nof IVP four base networking so do that.\n\n81\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.680\nAnd lets start with just\nsome of the basics.\n\n82\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.730\nIf you could join me right\nover here there we go.\n\n83\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.460\nI wanna talk about the concept\nof IVP4 address comes to be.\n\n84\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.077\nAnd when we think about an IVP4\naddress very first thing we can do.\n\n85\n00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:31.460\nGive me just one second.\n\n86\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.260\nLet me just bring up a command line,\ncuz I have one but\n\n87\n00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.440\nI have it set up for something else.\n\n88\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.050\nWhen we think about an IPv4 address,\nand I know this is not Server 16,\n\n89\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.470\nthis is Windows 10 that you're looking at.\n\n90\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.860\nBut the interface, the tools are the same,\ndesktop version of the server side.\n\n91\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.120\nAnd just for purposes of demonstration,\nreally simple and\n\n92\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.370\neasy When we do an IP config command here.\n\n93\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.200\nWe just take a look at an IPv4 address,\nlet's go down here for\n\n94\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.830\njust one second and\njust highlight this address right here.\n\n95\n00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.630\nThis is what we are talking about right,\nsomething like ten zero ten 236 an IPv4\n\n96\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.380\naddress made up of four octates,\neach octate separated by a decimal.\n\n97\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.604\nSo 10 dot is octet number one,\n0 dot octet number two,\n\n98\n00:05:16.604 --> 00:05:21.130\n10 dot octet number three and\n236 octet number four.\n\n99\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.920\nThe numerical values are gonna be\nultimately derived from a series of bits.\n\n100\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.920\nThere are 8 bits that make up an octet.\n\n101\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.060\nHence the name and that's where we\nget the concept of the octet from and\n\n102\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.680\neach bit has a representational value from\nthe high order bit to the low order bit.\n\n103\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.100\nAlong that graph we just saw or\nthat line, that linear progression\n\n104\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.830\nI just had up in Excel, we'll go back and\ntake a look in a minute.\n\n105\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.760\nAnd by turning on or\nturning off those bits representing them\n\n106\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.900\nin binary with ones or\nzeros to signify on or off.\n\n107\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.690\nWe're then going to be able to\nchoose which bits we want to use.\n\n108\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.960\nAnd what the numerical values\nwill be of this particular octet,\n\n109\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.480\nessentially just add them all up.\n\n110\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.090\nAnd once we're done, we have a value\nderived from the bits that are on.\n\n111\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.330\nWe then put that value in there,\nwe do that four times, and ultimately,\n\n112\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.400\nwe wind up with an IP address.\n\n113\n00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.290\nNow the good news is,\n\n114\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.440\nwhen I say we do that,\nwe don't really need to do that, right?\n\n115\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.510\nEven if we are providing a static\nIP address, we are typing that in.\n\n116\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.450\nOne of us, myself, Cherokee,\nany of you, whoever, would put that in.\n\n117\n00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.630\nBut once we type that in,\nwe walk away from the computer.\n\n118\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.900\nThe translation from binary back to\ndot-decimal notation, which is how.\n\n119\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.840\nWe as humans,\n\n120\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.240\nreadable forms represent that IP\naddress and all the stuff that goes on.\n\n121\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.290\nNow we're gonna talk about here,\nreally none of that is our Bailey wick.\n\n122\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.730\nWe're not gonna have to worry about that,\nthankfully.\n\n123\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.840\nCan imagine the headaches involved\nwith us having to sit down and\n\n124\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.280\nscratch our heads Monday morning.\n\n125\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.070\nAll right, how do we write that again\nin binary and let's get our pad and\n\n126\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.200\nstart scribbling 1's and\n0's down by bit blocks.\n\n127\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.986\nThat's hard enough with IPv4.\n\n128\n00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:56.227\nWait until we get to IPv6 and we Take the\nnumber of bits and multiply it by four,\n\n129\n00:06:56.227 --> 00:06:57.848\nbecomes even more involved.\n\n130\n00:06:57.848 --> 00:07:00.450\nThen, and so, thankfully,\nhello, how are you?\n\n131\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.115\nNice to see you.\n\n132\n00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:03.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So thankfully, as a result of that,\n\n133\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.110\nwe're gonna push that burden,\nthat liability, that concern.\n\n134\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.055\nThat work over to the computer which\nis very specifically designed,\n\n135\n00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:14.170\nmathematically inclined, right.\n\n136\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.656\nFor us to be able to do that,\n\n137\n00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:19.221\nbecause the math co-processor\nbits that are sitting in the CPU.\n\n138\n00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:21.782\nThe logic of implementation\nof the network stack,\n\n139\n00:07:21.782 --> 00:07:24.410\nall the tools required\nare sitting in the computer.\n\n140\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.000\nAll the computer has to be given is\nsome basic information, and it goes and\n\n141\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.850\ndoes its thing for us.\n\n142\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.850\nSo that part is actually very nice.\n\n143\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.610\nSo Cherokee wanted to ask a question\nhere real quick, so go ahead, Cherokee.\n\n144\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.230\n&gt;&gt; So I really don't have a question,\nbut I did wanna add something to that-\n\n145\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n146\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.165\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, you're completely right.\n\n147\n00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:42.950\nIn real life we don't have to we have\nsubnet calculators and so forth.\n\n148\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.050\nIf someone, I know you said this\nisn't the proper show for that.\n\n149\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.685\nBut for me it would always help\nstart it initially starting,\n\n150\n00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:52.095\nbringing everything back to binary.\n\n151\n00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:55.380\nSo you could mentally kind of see\nyour least significant bit, and\n\n152\n00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.003\nwhere that shift is happening.\n\n153\n00:07:57.003 --> 00:08:00.751\nAnd putting it in that computer language\nso you could kinda think like a computer.\n\n154\n00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:03.711\nI don't know if you've ever\nhad that happen, yeah?\n\n155\n00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:07.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like that.\n\n156\n00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:09.358\n&gt;&gt; Like exactly-\n&gt;&gt; My God, look at that.\n\n157\n00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:10.141\n&gt;&gt; Adam, you've read my mind.\n\n158\n00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:11.412\n&gt;&gt; Couldn't have planned\nthat better if we tried.\n\n159\n00:08:11.412 --> 00:08:13.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you notice I was not actually,\n\n160\n00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:16.057\nyou didn't hear me clacking away, didn't\ntype while Cherokee was saying that.\n\n161\n00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:18.314\nWe have all of that already setup,\nas a matter of a fact,\n\n162\n00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:21.292\nif you happen to be looking at the\nspreadsheet that I'm gonna be walking us\n\n163\n00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:22.943\nthrough here over the next few minutes.\n\n164\n00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:24.880\nYou'll notice there's a lot of tabs here.\n\n165\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.109\nI did try to label them as obvious as I\ncould, the labels may not be perfectly\n\n166\n00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.488\nspot on with the definitions,\nbut they're pretty close.\n\n167\n00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:36.190\nAnd hopefully as we go through,\njust quickly preview it for you.\n\n168\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.101\nWe've got a discussion\nabout subnet mass and\n\n169\n00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.924\nhow that works got a binary bits there,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n170\n00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:44.355\nGot our IP address classes,\ngot our number of subnets,\n\n171\n00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:46.839\ngot our increments between addresses.\n\n172\n00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.211\n&gt;&gt; You've got all the good stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Number of usuable host,\n\n173\n00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:49.135\nI got a lot of stuff there.\n\n174\n00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:51.111\nI was really bored on-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:52.366\n&gt;&gt; We had nothing to do.\n\n176\n00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:56.300\nAnd said how could possibly come up with a\nseven tab spreadsheet that when use end to\n\n177\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.561\nend would give people everything\nthey ever wanted to knowing more.\n\n178\n00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:00.258\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].\n\n179\n00:09:00.258 --> 00:09:02.419\n&gt;&gt; About IP addressing,\nand so it's all here.\n\n180\n00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:04.287\nAnd the good news is we're\ngonna get through it all,\n\n181\n00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:05.954\nwe're gonna walk through\nwith you right now.\n\n182\n00:09:05.954 --> 00:09:08.203\nAnd perhaps at another episode,\ndepending how long this takes, but\n\n183\n00:09:08.203 --> 00:09:09.350\nwe're gonna get through this.\n\n184\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.850\nAnd together, myself, Cherokee,\n\n185\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.740\nall of you, we're gonna take a field\ntrip and talk about IP addressing.\n\n186\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.889\nBy the time we're done hopefully you're\ngonna be a lot more comfortable with it.\n\n187\n00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.266\nSo we're gonna provide for\nall of that, that's worth like.\n\n188\n00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:22.376\n&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering-\n&gt;&gt; On screen hype, there you go,\n\n189\n00:09:22.376 --> 00:09:23.325\nright there.\n\n190\n00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:25.613\n&gt;&gt; What is gonna be our\nIP version 4 souvenir?\n\n191\n00:09:25.613 --> 00:09:26.196\nFor a field trip?\n\n192\n00:09:26.196 --> 00:09:27.573\n&gt;&gt; Well they're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n193\n00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:29.266\n&gt;&gt; Get this lovely spreadsheet customized\n\n194\n00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:31.099\nfor their needs, taking away with them.\n\n195\n00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:31.864\n&gt;&gt; That's nice of you.\n\n196\n00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:36.191\n&gt;&gt; And for hopefully for\nit to be a valuable resource for studying.\n\n197\n00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:38.232\nBut also just to remember\nhow these things work.\n\n198\n00:09:38.232 --> 00:09:41.539\nI do a lot of this kind of work when\nI teach, just basic classes and\n\n199\n00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.838\neven advanced classes.\n\n200\n00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:46.645\nAnd we do security stuff,\nwe do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n201\n00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:50.425\nAnd you've seen me do a lot of different\nshows with different topics here at\n\n202\n00:09:50.425 --> 00:09:51.110\nITPro.TV.\n\n203\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.409\nNot to mention all the work I do outside,\nwhen I'm working with customers and\n\n204\n00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:55.541\nwhen I'm in classrooms.\n\n205\n00:09:55.541 --> 00:10:00.550\nAnd some of the basic concepts, you don't\nget away from them, like you were saying.\n\n206\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.880\nI don't remember the last time I had\na conversation with a customer and\n\n207\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.750\nor a client in the field or a student.\n\n208\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.029\nWhere at some point I didn't have\nto reference something about one or\n\n209\n00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:12.962\nmore concepts related to IP addresses.\n\n210\n00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:16.084\nWhether they're version 4 or\nversion 6 at this point is irrelevant,\n\n211\n00:10:16.084 --> 00:10:17.029\njust general ideas.\n\n212\n00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:19.877\nAnd always needed to go\nback to those concepts.\n\n213\n00:10:19.877 --> 00:10:21.870\nHey, what's gonna be that subnet?\n\n214\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.220\nHow many networks do we need,\nhow many hosts?\n\n215\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.780\nWhat's that subnet mask?\n\n216\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.808\nHow are we gonna get from here\nto there going through two or\n\n217\n00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:30.206\nthree of these gateways?\n\n218\n00:10:30.206 --> 00:10:33.670\nAnd how are we gonna represent that,\nas we expand that maybe a little bit?\n\n219\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.334\nWhat's the DNS and\nindoor DHCP infrastructure we have to use?\n\n220\n00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:38.718\nIt would have to talk about\nthis stuff all the time.\n\n221\n00:10:38.718 --> 00:10:42.490\nWe take it for granted in many respects,\nbecause hopefully a lot of the time,\n\n222\n00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.357\nit really is just set it and forget it.\n\n223\n00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:46.549\nIt kind of works, and\nonce it's up and running,\n\n224\n00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:49.360\nwe dont' necessarily have to go back and\nmaintain it.\n\n225\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.494\nAnd you really go in there and play around\nwith it often, but we do at least have to\n\n226\n00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:57.353\nget the basic concepts down so\nwe can initialize our networks correctly.\n\n227\n00:10:57.353 --> 00:11:01.055\nAnd we can set them up and of course,\nongoing management and maintenance of it.\n\n228\n00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:04.565\nUsing these kinds of basic\nideas as helpful but\n\n229\n00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:07.181\nwe can then extrapolate this out.\n\n230\n00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:10.283\nWe'll talk about something known as IPAM,\nIP Address Management.\n\n231\n00:11:10.283 --> 00:11:13.478\nAs a feature said in Windows\ncoming up in some future episodes,\n\n232\n00:11:13.478 --> 00:11:15.304\nwe'll take a look at how to do that.\n\n233\n00:11:15.304 --> 00:11:17.997\nAnd those kind of things were helpful but\nit's the basics, right?\n\n234\n00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:20.519\nThe basic blocking intact\nlike that's really good.\n\n235\n00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:23.966\nAnd some of the calculators, Cherokee\nmention them, always helpful if you need\n\n236\n00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:26.866\nthem, you can find them online,\nthere's a whole variety of them.\n\n237\n00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:30.166\nBut you could actually use the Windows\ncalculator to do all that stuff as well as\n\n238\n00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.467\nlong as you're familiar with it and\nknow how to use it.\n\n239\n00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:37.327\nAnd the newer calculators in Server 2016\ncertainly in Windows 10 on the desktop,\n\n240\n00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.700\nactually have a bunch of other functions.\n\n241\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.076\nI tripped across one I wasn't even\nfamiliar with in the Windows 10\n\n242\n00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.670\nCalculator, and I'll show it to you.\n\n243\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.301\nYou could actually do dates, and\nyou could go ahead and extrapolate out.\n\n244\n00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:49.818\nAnd say I wanna essentially\nfigure out what the date for\n\n245\n00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:53.386\nthis day in the future will be like 200\nyears from now, that kind of thing.\n\n246\n00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:56.557\nBut it will actually let you do that\nalong with a bunch of other stuff.\n\n247\n00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:59.045\nIt's really kinda cool,\nthe features they've thrown in.\n\n248\n00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:00.665\nSo just what we would\nthink of as a calculator.\n\n249\n00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:03.455\nSo anyway, getting back to what\nwe're talking about there.\n\n250\n00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.741\nSo this idea of bits as we\nwere talking about, right?\n\n251\n00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:10.340\nWe've got the high order bit on the left\ngoing from high to lows, we go down.\n\n252\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.291\nSo we call this the highest order bit,\nwe call this the lowest order bit.\n\n253\n00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:18.371\nAnd all the bits in between are simply\ngonna represent each one of those\n\n254\n00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:23.072\nvalues in the 8 bits that we specified for\nan octet that could be turned on or off,\n\n255\n00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:25.592\nthinking about the concept of the binary.\n\n256\n00:12:25.592 --> 00:12:30.196\nSo if we do something here real quick,\nlet's just say that we,\n\n257\n00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:36.509\nPut in or think about putting\n\n258\n00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:41.035\nin here, just one second.\n\n259\n00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:43.875\nAll right, I'm not gonna type there\nbecause I can't seem to get my keyboard to\n\n260\n00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:44.616\nwork the right way.\n\n261\n00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:47.235\nSo we're not worried about typing for\nthe moment, I'm just gonna go ahead.\n\n262\n00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:48.951\nI'm just gonna go talk about this, but\n\n263\n00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:51.036\nwhen we think about being\nable to put binary in.\n\n264\n00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:55.403\nLet's just say hypothetically, we put\na 1 under the bit labeled 128, right?\n\n265\n00:12:55.403 --> 00:12:57.384\nOur first bit there going left to right.\n\n266\n00:12:57.384 --> 00:13:00.465\nAnd we said, we wanna turn that bit on or\nsend it to signify\n\n267\n00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:05.490\nthat that bit will be active, we have all\nzeros going across the rest of the 7 bits.\n\n268\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.258\nOur total value or the number that we\nwould derive from that would be 128.\n\n269\n00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:14.517\nAnd we would then have 1 bit turned\non since we 7 bits turned off.\n\n270\n00:13:14.517 --> 00:13:19.150\nAnd if we take a look at something like\nthis, we're just looking at over here.\n\n271\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.216\nIn red, you could see that when I put\nall 1s underneath each of the 8 bits\n\n272\n00:13:23.216 --> 00:13:25.094\nrepresenting that first block.\n\n273\n00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:28.966\nLet's just say right there,\nwe get a total value of 255, right?\n\n274\n00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:34.242\nAnd so the idea is that we can add up\nall these bits and signify or specify.\n\n275\n00:13:34.242 --> 00:13:37.439\nWe want certain numbers\navailable to us by putting a 1,\n\n276\n00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:42.008\nequivalent of 1, underneath the box or\nessentially just selecting that bit.\n\n277\n00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:47.305\nSo 128 and 64, if we turned on those\ntwo bits, we'd have a 192 value, right?\n\n278\n00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.238\nFor that particular item,\n\n279\n00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:54.454\nwe add 32 in there with 192 as we go\nthat kind of way from left to right.\n\n280\n00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:56.788\nWe just keep incrementing and going, and\n\n281\n00:13:56.788 --> 00:14:00.662\nwe go from 128 all the way over\nto 255 when we add everything up.\n\n282\n00:14:00.662 --> 00:14:05.638\nAnd so as we think about working with\nthe octet and looking at the placement of\n\n283\n00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:10.481\nbits inside the octet that signify on or\noff or ultimately signify value.\n\n284\n00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:14.020\nWe have to understand that the total\nvalue of all the bits is 255.\n\n285\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.620\nAnd these are the actual\nnumerical values for\n\n286\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.952\nthe bits as we go from highest to lowest.\n\n287\n00:14:18.952 --> 00:14:21.784\nSo it is important just to\nhave that basic idea and\n\n288\n00:14:21.784 --> 00:14:24.560\nto be aware of that basic\nidea as we get started.\n\n289\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.822\nSo any thoughts, comments, questions?\n\n290\n00:14:27.822 --> 00:14:30.113\n&gt;&gt; Is this called the delta\nchart by any chance?\n\n291\n00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:32.670\n&gt;&gt; It's actually called the Adam\nchart because I created it.\n\n292\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's not called the delta chart,\n\n293\n00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.454\nI call my chart the octet bits chart-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:39.666\n&gt;&gt; But you could label it all sorts of\n\n295\n00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:40.855\nstuff I suppose.\n\n296\n00:14:40.855 --> 00:14:43.630\nIt's not necessarily\nreferred to by any one name.\n\n297\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.710\nAll kidding aside, it could be referred\nto by lots of different names.\n\n298\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.983\nI've seen it referred to as a delta chart,\nbut\n\n299\n00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:52.083\nyou gotta be careful sometimes\nwith terms like delta, right?\n\n300\n00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:56.660\nFor instance, hypothetically because\ndelta in our world in IT, right?\n\n301\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.360\nAnd let's not even worry about\nthings like engineering and\n\n302\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.620\nSDLC, Software System Design,\nLife Cycle, etc.\n\n303\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.300\nJust generally the concept of a delta\nin IT often represents the change.\n\n304\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.686\nOr a shift of some kind from\na baseline and then adding and\n\n305\n00:15:11.686 --> 00:15:14.220\nremoving things based on modification.\n\n306\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.333\nWhile we could use that to refer to this,\nthat may give somebody who's not thinking\n\n307\n00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:21.288\nIP address first,\nperhaps the wrong impression, right?\n\n308\n00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:24.147\nSo I don't know if I'd call it a delta\nchart, I've heard it referred to that way.\n\n309\n00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen it written\nlike that in book, and\n\n310\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.597\nthen some people even\nsay to find your delta.\n\n311\n00:15:28.597 --> 00:15:30.781\nAnd I always say find your increment,\nwhen we're creating it, so-\n\n312\n00:15:30.781 --> 00:15:31.548\n&gt;&gt; Increment's a better term.\n\n313\n00:15:31.548 --> 00:15:32.189\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n314\n00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:35.582\n&gt;&gt; Only because increment implies,\nwe're going up or down.\n\n315\n00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:37.390\nAnd again,\nwe're making a change in theory.\n\n316\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.892\nIt is a delta, but the delta concept,\nthis is a vocabulary term,\n\n317\n00:15:40.892 --> 00:15:42.817\nreally has a broader connotation.\n\n318\n00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.367\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; When you hear people talk about\n\n319\n00:15:44.367 --> 00:15:46.720\nIP addressing, and\nthey're talking about the bit shift.\n\n320\n00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.481\nWhich is essentially what we're\ntalking about in a concept,\n\n321\n00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.614\nthen really talk about\nfinding our increment.\n\n322\n00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:54.127\nAnd that's the term you often hear, right?\n\n323\n00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:57.044\nIs finding the incrimeter, or\noccasionally you hear a bit shift, but\n\n324\n00:15:57.044 --> 00:15:58.736\nbit shift can mean other things as well.\n\n325\n00:15:58.736 --> 00:16:02.105\nSo it's kind of an upside down,\nFive process, right?\n\n326\n00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:04.172\nIt can kind of go either way, I supposed.\n\n327\n00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:04.863\nAll right, so\n\n328\n00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:08.910\njust think about the concept of the Octet\n,think about breaking down to bits.\n\n329\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.020\nThink about being able to\nunderstand the logic of eight bit.\n\n330\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.240\nYou put the numerical value assign to it.\n\n331\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.310\nBeing specified with a one or\na zero and binary on or off.\n\n332\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.290\nAnd then aggregating, or adding up\nall of the bits that are turned on\n\n333\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.810\nto derive that value for\nthe IP address, right?\n\n334\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.740\nAnd so, if we wanted to get a ten,\nwhich we saw in our IP address.\n\n335\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:35.379\nWe would put 00000 or excuse me 4 0's,\na 1, and then a 0, a 1 and a 0, right?\n\n336\n00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:41.210\nSo that would give us the fifth bit,\nand the sixth bit,\n\n337\n00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.010\nfifth bit, and the seventh bit turned on\nand the other bits turned off, right?\n\n338\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.510\nAnd by doing that we would then add eight\nand two, and we would ultimately get 10.\n\n339\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.960\nSo that's the kind of thing that we're\nthinking about as we go left to right,\n\n340\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.530\nall right?\n\n341\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.240\n&gt;&gt; And using this chart\nalso is really helpful when\n\n342\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.300\nyou're checking your work-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n343\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.550\n&gt;&gt; Or\ndoing any kind of reverse engineering.\n\n344\n00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.765\nSo it's a good tool to share with people.\n\n345\n00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:57.772\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's helpful.\n\n346\n00:16:57.772 --> 00:17:01.005\nIt's just a good to way to think about\njust as you look up you go, wait,\n\n347\n00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:03.185\nthose are the bits and\nI can kinda figured it out.\n\n348\n00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:07.295\nIn a lot of networking discussion\nyou'll often see the printed out, or\n\n349\n00:17:07.295 --> 00:17:10.191\nsomebody has maybe up on the wall,\nor things like that.\n\n350\n00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:12.984\nYou could do all sorts of\nthings to get through this.\n\n351\n00:17:12.984 --> 00:17:16.321\n&gt;&gt; I've even written it down on the little\nboards they give you before an exam during\n\n352\n00:17:16.321 --> 00:17:18.245\nthat time,\nbefore your ticker starts going.\n\n353\n00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:22.285\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, you get a little dry erase\nboard Graph paper you can write that down\n\n354\n00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:25.210\nand bring it in with,\nthis kinda laid out and see it.\n\n355\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.290\nCisco exams probably really\nhelpful there I would think.\n\n356\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.067\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right especially, Microsoft doesn't\n\n357\n00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:34.870\ntend to spend as much time going into the\ndeep dark recesses of networking around\n\n358\n00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.041\nthe bits, and things like that as\na Cisco exam for instance, right?\n\n359\n00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.781\nBecause it's really designed,\nCisco exams are,\n\n360\n00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:45.750\nto test your knowledge of the concepts\nof networking theoretically.\n\n361\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.730\nAnd then apply them to their\ninterfaces in the way they configure.\n\n362\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.980\nThe CCNT, the CCNA,\nright, especially there.\n\n363\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.450\nBut you know with Microsoft,\nwe expect basic knowledge as a baseline.\n\n364\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.410\nWe expect you would understand\nwhat an IP address is,\n\n365\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.180\nexpect you to know how to do subnetting.\n\n366\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.663\nWe may give you one or more IPs and say,\nhey what's this network gonna be, or\n\n367\n00:18:03.663 --> 00:18:06.066\nwhat's the host gonna be,\nor something like that.\n\n368\n00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:09.462\nBut you're not gonna get in to a lot\nof the craziness you may see in a Cisco\n\n369\n00:18:09.462 --> 00:18:10.940\nexam right, traditionally.\n\n370\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.256\nSo, it's good to know, it's never\ngonna hurt, you it's good father for\n\n371\n00:18:14.256 --> 00:18:15.859\nwhen you play geek trivia, right?\n\n372\n00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:16.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n373\n00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:18.616\nyou seat down at the bar\nyou got nothing to do,\n\n374\n00:18:18.616 --> 00:18:21.490\nimpress your friends make new friends.\n\n375\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.020\nDraw your subnetting grid there\nright on the bar, and beg people for\n\n376\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.160\ndrinks as to whether or not you\ncould get what ever drinks they have\n\n377\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna plead the fifth on that\n\n378\n00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.920\ntopic right there [LAUGH].\n\n379\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.529\n&gt;&gt; I'm assuming that means there may\nhave been some experience in the past,\n\n380\n00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:33.120\nin Cherokee's-\n&gt;&gt; May or may have not.\n\n381\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.250\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's history,\ncheckered and colored though it is.\n\n382\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.550\nAll right so,\nwhen we think about IP addresses,\n\n383\n00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:44.320\nthe next stop down on the IP address\ndiscussion, just to go here.\n\n384\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.890\nWe just talked about IP addresses.\n\n385\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.280\nLet's talk about this next item down.\n\n386\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.450\nLet's just highlight this\nright here real quick.\n\n387\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.990\nLet's talk about this\nconcept of the Subnet Mask.\n\n388\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.620\nAnd we wanna talk about it in\nrelation to the IP Address,\n\n389\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.060\ncuz that's really how we\nunderstand Subnet Mask.\n\n390\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.660\nOne thing about the IP Address,\nwhich the Subnet Mask makes very clear is\n\n391\n00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.750\nthat on surface of the IP Address\nis kind of unassuming, right?\n\n392\n00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.700\nSo it's got four bits there or\n\n393\n00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.630\nfour octet rather specified with\na numerical value associated there.\n\n394\n00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.758\nAnd [COUGH], when we think about\nlooking at the IP address,\n\n395\n00:19:15.758 --> 00:19:19.182\nwhat we really see, at least as an IT\nprofessional, when we look at it,\n\n396\n00:19:19.182 --> 00:19:23.035\nas somebody who is understanding it,\nwe see two distinctly different things.\n\n397\n00:19:23.035 --> 00:19:27.713\nWe see both a network portion of\nthe IP address, in other words,\n\n398\n00:19:27.713 --> 00:19:31.628\nan indicator of some\nassociation with a broad group.\n\n399\n00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:34.037\nAnd then we see a portion that is unique.\n\n400\n00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:36.194\nWe see a individual host address, or\n\n401\n00:19:36.194 --> 00:19:40.620\nthe portion of that address that\nidentifies this particular endpoint.\n\n402\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.250\nIn this case,\none of the network interfaces on my\n\n403\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.080\nmachine that we're talking through\nhere as being uniquely setup, or\n\n404\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.920\nuniquely identified within the broader\ngroup or context of the network.\n\n405\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.380\nAnd so there's a lot of subtleties\nassociated with looking at\n\n406\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:53.960\nan IP address, right?\n\n407\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.370\nBecause, it has a lot of things associated\nwith it, and we may not just stop and\n\n408\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.010\nthink about normally.\n\n409\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.646\nWe'll say, we need that IP address,\n10.0.10.236, so\n\n410\n00:20:01.646 --> 00:20:05.901\nI can connect this machine or map a drive,\nor who knows whatever I wanna do, right?\n\n411\n00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:08.441\nAnd what we're really\nsaying when we say that is,\n\n412\n00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.920\nI need to know the network\nyou remember of.\n\n413\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.222\nAnd I need to know your unique\nidentifier within the network,\n\n414\n00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:17.663\nbecause that's how we break down and\nunderstand an IP address.\n\n415\n00:20:17.663 --> 00:20:20.585\nSo when we think about a subnet mask,\nwe think about and\n\n416\n00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:23.250\nunderstand the tool that\nhelps us to do this.\n\n417\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.200\nOr helps us to understand how\nto split the IP address into\n\n418\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.475\nthese two constituent parts, right?\n\n419\n00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:33.195\n255.255.00 is what we see there for\nour subnet mask.\n\n420\n00:20:33.195 --> 00:20:34.403\nAnd in this case,\n\n421\n00:20:34.403 --> 00:20:39.723\nwe see that the 255 values are the values\nthat signify that all eight bits for\n\n422\n00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:44.007\nthe first octet and indeed for\nthe second octet are being used.\n\n423\n00:20:44.007 --> 00:20:49.082\nThose 16 bits, the first groups or\ntwo groups that they've added together,\n\n424\n00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:52.960\n16 bits out of a possible 32,\nare being used to specify.\n\n425\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.080\nIn this case, that we have the first\ntwo portions of the IP address,\n\n426\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.920\n10 and 0, being linked to our network ID.\n\n427\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:06.630\nAnd then the other two, the zeroes,\nso subnet mask 255.255 and then 0.0,\n\n428\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:11.487\nthe last two octets, octets three and\nfour, specify no bits turned on.\n\n429\n00:21:11.487 --> 00:21:14.900\nNo bits being used,\nthat's what the zero value comes from.\n\n430\n00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.990\nThat indicates to us that the last two\nblocks, or parts of the IP address,\n\n431\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:25.026\noctets three and four 10.236, represent\nthe unique host ID within the network.\n\n432\n00:21:25.026 --> 00:21:30.003\nAnd so 10.0 is our network and 10.236,\nif we were just roughly literally\n\n433\n00:21:30.003 --> 00:21:34.481\nto take the IP address and kinda split\nit evenly down the middle and push to of\n\n434\n00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:38.775\nthe four blocks off to the side, and\nthe other two off to the other side.\n\n435\n00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:43.095\nLabel the first two network,\nlabel the other two host.\n\n436\n00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:47.155\nWe would see that we have indeed\nan actual distinction in the network and\n\n437\n00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:47.805\nthe host idea.\n\n438\n00:21:47.805 --> 00:21:51.200\nAnd this is how we can derive\na unique identity for each machine.\n\n439\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.172\nAnd I'm sure you are all familiar with,\n\n440\n00:21:53.172 --> 00:21:56.421\nwe've all seen the rule that I'm\nabout describe to you in action.\n\n441\n00:21:56.421 --> 00:21:59.846\nAt some point if you've been doing\nthis long enough, where we connect\n\n442\n00:21:59.846 --> 00:22:03.397\ntwo machines that have the same IP\naddress on the same subnet on a way.\n\n443\n00:22:03.397 --> 00:22:06.644\nIn other words, you're network together\nessentially on the same switch, so\n\n444\n00:22:06.644 --> 00:22:09.411\nthey would see each other,\nwe get an IP address conflict, right?\n\n445\n00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:13.659\nWe usually get a pop up, it's usually\na dialog box that shows up on the screen.\n\n446\n00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:17.318\nIt's got the red circle in there,\nright and it says, hey by the way,\n\n447\n00:22:17.318 --> 00:22:20.681\nIP address conflict lists the IP\ntells you there's a problem.\n\n448\n00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:23.241\nAnd then you go on\nthe needle in the haystack,\n\n449\n00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:26.141\ntry to figure out what the other\nendpoint of that conflict is.\n\n450\n00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:29.607\nAnd you gotta go, and\nyou gotta figure out which machine or\n\n451\n00:22:29.607 --> 00:22:32.672\nmachines have come up with\nan IP address conflict.\n\n452\n00:22:32.672 --> 00:22:36.691\nI often thought, I talk about UI interface\ndesign and what a good thing would be.\n\n453\n00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:39.521\nIt would be awesome if they have\nthe availability to obvious to do this and\n\n454\n00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:42.550\npop up and say, okay, hey,\nclearly, there's an IP conflict.\n\n455\n00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.900\nYou're on a system, where two hosts\nare not uniquely identifying any longer.\n\n456\n00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.080\n&gt;&gt; It's not letting you type it in.\n\n457\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.721\n&gt;&gt; No, not even that, no.\n\n458\n00:22:47.721 --> 00:22:51.453\nI mean, that would be cool, don't get\nme wrong, but I was thinking more like,\n\n459\n00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:54.880\nlet's bring Bing Maps to the table,\nor Google Maps, or whatever.\n\n460\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.395\nLet's just bring up like a plot.\n\n461\n00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:57.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let's give you the ability\n\n462\n00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.520\nto find that machine.\n\n463\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Narrow in on the culprit.\n\n464\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.420\n&gt;&gt; And just zero in, and\n\n465\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.685\nthen you have a, like in Battleship you\ncan just drop a bomb, or something.\n\n466\n00:23:03.685 --> 00:23:04.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And just blow the machine,\n\n467\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.860\nyou can send it a ping the death\npacket and take the machine offline.\n\n468\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.180\nI mean, that would be a cool option, talk\nabout UI design benefits IT professionals.\n\n469\n00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.320\nI want the ability to go out and\n\n470\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.380\nkill my IP conflict partner in real time\nby taking him or her off the network.\n\n471\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.880\nThat will be a cool feature.\n\n472\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.350\nI would actually pay money for an OS that\ndoes that, but that's just me, right.\n\n473\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.670\n&gt;&gt; Have you contacted\nMicrosoft with these ideas?\n\n474\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.750\n&gt;&gt; I have not because I just haven't\ngotten around to it and well,\n\n475\n00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.810\nyou know,\n&gt;&gt; They don't like to\n\n476\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.660\ntalk to people [LAUGH]\nthat act crazy like that.\n\n477\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.400\nBut, you know, just think about\nthe logic and all kidding aside, right?\n\n478\n00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.245\nObviously, clearly,\n\n479\n00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:38.940\nwe're not looking to design the next\ngreat video game interface.\n\n480\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.220\nBut if you think about the logic, right?\n\n481\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.897\nWouldn't it be great if it actually\ntold you what the other machine was or\n\n482\n00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:46.052\ntold you where it was?\n\n483\n00:23:46.052 --> 00:23:49.463\nOr, Cherokee to your point, wouldn't\nit be great if it also gave you the,\n\n484\n00:23:49.463 --> 00:23:51.701\nprevented you in theory,\nfrom putting that in.\n\n485\n00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:55.117\nOr at least gave you some sort of\nadditional information other than Hey,\n\n486\n00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:56.353\nsomebody made a mistake.\n\n487\n00:23:56.353 --> 00:23:59.423\nAnd now you go and figure it out cuz\nthat's all it's really doing, right?\n\n488\n00:23:59.423 --> 00:24:01.199\nSo it is helpful, right?\n\n489\n00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:05.611\nBut the idea would be that it could be\nmore hopeful is all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n490\n00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:07.997\nAll right, so anyway, so\nthe subnet mask, right?\n\n491\n00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:10.654\nHelps us to understand and\nidentify how to break up and\n\n492\n00:24:10.654 --> 00:24:13.146\ndistinguish between the network and\nthe host ID.\n\n493\n00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:18.001\nThis is also a critical component of what\nwe talk about, and if we go back here.\n\n494\n00:24:18.001 --> 00:24:22.585\nAnd we go to this tab right here,\nsecond tab moving left to right on our\n\n495\n00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:27.026\nspreadsheet or our book of knowledge\nwhen it comes to networking.\n\n496\n00:24:27.026 --> 00:24:29.813\nIt's called the workbook of network,\nthat's what I'm gonna call it-\n\n497\n00:24:29.813 --> 00:24:30.376\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n498\n00:24:30.376 --> 00:24:31.357\n&gt;&gt; The workbook of networking.\n\n499\n00:24:31.357 --> 00:24:36.318\n[CROSSTALK] So you'll see that we have\nat least of the default subnet mask for\n\n500\n00:24:36.318 --> 00:24:39.008\nclass A, class B and class C addresses.\n\n501\n00:24:39.008 --> 00:24:41.940\nWe'll talk about address\nclasses in just a moment.\n\n502\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.476\nYou'll see I've got a little chart\nhere that gets us to all that, and\n\n503\n00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:45.975\nwe'll talk about that in just a second.\n\n504\n00:24:45.975 --> 00:24:47.929\nBut I listed them, and I color coded them.\n\n505\n00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:51.704\nAnd if you don't prefer red, if you prefer\na different color, feel free to change it,\n\n506\n00:24:51.704 --> 00:24:53.947\nif you download this from\nthe show notes and use it.\n\n507\n00:24:53.947 --> 00:24:56.890\nI just put it in red,\njust to make it stand out for you.\n\n508\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.260\nBut you'll see that I color coded\nthe default subnet mask identifier for\n\n509\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.150\nthe network portion of the subnet mask.\n\n510\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.740\nAnd I color coded the binary bits here\nthat Cherokee was asking about earlier.\n\n511\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.033\nSo that way, as we go back between\nthe two, we can see that a 255 for\n\n512\n00:25:12.033 --> 00:25:15.972\nthe first octet, represents\nthe first 8 bits been to all 1s.\n\n513\n00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:17.471\nThe rest are being set to all 0s.\n\n514\n00:25:17.471 --> 00:25:21.845\nThey color code to the host portion\nof the default subnet mask for\n\n515\n00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:23.878\na class A IP address or range.\n\n516\n00:25:23.878 --> 00:25:26.705\nAnd then we would see that I\nput the network prefix here,\n\n517\n00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:30.393\nreally just the short hand notation for\nhow we would write a subnet mask.\n\n518\n00:25:30.393 --> 00:25:34.479\nWe could write the IP address 10.001 and\n\n519\n00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:39.623\nthen put 2550004 for\nthe subnet, that's right.\n\n520\n00:25:39.623 --> 00:25:43.386\nWe could do that, but that's kinda old\nschool and that takes a long time and\n\n521\n00:25:43.386 --> 00:25:44.359\ngot to type it all.\n\n522\n00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:46.013\n&gt;&gt; Nobody likes to type these days, yeah.\n\n523\n00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:47.400\n&gt;&gt; No place to type-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n524\n00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.367\n&gt;&gt; These days, got no room, right?\n\n525\n00:25:48.367 --> 00:25:53.047\nSo instead keeping with the times, and\nmaking everything more short, compact, and\n\n526\n00:25:53.047 --> 00:25:54.029\neasier, right?\n\n527\n00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:57.750\nWe could go ahead and we're able\nto use this short hand notations,\n\n528\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.412\n/notation is what it's referred\nto as in slang traditionally.\n\n529\n00:26:01.412 --> 00:26:06.110\nAnd the /notation for a default class\nin subnet mask is just simply /8.\n\n530\n00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.539\nThe number there, 8 in this case\nrepresents the number of bits that had\n\n531\n00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:12.409\nbeen dedicated for\nthe network portion of the subnet mask.\n\n532\n00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:15.962\nAnd you'll see here that we have\n255 equaling all 8 bits and\n\n533\n00:26:15.962 --> 00:26:17.512\nthat's what we would see.\n\n534\n00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:22.538\nSo you will often see an IP address\n10001 /8, and that signifies\n\n535\n00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:28.512\nthe default class A subnet mask for\n8 bits being turned on or 255002, right?\n\n536\n00:26:28.512 --> 00:26:32.308\nThat's what you would often take away\nfrom that, so just be aware of that, and\n\n537\n00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:33.874\njust keep that in mind, right?\n\n538\n00:26:33.874 --> 00:26:36.585\nAll right, so when we have that,\nwe'll think about the chart here.\n\n539\n00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:41.100\nYou'll see for class B, we have 2 of the 4\noctets being given over to the network,\n\n540\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.565\nand so therefore 16 bits being specified.\n\n541\n00:26:43.565 --> 00:26:48.054\nAnd then for class C3 4 octet for\nthe subnet mask specifically.\n\n542\n00:26:48.054 --> 00:26:53.252\nAnd only being identified\nas network 255255255/24.\n\n543\n00:26:53.252 --> 00:26:56.506\nAnd then 1 of the 4 octets being\ngiven over to the host range,\n\n544\n00:26:56.506 --> 00:26:58.455\nand that will give us the last octet.\n\n545\n00:26:58.455 --> 00:27:02.065\nSo this brings up an interesting point or\nconversation here which is,\n\n546\n00:27:02.065 --> 00:27:04.097\nwe have different IP address classes.\n\n547\n00:27:04.097 --> 00:27:06.040\nYou see three of them, class A, B and C.\n\n548\n00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.060\nWe actually have a total of five\nthe way identifying IPv4 networks.\n\n549\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.053\nI left off classes D and\nE here on this particular chart,\n\n550\n00:27:12.053 --> 00:27:15.953\njust because we're not traditionally\ndealing with subnetting those.\n\n551\n00:27:15.953 --> 00:27:18.294\nWe're just gonna normally talk about A,\nB, and C,\n\n552\n00:27:18.294 --> 00:27:20.115\ncuz being where we focus our attention.\n\n553\n00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.563\nBut a total of five, class A, class B, and\n\n554\n00:27:22.563 --> 00:27:26.439\nclass C are the traditional production\nnetworks that we would use.\n\n555\n00:27:26.439 --> 00:27:30.244\nRoute traffic across, whether we\nuse private IP addressing, and for\n\n556\n00:27:30.244 --> 00:27:32.834\npublic available public\nrouted IP addresses.\n\n557\n00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:36.002\nOr automatic private IP address and\nwe'll talk about all that.\n\n558\n00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:38.035\nBut we will traditionally think of A,\nB and\n\n559\n00:27:38.035 --> 00:27:40.870\nCs being the classes we go into\nproduction with primarily.\n\n560\n00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.957\nClass D is slipped in there although\nwe don't often talk about it.\n\n561\n00:27:43.957 --> 00:27:45.438\nIt's the multicasting, right?\n\n562\n00:27:45.438 --> 00:27:49.880\nSo we will use class D for\nmulticasting, we use multicasting for\n\n563\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.366\na variety of things.\n\n564\n00:27:51.366 --> 00:27:52.630\nWhether it is disc imaging,\n\n565\n00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.062\nwhether it's streaming media, a lot of\ndifferent stuff we would use there.\n\n566\n00:27:56.062 --> 00:28:00.379\nAnd then class E are experimental\nsometimes called the expansion range,\n\n567\n00:28:00.379 --> 00:28:03.998\nis used and reserved for testing and\nvarious things that may or\n\n568\n00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:05.961\nmay not go on in normal networks.\n\n569\n00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:10.927\nAnd so when we look at all the different\nIP address classes, we look at a range for\n\n570\n00:28:10.927 --> 00:28:12.050\nthe first octet.\n\n571\n00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.829\nAnd this is what we often think about\nwhen we think about IP address classes.\n\n572\n00:28:14.829 --> 00:28:17.942\nAnd again, you'll see here,\nI've got class A, B, C.\n\n573\n00:28:17.942 --> 00:28:20.919\nWe could put class D and E in here,\nwe'll be happy to do that for\n\n574\n00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:22.630\nyou while we're talking.\n\n575\n00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.610\nBut you'll see class class\nA goes from 1 to 127,\n\n576\n00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.100\nthat's the range usable\nin the first octet.\n\n577\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.240\nWe have an asterisk next to\nthat statement for class A.\n\n578\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.119\nAnd depending on whose documentation you\nread and who you listen to and whether or\n\n579\n00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:39.489\nnot you are looking at the,\nfor instance RFC standard or\n\n580\n00:28:39.489 --> 00:28:42.452\nperhaps looking at\na vendor's documentation.\n\n581\n00:28:42.452 --> 00:28:46.175\nAnd I've actually seen the both ways\nin Microsoft's documentation as well.\n\n582\n00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:49.602\nThey will put 1 to 127 in\nthe class a full range,\n\n583\n00:28:49.602 --> 00:28:53.030\ninclusive of the Loopback Adapter\naddress range or\n\n584\n00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.751\nloopback subnet range, not subnet range,\nloopback octet, right?\n\n585\n00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:00.161\nFor 127 for the address block.\n\n586\n00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:04.090\nAnd that I've also standard as 1 to 126\nin our documentation for Microsoft.\n\n587\n00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.236\nSo I've seen it both ways, and\nthe idea is that ultimately and\n\n588\n00:29:07.236 --> 00:29:10.277\nI've actually seen it both ways for\nCisco as well, right?\n\n589\n00:29:10.277 --> 00:29:13.636\nDepending on which documentation and\nwhich area you're looking at.\n\n590\n00:29:13.636 --> 00:29:18.307\nOverall 127 is technically considered to\nbe part of the class A address block.\n\n591\n00:29:18.307 --> 00:29:22.659\nBut it's not usable for traditional\nrouted communication between host.\n\n592\n00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:26.041\nWe reserved the entire blocks\nof the 127 address block,\n\n593\n00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:28.077\nit's what we call set aside block.\n\n594\n00:29:28.077 --> 00:29:32.838\nIt is reserved for in this case\ndiagnostic work, the 127.00.1 address,\n\n595\n00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:37.668\nyou're probably familiar with which it's\nusually called the Loopback Adapter.\n\n596\n00:29:37.668 --> 00:29:41.744\nAnd you can ping the loop back adaptor\nto be able to see whether your network\n\n597\n00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:46.611\ninterface has setup, is drawing power, is\ngot the driver initialized in other words,\n\n598\n00:29:46.611 --> 00:29:48.421\nif it's working the right way.\n\n599\n00:29:48.421 --> 00:29:52.332\nA traditional and\nspecified kind of linear progression in\n\n600\n00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:56.096\nthe troubleshooting methodology\nif we go step by step.\n\n601\n00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:58.323\nAnd think through the logical\nof what we're supposed to do,\n\n602\n00:29:58.323 --> 00:30:01.303\nyou would actually ping the loop back\nadapter most of us don't bother with that.\n\n603\n00:30:01.303 --> 00:30:04.417\nOr I don't think anybody would readily\nstandup in public and admit that they\n\n604\n00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:07.646\nactually ping the Loopback Adapter on\na regular basis to do troubleshooting.\n\n605\n00:30:07.646 --> 00:30:10.729\nInstead what we traditionally will do,\nis jump ahead and\n\n606\n00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:15.100\nusually ping something off the machine\nto tap both the Loopback Adapter status,\n\n607\n00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.362\nto ensure Internet card is initialized.\n\n608\n00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:20.683\nTo check the interface,\nto the check the DNS information,\n\n609\n00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:24.081\nif we're resolving past the gateway,\nout to the Internet.\n\n610\n00:30:24.081 --> 00:30:27.009\nAnd or to check our ability to\ntalk to a machine on the LAN or\n\n611\n00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:28.972\nto hit the gateway or to go through it.\n\n612\n00:30:28.972 --> 00:30:32.347\nAnd so we may ping the default gateway and\nfrom backwards from there is our\n\n613\n00:30:32.347 --> 00:30:35.130\ntroubleshooting [INAUDIBLE] for\ninstance traditionally.\n\n614\n00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.429\nBut if you look at kind of the step by\nstep methodology, step one do this,\n\n615\n00:30:39.429 --> 00:30:40.497\nstep two do that.\n\n616\n00:30:40.497 --> 00:30:43.735\nYou look at the documentation\nmost vendors tell you, hey,\n\n617\n00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:45.695\nstart by paying Loopback Adapter.\n\n618\n00:30:45.695 --> 00:30:49.350\nAnd so that's what the 127.00.1\naddress specifies.\n\n619\n00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.489\nSo it is technically\nconsidered part of class A,\n\n620\n00:30:52.489 --> 00:30:57.399\nbut from a usability perspective in\nterms of the actual usable octet block.\n\n621\n00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:01.803\nOr reference that's it's gonna be used for\nthe first value that goes into that octet,\n\n622\n00:31:01.803 --> 00:31:02.537\n1 to 126.\n\n623\n00:31:02.537 --> 00:31:06.990\nIt's considered the acceptable range for\nclass A or usable range.\n\n624\n00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:12.294\nYou'll see B, class B 128 to 191,\nclass C 192 to 223.\n\n625\n00:31:12.294 --> 00:31:15.630\nAgain, we're talking about just the value\nthat goes into the first octet.\n\n626\n00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.222\nThe other octets will be\nmade up of different values,\n\n627\n00:31:18.222 --> 00:31:20.130\npopped up those rules in just a moment.\n\n628\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:25.238\nClass D for\nmulticasting would be 224 to 239.\n\n629\n00:31:25.238 --> 00:31:27.558\nAgain, first octet value only, right?\n\n630\n00:31:27.558 --> 00:31:29.570\nJust specifying what that would look like.\n\n631\n00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:35.916\nAnd then class E, the experiment\nset aside would be from 224 to 239,\n\n632\n00:31:35.916 --> 00:31:39.555\n240 to all the way up to the end, right?\n\n633\n00:31:39.555 --> 00:31:42.561\nAll the way out to the final part of that,\nso up to 255.\n\n634\n00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:45.636\nSo just keep in mind that\nalthough we don't list them here,\n\n635\n00:31:45.636 --> 00:31:48.468\nthere are two additional class,\njust to keep in mind.\n\n636\n00:31:48.468 --> 00:31:51.338\nNow the other thing you'll see here, I\nput in the number of networks in a number\n\n637\n00:31:51.338 --> 00:31:53.356\nof pose because a lot of\ntimes we're asked about this.\n\n638\n00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:56.469\nHey, how may networks,\nCan I get in a class B?\n\n639\n00:31:56.469 --> 00:31:57.958\nHow many hosts do I get roughly?\n\n640\n00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.840\nAnd you'll see the numbers here.\n\n641\n00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.720\nAnd the thing that's interesting about\nthis is, and I've gotta a little blurb off\n\n642\n00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.600\nto the side we'll take a look at for\na minute that comes from the RFC directly\n\n643\n00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.705\njust as a quote, and\nI'll show you that in just a second.\n\n644\n00:32:08.705 --> 00:32:10.855\nBut the interesting thing here is,\n\n645\n00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:12.637\nit's crazy when those things\njust randomly happen.\n\n646\n00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:14.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Full-screen back again.\n\n647\n00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:15.045\nI didn't even have to say anything.\n\n648\n00:32:15.045 --> 00:32:15.635\n&gt;&gt; It's magic.\n\n649\n00:32:15.635 --> 00:32:16.495\n&gt;&gt; It's just lovely.\n\n650\n00:32:16.495 --> 00:32:17.245\nThat's just great.\n\n651\n00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:17.775\nThat's awesome.\n\n652\n00:32:17.775 --> 00:32:23.010\nSo, the nice thing about this is that\nwe can see that this is ultimately\n\n653\n00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.900\nwhat I would think of as a fixed sum,\nright?\n\n654\n00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.940\nThe total number of IP addresses,\n\n655\n00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.140\ntotal number of networks that we get here,\nis fixed ultimately, right?\n\n656\n00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.720\nWe have about 4 billion with the B\naddresses approximately in the IPv4\n\n657\n00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.620\nrange starting with our very, very first\nusable IP address in the class A range,\n\n658\n00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.165\nthe very first octet value.\n\n659\n00:32:42.165 --> 00:32:45.100\n1.001 all the way at the bottom.\n\n660\n00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.694\nAnd then if we went all the way up to the\nvery top of the range, right, of class C,\n\n661\n00:32:49.694 --> 00:32:54.060\nand we did 223.255.255.254, right,\n\n662\n00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.510\nthat would be our last usable\naddress in the class C range.\n\n663\n00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.140\nWe included DNE,\ngo all the way out, right?\n\n664\n00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.160\nAnd we would get a total\nnumber of IP addresses.\n\n665\n00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.530\nBut that number doesn't change\nin the sense that it is fixed.\n\n666\n00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:09.460\nAnd as we add networks,\nwe're adding them at the expense of hosts.\n\n667\n00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.350\nAnd as we take away hosts,\nwe're gaining networks.\n\n668\n00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.370\nAnd as we add networks,\nwere taking away hosts.\n\n669\n00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.120\nSo it's kind of a scale that\nwe have to balance, right,\n\n670\n00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.810\nif you think about the logic of it.\n\n671\n00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.900\nAnd you could see that they're\ninversely proportional\n\n672\n00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.790\nas we have a small number of networks,\nvery large number of hosts.\n\n673\n00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like when people say,\nwe're borrowing bits from the network or\n\n674\n00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.125\nthe host portion, but it's like\nare ever really giving them back?\n\n675\n00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:32.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n676\n00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.930\nWe do, we're not gracious.\n\n677\n00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.840\nWe borrow them, but\nwe don't ever give them back, right?\n\n678\n00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.360\nBecause we keep them, so we're permanently\nacquiring them is what we should say.\n\n679\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.855\nWe're gonna M an A,\nmerger and acquisition our.\n\n680\n00:33:41.855 --> 00:33:44.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Take them over in a hostile bid.\n\n681\n00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.470\nSo you'll see here,\nwe grow the number of networks.\n\n682\n00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.850\nBut notice, of course, we are shrinking\nthe number of hosts as a result.\n\n683\n00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.465\nAnd so, we just wanna keep this in\nmind because there is a balance, and\n\n684\n00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:53.675\nthere is a finite number.\n\n685\n00:33:53.675 --> 00:33:56.670\nAnd we're not allowed to break\nthe rules of the laws here\n\n686\n00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.820\nin order to go beyond those where\nthings don't work the right way.\n\n687\n00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.030\nI mentioned that we do have\nsome other rules just real\n\n688\n00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.330\nquickly I wanna throw out here, just with\nregards to the idea of the first octet,\n\n689\n00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.850\nwe know that class A,\nB, and C in the value.\n\n690\n00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.210\nWhat about the second,\nthe third, and the fourth octet?\n\n691\n00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.180\nWe'll give some rules that govern that.\n\n692\n00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.485\nThe second and the thrid octets can be\nanything in value from zero to 255, right?\n\n693\n00:34:18.485 --> 00:34:20.770\nAnd so the values for the second and\n\n694\n00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.360\nthe third octet be anything\nfrom zero all the way to 255.\n\n695\n00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.451\nThe full number of bits being turned on\nand specified as being available, right?\n\n696\n00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:33.856\nSo for, say, 1.001 is the first\nusable address for the host in the 1.\n\n697\n00:34:33.856 --> 00:34:35.279\nnetwork.\n\n698\n00:34:35.279 --> 00:34:38.769\nWe could say that 1.255.255, right,\n\n699\n00:34:38.769 --> 00:34:43.374\nwould also be .1, would be\nan acceptable IP address in the 1.\n\n700\n00:34:43.374 --> 00:34:46.430\nnetwork for the second and\nthird octet values.\n\n701\n00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.900\nNow we don't often think about it,\nand we don't stop and say, yeah,\n\n702\n00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.790\nI got to go all the way\nup incrementing by 1,\n\n703\n00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.490\nbut we have to just think about that\nto understand the value of the bits.\n\n704\n00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:56.670\nNow, for the fourth bit,\nthe very last octet value, right,\n\n705\n00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:00.930\nwe have to think about that fact that\nthere is a rule that governs that.\n\n706\n00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.690\nBut the rule is that we never start\non a zero, and we never end on a 255.\n\n707\n00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.590\nJust like the same rule that governs\nthe first octet or the values of the first\n\n708\n00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.840\noctet, cuz if we start on a zero in either\nthe first or the last octet, we don't\n\n709\n00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.640\nhave a valid IP address that we can use\nto send or receive traffic between hosts.\n\n710\n00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.210\nWe are going to have a null value,\nessentially,\n\n711\n00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.280\nwe're not assigning an IP address.\n\n712\n00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.220\nAnd if we start in the first or start in\nthe last on a 255, we're broadcasting,\n\n713\n00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.330\nwe're essentially saying we wanna send\neverybody, and we're not using a unicast\n\n714\n00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.440\ntransmission between two fixed\nendpoints with unique host IDs.\n\n715\n00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.200\nBut we're essentially screaming at the top\nof our lungs to anybody who's within\n\n716\n00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.710\near range, or in other words, who's on our\nsubnet, whether they wanna hear us or not.\n\n717\n00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.260\nAnd we're not using a IP address\nin the traditional sense.\n\n718\n00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.489\nSo, although we do say, hey,\nyou could do 1.255.255.255,\n\n719\n00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:54.074\nit is a value in that\nranges that we increment.\n\n720\n00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:57.285\nIt's not an acceptable value for us.\n\n721\n00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.546\nAnd this is why, ultimately,\nas we go through and\n\n722\n00:36:00.546 --> 00:36:03.418\nwe start to account for\nthe number of hosts,\n\n723\n00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:07.845\nwe have to think about the fact that\nwe have to subtract two hosts from\n\n724\n00:36:07.845 --> 00:36:12.610\nthe overall value of every network as\nwe think about how we increment up.\n\n725\n00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.445\nBecause as we think about, hey, we've got,\n\n726\n00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:20.173\nlet's say, 256 values, zero to 255,\ninclusive of zero and 255,\n\n727\n00:36:20.173 --> 00:36:25.455\nis a total of 256 possible host addresses\nif think about the logic of that, right?\n\n728\n00:36:25.455 --> 00:36:28.790\nAnd we always start on zero in the sense\nthat we always start numbering\n\n729\n00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.700\nin anything that has to do with computers,\nthe first value is always a zero.\n\n730\n00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.250\nWe start our numerical system or\nsequence from there.\n\n731\n00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:41.770\nSo if we start Start zero to 255,\ninclusive 256 possible assigned values.\n\n732\n00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:46.050\nBut if we have to take off the no use\nof zero and no use of 255 at the end,\n\n733\n00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.100\nwe always minus two or\ntake away two from the total number.\n\n734\n00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.960\nAnd that's how we would\nget at the bottom there.\n\n735\n00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.474\n254 hosts per network instead of 256.\n\n736\n00:36:53.474 --> 00:36:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, our network ID and\nour broadcast ID.\n\n737\n00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n738\n00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.920\n&gt;&gt; And to support your rule about, for\n\n739\n00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.241\ninstance, not being able have a 1 in\nthat first octet followed by any 255s,\n\n740\n00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:09.110\none of the cool things about using,\nbreaking it down into that chart you\n\n741\n00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.360\nshowed us, you can always see that-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n742\n00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Not that chart,\n\n743\n00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.120\nthe one with the red and the black.\n\n744\n00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.010\n&gt;&gt; That chart right there.\n\n745\n00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.850\n&gt;&gt; That chart right there.\n\n746\n00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.470\nSo you can see how that the one's\nare always contiguous to the left,\n\n747\n00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.380\nthe zeros always to the right, and\n\n748\n00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.440\nif you have any zeros in between, then you\nknow that that's an invalid subnet mask.\n\n749\n00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.080\nSo if you break it down in a simple way,\nmy simple mind here, Adam.\n\n750\n00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:29.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n751\n00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna accept the,\n\n752\n00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.360\nI've come to call them Cherokeeisms,\nthat's what we're gonna call them.\n\n753\n00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.830\nAnd I'm gonna accept\nCherokee's thought process.\n\n754\n00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.790\nAnd it is certainly a very valid one,\n\n755\n00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.450\njust another way of looking at\nthe same thing we were talking about.\n\n756\n00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.930\nAnd it's helpful to have more than one\nperspective as we go through this.\n\n757\n00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.950\nSo, I think it's probably that time.\n\n758\n00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.140\n&gt;&gt; You think so.\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking.\n\n759\n00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.925\nI see red on the screen.\n\n760\n00:37:48.925 --> 00:37:50.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't see anymore red on the clock,\n\n761\n00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.790\nit usually indicates,\nit's maybe that time.\n\n762\n00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.270\nBut it may be a good place for\nus to break our conversation,\n\n763\n00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.050\nreally just kinda regroup,\ngive you a moment to catch your breath,\n\n764\n00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:02.600\ncome back, continue our conversations\naround IPv4 with episode two,\n\n765\n00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.080\nand flesh out our conversation\nin a little more detail.\n\n766\n00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.260\nWe still have to talk about\nsome things like super netting,\n\n767\n00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.120\nand talk about how we set up and\nactually apply these changes and\n\n768\n00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.740\nthese solutions into an interface using\nboth PowerShell and the command line.\n\n769\n00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.651\nMaybe a little Net SH,\na little PowerShell,\n\n770\n00:38:18.651 --> 00:38:21.180\nsome of the command lists\nthat are associated there.\n\n771\n00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.160\nJust show you some other\nthings that we can do.\n\n772\n00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.250\nAnd also, yet a third way that\nyou can look at IP interfaces and\n\n773\n00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.680\nlook at routing tables,\nwhich a lot of people often forget about.\n\n774\n00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.460\nYou have to come back and take a look\nat us in episode two to see that, but\n\n775\n00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.630\nit will be interesting for you.\n\n776\n00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, you heard it, but for\n\n777\n00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.470\nthis show we are out of time,\nso we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n778\n00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.700\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n779\n00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n780\n00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.074\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n781\n00:38:44.074 --> 00:38:50.243\n[MUSIC]\n\n782\n00:38:50.243 --> 00:38:53.717\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:07.479\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.974\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:15.387\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.341\nThis episode is a continuation of a\nprevious conversation where we were really\n\n8\n00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.389\nlooking at networking with IPv4 where\nwe started talking about subnets.\n\n9\n00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:28.315\nWe didn't really get\ninto routing too much,\n\n10\n00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:31.930\nI'm kind of excited to see where we\nare going in this particular episode.\n\n11\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.860\nWith us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.864\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:40.103\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, it is going well,\nit is an IPtastic day, and\n\n14\n00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:44.517\nwe're gonna make it IPtastic here for\nyou in IPv4 episode two.\n\n15\n00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:49.048\nSound like the networking, rhyming guy.\n\n16\n00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.910\nSo, we're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n17\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.339\nAnd as Cherokee said,\nwe had just really scratched the surface.\n\n18\n00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.119\nWe talked about some of the basic\nconcepts the plocking and\n\n19\n00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.059\ntackling of what an IPV 4 addresses is.\n\n20\n00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.258\nWhat is our subnet mask?\n\n21\n00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:01.064\nHow do we understand the logic and\n\n22\n00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.804\nthe laws that relate to how we get\nthose two things to bind together and\n\n23\n00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:07.919\nindicate for us what our network is,\nwhat our host ID is?\n\n24\n00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.220\nHow we create uniqueness and\nspecify unique identity for\n\n25\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.117\nan individual endpoint\nwithin an IPV 4 network?\n\n26\n00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:17.474\nAnd we're gonna continue that I wanna go\nback to where we left off in the last\n\n27\n00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:18.229\nconversation.\n\n28\n00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.825\nI mentioned I have a quote all tied up for\nyou on a spread\n\n29\n00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.058\nsheet didn't get the chance to refer\nyou back to it in the episode,\n\n30\n00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.638\nwe can go full screen on\nthis cuz I'm covering half.\n\n31\n00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:30.967\nBut right at the end here as you\ncan see of this part of this\n\n32\n00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:34.853\nspreadsheet IP address\nclasses is where we were.\n\n33\n00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:38.963\nOn the tab we're talking about the number\nof networks, number of host and\n\n34\n00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:42.741\nI explain the concept of why we have\nto essentially drop the first and\n\n35\n00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.409\nthe very last bit to 0 and\nthe 255 and walk through that logic.\n\n36\n00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.282\nIf you haven't seen that,\nyou definitely wanna go back, take a look.\n\n37\n00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:50.631\nI just wanted to show you\nwhere that comes from.\n\n38\n00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.658\nSometimes it's important\nto actually go back and\n\n39\n00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:57.694\nreference the historical information\nthat gives us the theory and\n\n40\n00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.807\nhelps us to understand or\nanswer the question why.\n\n41\n00:02:00.807 --> 00:02:04.590\nAnd I don't expect you to go out and\ndig up RFC's.\n\n42\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.041\nBut if you wanna take a look at it,\nthe URL's right down there for you.\n\n43\n00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:12.909\nRFC 923 and before you go there, before\nyou look at it, before you come screeching\n\n44\n00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.990\nback here and say, my God that RFC's been\nobsolete about like a million other RFC's.\n\n45\n00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.260\nWhy are you quoting it?\n\n46\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.411\nWe know that.\n\n47\n00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:24.031\nWe're just showing you that this\nis the historical document,\n\n48\n00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:28.963\nthe reference point for where we actually\nunderstand the basic logic of networking.\n\n49\n00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:33.077\nAnd the quote in particular, the piece of\nthat RFC, cuz it is a multi-page document.\n\n50\n00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:36.230\nBut the piece that speaks to\nthis particular thought process,\n\n51\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.585\nif you take a look right there, can\nhave a decimal value between 0 and 255.\n\n52\n00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:42.904\nAs I indicated in the show\nwe were talking about,\n\n53\n00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:45.120\nthe total of 256 possible values, right?\n\n54\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.992\nInclusive 0 to or through 255.\n\n55\n00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:52.109\nWhy does a class C network, or any network\nfor that matter if you do the math, but\n\n56\n00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.383\nit's very obvious when\nyou look at class C,\n\n57\n00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:57.290\nhave only 254 useable\naddresses as we said, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.570\nAnd the first address\nwhere all bits are 0 and\n\n59\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.100\nthe host portion when IP is the subnet ID.\n\n60\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.589\nLast address where all bits are 1\nis used for broadcasts as we said.\n\n61\n00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:09.763\nAnd as a result we essentially take\nthose away, and we drop them, or\n\n62\n00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:12.339\njust remove them from the conversation.\n\n63\n00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:16.197\nWe start on a 1, we end on a 254,\nand as a result of that,\n\n64\n00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:21.080\nthe usable values become inclusive\nthere and we have 245 usable hosts.\n\n65\n00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.244\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n66\n00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:25.918\nWhen it comes to more of C923 that's\nwhere we actually get that from.\n\n67\n00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:28.259\nAnd just so you know why we're\nactually thinking about that.\n\n68\n00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.430\nNow this takes us to another\ninteresting conversation.\n\n69\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.171\nLet's go back over here for just a second,\nwe'll take a look at our classes, and\n\n70\n00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:39.258\ntalk about our addresses,\nand our address blocks.\n\n71\n00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:40.839\nWe've talked about class A, B, and C.\n\n72\n00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.330\nWe included D and E in the mix,\nand identified what those were.\n\n73\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.786\nBut for purposes of public, private\nand/or automatic private IP addressing,\n\n74\n00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:50.760\nwhat's called APIPA addressing.\n\n75\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.501\nWe have to think about class A,\nB and C definitively, cuz\n\n76\n00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:57.510\nthose are really the address blocks that\nwe will operate on as we've talked about.\n\n77\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.290\nAnd so when we think about public\naddresses we think about routable IP\n\n78\n00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.789\naddresses that are used for\n\n79\n00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:06.831\ncommunication between two end points\nthat are available to everybody and\n\n80\n00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.295\nanybody that wants to interact with them\non the LAN through the WAN out to the WAN.\n\n81\n00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:14.225\nAnd on the WAN across the other side and\nback to down again.\n\n82\n00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:18.198\nIn other words these are addresses\nthat often get assigned to gateways or\n\n83\n00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:20.151\nend points that are gonna accept and\n\n84\n00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:23.240\nsend traffic on our behalf\nacross public networks.\n\n85\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.022\nThink of routers, think of firewalls,\nthink of intrusion detection and\n\n86\n00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:31.170\nprevention systems and even the standing\nguard or sitting on a perimeter that's\n\n87\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.269\ngonna interdict and accept traffic and\nexamine it, and allow it to come and go.\n\n88\n00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:37.082\nBut does so facing the outside world,\n\n89\n00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:40.038\nhas one of these public IP\naddresses traditionally, right?\n\n90\n00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:41.992\nNow hosts may have public IP addresses,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:46.856\nWe may give them public IP addresses,\nweb servers sitting in a DMZ, may very\n\n92\n00:04:46.856 --> 00:04:51.426\nwell be given a direct IP address,\nso somebody can interact with them.\n\n93\n00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:55.332\nBut we may also put them behind a DMZ,\nput them behind, or in a DMZ, behind\n\n94\n00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:59.699\na firewall, and make the public IP address\nof any, or all, of those web servers.\n\n95\n00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.904\nIn a web form, the inbound IP of the\nfirewall, the WAN side of the firewall,\n\n96\n00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:07.916\nthat becomes the common IP address that\nis used to load balance across and\n\n97\n00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:12.080\nthat we ultimately will access and\ninteract with the web server behind.\n\n98\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.063\nSo it depends on how we set this up,\nbut public IP addresses are routable IP\n\n99\n00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:19.597\naddresses that exist outside in\nthe real world useable to send and\n\n100\n00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:20.900\nreceive information.\n\n101\n00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.289\nAmong and between systems across\nthe largest public network in the world,\n\n102\n00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.753\nthe internet and world wide web and\nmay others as well right over that maybe.\n\n103\n00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:30.634\nSpeaking of which you may\nnot have seen this one.\n\n104\n00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:31.560\nI'm going out on the limb.\n\n105\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking you're heard of this.\n\n106\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.736\n&gt;&gt; Okay is it the Disney one?\n\n107\n00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:35.640\n&gt;&gt; No, it is not,\n\n108\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.052\nit's the Erickson Labs animated short\ncalled Good Warriors of the .NET.\n\n109\n00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:41.204\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n110\n00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:42.053\nYou've not.\n\n111\n00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.772\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sorry to let you down and\ndisappoint you yet again.\n\n112\n00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:48.870\n&gt;&gt; Wow so you have to and\nall of you out there as well.\n\n113\n00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.068\nYou have to watch this.\n\n114\n00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:52.378\nCherokee is gonna actually do\nme a favor while we're talking.\n\n115\n00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:53.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So Cherie's is gonna just\n\n116\n00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.847\nsearch for the URL.\n\n117\n00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:56.777\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Just go out to YouTube do good warriors\n\n118\n00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:57.310\nof the NET.\n\n119\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.199\n&gt;&gt; I don't have my display-\n&gt;&gt; .NET being period net, right?\n\n120\n00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.778\nAnd she's gonna find the video.\n\n121\n00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.955\nWe're not gonna play it,\nit's about a 30 minute video.\n\n122\n00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:05.429\n&gt;&gt; I'm not hooked up.\n\n123\n00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:07.962\n&gt;&gt; She is going to, no, no,\nno we're not gonna play this one,\n\n124\n00:06:07.962 --> 00:06:09.070\nI want you to post the URL.\n\n125\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's part of the notes.\n\n126\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.462\n&gt;&gt; I will see that.\n\n127\n00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:11.430\n&gt;&gt; If you can look at it if they want to.\n\n128\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.446\nWe're not gonna play it because it's\nobvious to something if you choose to look\n\n129\n00:06:14.446 --> 00:06:15.357\nat you do it on your own.\n\n130\n00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:16.737\nBut this is a really cool video.\n\n131\n00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:18.619\nLet me click I could\ndescribe the concept to you.\n\n132\n00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.448\nI use this with all my\nNetwork Plus classes.\n\n133\n00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:21.928\nMy basic Inter-classes.\n\n134\n00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:23.059\n&gt;&gt; I think I have seen this seen one.\n\n135\n00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.243\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking you have coz somebody\n\n136\n00:06:24.243 --> 00:06:25.950\nprobably told you to take\na look at it at some point.\n\n137\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.722\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a really good but\ncheesy kind of graphical representation.\n\n138\n00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:33.484\n&gt;&gt; I would drop the cheesy part, it's just\nlet's go with it's a good presentation.\n\n139\n00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:34.288\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't want\n\n140\n00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:35.632\nto pre-judge on everybody's\nbehalf out there.\n\n141\n00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:37.407\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no\n&gt;&gt; It's an animated short,\n\n142\n00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:40.111\nit's about 13 minutes long,\ndone by Ericson Labs.\n\n143\n00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:44.336\nIt shows you, interacts with you around\nall the ideas of the OSI model and\n\n144\n00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:46.300\nnetworking top to bottom.\n\n145\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.964\nSo it explains the concepts of routers,\nswitches, IP addresses,\n\n146\n00:06:49.964 --> 00:06:54.033\npacket movement, default gateways,\nfirewalls, the whole nine yards.\n\n147\n00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:57.440\nIt's a really cool video, it's a great\nway to put your toe in the water.\n\n148\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.403\nAnd just remind yourself of all\nthe concepts and get used to them.\n\n149\n00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.249\nIt is a little dated to be fair.\n\n150\n00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.613\nYou'll see some references to\nsome pretty cool old technology.\n\n151\n00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:07.255\nNetscape is a browser is in there.\n\n152\n00:07:07.255 --> 00:07:10.530\nIf you take a look at the browser windows,\nthey show you the animated feature.\n\n153\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.860\nBut you should definitely\ntake a look at it.\n\n154\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.134\nSo Cherokee will post that up for\nus while we're talking.\n\n155\n00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:20.514\nBut the idea of private IP addresses are\ngonna be these set-aside address blocks or\n\n156\n00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:25.998\nby-class, class A, class B,\nclass C, individual address blocks.\n\n157\n00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:30.618\nOne per class that are used internally\nin every major and minor organization,\n\n158\n00:07:30.618 --> 00:07:33.978\nenterprise on the planet whether\nyou have two machines or\n\n159\n00:07:33.978 --> 00:07:36.368\n200 million that you wanna connect.\n\n160\n00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:40.530\nEverybody is using private IP addresses on\ntheir internal networks today in order to\n\n161\n00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.240\nbe able to setup and communicate.\n\n162\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.098\nAnd so in class A,\nwe traditionally have a 10 dot series.\n\n163\n00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:53.932\nSo 10.0000/8 meaning the entire 10 network\nis gonna be used for private class A.\n\n164\n00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:57.644\nIP addressing inside of\nyour corporate network.\n\n165\n00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:02.613\nSo 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255\nwould be the range.\n\n166\n00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:10.080\nOn class B, 17216.00/12 would\nbe the private network there.\n\n167\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.250\nMeaning, 1721600 through 17231255255\ninclusive would be the full\n\n168\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.636\nrange for private addresses in class B.\n\n169\n00:08:18.636 --> 00:08:24.313\nAnd class C, 19216800/16.\n\n170\n00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:27.540\nSo 16 bits being given over\nto the network, 16 for\n\n171\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.132\nthe host, split it right down the middle.\n\n172\n00:08:30.132 --> 00:08:33.251\nThe kind Solomon version\nof the IP address and\n\n173\n00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.160\nthe subnet mask-\n&gt;&gt; Horrible analogy.\n\n174\n00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.570\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Horrible analogy.\n\n175\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.080\n&gt;&gt; Horrible analogy.\n\n176\n00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.626\n&gt;&gt; Accurate but-\n&gt;&gt; We're not splitting the baby,\n\n177\n00:08:40.626 --> 00:08:42.648\nwe're splitting the IP address.\n\n178\n00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:47.434\nBut 192.168.0.0 all the way through\n192.168.255.255 inclusive would be our\n\n179\n00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:48.080\nrange there.\n\n180\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.580\nSo just be aware of the fact\nthat this is gonna give us\n\n181\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.240\nour private IP address blocks or\nour private IP address classes.\n\n182\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.250\nYou hear them sometimes referred\nto by class A, class B, class C.\n\n183\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.970\nBut these are our private address blocks,\nand\n\n184\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.030\nthis is what we use there\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n185\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.980\nwe also have this thing called the APIPA,\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n186\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.630\nBeen around for sometime.\n\n187\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.060\nMicrosoft implements it\nin Windows going back,\n\n188\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.310\nI think, as far as at least Server 2003,\nmaybe even Server 2000.\n\n189\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.860\nSo it's been around for some time.\n\n190\n00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.650\nBut the idea that we can\nassign a 169254.something\n\n191\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.340\nsomething address to a host that\nloses it's DHCP assigned address.\n\n192\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.260\nSo if it's got a lease, and\nwe'll go into this whole idea of DHCP and\n\n193\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.090\nhow it works in upcoming episodes.\n\n194\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.620\nBut if it's leasing an IP address\nfrom a DHCP server, and doing so\n\n195\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.510\nusing a dynamically assigned address,\ngetting it as a dynamic assignment instead\n\n196\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.960\nof getting a static address, cuz we\ncan actually do either one from DHCP.\n\n197\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.052\nWe can have a reservation that gives us\na statically mapped IP that we just keep.\n\n198\n00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:51.715\nBut let's assume we use DHCP\ntraditionally, we're leasing an address,\n\n199\n00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:55.193\nwe have a TTL value,\na total time out value on the lease,\n\n200\n00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:58.166\neight hours let's say,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n201\n00:09:58.166 --> 00:10:01.779\nThat ticks down to zero, and\nwe're not able to refresh and\n\n202\n00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:06.501\nrenew our lease either 50% TTL or\n87.5% TTL, the two default values\n\n203\n00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:11.435\nthat we operate on in a Windows\nenvironment with DHTP to attempt renewal.\n\n204\n00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:16.165\nIf we get down to zero and\nthe address has not been renewed,\n\n205\n00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:20.077\nwe release it, it goes to traditionally\nall zeros, we lose our IP address.\n\n206\n00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.155\nBut APIPA steps in and says, wait a sec,\n\n207\n00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.515\nwe need to keep you\nconnected to the network.\n\n208\n00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:28.765\nLet's put you on this special address\nblock on this special subnet called\n\n209\n00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:34.390\n169254, and then we'll give you 01 or\n02 or whatever for the unique host ID.\n\n210\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.054\nAnd there's a algorithm that kicks in, and\n\n211\n00:10:36.054 --> 00:10:39.850\nAPIPA generates a unique address,\nassigns it to that interface.\n\n212\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.580\nAnd then, every five minutes we start\nchecking back with the DHCP server trying\n\n213\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.635\nto see whether or not we can renew\nand/or lease a new addresses.\n\n214\n00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:52.775\nBut technically, what APIPA's able to do\nfor us is keep us connected to the LAN so\n\n215\n00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:57.625\nwe're able to consume network services,\nsuch as renewals for DHCP without\n\n216\n00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:01.674\ngoing dark, without specifying an all zero\naddress and loosing our connectivity.\n\n217\n00:11:01.674 --> 00:11:05.042\nSo APIPA gives us a very\nimportant capability\n\n218\n00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:07.822\nthat we wanna make sure we're aware of and\nwe understand as well.\n\n219\n00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:13.142\nWe will assign, as I said,\nthat IP address in the 169254 block.\n\n220\n00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:17.841\nThe host ID will be something in the last\ntwo octets, anything from 01 through\n\n221\n00:11:17.841 --> 00:11:21.992\n255254, depending on just a variety of\nvariables on that particular network.\n\n222\n00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:23.282\nBut do you be aware of that.\n\n223\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.920\nIt is important.\n\n224\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.970\nIt does happen automatically.\n\n225\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.320\nWe don't need to get in the way of it.\n\n226\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.610\nWe just need to get out of the way, as\na matter of fact, and let it do its job.\n\n227\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.740\nIf you wanna take a look here real quick,\n\n228\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.520\nwe will see something else I just wanted\nto mention with regards to IP address.\n\n229\n00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.710\nWe've been kind of stepping\nthrough the IP and\n\n230\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.650\njust using the IP config information\nhere to identify the constituent parts.\n\n231\n00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.700\nI mentioned the default gateway.\n\n232\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.110\nI just wanna highlight that and\nmake sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n233\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.966\nThe default gateway acts as our doorway\nthat allows us to get out of our\n\n234\n00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:54.553\nLocal Area Network and cross the threshold\ninto the broader, wider networks that\n\n235\n00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:59.207\nexist beyond that, whether it's another\nLAN that maybe we're connecting to, or\n\n236\n00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:02.170\nanother WAN, wherever it is,\nwhatever it is.\n\n237\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.104\nIt's the address of the gateway device,\nthe keeper of the keys so to speak, right?\n\n238\n00:12:07.104 --> 00:12:11.349\nThe router, the firewall, whatever\nthat device is that straddles our LAN,\n\n239\n00:12:11.349 --> 00:12:15.530\nour local area network, and one or\nmore other networks that exist outside,\n\n240\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.060\nand has a network connection that\nessentially exists in both places, right?\n\n241\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.260\nIt's a multi-home machine.\n\n242\n00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.330\nIt's got at least two interfaces.\n\n243\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.760\nAnd the interface that is attached to our\nlocal area network is the default gateway.\n\n244\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.220\nThat's what we read it as.\n\n245\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.350\nIt's our pathway to get out of our\nnetwork and go somewhere else.\n\n246\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.390\nAnd we throw all of our traffic\nup against that pathway.\n\n247\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.860\nThe device, router, firewall, whatever,\nwill process that traffic, do something\n\n248\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.710\nwith it depending on a variety of rules\nand things that we have to specify that\n\n249\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.180\nmay or may not be appropriate for\nthis conversation specifically.\n\n250\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.100\nBut generically, we assume that if we\nsend traffic that is in the valid form,\n\n251\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.070\nhas the right addresses,\nhas the right permission,\n\n252\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.210\ncomes from the right user on\nthe right interface, all that stuff,\n\n253\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.450\nthat it should pass through that gateway,\nmoving through that doorway and\n\n254\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.990\nappearing on the other side of that device\nusing a publicly routeable IP address\n\n255\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.450\nthat will then take that information and\nmove it somewhere beyond our border and\n\n256\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.660\nhopefully bring it back again at\nsome point in the future, right?\n\n257\n00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.690\nCuz we would like to see it come back.\n\n258\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.160\nAnd as a result of that, we're able to\nthen extend our communication pathways so\n\n259\n00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.440\nwe can send and receive.\n\n260\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.720\nJust kind of what we do with that.\n\n261\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.750\nSo it's the circle of life when\nit comes to IP addressing, right?\n\n262\n00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.090\nSo we have our default gateways.\n\n263\n00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.779\nHere now, we don't have,\nlet me just actually scroll down here for\n\n264\n00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:33.720\none second, right here.\n\n265\n00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.000\nI don't have on APIPA based address\non any of these interfaces,\n\n266\n00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.372\nas you can see, they're just,\nyou got a variety of things.\n\n267\n00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:41.310\nYou do have some IPv6 addresses.\n\n268\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.596\nWe'll be coming back, talking about those\nin upcoming episodes in more detail.\n\n269\n00:13:44.596 --> 00:13:47.230\nBut I don't have any APIPA\nbased addresses right now.\n\n270\n00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.210\nBut what I can do is the following.\n\n271\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.228\nJust give me one second.\n\n272\n00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:53.300\nLet me just extend our\nlittle lab timer there.\n\n273\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.859\nWhat we can do is we\ncan come over here and\n\n274\n00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:04.426\nwe can take a look at our routing table.\n\n275\n00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.025\nAnd we can see,\njust on a Server 16 machine,\n\n276\n00:14:07.025 --> 00:14:10.530\nI'm just using one of the demo\nmachines that I've set up.\n\n277\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.730\nI'm gonna talk about routing\ntables in just a moment, but\n\n278\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.970\nif you take a look right here,\nI'll just highlight it so you can see it.\n\n279\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.025\nYou'll see that I do have an APIPA based\naddress assigned in my routing table on\n\n280\n00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:21.833\nthis machine.\n\n281\n00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:23.505\nThere's actually a couple of them.\n\n282\n00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:24.575\nI didn't highlight the whole block,\n\n283\n00:14:24.575 --> 00:14:28.225\nI just highlighted the unique\none that's assigned right here.\n\n284\n00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:31.757\nBut you can see the block 169254, right?\n\n285\n00:14:31.757 --> 00:14:36.497\nAnd you could see that as a result zero,\nzero all the way through 2255255.\n\n286\n00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:39.350\nThat's the block that\nallows us to use APIPA and\n\n287\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.499\nactually have an assignment made.\n\n288\n00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:47.133\nIt's a static route sitting in our\nrouting table there, as you can see.\n\n289\n00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:51.953\nAnd as a result, allows Windows, in\nthis case, Server 16, or any Windows box\n\n290\n00:14:51.953 --> 00:14:55.803\nto ultimately assign an IP address in\nthat range using that particular service.\n\n291\n00:14:55.803 --> 00:14:57.920\nSo we could see that it is provided for,\nand\n\n292\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.910\nwe would see addresses assigned if we did\nrun out of IP addresses for some reason.\n\n293\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.980\nDHCP stopped leasing,\nany number of things could go wrong there.\n\n294\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.640\nWe would get a private IP address or an\nautomatically assigned private IP address,\n\n295\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.160\nwhat we call an APIPA address.\n\n296\n00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Now, that would also still fall\nunder that private categorization.\n\n297\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.450\nAnd then, also,\nother operating systems do this as well,\n\n298\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.040\nbut the term APIPA is a Microsoft term.\n\n299\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.870\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\nThis is not a Microsoft specific\n\n300\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.190\ntechnology, it's just\n\n301\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.060\nwe call the implementation of it in\nMicrosoft automatic private IP addressing.\n\n302\n00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.000\nBut the general idea is applied in\nevery networking stack on the planet\n\n303\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.780\npretty much in one form or another.\n\n304\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.320\nIt's just a matter of what the vendor\nwould specify that technology as being or\n\n305\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.920\nwhat the operating system calls it,\nhowever you want to think of it that way.\n\n306\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.200\nBut absolutely correct.\n\n307\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.380\nAwesome to bring that up,\nvery important for us to remember that.\n\n308\n00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.800\nSo, thank you very much, appreciate it.\n\n309\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.184\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; You're always there with that\n\n310\n00:15:46.184 --> 00:15:47.929\nhelpful hint whenever we need it,\nthat's awesome.\n\n311\n00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:51.284\nSo we did talk about numbers of subnets,\nand\n\n312\n00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:57.104\nI mentioned that we could take a look at\nAnd think about the logic of subnets.\n\n313\n00:15:57.104 --> 00:16:01.374\nAnd I just wanted to show you here the\nidea behind, as we take a certain number\n\n314\n00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:05.466\nof bits and we assign it, how we get\na certain number of subnets, right?\n\n315\n00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:08.570\nThis is also something which we wanna\nthink about and just be aware of.\n\n316\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.245\nThink through the logic of all the\ndifferent pieces that we're talking about.\n\n317\n00:16:11.245 --> 00:16:13.000\nThis helps us to understand that.\n\n318\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.430\nWhen we're thinking about the formula\nhere, we're thinking about 2 to the 1st,\n\n319\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.762\n2 to the 2nd, 2 to the 3rd, so\nit's just how we would specify, or\n\n320\n00:16:21.762 --> 00:16:26.090\nwrite it, in this case, because, well,\nExcel doesn't write it that way, normally.\n\n321\n00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.210\nSo that's how we normally\nwill see it written.\n\n322\n00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.200\nBut more importantly, in all honesty, you\nwill see it in most network documentation.\n\n323\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.370\nThis is how we actually\nrepresent that idea.\n\n324\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.220\nSo we see 2 kind of up arrow,\na little caret 6.\n\n325\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.590\nThat means 2 to the 6th, right?\n\n326\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.310\nFor the formula, or a total of 2\nraised to the 6th power, right?\n\n327\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.285\nOr a total of 64 subnets that we would\nultimately get, cuz we're using six bits.\n\n328\n00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:50.610\nSo just wanna think about\nthe logic of how we write that.\n\n329\n00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.917\nBecause a lot of times you will see\nthe formula representing a shorthand for\n\n330\n00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:54.979\nthe number of subnets.\n\n331\n00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:58.911\nSomebody will say I have 2 to the 4th,\nand that's really 16 subnets.\n\n332\n00:16:58.911 --> 00:16:59.986\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n333\n00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:01.946\nNow, if you're not familiar with that or\n\n334\n00:17:01.946 --> 00:17:05.475\nyou just need a little refresher just go\nlook up power of twos, or a table for\n\n335\n00:17:05.475 --> 00:17:09.190\npower of twos and you'll find at least\nthe first eight of them anyway, right?\n\n336\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.517\n2 to the 6th, 2 to the 7th, 2 to the 8th,\nall the way through all the bits,\n\n337\n00:17:12.517 --> 00:17:15.824\nall the way up to 256, you'll actually\nfind them just represented there.\n\n338\n00:17:15.824 --> 00:17:17.403\nBut you will be able to see them.\n\n339\n00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.205\nIf you go out to the web and\njust Google for\n\n340\n00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.940\nit you'll find the table that\nwill show you the first eight.\n\n341\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.800\nAnd that's all we're concerned about for\nIPv4.\n\n342\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.410\nThere obviously are concerns and\nconsiderations for other systems, for\n\n343\n00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:27.960\nother things.\n\n344\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.800\nBut we're really just\nfocusing on the IPv4,\n\n345\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.820\nand remember the thought process being\nthe eight bits that we're working with.\n\n346\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.752\nSo Cherokee you wanted to-\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n347\n00:17:34.752 --> 00:17:37.291\nYeah, no, I'm just thinking it's\nreally great to think about\n\n348\n00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:40.692\nthe power of twos there, because like you\nhad said, these numbers, they do come up.\n\n349\n00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:43.924\nAnd that's simply because if\nwe're thinking about binary,\n\n350\n00:17:43.924 --> 00:17:48.026\nbase two numbering system, you look at\nyour storage spaces, your RAM sizes,\n\n351\n00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:52.437\nand by using that chart that's an easy way\nto kind of, you start seeing the pattern,\n\n352\n00:17:52.437 --> 00:17:54.824\nlike we're in the matrix or\nsomething Adam.\n\n353\n00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:55.324\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n354\n00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:56.845\n&gt;&gt; It could be.\n\n355\n00:17:56.845 --> 00:17:58.371\nYeah, let's look at some more of\n\n356\n00:17:58.371 --> 00:17:59.725\nthe matrix, shall we?\n&gt;&gt; Double them up, yeah.\n\n357\n00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:00.387\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n358\n00:18:00.387 --> 00:18:04.534\nwe'll talk about incrementing here between\nsubnets or the increment between addresses\n\n359\n00:18:04.534 --> 00:18:08.420\nin just a minute, but let's, I know I\nmentioned supernets before we got started.\n\n360\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.425\nYou were like, supernets, that's super.\n\n361\n00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:12.640\nExactly, literally, that's what she said,\n\n362\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.950\nso let's talk about supernets for\njust a minute.\n\n363\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.790\nSo when we think about supernets, it's\n\n364\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.021\nalso kind of a cool thing with subnets.\nWe talk about being able to do bit\n\n365\n00:18:20.021 --> 00:18:22.899\nborrowing, I think that's actually the\nterm that you and I were talking about,\n\n366\n00:18:22.899 --> 00:18:24.423\nand you mentioned you\ncould borrow bits but\n\n367\n00:18:24.423 --> 00:18:25.808\nyou don't give them back.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:26.794\n&gt;&gt; Right, you talked about that in\n\n369\n00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:29.206\nthe last episode.\nAnd so, when we think about borrowing\n\n370\n00:18:29.206 --> 00:18:33.197\nbits, right, what we really are thinking\nabout is traditionally we'll take an IP\n\n371\n00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:36.860\naddress, right, and we can manipulate\nit through the use of a subnet mask.\n\n372\n00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.648\nWe haven't really talked about this logic\n\n373\n00:18:38.648 --> 00:18:43.011\nyet, but we've talked just generically.\nWe'll just go back here for just a minute.\n\n374\n00:18:43.011 --> 00:18:44.705\nWe talked generically about the default\n\n375\n00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:48.050\nsubnet mask.\nOkay, Class A default 8-bit subnet mask,\n\n376\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.870\nall 8 bits turned on for the network\nportion, other three octets all zeroes,\n\n377\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.480\nall bits turned off, host portion.\nSo 10.something, and\n\n378\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.037\nthe 10.something network, and 001,\n\n379\n00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:02.213\nour first host within that network.\nOkay, we get that, right?\n\n380\n00:19:02.213 --> 00:19:02.919\nWe've been through that,\n\n381\n00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:04.450\npretty straightforward, pretty easy.\nBut\n\n382\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:09.230\nwhat if we want to be able to say,\nI don't want a 255.000 subnet mask.\n\n383\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.220\nWhat if I want a custom subnet mask,\nright?\n\n384\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.990\nThat would be one thing we could do and\nyou're talking about borrowing bits.\n\n385\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.700\nWe could do 255.128.0.0, right?\n\n386\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n387\n00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.470\n&gt;&gt; Borrow the first bit of the next octet.\n\n388\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.075\n&gt;&gt; Being a rebel and breaking these\npredetermined classes for us.\n\n389\n00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:27.240\n&gt;&gt; Or being a subnet bit bank robber and\nstealing bits from the bank.\n\n390\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.190\nRight, we could do that as well.\n\n391\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.520\nSo however you think of it, right.\n\n392\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.770\nWe can actually literally go\nover here to this next octet and\n\n393\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.340\nstart chipping away at these bits and\nsaying I wanna put some 1s in there.\n\n394\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.520\nI wanna turn those on and I wanna use them\nand I want to assign them to the network.\n\n395\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.150\nPush them over to the left there, right?\n\n396\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.636\nGroup them with the other octet.\n\n397\n00:19:44.636 --> 00:19:48.821\nMake them red and\nas a result I'm gonna not have a /8.\n\n398\n00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:51.627\nMaybe I have a /9 or /10 or\nwhatever the case may be for\n\n399\n00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:53.970\nthe number of bits that are turned on.\n\n400\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.264\nAnd so if I do that for\nthe first two bits of the next octet,\n\n401\n00:19:57.264 --> 00:19:59.990\nI would have 255.192.0.0.\n\n402\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.490\nA custom subnet address or\na custom subnet mask.\n\n403\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.060\nAnd as a result, I would then start\nto tip the scales around this idea\n\n404\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.460\nof the number of hosts and\nnumber of networks, and\n\n405\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.195\nwe were talking a bit about this idea but\nhadn't really gotten Into it.\n\n406\n00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:14.685\nSo I can borrow bits, right?\n\n407\n00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:17.928\nNow I can do that at the expense\nof the host when I'm doing\n\n408\n00:20:17.928 --> 00:20:20.826\ntraditional subnet mask calculations and\nI wanna\n\n409\n00:20:20.826 --> 00:20:25.449\nget a custom subnet mask extending my\nnetworks at the expense of hosts, right?\n\n410\n00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:29.309\nThat's one way of doing this but\nI can also do what's called supernetting.\n\n411\n00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:33.042\nSupernetting combines different\nsmaller networks together for\n\n412\n00:20:33.042 --> 00:20:34.950\nme into a single larger network.\n\n413\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.530\nSo I can aggregate networks up.\n\n414\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.435\nBut I have to follow a very simple but\nvery important rule.\n\n415\n00:20:39.435 --> 00:20:42.940\nSupernetting can be done, but it can only\nbe done if the networks are contiguous.\n\n416\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.740\nPeople often don't realize or forget this.\n\n417\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.225\nSo if we have a, for\ninstance, 192.168.20.0 and\n\n418\n00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:53.542\nif we have 192.168.21.0\nas our two addresses,\n\n419\n00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:57.448\nif you think about the two\nnetworks that we're using.\n\n420\n00:20:57.448 --> 00:21:02.169\nSo 192.168.20 and 21.0/24, so\n\n421\n00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:06.128\ntraditional class C subnet mask, right?\n\n422\n00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:09.440\nThen those two networks are contiguous,\nthey're next to each other.\n\n423\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.720\nSequentially they're\nrelated to one another.\n\n424\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.553\nAnd as a result we can supernet them,\ncombine them together,\n\n425\n00:21:14.553 --> 00:21:15.971\nsmash them together, right,\n\n426\n00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:19.859\nessentially, and we get one large network\nout of two individual smaller networks.\n\n427\n00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:23.140\nSo we would then, no, you're not gonna\nbe able to ask anything until I'm done.\n\n428\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.167\nStop waving at me.\n\n429\n00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:26.490\nWe'll get to Cherokee's\nquestion in just one second.\n\n430\n00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.781\nI just want to make everybody\nis clear in the concept,\n\n431\n00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:29.490\nthen I wanna let you ask your question.\n\n432\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.690\nSo remember, we can do this but if they're\nnot contiguous we cannot supernet them.\n\n433\n00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.808\nSo if we had, for instance,\nin theory 192.168.32.0,\n\n434\n00:21:38.808 --> 00:21:41.997\nand 192.168.46.0, right?\n\n435\n00:21:41.997 --> 00:21:45.189\nThose two numbers cannot be supernetted\ntogether cuz what are we gonna do with\n\n436\n00:21:45.189 --> 00:21:46.600\nall the stuff in the middle?\n\n437\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.940\nWe're gonna jump over it.\n\n438\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.870\nHow do we combine those two over\nhere into one big network and\n\n439\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.470\nleave out everything in the middle, right?\n\n440\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.540\nThat would be the problem.\n\n441\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.090\nIf we wanted to smash them all together\nand make one big network out of,\n\n442\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:03.230\nwhat did I say, 32 to 46,\nout of 14 networks we could do that,\n\n443\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.800\nbut that's not the same thing\nas saying I just want 32 and\n\n444\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.290\n46 joined together,\nleaving out everything in between.\n\n445\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.640\nThat's the trick with supernetting.\n\n446\n00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.020\nWe gotta know that the networks\nhave to be contiguous.\n\n447\n00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.000\nSo, it's the exact opposite\nof subnetting right?\n\n448\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.850\nWhen we do supernetting, we allocate\nbits from the network ID to the host.\n\n449\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.810\nWe give them back in other words, right?\n\n450\n00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.108\nWe go the other way.\n\n451\n00:22:24.108 --> 00:22:27.250\nRight, we're getting more hosts,\nbecause we're combining networks together.\n\n452\n00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.018\nThink about the logic,\nwith subnetting, I just explained,\n\n453\n00:22:30.018 --> 00:22:32.210\nis we borrow bits to create\ncustom subnet masks.\n\n454\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.724\nWe get more networks, right,\nat the expense of hosts.\n\n455\n00:22:35.724 --> 00:22:37.600\nSupernetting, the exact opposite.\n\n456\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.240\nWe have less networks, they're bigger,\nbut we get more hosts per network.\n\n457\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.934\nSo inverse, exact reverse or\n\n458\n00:22:42.934 --> 00:22:46.942\nthink about them as being mirrored\nopposites of one another, right?\n\n459\n00:22:46.942 --> 00:22:48.006\nOkay, now.\n\n460\n00:22:48.006 --> 00:22:49.765\n&gt;&gt; So, I know-\n&gt;&gt; You've been so patient.\n\n461\n00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:51.170\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm trying.\n\n462\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.520\n&gt;&gt; You're like jumping up and down.\n\n463\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.420\n&gt;&gt; Over here, over here.\n\n464\n00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Fidgeting, you're like me,\nme, pick me, pick me.\n\n465\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:56.720\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n466\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.870\n&gt;&gt; No, I just was thinking,\n\n467\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.790\nIt's kind of interesting when we\nthink about the use of subnetting and\n\n468\n00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.650\nsupernetting, and sometimes you might\neven hear terms like route summarization.\n\n469\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.617\nWhy do we do this to help\nspeed up our networks?\n\n470\n00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:09.830\nWhy do we even subnet?\n\n471\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.320\nAnd so I was just kind of thinking,\nshould we talk about that or\n\n472\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.461\nis that kind of like a pre-this\nseries conversation?\n\n473\n00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've talked a little bit about\nit already in the sense that there may be\n\n474\n00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.174\na need to extend our traditional\nallocation of either networks or hosts.\n\n475\n00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:30.320\nYou can think of it either way,\njust depending on what we're doing, right?\n\n476\n00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.749\nAnd so, if we go back to the chart for\njust a minute where we just were,\n\n477\n00:23:33.749 --> 00:23:37.771\nif we look at this and we think about\nthe logic of, okay, I have 126 networks,\n\n478\n00:23:37.771 --> 00:23:42.714\npotentially, let's just say, in a Class A\ndefault network, 255.0.0.0 for a subnet.\n\n479\n00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:44.169\nSo I have one network called one.\n\n480\n00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:47.966\nI hae a separate network called, or\nstarted with the octet value of two.\n\n481\n00:23:47.966 --> 00:23:49.808\nAnother one started with\nan octet value of three, etc.\n\n482\n00:23:49.808 --> 00:23:52.084\nIf we just think about,\nThe logic of that, right?\n\n483\n00:23:52.084 --> 00:23:56.521\nAnd each one of them is gonna\nhave approximately 17 million,\n\n484\n00:23:56.521 --> 00:24:03.552\n16.7 million hosts from 001, usable,\nright, all the way up to 255.255.254,\n\n485\n00:24:03.552 --> 00:24:07.672\nso 10.001.002.003, etcetera, right?\n\n486\n00:24:07.672 --> 00:24:09.680\nAnd each one roughly has that amount.\n\n487\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.590\nWell, that's great if I have less than\n16.7 million hosts, right, in theory.\n\n488\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.420\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot, yeah\n&gt;&gt; And it is a lot, but\n\n489\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.506\nthere are networks that will\nhave more hosts than that.\n\n490\n00:24:19.506 --> 00:24:20.545\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that they need more.\n\n491\n00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:26.073\nAnd so we may need to extend, right,\nthe number of hosts that are available.\n\n492\n00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:28.425\nBecause we may have to add more,\nnow it's not as prevalent and\n\n493\n00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:29.735\nas common on a class A network.\n\n494\n00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:34.280\nCuz again, how many networks really\nhave 17 million hosts under management?\n\n495\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.100\nAnd I'm sure there are networks out there,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n496\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.750\nI've worked with customers that\nhave bigger than that in terms of\n\n497\n00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.720\nthe number of hosts.\n\n498\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.220\nI know they exist, but my point is,\nfor the average individual, for\n\n499\n00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.190\nany of you out there, for us,\nand traditional organization or\n\n500\n00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.930\nenterprise, we're probably thinking more\nalong the lines in the class C range\n\n501\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.690\nof having to get more addresses\nallocated out, right?\n\n502\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.870\nBecause we have only 254 hosts, that's\nprobably a better thought process for us,\n\n503\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.890\ncuz it's more realistic for the average\nenterprise to say, I need 500 hosts, but\n\n504\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.525\nI've only got 254 in my class C network.\n\n505\n00:25:04.525 --> 00:25:05.455\nWhat do I do?\n\n506\n00:25:05.455 --> 00:25:06.835\nWell then,\nI could either borrow some bits,\n\n507\n00:25:06.835 --> 00:25:10.615\ncreate a custom sub-net mask or\nI could do a variety of things.\n\n508\n00:25:10.615 --> 00:25:11.222\nI could super net.\n\n509\n00:25:11.222 --> 00:25:13.385\nThere's different ways\nthat I could approach it.\n\n510\n00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:17.075\nThe point is, it's driven by number one,\nyou have the needs of the customer or\n\n511\n00:25:17.075 --> 00:25:19.735\nthe needs of the enterprise,\nhowever you wanna think of that.\n\n512\n00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:23.860\nAnd it comes down to the idea we talked\nabout, not just here, we'll mention that.\n\n513\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.690\nWe mentioned it,\nyou've heard me mention it,\n\n514\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.660\ncertainly you've heard\nCherokee mention it.\n\n515\n00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.830\nAny of the host here at ITPro TV I know\nhave this conversations with Daniel,\n\n516\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.840\nwith Mike and everybody talks about it\nat some point in any of their shows.\n\n517\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.440\nThe idea of planning to be successful or\nplanning to fail.\n\n518\n00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.560\nYou can call it in different things, but\n\n519\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.080\nultimately the idea of understanding ahead\nof time what are needs are gonna be.\n\n520\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.766\nAnd I think it's a great conversation to\nhave, and i think the right time to have\n\n521\n00:25:46.766 --> 00:25:49.582\nit is, at some point in this\nkind of a conversation, right?\n\n522\n00:25:49.582 --> 00:25:54.422\nBecause it is important to understand\nthat we have to think ahead of the demand\n\n523\n00:25:54.422 --> 00:25:54.947\ncurve.\n\n524\n00:25:54.947 --> 00:25:58.682\nAnd that's essential with this kind of\nconversation to help us to do and say,\n\n525\n00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:02.359\nif I'm gonna be deploying multiple\nhosts and I'm using an internal private\n\n526\n00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:05.173\nclass C network,\nmaybe I need to modify that a little bit,\n\n527\n00:26:05.173 --> 00:26:08.104\nmake sure I have enough room,\nor maybe I should switch over,\n\n528\n00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:11.808\ncuz you see most companies, honestly,\nthey use class A private networks.\n\n529\n00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:14.035\nJust because they avoid this\nall together and say, yeah,\n\n530\n00:26:14.035 --> 00:26:16.444\nwe don't even wanna worry about\nhaving to do that whole, hey,\n\n531\n00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:18.830\nhow many bits do I have,\nhow many networks, ow many hosting?\n\n532\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.609\nLet's just use like a ridiculous range and\nwe're never gonna run out of room, right?\n\n533\n00:26:22.609 --> 00:26:26.720\nBecause we have this beautiful thing\ncalled matting, which we'll talk about at\n\n534\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.710\nsome point later which allows us to hide\nthose private internal IP addresses,\n\n535\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.277\nlink them through a gateway to external\npublic routed IPs that present\n\n536\n00:26:34.277 --> 00:26:37.964\nthe opportunity in a very specified and\ncontrolled way to give just one or\n\n537\n00:26:37.964 --> 00:26:41.070\ntwo IP addresses that you used for\nall communication.\n\n538\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.370\nAnd everything internally\nis hidden from view.\n\n539\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.786\nSo let's just use 16.7 million and\nhave an IP party and\n\n540\n00:26:46.786 --> 00:26:48.971\nwe don't have to worry about it,\n[CROSSTALK] right?\n\n541\n00:26:48.971 --> 00:26:51.726\nSo it's a question of just doing\nan assessment up front and\n\n542\n00:26:51.726 --> 00:26:54.385\nreally thinking through the logic,\nhow many do I need?\n\n543\n00:26:54.385 --> 00:27:00.305\nNow, in certain cases, you go ahead and\nsay, I only need 200 or I need 500.\n\n544\n00:27:00.305 --> 00:27:03.049\nThis is where you're gonna\nstart actually getting into,\n\n545\n00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:04.904\ndo I need public IP addresses, right?\n\n546\n00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:07.514\nBecause then, we gotta pay for\nthose IP addresses, right?\n\n547\n00:27:07.514 --> 00:27:08.310\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; Traditionally,\n\n548\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.340\nalmost without exception.\n\n549\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.840\nWe gotta pay for them and as a result,\n\n550\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.460\nwe really have to be a little bit more\naware, a little bit more focused on, hey,\n\n551\n00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.430\nwhat do I really need and\nhow many am I gonna consume.\n\n552\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.230\nThis is why your ISP,\nyour internet service provider,\n\n553\n00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:25.050\nright traditionally lets you only\nhave one or maybe two IP addresses\n\n554\n00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.350\nwhen you get your cable service or\nyour internet service, cable service, etc.\n\n555\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.500\nUsually all bundled these days together.\n\n556\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.800\nAnd you get that from them.\n\n557\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.386\nAnd they give you the DSL or cable modem\nbox or whatever they give you these days.\n\n558\n00:27:36.386 --> 00:27:40.609\nAnd you hook it up, and they give you one,\nmaybe two public IP addresses,\n\n559\n00:27:40.609 --> 00:27:42.877\ndepending on what you're paying for.\n\n560\n00:27:42.877 --> 00:27:45.090\nYou can get more of course,\nbut you've gotta pay for them.\n\n561\n00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.360\nBut with your basic service usually,\nyou get one.\n\n562\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.780\nAnd that's usually assigned through DHCP,\n\n563\n00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.440\nbecause they're the only one who'll\nlet you have it grudgingly for\n\n564\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.690\nthe absolute bare minimum\namount of time you need it for.\n\n565\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.826\nThe minute you shut that device down or\nstop using it,\n\n566\n00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:58.303\nthey're gonna yanking away from\nyou until you need it again.\n\n567\n00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:01.483\nBut they're gonna give you that IP and\nthat's gonna be used for\n\n568\n00:28:01.483 --> 00:28:05.563\nall your outbound communication, going\nout of the box, out of the gateway, and\n\n569\n00:28:05.563 --> 00:28:09.404\nall of the inbound coming back, referred\nto for all of the machines inside.\n\n570\n00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:12.992\nWe're gonna NAP that,\nwe're gonna address translate that, and\n\n571\n00:28:12.992 --> 00:28:15.500\nhide that private internal\nIP address range.\n\n572\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.359\nYou're probably using a 192 or a 10 dot\nrange at home most likely, 192.168, right?\n\n573\n00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:23.176\nSo we all do this right,\nyou should be like the cool kids.\n\n574\n00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:26.170\nEverybody's doing it,\nyou should come do it too, right?\n\n575\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:26.770\nBe cool.\n\n576\n00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.806\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n&gt;&gt; Be like us right?\n\n577\n00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so that's what's happening,\n\n578\n00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.580\nthat's what's going on, right?\n\n579\n00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.044\nSo that's really the conversation that\nwe would have, right, traditionally, and\n\n580\n00:28:34.044 --> 00:28:35.642\nit's never a bad idea to bring that up.\n\n581\n00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:38.410\nI mean, it's always a good idea to make\nsure we're comfortable with the logic of\n\n582\n00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.031\nhow things work.\n\n583\n00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:42.349\nSo never be ashamed to ask why is what I\ntell my students, and you shouldn't be\n\n584\n00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:45.617\neither, because it's really important\nto challenge those assumptions,\n\n585\n00:28:45.617 --> 00:28:48.700\nmake sure you understand the logic of\nwhy we do things and how we do them.\n\n586\n00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.070\nIt's very, very important.\n\n587\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.440\nSo we've got the idea of supernetting.\n\n588\n00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.552\nI just wanna throw that out there and\nmake sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n589\n00:28:53.552 --> 00:28:57.274\nHow do we actually go in and\nuse the command line to do some of this\n\n590\n00:28:57.274 --> 00:29:00.438\naddressing, and\nI wanna talk a bit about metastage,\n\n591\n00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:03.622\nwanna talk a bit about PowerShell,\nand Server 16.\n\n592\n00:29:03.622 --> 00:29:06.539\nYou hear me mention PowerShell\nall the time, on Microsoft side,\n\n593\n00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:08.450\nanyone if we're doing these shows.\n\n594\n00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.450\nI'm a big fan, big advocate,\nbig user of the tool.\n\n595\n00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.540\nI think it's definitely something you\nwanna be more familiar with as an IT\n\n596\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.560\nprofessional.\n\n597\n00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.740\nI think it's important for\n\n598\n00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.870\nyou to be comfortable with\nthe logic of how this tool works.\n\n599\n00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.520\nJust extending our timer here and\nI think it's important for\n\n600\n00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.950\nyou to be comfortable in both\nthe traditional command line.\n\n601\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.040\nAnd you could see how that appear, we're\njust taking a look at our IP address and\n\n602\n00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.410\nwhere we were few minutes ago.\n\n603\n00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.630\nAnd I also think it's important for you\nto be comfortable in PowerShell, right,\n\n604\n00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.480\nbecause I think both of\nthem are equally valuable.\n\n605\n00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.150\nThe command line is always gonna be there.\n\n606\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.530\nIt hasn't really ever gone away despite\neverybody's threatening to get rid of it,\n\n607\n00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.650\ndespite everybody complaining about it.\n\n608\n00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.270\nYou see it's still there, but\n\n609\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.390\nPowerShell has really become\nthat new standard for it.\n\n610\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.920\nSo the nice thing about PowerShell,\npeople don't often realize this.\n\n611\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.890\nYou could do just about any you could\ndo from a command line in PowerShell.\n\n612\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.080\nWe support all the tools that\nyou would wanna run there.\n\n613\n00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.586\nSo ping, ipconfig, tracert,\npathping, whatever the tools maybe.\n\n614\n00:30:07.586 --> 00:30:11.100\nYou could run them from PowerShell, but\nyou can also do a lot of other stuff that\n\n615\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.410\ntraditional command line\nwill not let you do.\n\n616\n00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.199\nAll the commandlets that you always refer\nto and talk about are supported with\n\n617\n00:30:17.199 --> 00:30:20.823\nPowerShell, but they're not supported\nin a traditional command line.\n\n618\n00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:23.759\nSo to that end, and\nI often talk about commandlets,\n\n619\n00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:27.362\nI've put out there during shows,\nput them in the units for you,\n\n620\n00:30:27.362 --> 00:30:31.101\nhave a whole bunch of them scatter\nthroughout all these units, for\n\n621\n00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:35.693\nall the episodes we're going through\naround networking with Server 2016.\n\n622\n00:30:35.693 --> 00:30:38.466\nBut a lot of times, it's kinda taken for\ngranted the fact that we say,\n\n623\n00:30:38.466 --> 00:30:40.497\nhey I've got a PowerShell and\ntype the command in.\n\n624\n00:30:40.497 --> 00:30:41.658\nBut I often stop and wonder, and\n\n625\n00:30:41.658 --> 00:30:44.241\nI often think about which one to take\nto the time and do with you here now.\n\n626\n00:30:44.241 --> 00:30:46.120\nDo you really know what the command does?\n\n627\n00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.460\nWe tell you about it,\nwe tell you where to go look it up online.\n\n628\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.790\nBut do you know you could get help for\nit right in PowerShell itself?\n\n629\n00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.820\nIt's always good to know how to find help.\n\n630\n00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.910\nAnd so, I wanted to show you\nthat before we actually take\n\n631\n00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.360\na look at the commands here.\n\n632\n00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.715\nGet help and followed by whatever\nthe name of the commandlet is for\n\n633\n00:30:59.715 --> 00:31:03.436\nany command that you wanna see,\nassuming that a module is loaded that has\n\n634\n00:31:03.436 --> 00:31:07.218\nthe commandlet already available will\nprovide the help for you locally.\n\n635\n00:31:07.218 --> 00:31:08.664\nNow, the first time you do this,\n\n636\n00:31:08.664 --> 00:31:11.715\nactually, depending on the last time\nyou used PowerShell whether you\n\n637\n00:31:11.715 --> 00:31:14.675\nhave ever done it or not,\nyou may actually get something like this.\n\n638\n00:31:14.675 --> 00:31:17.726\nSo I'm just gonna go\nback up here real quick.\n\n639\n00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:20.700\nI did this before and I did it ahead\nof time because it takes a few minutes\n\n640\n00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.272\nthe first time to do this and\nI don't want you to have to sit and\n\n641\n00:31:23.272 --> 00:31:26.316\nwatch while we go out to the web and\ndownload all the updated help files.\n\n642\n00:31:26.316 --> 00:31:28.665\nBut the first time you do this,\nyou'll get prompted for it,\n\n643\n00:31:28.665 --> 00:31:29.829\ndo you wanna run update help?\n\n644\n00:31:29.829 --> 00:31:33.100\nMeaning, should we go out, assuming you're\nconnected to the internet, of course.\n\n645\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.550\nSo make sure that is the case.\n\n646\n00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.572\nAnd you want to pull down and\n\n647\n00:31:35.572 --> 00:31:38.518\nlook for all the latest help files that\nmay or may not already be on your system.\n\n648\n00:31:38.518 --> 00:31:40.709\nAnd you got some choices here, right?\n\n649\n00:31:40.709 --> 00:31:45.608\nYou'll see right there, I just went ahead,\nyou'll see I chose y for yes, right?\n\n650\n00:31:45.608 --> 00:31:49.008\nAnd so I did that and then it goes out,\nand you're probably seeing that progress\n\n651\n00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:52.663\nbar in PowerShell, the green window opens\nup, the yellow little circles Go across,\n\n652\n00:31:52.663 --> 00:31:55.487\nso it's downloading all the help\nfiles does that the first time.\n\n653\n00:31:55.487 --> 00:31:58.569\nAnd then once, it's done displays\nthe help files for you and\n\n654\n00:31:58.569 --> 00:32:01.789\nsee New-NetIPAddress creates and\nconfigures an IP address.\n\n655\n00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:06.127\nSo one of the new PowerShell cmdlets\nthat's available to you in server 16 or\n\n656\n00:32:06.127 --> 00:32:08.300\n2016 is the New-NetIPAddress.\n\n657\n00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.768\nAnd you could go in you could use this and\nyou could see the syntax there.\n\n658\n00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:13.367\nIt's a little bit hard to see,\ncan we go full screen?\n\n659\n00:32:13.367 --> 00:32:15.885\nCuz I'm covering like part\nof that whole thing, but\n\n660\n00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:17.725\nyou could see there the syntax for it.\n\n661\n00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:23.453\nSo new NetIP address, then IP address then\nyou would specify maybe address family.\n\n662\n00:32:23.453 --> 00:32:29.195\nIPv4 and IPv6, you could see how that\nwould be supported CIM is supported\n\n663\n00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:34.684\nthere if you wanna use CIM or the WMI\nequivalent in Windows of CIM is WMI.\n\n664\n00:32:34.684 --> 00:32:39.575\nCIM session, common information management\nmodule that allows us to go out and\n\n665\n00:32:39.575 --> 00:32:41.187\naccess the object class.\n\n666\n00:32:41.187 --> 00:32:44.795\nAnd be able to then work with hardware and\ninteract with it and\n\n667\n00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:46.932\nprovide all sorts of information.\n\n668\n00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:51.926\nWe have our default gateway,\nour policy store, our preferred lifetime.\n\n669\n00:32:51.926 --> 00:32:55.868\nAll sorts of switches and\navailable items can be configured here.\n\n670\n00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:59.106\nAnd the nice thing about this is\nwhen you look at the help file,\n\n671\n00:32:59.106 --> 00:33:00.552\nget a little description.\n\n672\n00:33:00.552 --> 00:33:04.664\nAnd this is just the basic get help,\nthis is not the advanced or detailed help.\n\n673\n00:33:04.664 --> 00:33:06.993\nAnd I'll talk about other help\noptions here in a minute.\n\n674\n00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:10.161\nBut you'll see we just get a very basic\noverview description, nothing fancy.\n\n675\n00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:15.109\nNow if you wanna go ahead and you actually\nwant to get some additional help.\n\n676\n00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:18.504\nWell take a look, you could do get\nhelp cmdlet and then examples,\n\n677\n00:33:18.504 --> 00:33:22.825\nno quotes by the way, the quotes are just\nto represent the command in the help file,\n\n678\n00:33:22.825 --> 00:33:24.344\nyou don't need the quotes.\n\n679\n00:33:24.344 --> 00:33:27.207\nIf you do that,\nyou'll actually get six, seven, eight,\n\n680\n00:33:27.207 --> 00:33:31.130\nten depending on the health file options\nthat shows you the syntax, right?\n\n681\n00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.781\nSo actually be able to do that,\nif take a look and get help new IP detail.\n\n682\n00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:37.777\nYou'll get a detail,\nbut not full help file.\n\n683\n00:33:37.777 --> 00:33:40.589\nThere's different variations here,\nfull gives you everything and\n\n684\n00:33:40.589 --> 00:33:42.100\nif you always want to see the latest.\n\n685\n00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.225\nAssuming you connected online,\njust do the online switch and\n\n686\n00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.917\nthat will take you out to the web.\n\n687\n00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:50.930\nAnd that will let you see whatever the\nmost recent updated version of this is.\n\n688\n00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.100\nWe always go out to the web, we try to\ntake you out to the web when we do this.\n\n689\n00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.892\nShow you the web page,\ngive you the reference.\n\n690\n00:33:55.892 --> 00:33:59.797\nCuz you know things change from time to\ntime, and you want to know that, right?\n\n691\n00:33:59.797 --> 00:34:02.420\nBut you can go in here, right?\n\n692\n00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:09.435\nDo online, and then you'll notice it\njust triggers the browser, right?\n\n693\n00:34:09.435 --> 00:34:13.607\nGoes out, loads up the web page for us,\nyou'll see it's resolving right there.\n\n694\n00:34:13.607 --> 00:34:15.440\nIt's the first time I'm using\nthe browser and the machine.\n\n695\n00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.110\nSo normally you won't get that\nunless you have already set that up.\n\n696\n00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.165\nYou'll see it and\nthen you'll see New-NetIPAddress.\n\n697\n00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:25.369\nAnd it just takes us out to the TechNet\nwebsite with in this case whatever\n\n698\n00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:27.978\nthe cmdlet is and querying for New-NetIP.\n\n699\n00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:32.313\nBut you'll see server 12r2\nWindows 8.1 as well as server 16.\n\n700\n00:34:32.313 --> 00:34:35.312\nSo this is not new new, but\nthis is a relatively new cmdlets and\n\n701\n00:34:35.312 --> 00:34:38.961\nthat's part of the overall networking\ncmdlets that are available to you.\n\n702\n00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:42.462\nAnd to that end when you\nwanna take a look, right?\n\n703\n00:34:42.462 --> 00:34:45.843\nIf you wanna go out and take a look for\nall of the network commands,\n\n704\n00:34:45.843 --> 00:34:48.565\nthat are supported in\nServer 16 with PowerShell.\n\n705\n00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:51.297\nNetTCPIP is the module.\n\n706\n00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:54.048\nRemember we talked about the idea\nof a PowerShell of modules.\n\n707\n00:34:54.048 --> 00:34:57.240\nThis is block of all the cmdlets\nput together, that's imported or\n\n708\n00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.016\npreloaded into PowerShell for you.\n\n709\n00:34:59.016 --> 00:35:02.208\nYou've heard me talk about them in\nvarious shows for various things.\n\n710\n00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:05.998\nThe NetTCIP Module is the one that\nsupports all the networking, and\n\n711\n00:35:05.998 --> 00:35:09.407\nyou'll see relatively recent\ninformation there, right?\n\n712\n00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:12.510\nApril 3 of 2017, wouldn't it be\ngreat if it was April 1st of 2017,\n\n713\n00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.869\nApril Fool's Day for 2017.\n\n714\n00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:15.061\n&gt;&gt; It's just a joke.\n\n715\n00:35:15.061 --> 00:35:15.667\n&gt;&gt; It's just a joke, right?\n\n716\n00:35:15.667 --> 00:35:17.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you'll see here,\n\n717\n00:35:17.522 --> 00:35:20.840\nthat when we load this up,\ngo to this particular website,\n\n718\n00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.107\nthis show us every command\nthat is currently supported.\n\n719\n00:35:24.107 --> 00:35:27.510\nAs I'm just scrolling down,\nyou'll see them all here, right?\n\n720\n00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.582\nAnd on the nice thing about this is I can\nclick through any one of these commands\n\n721\n00:35:31.582 --> 00:35:34.353\njust like the New-NetIPAddress\nthat we looked at.\n\n722\n00:35:34.353 --> 00:35:36.675\nAnd see the detail page I was\njust showing you for each and\n\n723\n00:35:36.675 --> 00:35:37.920\nevery one of these commands.\n\n724\n00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.394\nSo you're able to go in and see that\nall here, and you can interact with it.\n\n725\n00:35:41.394 --> 00:35:44.646\nAnd so\nPowerShell would allow you to do this,\n\n726\n00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:47.734\nif you wanna see what\nthis would look like.\n\n727\n00:35:47.734 --> 00:35:49.541\nLet's go into PowerShell real quick,\n\n728\n00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:51.683\nlet me just type in\na command line here for you.\n\n729\n00:35:51.683 --> 00:35:56.907\nAnd show you very quickly what\nwe would do inside PowerShell.\n\n730\n00:35:56.907 --> 00:35:59.500\nJust clear the screen here real quick,\nso you could see this.\n\n731\n00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.512\nSo let me just scroll down here, so that\nI can get the right information for you.\n\n732\n00:36:04.512 --> 00:36:09.009\nSo New-Net, oops, yeah, IP and\nthe nice thing about PowerShell,\n\n733\n00:36:09.009 --> 00:36:11.191\nI've talked about this before.\n\n734\n00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:13.476\nYou just saw that you didn't have\nto type in the whole command.\n\n735\n00:36:13.476 --> 00:36:17.070\nI just started to typing that's the point\nwere I new more or less the auto tab or\n\n736\n00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.745\ntab complete function would work.\n\n737\n00:36:18.745 --> 00:36:20.816\nAnd I just be able to hit tab key,\nand it completes for me.\n\n738\n00:36:20.816 --> 00:36:24.876\nAnd so it's nice because it will add in\nall those things, and all about spelling\n\n739\n00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:28.402\nand correcting which is great for\nme cuz I can't type to save my life.\n\n740\n00:36:28.402 --> 00:36:31.522\nAnd so you just wanna think about that,\nbut that's nice, right?\n\n741\n00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:37.405\nSo then we can do\ninterface alias right here.\n\n742\n00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:39.159\nLet me just bring this down\njust a smidge because-\n\n743\n00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:40.651\n&gt;&gt; All the little shortcuts are nice,\n\n744\n00:36:40.651 --> 00:36:41.452\nlike the up arrow.\n\n745\n00:36:41.452 --> 00:36:43.698\n&gt;&gt; Just so you could see that, cuz it's\nkind of up underneath that blue square.\n\n746\n00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:44.302\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of hard to see.\n\n747\n00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:47.744\nSo interface alias, this is going\nto let me name the interface.\n\n748\n00:36:47.744 --> 00:36:52.809\nSo I'll put this in,\nlet's call this ITPro.TV.\n\n749\n00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:58.539\nLet's say LAN, whoops, LAN 2 or\nwhatever I wanna call it.\n\n750\n00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:00.752\nThat will become the name of my interface,\n\n751\n00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:03.829\nso you know how you give\na network card name traditionally.\n\n752\n00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:05.220\nThat's what's it's gonna be,\nthat's what I'm doing.\n\n753\n00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.124\nInterface alias lets me\nname the interface, right?\n\n754\n00:37:08.124 --> 00:37:11.761\nSo I've got that then I have to specify\nmy IP address, whatever I wanna do, okay,\n\n755\n00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:12.360\nno problem.\n\n756\n00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.237\n&gt;&gt; IP address right there,\nthis is an IPv4 cmdlet.\n\n757\n00:37:16.237 --> 00:37:19.528\nSo I'm using it for\nIPv4 and or IPv6, my choice.\n\n758\n00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:23.880\nBut I'm gonna make it an IPv4 address, so\nI'm gonna put in whatever address I want.\n\n759\n00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.602\nLet's do a class A address of 10.1.0.10,\n\n760\n00:37:28.602 --> 00:37:31.508\nlet's say, hypothetically.\n\n761\n00:37:31.508 --> 00:37:33.250\nThat's gonna be my IP address.\n\n762\n00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.550\nNow what about my subnet mask?\n\n763\n00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:40.110\nWell prefix length is what I'm gonna do\nfor our subnet mask or for our length,\n\n764\n00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.120\nand the number of bits that we wanna use.\n\n765\n00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.052\nSo we can go ahead and\nput in prefix length, if we want to.\n\n766\n00:37:46.052 --> 00:37:49.682\nPrefix length just have that there, but\n\n767\n00:37:49.682 --> 00:37:55.144\nwe can specify what we want for\nwhat whatever it will be, 8.\n\n768\n00:37:55.144 --> 00:37:56.761\nLet's say 16, 24,\n\n769\n00:37:56.761 --> 00:38:02.154\nI'll just put in 24 that means we\nare gonna have the 10.1.0 as our network.\n\n770\n00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:05.928\nAnd the 10 as our host IP,\nhost address rather at the end of that.\n\n771\n00:38:05.928 --> 00:38:11.255\nSo we're gonna set that up,\nlet's do our default gateway and\n\n772\n00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:14.620\nso we'll specify default gateway.\n\n773\n00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.768\nNotice I'm typing this all on this one\nline even though it's truncating and\n\n774\n00:38:17.768 --> 00:38:19.601\nwrapping it, it is all one string, right?\n\n775\n00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:21.630\nWe're putting that end's default gateway.\n\n776\n00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.014\nSo our default gateway is gonna be\nagain make sure it's on the same\n\n777\n00:38:25.014 --> 00:38:26.559\nnetwork obviously, right?\n\n778\n00:38:26.559 --> 00:38:28.527\nSo that would be important.\n\n779\n00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:32.496\nIt's 10.1.0.1 that would be our default\ngateway on the same address and\n\n780\n00:38:32.496 --> 00:38:34.488\nthen we're on the same network rather.\n\n781\n00:38:34.488 --> 00:38:39.276\nIf I wanna set my DNS client server\naddress, I could actually do that as well.\n\n782\n00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:41.254\nI could set all sorts of stuff here,\nright?\n\n783\n00:38:41.254 --> 00:38:44.248\nAnd then if I hit Enter,\nit will go ahead and create that.\n\n784\n00:38:44.248 --> 00:38:48.407\nIt will give me a new interface\nassuming I'm successful called\n\n785\n00:38:48.407 --> 00:38:52.412\nITPRo.TV LAN2 assign\n10.1.0.10 address to it.\n\n786\n00:38:52.412 --> 00:38:56.230\nAnd give me a gateway of 10.1.01,\nthat's what it would do.\n\n787\n00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.696\nSo that's how we could use PowerShell,\nright?\n\n788\n00:38:58.696 --> 00:39:00.198\nJust to be able to set that up.\n\n789\n00:39:00.198 --> 00:39:04.222\nNow just before we wrap up cuz I wanna\ngroup PowerShell and Netsh together.\n\n790\n00:39:04.222 --> 00:39:06.150\nSo let's just take\na look quickly at Netsh.\n\n791\n00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.048\nAnother way of doing this is with\nthe same idea, just minimize here.\n\n792\n00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:15.029\nAnd in our command line, we just scroll\ndown here and get past the routing table,\n\n793\n00:39:15.029 --> 00:39:16.799\njust kind of clear that out.\n\n794\n00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:22.455\nSo in command line, I will give\nyou some PowerShells by the way.\n\n795\n00:39:22.455 --> 00:39:24.808\nJust to take it I'll go to with\ndifferent interface to just to give you\n\n796\n00:39:24.808 --> 00:39:25.508\nthe same idea here.\n\n797\n00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:28.144\nNetsh, on Netsh, right?\n\n798\n00:39:28.144 --> 00:39:32.623\nNetwork shell, we can use and it's been\naround for some time as well, by the way.\n\n799\n00:39:32.623 --> 00:39:35.456\nLet me just bring this down, so\nyou can see that a little bit easier,\n\n800\n00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:36.512\nsee the command prompt.\n\n801\n00:39:36.512 --> 00:39:40.191\nNotice it opens up a separate\ncommand prompt inside that shell.\n\n802\n00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:44.606\nSo we're at the command prompt\nwhen we add in or specify Netsh.\n\n803\n00:39:44.606 --> 00:39:46.903\nWe hit Enter,\nwe're now at the Netsh prompt.\n\n804\n00:39:46.903 --> 00:39:53.765\nAnd Netsh is gonna allow me To be able to\ngo in, and be able to specify or go in.\n\n805\n00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:56.948\nAnd decide how I wanna add\nthe same kind of information or\n\n806\n00:39:56.948 --> 00:39:59.990\nessentially put in my\nnetworking information.\n\n807\n00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:03.156\nBut to do so\nusing the following commands instead,\n\n808\n00:40:03.156 --> 00:40:06.626\nessentially get to the same place,\nso inet sh, right?\n\n809\n00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:09.784\nI'm gonna type in interface.\n\n810\n00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:16.527\nAnd I'm gonna type in ipv4, again, ipv4.\n\n811\n00:40:16.527 --> 00:40:23.625\nAnd then I'm gonna type\nin set address name and\n\n812\n00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:29.087\nI'm gonna set that = ITPROTVLan.\n\n813\n00:40:29.087 --> 00:40:31.905\nAnd let's just do LAN 1 instead of LAN 2,\nright?\n\n814\n00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:35.200\nSo we did that, so we have ITPROTVLan 1.\n\n815\n00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.448\nI could put spaces in there if I\nwanted to, up to me to decide, right?\n\n816\n00:40:39.448 --> 00:40:41.827\nSo I can just do that,\nit's enclosed in a set of quotes, so\n\n817\n00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:44.270\nit's gonna treat it as a little strength.\n\n818\n00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:49.200\nAnd then specify source = static\nwere dynamics where we're gonna\n\n819\n00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.556\nget that from it's gonna\nbe static address.\n\n820\n00:40:52.556 --> 00:40:55.102\nI'm gonna specify my address,\nso addr = and\n\n821\n00:40:55.102 --> 00:40:58.521\nthen let's just use a different\naddress block for this one.\n\n822\n00:40:58.521 --> 00:41:01.860\nWe're not really gonna assign the address,\nwe're just gonna type it in so\n\n823\n00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.550\nyou can see it.\n\n824\n00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:06.526\nSo that's gonna be a class C, 172.16.0.10.\n\n825\n00:41:06.526 --> 00:41:09.801\nWe specify our mask,\nput our subnet mask in there.\n\n826\n00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:14.491\n255.255.0.0, traditional class C,\nor class B rather,\n\n827\n00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:20.330\nexcuse me, default subnet mask, and\nthen let's put our gateway in there.\n\n828\n00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:25.430\nSo I spelled that correctly gateway,\nyeah, gateway = and\n\n829\n00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:31.147\nlet's do 172.16.01,\nkeep track of all these numbers.\n\n830\n00:41:31.147 --> 00:41:35.291\nAnd so if I did this with inet sh,\nI would then be able to go ahead.\n\n831\n00:41:35.291 --> 00:41:40.531\nAnd I would be able to specify\nthat I would create the interface,\n\n832\n00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:44.730\ncall it for IPv4 ITProTVLan 1,\non the source.\n\n833\n00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.700\nThe address information,\nthe subnet mask and the gateway.\n\n834\n00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.292\nSo I could do this in either area, from\na command line, achieve the same results.\n\n835\n00:41:51.292 --> 00:41:54.888\nJust a question, how I choose to do it,\nbut don't fear the command line,\n\n836\n00:41:54.888 --> 00:41:56.164\ndon't fear PowerShell.\n\n837\n00:41:56.164 --> 00:41:59.822\nWe get real used to being able to go in\nGUI and type in an IP address, right?\n\n838\n00:41:59.822 --> 00:42:02.735\nI mean that's something that traditionally\nwe're real comfortable with,\n\n839\n00:42:02.735 --> 00:42:03.810\nall of us probably are.\n\n840\n00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.585\nI would think, and when I mean that,\ncan we go full screen for a second?\n\n841\n00:42:06.585 --> 00:42:09.208\nWhen I talk about that I mean,\ngo down here on your desktop,\n\n842\n00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:10.680\ngo to your network card, right?\n\n843\n00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.499\nWe're all used to doing this, go to Open\nNetwork Sharing or Open the Network and\n\n844\n00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:15.755\nSharing Center, right?\n\n845\n00:42:15.755 --> 00:42:19.901\nGo in change Adapter Settings\nto one of the two interfaces.\n\n846\n00:42:19.901 --> 00:42:24.357\nGo here, go to Properties, just like\nyou would do in any version of Windows,\n\n847\n00:42:24.357 --> 00:42:25.739\nthis hasn't changed.\n\n848\n00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:31.123\nGo here to IPv4, and we're all really used\nto coming in here and typing something in.\n\n849\n00:42:31.123 --> 00:42:34.502\nI mean that's pretty common and\npretty standard for most of us anyway.\n\n850\n00:42:34.502 --> 00:42:35.918\nBut it's no different, and\n\n851\n00:42:35.918 --> 00:42:39.550\nI don't wanna shortchange the fact you\ncould do it right here in the GUI.\n\n852\n00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.440\nThere's nothing wrong with that, a lot of\npeople are comfortable with it, it's fine.\n\n853\n00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.602\nBut all we're doing in the command line,\nwould Netsh for\n\n854\n00:42:44.602 --> 00:42:45.963\nall we're doing with PowerShell.\n\n855\n00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:50.571\nIt's simply just going through and filling\nin the text fields for all those boxes.\n\n856\n00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:54.240\nAnd providing the information in the\nscripted or cmdlet driven form that allows\n\n857\n00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.320\nus to drop those values in and\nspecify, that's all we're doing.\n\n858\n00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.994\n&gt;&gt; And Adam if we're working\nin a production environment,\n\n859\n00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.400\nwe may come across a core\ninstallation of servers.\n\n860\n00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.236\nSo then we might just need to\nknow how to do it that way.\n\n861\n00:43:05.236 --> 00:43:07.855\n&gt;&gt; We're a nano-version of-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's right, there we go.\n\n862\n00:43:07.855 --> 00:43:10.473\n&gt;&gt; 2016, as a matter of the things-\n&gt;&gt; I forgot about that, yeah.\n\n863\n00:43:10.473 --> 00:43:15.129\n&gt;&gt; One of the things we'll talk about,\nwhen we talk about setting up\n\n864\n00:43:15.129 --> 00:43:19.205\nyour DHCP and or DNS,\nis that we can run it on Nano Server.\n\n865\n00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:20.897\nAnd we'll actually talk\nabout how to do that.\n\n866\n00:43:20.897 --> 00:43:23.062\nI've got a little discussion coming up for\n\n867\n00:43:23.062 --> 00:43:27.340\nyou in an upcoming episode about the steps\ninvolved with configuring Nano Servers.\n\n868\n00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.133\nSo it's actually kinda cool-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n869\n00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:30.530\n&gt;&gt; But a Nano Server's just like core.\n\n870\n00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:34.610\nThe only difference is it's stripped down\neven smaller, less intrusive version in\n\n871\n00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.850\nterms of the footprint, that really just\nallows us to do this exact kind of thing.\n\n872\n00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.764\nSet up a machine, it's got a very\nlimited vision of what's it gonna do.\n\n873\n00:43:41.764 --> 00:43:45.360\nBut it's dedicated to one specific\nfunction or role, and just run that as\n\n874\n00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.910\na stand alone or off in the corner\ninstance as a virtual machine, right?\n\n875\n00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.829\nRunning as a VHD traditionally, and\nthat's what we're gonna do with Nano.\n\n876\n00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.787\nWe run them as virtual machines,\nso it could be that as well.\n\n877\n00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:56.893\n[CROSSTALK] Absolutely.\n\n878\n00:43:56.893 --> 00:43:59.325\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I think we are out\nof time for this particular episode.\n\n879\n00:43:59.325 --> 00:44:01.231\nDid you have any final thoughts,\nAdam or is that?\n\n880\n00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:02.693\n&gt;&gt; No, no, for now I think just again,\n\n881\n00:44:02.693 --> 00:44:05.823\njust wanna continue to build that\nincremental knowledge around networking.\n\n882\n00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:09.129\nTalked about some cmdlet options,\nand command line options.\n\n883\n00:44:09.129 --> 00:44:12.063\nI did wanna come back and\nwe will in our next episode,\n\n884\n00:44:12.063 --> 00:44:15.545\ntake a look at yet\nanother to interact with this information.\n\n885\n00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:17.038\nBut from a different perspective,\n\n886\n00:44:17.038 --> 00:44:19.238\nwe'll talk about routing\ntables a little bit more.\n\n887\n00:44:19.238 --> 00:44:22.171\nWe mentioned it, but I wanna show you\nanother way to look at routing tables that\n\n888\n00:44:22.171 --> 00:44:24.313\nyou may have forgotten about or\nmay not realize is there.\n\n889\n00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:28.336\nAnd it previews some of the features we'll\nsee coming up in later episodes around\n\n890\n00:44:28.336 --> 00:44:31.607\nVPNs and around direct access and\naround all sorts of cool stuff.\n\n891\n00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:35.314\nIf you haven't guessed what it is, it is\nthe routing number mode access console.\n\n892\n00:44:35.314 --> 00:44:36.906\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthat real quick as well.\n\n893\n00:44:36.906 --> 00:44:37.912\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n894\n00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:40.537\nThank you for joining us today, and\nthank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n895\n00:44:40.537 --> 00:44:41.305\njoining us as well.\n\n896\n00:44:41.305 --> 00:44:43.210\nBut for this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n897\n00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.976\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n898\n00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:45.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n899\n00:44:45.880 -->

00:00:12.006\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.505\nWelcome to your networking with Windows\nServer 2016 series, I'm your show host,\n\n5\n00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:17.428\nCherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:18.907\nSo we've made it to part 3,\n\n7\n00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:22.410\nwhere we're continuing to look\nat IP version 4 networks.\n\n8\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.797\nBack in studios with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.280\nThanks for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Great to be here as always.\n\n11\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.970\nContinuing our conversations\nassociated with IPv4.\n\n12\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.320\nWe've taken a look at many of\nthe building blocks and pieces,\n\n13\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.630\ntook a little detour into PowerShell and\nthe command line.\n\n14\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.840\nIn the last episode took a look\nat PowerShell cmdlets, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.030\nwe also took a look at Netsh and\n\n16\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.866\njust began to explore some of\nthe functionality we could find there.\n\n17\n00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.010\nSo I just wanted to remind you\nwith regards to Netsh by the way,\n\n18\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.340\njust take a look quickly on my machine.\n\n19\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.140\nI forgot to put this up\nin the last episode,\n\n20\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650\nbut as long as we get it in there\nsomewhere, I suppose it's good.\n\n21\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.260\nYou could see with Netsh that there\nis a list of all the commands that\n\n22\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.850\nare available on the web just like\nthere is for everything else.\n\n23\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.040\nAs we scroll down, you will see that\nNetsh has been around forever and\n\n24\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.880\na day by the way.\n\n25\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.500\nSo Netsh is not one of those new things.\n\n26\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.250\nNetsh has been around since NT4 and\nit's been around forever.\n\n27\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.770\nSo you can see here that we can go in and\n\n28\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.400\nwe could see all of the different\ncommands that are available.\n\n29\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.040\nAnd it's a very, very detailed tool\nthat lets us manage any and every aspect\n\n30\n00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.300\nof IP configuration interface management\nfor any interface on the system.\n\n31\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.805\nSo it would be worth your time\nto check it out real quick.\n\n32\n00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:31.128\nWe wanted to continue our\nconversation around a little bit of\n\n33\n00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:32.830\na different thought process.\n\n34\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.750\nI just wanna scroll over\njust a little smidge there,\n\n35\n00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.370\njust to show you the edge of this.\n\n36\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.600\nAnd I'm gonna type in the route command.\n\n37\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.130\nAnd when I do that you'll see that\nwe get just a help file for route.\n\n38\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.080\nYou can see it tells us the information\nabout how we can pull up\n\n39\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.750\nthe route command, what we can use it for.\n\n40\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.340\nThe route command,\nroute print specifically,\n\n41\n00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.760\nwill let us see the routing table.\n\n42\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.450\nI had it up in a prior episode.\n\n43\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.160\nRoute add will let us manipulate an add,\neither static routes in or\n\n44\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.640\nspecify a certain route.\n\n45\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.020\nWe can modify the routes that are there.\n\n46\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.370\nSo the route command again,\nbeen around forever.\n\n47\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.090\nAnd many people just don't even\nthink about or don't really use it.\n\n48\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.520\nThey'll go in and they'll specify and\nconfigure IP information,\n\n49\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.200\nas we talked about,\nfrom one of the other interfaces.\n\n50\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400\nBut we can do this right\nfrom in here if we want to,\n\n51\n00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.100\nand when we do that we do route print.\n\n52\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.920\nAs we saw, we could see the routing table.\n\n53\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460\nIn this case, this is server 16.\n\n54\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.000\nAnd so we can see we have both a routing\ntable for IPv6 down at the bottom there.\n\n55\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.039\nAnd we have one for IPv4,\njust a little further up right here.\n\n56\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.701\nAnd we can see the routing\ntable is listed for both.\n\n57\n00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:43.298\nAnd when we look at a routing table,\n\n58\n00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:46.246\nwe want to understand the different\ninformation that's there.\n\n59\n00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:49.110\nSo I just wanna quickly identify\nthe five key elements that make up\n\n60\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.200\nthe table here and just make sure\nwe're comfortable with what they are.\n\n61\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.620\nThe network destination,\nright here, the netmask,\n\n62\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.640\nthe gateway, the interface and the metric.\n\n63\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.300\nLet's just talk about what those are.\n\n64\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.760\nLet's start with the network destination.\n\n65\n00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.750\nThis is the destination host where traffic\nis going to be transmitted, right?\n\n66\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.630\nSo in other words, this is what we\nare thinking about sending our traffic to.\n\n67\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.580\nIt's whatever this address is.\n\n68\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.500\nWhen we think about the netmask we're\nthinking about the subnet mask.\n\n69\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.870\nJust highlight that as we go.\n\n70\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.720\nThe subnet mask that we will be using,\nwe've talked about subnet masks.\n\n71\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.635\nYou would know hopefully\nby now what they are.\n\n72\n00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:23.930\nWhen we think about the gateway,\nthe gateway is going to be that\n\n73\n00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.810\ninterface that allows us to be able to\nget out of our system across our LAN and\n\n74\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.240\nthen specify connectivity\nto another network.\n\n75\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.960\nSo that's the target we're\ngonna send our traffic to,\n\n76\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.140\nto route traffic on a IPv4\nnetwork in this case.\n\n77\n00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.650\nThe interface itself, the IPv4\naddress that we are using to send and\n\n78\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.470\nreceive traffic on this particular\nmachine, whatever this may be for\n\n79\n00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.120\nthe route in question.\n\n80\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.890\nNotice all this information is\nentered as a series of items, right,\n\n81\n00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.598\ngoing across horizontally as\na row inside the routing table.\n\n82\n00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:59.490\nEach one of the items we're\ndefining has a unique identifier or\n\n83\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.610\nentry associated with it.\n\n84\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.450\nAnd then the metric is\nthe relative cost for the route.\n\n85\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.610\nMetric is a number that gets assigned that\nthen is going to translate into a priority\n\n86\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.130\nfor the route, if you will, the cost\nbeing high or low based on the number.\n\n87\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.930\nSo the lower the metric number,\nthe lower the cost.\n\n88\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.074\nThe higher the metric number,\nthe higher the cost.\n\n89\n00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:26.950\nAnd so a metric of 10 would be lower and\ntherefore less costly to\n\n90\n00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.800\nuse than a metric of 281, or 331, or\nwhatever numbers you may see there.\n\n91\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.300\nThey're more expensive, quote, unquote.\n\n92\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.498\nNow I talked to people about it.\n\n93\n00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:37.170\nSo it's like, you get out money,\nyou start, no, we don't do that.\n\n94\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.300\nThis is not money.\n\n95\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.290\nWhen we say costs, what we mean is that we\nare simply specifying the numerical value\n\n96\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.000\nthat indicates our preference for\n\n97\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.530\nthe route based on a lower number being\nmore preferable than a higher number.\n\n98\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.810\nBut we just,\nwe tend to refer to it as a cost value.\n\n99\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.954\nThat's how the metric is often\ndocumented and described.\n\n100\n00:04:52.954 --> 00:04:54.539\n&gt;&gt; It just has some logic.\n\n101\n00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.300\nIt has good logic behind it, though.\n\n102\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.870\nIf you have a cheeseburger over here for\n$10 versus a cheeseburger for $5, and\n\n103\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.480\nthey both fill you up.\n\n104\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.420\nKinda like it gets you to the same place,\nso which route would you wanna choose?\n\n105\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.350\nUsually you're looking at the one with\nthe lower, was that the $5 burger?\n\n106\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.857\nThe lower metric there, right?\n\n107\n00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:11.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am\n\n108\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.332\nnot inserting myself into your\ncheeseburger world, young ladyship!\n\n109\n00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:18.392\nI'm gonna leave that totally up to\nyou [LAUGH] to decide whether left or\n\n110\n00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:19.458\nright was less or more.\n\n111\n00:05:19.458 --> 00:05:23.010\nI would have gone with left less and\nright being higher.\n\n112\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.420\nThat's just me, but then again,\nyou know, what can I tell you?\n\n113\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.688\nI don't eat cheeseburgers, so for\nme it wouldn't actually matter.\n\n114\n00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:28.691\nBut I get the idea.\n\n115\n00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.270\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n116\n00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.530\nIt would be something along those lines,\nright?\n\n117\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.536\nLess filling, or\nrather equally filling but\n\n118\n00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:35.496\nless cost is what we\nwere going after there.\n\n119\n00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've never actually explained routing\n\n120\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.060\nwith a reference to nutrition.\n\n121\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.580\n&gt;&gt; It was just kind of on the fly.\n\n122\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.187\nSo sorry if it doesn't make sense.\n\n123\n00:05:43.187 --> 00:05:43.919\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n\n124\n00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:44.860\n&gt;&gt; But that's just how it works sometimes.\n\n125\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.230\n&gt;&gt; But that's the beautiful thing about\nhaving Cherokee hosting with me here.\n\n126\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.460\n&gt;&gt; We always never know.\n\n127\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.880\nThere's always a surprise element\nin the explanations that we get.\n\n128\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.896\nBut I actually like that one.\n\n129\n00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:56.460\nThat is kind of a cool way of\nthinking about it, all kidding aside.\n\n130\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.450\nSo when we think about our routing table,\nright, we are seeing that every machine,\n\n131\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.150\nand this is just a server 16 machine,\nright, just out of the box installed.\n\n132\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.580\nNothing special about it,\n\n133\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.470\nhas a certain number of entries\nin the routing table already.\n\n134\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.460\n&gt;&gt; These are gonna\nrepresent default routes,\n\n135\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.640\nthe routes that we have to have\nknowledge of and be aware of.\n\n136\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.970\nAnd then we may add to this\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n137\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.003\nSo we've got our starting network\ndestination of all zeroes here, right,\n\n138\n00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:21.596\nthat we've got our loop back, adapter 127.\n\n139\n00:06:21.596 --> 00:06:25.509\nWe've got the broadcast, right,\nend of the block there for 127,\n\n140\n00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.378\nwe gotta repair the block,\nwe've looked at that.\n\n141\n00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:31.339\nWe've got a 192.168 block\nwhich is our actual\n\n142\n00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:35.306\ninterface address that's a sign\nthat's what we're actually using.\n\n143\n00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:38.050\nWe're on the 192.168 network,\nso we have that.\n\n144\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.040\nWe have our 224 address block here,\nthis is our multitask and our broadcast,\n\n145\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.530\nall 255 blocks here.\n\n146\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.960\nSo all of these are going to specify and\ndictate for\n\n147\n00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.160\nus certain basic elements that we\nneed to understand to use networking.\n\n148\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.280\nAnd then we add in and\nconfigure them on the fly if necessary.\n\n149\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.630\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna switch over here for\n\n150\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.940\njust a second to a different machine.\n\n151\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.830\nSo just bear with me here while\nI change our console out.\n\n152\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.490\nAnd I promised you that\nwe would talk about yet\n\n153\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.390\nanother way to look at some of the routing\nand network information in the system.\n\n154\n00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.510\nIt's often overlooked cuz a lot of\ntimes we don't have a Routing and\n\n155\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.920\nRemote Access configuration running.\n\n156\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.390\nAnd so we may not think of the fact\nthat the RRAS, or Routing and\n\n157\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.795\nRemote Access, MMC, or Management Console,\ncan also be used in this regard.\n\n158\n00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:24.281\nBut it is available to us and\n\n159\n00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:27.520\nyou can see here I just stood\nup a RRAS server in Server 16.\n\n160\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.835\nJust went in to the Server Manager,\nwent to go ahead and add the role.\n\n161\n00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:37.323\nAnd added in the routing and remote access\nand then the supporting items for VPN,\n\n162\n00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:40.564\nweb application proxy,\ndirect access, whatever we do.\n\n163\n00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:43.264\nAnd then what we did is just\nsimply open up the console, so\n\n164\n00:07:43.264 --> 00:07:45.135\njust showing you where I got this from.\n\n165\n00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:48.450\nI just went into the Server Manager,\nwent to tools.\n\n166\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.900\nOnce I installed it, went to routing.\n\n167\n00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.840\nCan you go full screen here?\n\n168\n00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.268\nCuz what I'm doing is behind me.\n\n169\n00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:53.137\nYou can't see it.\n\n170\n00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:57.116\nAnd routing in remote access you'll see\nright there just to open the console that\n\n171\n00:07:57.116 --> 00:07:59.984\nwe're looking at And\nin order to install this initially,\n\n172\n00:07:59.984 --> 00:08:03.290\nI just went to manage add rules and\nfeatures and stood this up.\n\n173\n00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.690\nNow we'll do a whole discussion of said\nepisodes on this later on I'm coming and\n\n174\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.830\nwe're going to delve into the mysteries\nof routing and remote access.\n\n175\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.120\nI'm not too worried about what\ngoes on in here for the moment.\n\n176\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.900\nIt's really just to show\nyou one specific feature.\n\n177\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.660\nBut when you set this up and\nopen it up, and\n\n178\n00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.310\nthen we open up our server here as you can\nsee and go in and go to either IPv4 and\n\n179\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.788\nor IPv6 and open up the interface,\nyou'll see I have a static routes area.\n\n180\n00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:32.742\nI can right-click on the static\nroutes area under either one.\n\n181\n00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:36.110\nAnd although there are no static routes\nthat are currently programmed and\n\n182\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.300\navailable here that I'm\nlooking at on the console,\n\n183\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.640\nI can see the IP routing table from here.\n\n184\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.260\nAnd you can see that all\nI have to do is click.\n\n185\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.590\nAnd it's not as pretty, and\nit's not as colorful, and\n\n186\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.520\nit's not an easy to see as it\nwould be in the command line.\n\n187\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.094\nI can extend this out, and so I can\nkind of interact with it a little bit,\n\n188\n00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:54.897\nmake it a little bit easier to read.\n\n189\n00:08:54.897 --> 00:09:00.877\nBut it is just gonna show me either IPv4\nand or IPv6 depending on which one I am\n\n190\n00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:06.136\nchoosing, if I could just grab that\nlower edge there, there we go.\n\n191\n00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:10.280\nNothing like a white on white console\ninterface to really make it easy for\n\n192\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.160\nyou to figure out how to pull\nthat window down, right?\n\n193\n00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.890\nAll right, so you could see what I did.\n\n194\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.450\nI could see the IPv4 routing table here.\n\n195\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.208\nI'm just showing it you.\n\n196\n00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:22.570\nIf I wanted to see the IPv6 one,\ndo the same thing right from here.\n\n197\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.380\nSo I can go in and I can pull\nthe routing table up to see what's\n\n198\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.555\nstatic routes have been programmed from\na variety of different interfaces.\n\n199\n00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:32.180\nIt would be a good idea for you,\nespecially if you're planning on sitting\n\n200\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.990\nfor that MCSA server 16 network exam,\nto perhaps know\n\n201\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.580\nthat we can use the routing and remote\naccess console to look at routing tables.\n\n202\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.350\nThat may be something that\nin a networking exam,\n\n203\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.728\nwould potentially be perhaps\nimportant to be aware of.\n\n204\n00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Very important.\n\n205\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.590\nI mean, this isn't a Cisco exam exam,\nwhere you would, I don't think they would\n\n206\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.450\nask you things like knowing,\nwe talked about those metrics there,\n\n207\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.670\nknowing that administrative, or\nknowing that cost for the metrics for\n\n208\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.990\nthe different types of the routing\nprotocols and so forth.\n\n209\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.443\nBut you also have the ability to\nmanipulate those administrative costs\n\n210\n00:10:03.443 --> 00:10:08.030\nmanually, administratively,\nto set a route preferences well.\n\n211\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.780\nBut there are multiple ways of doing that.\n\n212\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.240\nBut as Adam stated,\nthis is a Microsoft exam.\n\n213\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.604\nSo, note taken.\n\n214\n00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:16.095\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n215\n00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:18.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Note taken.\n\n216\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.370\nThank you.\n\n217\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.200\nAll right, so just one other thing we can\ndo here with, let's pull this over so\n\n218\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.175\nyou can see this.\n\n219\n00:10:24.175 --> 00:10:26.980\nWe're back in PowerShell,\njust thought I'd show you yet\n\n220\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.380\nanother way to look at the routing table,\nif you want to do it from PowerShell but\n\n221\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.650\nnot use the route print command.\n\n222\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:37.255\nGet net route, address family,\nyou specify IPv4 or IPv6 here.\n\n223\n00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:38.735\nAnd then you can go in and\n\n224\n00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:43.485\nyou'll see that we can actually see\nthe routing table here as well.\n\n225\n00:10:43.485 --> 00:10:45.075\nLet's just go full screen on that quick.\n\n226\n00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:48.225\nCan we go full screen for a second just so\nI can slide that around real quick?\n\n227\n00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:53.045\nAnd so, you'll see here that we\nhave our destination prefix.\n\n228\n00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:55.135\nWe have our next top, our route metric.\n\n229\n00:10:55.135 --> 00:10:57.910\nWe get some more information in here\n\n230\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.230\nthat is different than what we see with\na traditional in the IF index here.\n\n231\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.710\nThat is a little bit\ndifferent than what we see\n\n232\n00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.420\nwhen we look at the routing table from a\ntraditional either DOS shell command line.\n\n233\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.507\nSo the normal command line and/or\nif we go look at it, for instance,\n\n234\n00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:18.020\nin the routing remote access tables as\nI just looked at it with you there.\n\n235\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.550\nWe got a little bit of\na different information here, or\n\n236\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.710\nat least we see some\ndifferent information here.\n\n237\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.720\nBut we get the basics,\nwe can still see that.\n\n238\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.930\nBut notice, by the way,\nwe do have our shorthand notation for\n\n239\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.170\nour subnet mask, right?\n\n240\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.202\nSlash 32 for 32 bits being used.\n\n241\n00:11:31.202 --> 00:11:33.200\nSlash 4 here, right?\n\n242\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.090\nSo we're using only four bits for that.\n\n243\n00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.545\nSo we talked about this and\nwhy this is important.\n\n244\n00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:42.410\nNotice down here, kind of an unusual\none you don't see very often, /0.\n\n245\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.920\nBut if you notice that the IP is\nset to all zero, /0 makes sense.\n\n246\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.700\nWe don't have any bits specified\ncuz we haven't assigned any,\n\n247\n00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.150\nthey're all turned off, right?\n\n248\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.080\nAnd so, we could see that we understand\nhopefully based on prior conversations,\n\n249\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.290\nhow to recognize that\nshorthand notation now, and\n\n250\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.110\nbegin to see why all that stuff becomes so\nimportant.\n\n251\n00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.960\nIf I wanted to go ahead and add a route in\nhere, if I wanted to actually do a route\n\n252\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.520\nadd equivalent from PowerShell instead of\nin the command line where I would do route\n\n253\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.930\nadd, if I wanted to do it here,\nI could do New-NetRoute.\n\n254\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:13.790\nSo just do that.\n\n255\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.463\nAnd then I would do Interface.\n\n256\n00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:23.560\nOf course, I have to spell that correctly.\n\n257\n00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.340\nLet me just do that, interface, there\nwe go, interfaceindex instead of alias.\n\n258\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.950\nAnd for interface index, I'll specify 10.\n\n259\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.810\nInterface index is going\nto be the route metrics.\n\n260\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.940\nThat's essentially what\nwe're specifying there.\n\n261\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.580\nI'm sorry, not the route metric,\ninterface index.\n\n262\n00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.350\nI'm looking at route metric\nwhile I'm talking to you.\n\n263\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.895\nInterface index is this item over here,\nifindex.\n\n264\n00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:47.980\nThat's this identifier right here, right?\n\n265\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.280\nThat's what that will be.\n\n266\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.540\nThat's what I meant to say, but\nI'm looking straight ahead at the monitor,\n\n267\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.500\neven though you can't see me.\n\n268\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.342\nAnd I'm looking right at RouteMetric and\nmy brain is playing tricks on me here.\n\n269\n00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.950\nAll right, so destination.\n\n270\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.600\nAnd we're gonna do DestinationPrefix,\nso let me just put that in there.\n\n271\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.740\nAnd notice,\nI'm essentially just pulling in, right?\n\n272\n00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.640\nAll the parameters for\n\n273\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.710\nthe headers in the route table, and\nI'm specifying information for them so\n\n274\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.890\nI can program in one of these\nroutes if I choose to do that.\n\n275\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.861\nSo, let's say hypothetically I\ndid something like 172.16.0.0/16\n\n276\n00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:22.455\nusing my shorthand slash notation.\n\n277\n00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:24.615\nAnd then I'll put in my next hop.\n\n278\n00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:30.675\nAnd let's say that that is going\nto be just randomly, right,\n\n279\n00:13:30.675 --> 00:13:32.605\nsomething like that for my gateway.\n\n280\n00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:36.933\nSo what that would do is that would\nallow me to program in a new route\n\n281\n00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:40.253\nwith an interface site\nindex identifier of 10.\n\n282\n00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:44.594\nDestination prefix under\nhere of 172.16.0.0.\n\n283\n00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:46.598\nNotice, I don't have\nthat in there already.\n\n284\n00:13:46.598 --> 00:13:47.760\n/16, right?\n\n285\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.560\nAnd a NextHop, right here,\nas you can see for NextHop, of 10.0.0.1.\n\n286\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.580\nSo I could use PowerShell to be able\nto add routes in if I wanted to.\n\n287\n00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.880\nOr I could go over to my command line,\nright?\n\n288\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.700\nRight back here where we are.\n\n289\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.360\nAnd I could go to my routing table just\nlike I had before, just put that up there.\n\n290\n00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.340\nAnd instead, I could do instead\nof route print, route add.\n\n291\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.840\nAnd then I can go ahead and\n\n292\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.460\nI can specify just all the information\nto do a route add if I want to do that.\n\n293\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.220\nAnd I can obviously look at\ndoing it from either place.\n\n294\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.380\nRoute change lets me modify an existing\nroute instead of adding one in.\n\n295\n00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.320\nRoute delete.\n\n296\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.650\nDelete an existing route\nif I wanna do that.\n\n297\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.590\nSo I can manipulate and modify these\nsettings from a variety of different\n\n298\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.240\nplaces, and it will be helpful for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n299\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.440\nOr for you, I should say,\nto be aware of that.\n\n300\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.950\nBecause you're gonna wanna understand\nthat the routing table is going to be\n\n301\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.960\nthe pre-stored, pre-provided static\ninformation, at least these routes anyway.\n\n302\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.940\nThat is in any one of the machines that we\nwould then want to take advantage of or\n\n303\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.020\nleverage in order to be able to get\nfrom point a to point b and back again.\n\n304\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.620\nIt's gonna be real important for\nus to know that.\n\n305\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.260\nWhile we're just switching over here real\nquick, I'm just gonna load a command shell\n\n306\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.120\non the other machine here real quick and\njust modify it just so you can see it.\n\n307\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.740\nI'm just gonna show you some of the\ntroubleshooting tools that are available\n\n308\n00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.570\nin Server 16 real quick.\n\n309\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.328\nSo while we're doing that,\nCherokee is going to serenade you.\n\n310\n00:15:16.328 --> 00:15:19.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man,\nthat's gonna be scary, Adam.\n\n311\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.050\nBut you know what?\n\n312\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.060\nI will just note here you can\nalso utilize your route print\n\n313\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.950\nhere in the regular\ncommand prompt as well.\n\n314\n00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.630\nI'm sure you said that.\n\n315\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.370\n&gt;&gt; You can.\nI talked about that,\n\n316\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.460\nabsolutely I did, yes.\n\n317\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Good, good [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.580\nOf course you did.\n\n319\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.010\n&gt;&gt; I did, of course I did.\n\n320\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.460\nAll right, so we can talk about routing.\n\n321\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.830\nLet's talk about some\ntroubleshooting tools,\n\n322\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.940\ntools that are available to us that we\ncan use either from a command line.\n\n323\n00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.478\nCan use all these tools, by the way,\n\n324\n00:15:40.478 --> 00:15:43.859\nat least the command line ones that I'm\ngonna show yo, from PowerShell as well.\n\n325\n00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.820\nI'm not gonna go back and forth and\nshow you the same thing in both, but\n\n326\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.797\nyou can do them from either place.\n\n327\n00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:48.284\nThey'll all work the same way.\n\n328\n00:15:48.284 --> 00:15:53.211\nI know all of you, I'm sure Are familiar\nwith this command right here, ipconfig.\n\n329\n00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:58.135\nBut if you haven't, and I often encourage\nstudents to do the following to look\n\n330\n00:15:58.135 --> 00:16:01.577\nat the health file associated\nwith this measurement.\n\n331\n00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:04.769\nLet me make this just a little bit bigger,\ncuz I know you can see it but\n\n332\n00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:08.372\nit's probably really helpful for\nyou to see that really big, you know why?\n\n333\n00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:10.522\n&gt;&gt; It's helpful for me.\n[LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:16:10.522 --> 00:16:11.334\n&gt;&gt; It's helpful for Cherokee, here.\n\n335\n00:16:11.334 --> 00:16:12.707\nIt's helpful for you,\n\n336\n00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:17.540\nbecause you need to understand how to\nlook at the help file for these commands.\n\n337\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.920\nBecause you're gonna get asked about\nsubtle interface information, or\n\n338\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.460\ninternal information about these commands,\nthat you may or may not be familiar.\n\n339\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.510\nFor instance, I often ask people,\nhey you know about ipconfig?\n\n340\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.600\nYeah, we know about ipconfig.\n\n341\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.110\nGreat, you know what you could do with it?\n\n342\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.840\nYeah, I can go ahead and\nI can release and renew.\n\n343\n00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.770\nAbsolutely.\n\n344\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.100\nCan you look at your DNS resolver cache?\n\n345\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.950\nWhat's that?\n\n346\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.430\nWell when I explained it and we talked\nabout the display DNS command, or\n\n347\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.482\nthe flash DNS command.\n\n348\n00:16:41.482 --> 00:16:43.980\nThey're like, yeah, I know about that, but\nI didn't know that's what it's called.\n\n349\n00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.376\nSo it's important for you to understand\nwhat goes on with these tools out beyond\n\n350\n00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:52.313\nthe basics, cuz it's easy to ask\nthe interesting and basic question,\n\n351\n00:16:52.313 --> 00:16:54.098\nhey ipconfig, what does it do?\n\n352\n00:16:54.098 --> 00:16:56.915\nThe hard question you may\nnot get right on an exam is,\n\n353\n00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:00.322\nipconfig in a command string,\nfrom a screen capture, right?\n\n354\n00:17:00.322 --> 00:17:02.294\nAnd then,\nhey what is that command gonna do and\n\n355\n00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:04.360\nthen you have to choose what it does.\n\n356\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.781\nOr take that information and go click on\na diagram somewhere as a hotspot, and\n\n357\n00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:12.669\nidentify an issue that's gonna\nhappen as a result of that command.\n\n358\n00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:16.051\nYou're glad I don't write exam questions,\ncuz I'm devious, right?\n\n359\n00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:18.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm surprised you\nhaven't set a scenario-based like.\n\n360\n00:17:18.193 --> 00:17:21.620\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Could be as well, right?\n\n361\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.200\nBut my point is, there are so\nmany different ways today for\n\n362\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.330\nus to ask these questions of you.\n\n363\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.636\nThat it's not just simple, hey here's\nthe command, here's four options,\n\n364\n00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:30.450\nmultiple choice.\n\n365\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.995\nYeah, it must be b, right?\n\n366\n00:17:31.995 --> 00:17:33.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or whatever the urban myth legend,\n\n367\n00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:36.645\nright, universal answers is,\nI think it's c, right?\n\n368\n00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:37.385\nYeah, it's c.\n\n369\n00:17:37.385 --> 00:17:40.215\nSo whatever it is,\nit's not that simple anymore, right?\n\n370\n00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:41.605\nIt hasn't been for a long time.\n\n371\n00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:45.675\nSo understanding and looking at the help\nfile here, and I know because it's so\n\n372\n00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:48.015\nbig you're not gonna be able\nto see all the items there.\n\n373\n00:17:48.015 --> 00:17:50.245\nBut I just want you to\nunderstand the logic of that and\n\n374\n00:17:50.245 --> 00:17:52.815\nwhy it's important to take\na look at those help files.\n\n375\n00:17:52.815 --> 00:17:54.915\nBecause it is going to be valuable for\nyou.\n\n376\n00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:56.690\nLet me make that just\na little bit smaller.\n\n377\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.740\nIt is gonna be valuable for\nyou to be able to understand that.\n\n378\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.730\nSo ipconfig, ipconfig all, renew,\nrelease, those are the basic ones.\n\n379\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.859\nBut notice display, DNS, and flush DNS\nare not in the examples here, right?\n\n380\n00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:10.700\nYou will have to go back up and\nread up on them.\n\n381\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.170\nBut they are right here,\nthey're just under options.\n\n382\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.579\nJust the examples don't show everything.\n\n383\n00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:16.840\nYou wanna focus on the options, right?\n\n384\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.510\nAnd really take a look at and\nunderstand all this kind of stuff.\n\n385\n00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.800\nSet class ID, right, for\n6 and set class ID without 6.\n\n386\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.680\nThat lets us specify DHCP and\nDHCP version 6 support.\n\n387\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.750\nAnd we'll be talking about DHCP and\nsetting up the HTTP in upcoming episodes.\n\n388\n00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.640\nWe'll take a look at how to configure\na DHCP server for version 6, for\n\n389\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.040\nIPv6 support.\n\n390\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.200\nSo just make sure you know that.\n\n391\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.450\nWe've got register and display DNS, flush\nDNS, renew, renew 6, release, release 6.\n\n392\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.960\nYou guys know we have\na different command for\n\n393\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.630\nIPv6 to use ipconfig to release and renew.\n\n394\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.455\nIt's not just ipconfig release and\nrenew, that's the v4 command.\n\n395\n00:18:54.455 --> 00:18:57.830\nIpconfig release 6 is the release\ncommand for version 6.\n\n396\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.085\nSo you do need to take some time\njust to get acquainted here.\n\n397\n00:19:01.085 --> 00:19:04.460\nIt will be important for you,\nbecause if you're not familiar with it,\n\n398\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.685\nthat's the difference typically\nbetween success and failure.\n\n399\n00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:11.460\nIpconfig lets you go and\nlook at existing IP configurations,\n\n400\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.540\nmodify the binding and or work with IP\naddress that's important to know that.\n\n401\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.860\nOkay, let's go back to our\nnext one if you could please.\n\n402\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.276\nRight, so ping, I'm sure you guys\nare familiar with ping, not pong.\n\n403\n00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:23.092\nNot pong, as I type of there but ping.\n\n404\n00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:25.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you know the ping and\n\n405\n00:19:25.526 --> 00:19:28.840\nyou could see it when you type\nin ping question mark again.\n\n406\n00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.090\nWhole bunch of switches there,\nmost people know maybe one or two.\n\n407\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.600\nYeah, I can ping and maybe do a ping\ntea for a continuous ping, okay great.\n\n408\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.169\nBut there are so\nmany other things that you could do there,\n\n409\n00:19:38.169 --> 00:19:41.850\nnotice ping minus two right at\nthe top there, ping until stop, right?\n\n410\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.850\nBut you could see there's so\nmany other things ping minus p,\n\n411\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.830\nping hyper-V network\nvirtualization provider address.\n\n412\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.430\nDid you know you could do that?\n\n413\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.470\nI knew you could do that.\n\n414\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.990\nYou may or may not know you can do that,\nbut I promise you that somebody\n\n415\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.800\nwho is gonna ask you is gonna\nexpect you to know how to do that.\n\n416\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.900\nSo it would be important.\n\n417\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:02.059\nWhat about ping -4,\nthat forces IPv4 as opposed to IPv6,\n\n418\n00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:04.751\n-6 forces a ping using IPv6.\n\n419\n00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:08.860\nIt's important to know the distinctions\nhere and understand your tools, right?\n\n420\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.870\nWhen do I use them?\n\n421\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.180\nWhat are they used for?\n\n422\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.110\nWhy are they important?\n\n423\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:18.330\nPing is our traditional go to tool for\nIP configuration troubleshooting.\n\n424\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.230\nHey, let me ping something\nto see if it's connected,\n\n425\n00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.030\nif it's configured the right way.\n\n426\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.520\nI look at IP config to see\nthe config on the local interface.\n\n427\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.110\nI ping it to see if it has\ncommunication capabilities, and\n\n428\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.120\nthere's networking traffic\nthat's moving back and forth.\n\n429\n00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.760\nTo that end,\nI use two additional tools, right?\n\n430\n00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.309\nSomething called trace route,\nwe write it as tracert in Windows, right?\n\n431\n00:20:38.309 --> 00:20:42.124\nThat's just the shortened\nversion of the tool name.\n\n432\n00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:47.161\nAnd you could see the help file there,\nand tracert, short for trace route.\n\n433\n00:20:47.161 --> 00:20:52.758\nAnd you can see that this allows\nme to essentially combine\n\n434\n00:20:52.758 --> 00:20:58.150\nping together with some\nadditional information.\n\n435\n00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.100\nThat's gonna detail out for\nme specifically every hop\n\n436\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.490\nbetween where I start from and\nwhere I wanna ultimately end up.\n\n437\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.882\nAnd it's gonna show me every touch\non every interface as I hop or\n\n438\n00:21:08.882 --> 00:21:12.723\nconnect from routed interface to\nrouted interface during my hand off.\n\n439\n00:21:12.723 --> 00:21:16.665\nNetworking is actually really interesting,\nwe don't often go into this detail but\n\n440\n00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:19.006\nyou mind helping me do\nsomething here real quick?\n\n441\n00:21:19.006 --> 00:21:20.813\n&gt;&gt; Sure why not [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're so confident.\n\n442\n00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:21.985\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for, right?\n\n443\n00:21:21.985 --> 00:21:23.526\n&gt;&gt; You're like, yeah I don't know.\n\n444\n00:21:23.526 --> 00:21:26.527\nIt may involve something that I'm not\ncomfortable with, but we'll give it a try.\n\n445\n00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:27.871\nSo real simple.\n\n446\n00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:30.397\nSo, I just wanna illustrate the concept\nof a hop and a hop count, right?\n\n447\n00:21:30.397 --> 00:21:31.237\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n448\n00:21:31.237 --> 00:21:34.333\nwhen I wanna send traffic back and\nforth, right?\n\n449\n00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:38.910\nI have to pass something from my network\ncard over to either the default gateway,\n\n450\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.081\nor if I'm going out across to the network,\nbeyond the boundary of my LAN,\n\n451\n00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:47.254\nthe default gateway, or I will send it\nto another machine on my network but\n\n452\n00:21:47.254 --> 00:21:50.120\nit may not come through a default gateway.\n\n453\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.490\nIt depends on whether it's local to me or\nit's remote, as we know, right?\n\n454\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.270\nAnd so when we think about hot count,\n\n455\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.520\nwe're talking about default gateways that\nwe're connecting through, or we're hopping\n\n456\n00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.020\nfrom our system to probably the landside\nof our router or default gateway.\n\n457\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.776\nAnd then out beyond that the router\ndelivers to the next router down.\n\n458\n00:22:05.776 --> 00:22:08.377\nAnd so essentially, just give me a pen,\nor a piece of paper or\n\n459\n00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:09.963\nsomething I can hand to you, right?\n\n460\n00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:14.120\nSo if this is our packet right here,\nand I wanna send this packet.\n\n461\n00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.540\nI'm gonna send it off to Cherokee.\n\n462\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.844\nIf she is the default gateway,\nI'm gonna give it to her.\n\n463\n00:22:19.844 --> 00:22:23.486\nAnd then with this hands,\nshe's going to accept it on the lan.\n\n464\n00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:25.280\nAnd then she's going to transfer it.\n\n465\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.470\nGo full screen for a second.\n\n466\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.650\n&gt;&gt; This my my other interface?\n\n467\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.680\nOkay, hold on.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we gotta go full screen.\n\n468\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.637\nFull screen to both of us, there we go.\n\n469\n00:22:32.637 --> 00:22:33.288\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:34.318\n&gt;&gt; And she's gotta transfer it to\n\n471\n00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:34.877\nthe other side.\n\n472\n00:22:34.877 --> 00:22:36.073\nRight, she's gonna hand it off over there.\n\n473\n00:22:36.073 --> 00:22:40.886\nThat's the hand off on the router\nfrom the landside to the outside or\n\n474\n00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:42.496\nexternal side right?\n\n475\n00:22:42.496 --> 00:22:44.611\nAnd then she's gonna send,\nnow we need another hand.\n\n476\n00:22:44.611 --> 00:22:46.401\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta go that way to hand it\n\n477\n00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:47.011\nover to me.\n\n478\n00:22:47.011 --> 00:22:47.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n479\n00:22:47.703 --> 00:22:49.610\n&gt;&gt; And then she's gonna pass it around.\n\n480\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.850\nAnd then she's gonna transfer\nit to somebody else, and\n\n481\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.180\nthis is how we count tops, right?\n\n482\n00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:53.880\nThis is what we do.\n\n483\n00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.540\nAnd so, the idea is that when\nwe're using tracert, what\n\n484\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.020\nwe're going is instead of pinging, where\nall we get back is the following, right?\n\n485\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.159\nLet's just ping our gateway here.\n\n486\n00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:07.752\nSo let me just do an ipconfig real quick,\n\n487\n00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:12.085\nand just see what our\naddress is on this machine,\n\n488\n00:23:12.085 --> 00:23:16.962\nand it looks like we're on 192.168.0.4.\n\n489\n00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:19.120\nAnd actually just bring up my\ninterface for a moment if you could,\n\n490\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.400\nlet's go back to my machine.\n\n491\n00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.210\nSo remember I told you\nabout automatic private IP\n\n492\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.410\nconfiguration addresses, so PIPA.\n\n493\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.550\nSo there is one right there.\n\n494\n00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.590\nYou can see that I've got one assigned\nto my Ethernet adapter right there.\n\n495\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.030\nMy Ethernet two adapter.\n\n496\n00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.054\nSo that one's actually\nusing a private IP address,\n\n497\n00:23:33.054 --> 00:23:34.627\nan automatically assigned private IP.\n\n498\n00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:40.139\nBut this one,\nmy Ethernet one interface is 192.168.0.4.\n\n499\n00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:41.902\nMy gateway is 0.250.\n\n500\n00:23:41.902 --> 00:23:43.507\nSo I'm gonna ping that.\n\n501\n00:23:43.507 --> 00:23:46.420\nSo let's go down here, and\n\n502\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.242\nlet's ping 192.168.0.250.\n\n503\n00:23:51.242 --> 00:23:53.010\nAnd we'll get back four responses.\n\n504\n00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.010\nThis is the traditional information\nthat comes back from ping, right?\n\n505\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.350\nAssuming we're connected,\neverything's good on the network.\n\n506\n00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.280\nWhat Tracer does is it does this, but\n\n507\n00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.860\ninstead of just doing it to\nthe very last interface and\n\n508\n00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.870\nonly showing me the response from that,\nit shows me every step in between.\n\n509\n00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.160\nAnd so when I do trace search, right?\n\n510\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.910\nAnd I do 192.168.0.250,\nI'm essentially gonna get\n\n511\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.630\nback basically not much\ndifferent information,\n\n512\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.270\ncuz it's really nothing between me and\nthe default gateway.\n\n513\n00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.315\nBut if I was to do this to\nan external IP address,\n\n514\n00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:30.750\nI would actually get back information\nabout every hop along the way.\n\n515\n00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:35.730\nAnd it would show me the metric and\nthe TTL and all that value is you can see\n\n516\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.548\ncoming up here for that,\nout to a maximum of 30 hops.\n\n517\n00:24:39.548 --> 00:24:42.633\nAnd it would show me that information,\nhelp me diagnose whether or\n\n518\n00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:43.870\nnot I'm connecting.\n\n519\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.830\nAnd if I am connecting,\nhow I'm connecting,\n\n520\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.150\nover what circumstances or through what\nkind of a network all the way through.\n\n521\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.130\nAnd so I'm just gonna break that because\nwe're not gonna get any information back.\n\n522\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.470\nBut I would be able to do that.\n\n523\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.840\nAnd so I could actually go out and\nI could do a tracer to a machine, or\n\n524\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.470\nfrom a machine.\n\n525\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.056\nLet's just take a look here real quick\nat my Windows 10 machine that's actually\n\n526\n00:25:04.056 --> 00:25:05.858\nconnected out to the Internet.\n\n527\n00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:07.490\nAnd let's just take\na look here real quick.\n\n528\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.180\nLet me just get rid of what was there, and\n\n529\n00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.850\nlet's take a look at what\nthis would like for real.\n\n530\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.553\nSo if I do tracer www.cnn.com, right?\n\n531\n00:25:17.553 --> 00:25:21.180\nI don't even have to, I'm in net-sh.\n\n532\n00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.470\nI didn't even realize\nit was still in net-sh.\n\n533\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.480\nThere we go, that's better.\n\n534\n00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.750\nAll right, so let me do that.\n\n535\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:33.910\nI don't even need to\ntype in the IP address.\n\n536\n00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:38.000\nI can do that and\nrely on DNS to do the resolution for me.\n\n537\n00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.320\nAnd if you're not sure how that works,\n\n538\n00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.200\nwe're going to talk all about that\nin an upcoming episode as well.\n\n539\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.610\nBut you could see here\nthat when I do that,\n\n540\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.580\nI'm actually getting essentially a ping\nto every interface in the hop trail,\n\n541\n00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.400\nall the way from where I am\nall the way out to CNN.com.\n\n542\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.020\nAnd I'm showing everyone of those,\nbut instead of showing me the ping\n\n543\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.320\ninformation, what Tracer does is it\nshows me the information on the hop.\n\n544\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.870\nIt shows me what number it was,\nhow long it took me connect,\n\n545\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.436\nwhat the IP address was of that interface.\n\n546\n00:26:05.436 --> 00:26:07.145\nAnd then the next top,\nand then the next hop, and\n\n547\n00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:08.790\nthen the next hop all the way through.\n\n548\n00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.618\nSo Tracer details out all of the\nnetworking steps, or the interim steps for\n\n549\n00:26:12.618 --> 00:26:15.551\nme to go from point A to point D,\nand everything between.\n\n550\n00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:17.497\nAnd it details it out for\nme so I can see it.\n\n551\n00:26:17.497 --> 00:26:21.520\nAnd if there's a problem, it should help\nme to essentially zero in on that and\n\n552\n00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.720\nperhaps identify that\nthere's a concern here.\n\n553\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.860\nSo trace route, or TRACERT, which is\nthe name of how we reference the tool,\n\n554\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.830\nis gonna be helpful for us to do some\nroute-based trouble shooting to look at\n\n555\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.350\npath and to understand whether\nwe're connecting or not.\n\n556\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.560\nWe may see that there's a very\nhigh millisecond latency count\n\n557\n00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.540\non one of the hops here.\n\n558\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.010\nMaybe we're dropping packets,\nmaybe there's some congestion.\n\n559\n00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.250\nMaybe something's going on\nthat we have to adjust for-\n\n560\n00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's average,\n\n561\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.900\nbecause we're communicating globally,\n\n562\n00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.080\nand we have to traverse different\ncontinents or so forth.\n\n563\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.860\nIt might sometimes, so it just shows you\nthe layout of that particular packet,\n\n564\n00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.110\nit's traveling.\n\n565\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.950\n&gt;&gt; It shows us the network\nconnectivity that travels across, or\n\n566\n00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.140\nthe network map, if you will,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n567\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.180\nAnother one that does this is PathPing.\n\n568\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.850\nNow, PathPing will essentially\ndo very similar stuff.\n\n569\n00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.350\nBut instead of immediately returning\nour results the way Traceroute does,\n\n570\n00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.120\nwhen you do PathPing, it's gonna do\nthis and then it's gonna sit there for\n\n571\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.410\na minute or two and\nit's gonna gather some usage statistics,\n\n572\n00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.080\nand then it's gonna show it us.\n\n573\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.640\nSo take a little bit longer to\ngive us back the information, but\n\n574\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.475\nultimately when it does that-\n&gt;&gt; Adam,\n\n575\n00:27:26.475 --> 00:27:30.394\ncan I tell you how I feel about PathPing?\n\n576\n00:27:30.394 --> 00:27:34.424\nI don't want to scare you, but it's, this\nis my, it's almost like where you take\n\n577\n00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:37.695\nping and you're TRACERT, and\nthen they have a little offspring.\n\n578\n00:27:37.695 --> 00:27:39.925\n&gt;&gt; And so, if Traceroute and\n\n579\n00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.105\nPing got together-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n580\n00:27:41.105 --> 00:27:43.580\n&gt;&gt; And\ndid their business behind closed doors,\n\n581\n00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.980\nthen you're saying that they\nwould produce PathPing?\n\n582\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n583\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n584\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.979\n&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?\n\n585\n00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:53.549\n&gt;&gt; Sure, in your world, I am gonna go with\nyou because you are holding a sharp object\n\n586\n00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:55.560\nand I don't want to\naggregate you in any way.\n\n587\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.790\nSo, absolutely.\n\n588\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.086\nBut actually, it is very funny, but\n\n589\n00:27:59.086 --> 00:28:03.533\nit's actually a really great way of\nthinking about it, because it is,\n\n590\n00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:07.850\nPathPing is, essentially\nthe combination of ping and Traceroute.\n\n591\n00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.242\nSo it is a great way of thinking about it,\nbecause it's yet another way, and\n\n592\n00:28:11.242 --> 00:28:14.899\nyou could see, it's computing those\nstatistics that I mentioned here, right,\n\n593\n00:28:14.899 --> 00:28:18.132\nright down on the bottom, before it\nactually shows us the information on\n\n594\n00:28:18.132 --> 00:28:19.635\nthe pinged path and the latency.\n\n595\n00:28:19.635 --> 00:28:21.840\nAnd it's doing that combination for us.\n\n596\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.180\nSo it is actually a great way of\nthinking about it, I like that a lot.\n\n597\n00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.740\nBecause it is really kind of like\nthe combination of those two tools in one.\n\n598\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.280\nSo I actually like that a lot.\n\n599\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.206\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n600\n00:28:31.206 --> 00:28:33.030\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a good one.\n\n601\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.435\nThat's worth like a fist bump,\nthat was a good one.\n\n602\n00:28:36.435 --> 00:28:38.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll let that show up.\n\n603\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.270\nIt'll show up there eventually.\n\n604\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.440\nBut we've got that.\n\n605\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.650\nWe also have an interesting additional\ntool, one you may be familiar with.\n\n606\n00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:50.090\nJust open up another command line here\nreal quick, something called Netstat.\n\n607\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.550\nAgain, just help file,\na lot of options in there.\n\n608\n00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.500\nYou may do something like Netstat minus a,\nand\n\n609\n00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.509\nlook at the connections on your\nadapter for instance, right?\n\n610\n00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:07.030\nAnd take a look at all open ports and\nIP address and where they're coming from,\n\n611\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.570\nand so you could see that here.\n\n612\n00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.170\nWe use this in security classes and\nin hacking classes and\n\n613\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.810\ndemonstrations to begin to understand\nwhat's coming inbound to the machine.\n\n614\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.810\nSo if we do a port scan,\n\n615\n00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.200\nwe'll do a Netstat to see what shows\nup and understand what's there.\n\n616\n00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.460\nSo netstat's short for network statistics,\nallows us to understand that information.\n\n617\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.370\nSo it would be valuable for you to\ntake a look, you can see both TCP and\n\n618\n00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.720\nUDP displays there.\n\n619\n00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.530\nWe have our IP addresses, but\nwe also see our port numbers,\n\n620\n00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.900\nwhich is very important from\na security perspective.\n\n621\n00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.050\nWe wanna start investigating open ports,\nand that would be good to know for\n\n622\n00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:37.800\nus to be aware of.\n\n623\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.140\nSo we have that.\n\n624\n00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.291\nWe're still waiting for\nour statistics to arrive.\n\n625\n00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.740\nThey'll show up eventually.\n\n626\n00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.350\nAnd then, the other thing that we have\nhere, some GUI based tools, right?\n\n627\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.820\nIn Server 16 we also have some\ntools that are in the GUI\n\n628\n00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.440\nthat we would want to take a look at.\n\n629\n00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.090\nSo let's go over here, we can go in,\nand actually I'll just do it this way,\n\n630\n00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.970\nlet's go to Control Panel.\n\n631\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.280\nAnd from Control Panel we can\ngo into Administrative Tools.\n\n632\n00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.280\nAnd we have a bunch of\nother stuff that's here.\n\n633\n00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.920\nLet me just kinda open this up real quick.\n\n634\n00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.690\nWe have, remember, we're talking about or\nfocusing on tools that help us to\n\n635\n00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.550\nunderstand how to troubleshoot, or\npotentially look at information.\n\n636\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.470\nI just blew past the first\none right there.\n\n637\n00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.230\nBut the oldie but goody Event Viewer,\nyou're probably, I'm sure,\n\n638\n00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.670\nfamiliar with Event Viewer.\n\n639\n00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.930\nIn case you haven't seen it in server\n16 before, it doesn't really look\n\n640\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.670\nany different than it would in,\nif you're familiar with it in server 12,\n\n641\n00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.570\nor even in 2008 r2,\nit's been looking this way for some time.\n\n642\n00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:37.320\nSo you see we have our various logs here,\nlet's just open this up.\n\n643\n00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.170\nAnd when we come in and\nwe take a look go in under Windows logs,\n\n644\n00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.630\nwe have our standard logs here.\n\n645\n00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.910\nIf we go in under applications and\n\n646\n00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.900\nservices logs, we have some additional\ninformation that may be valuable here.\n\n647\n00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.500\nHardware, IE, Microsoft, and\nthe lab exchange, different stuff, right?\n\n648\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.080\nWindows PowerShell, right?\n\n649\n00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.960\nSo we've got a bunch of stuff.\n\n650\n00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.140\nBut up under Microsoft is where,\n\n651\n00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.490\nunder Windows, we'll see quite a bit of\ninformation that may be valuable for us.\n\n652\n00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.810\nAnd we can see there's lots and\nlots and lots of stuff here.\n\n653\n00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:13.050\nGot some stuff as we can see right here\non DHCP and DHCP v6 for the client.\n\n654\n00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.760\nSo may wanna be looking at those,\nsee if there's any information.\n\n655\n00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.020\nIf we are running DHCP and\n\n656\n00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.345\nwe're having some networking issues, may\nbe valuable for us to take a look at that.\n\n657\n00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.215\nSo, would be good to know that.\n\n658\n00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:24.075\nWe have our DNS client events here.\n\n659\n00:31:24.075 --> 00:31:27.695\nIf we have any problems with the DNS\nservice, wanna be able to troubleshoot and\n\n660\n00:31:27.695 --> 00:31:28.565\nlook at that.\n\n661\n00:31:28.565 --> 00:31:33.170\nSo we do have definitely some\ninformation that would be valuable for\n\n662\n00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.110\nus to examine at that level.\n\n663\n00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.800\nWe've got some other stuff here\ndepending on what we have set up.\n\n664\n00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.252\nRemote desktop services, remote access.\n\n665\n00:31:39.252 --> 00:31:41.732\nIf we have remote access services enabled,\nRRAS,\n\n666\n00:31:41.732 --> 00:31:44.050\nwe have a bunch of stuff\nthat we could log there.\n\n667\n00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.122\nSo there will be some logs and information\nthat will be valuable in the Event Viewer.\n\n668\n00:31:48.122 --> 00:31:49.819\nThat we don't wanna underestimate or\n\n669\n00:31:49.819 --> 00:31:52.636\nperhaps just ignore cuz we're\nnot thinking that it's there.\n\n670\n00:31:52.636 --> 00:31:57.417\nWe also have Resource Monitor, again,\none that we often have seen and\n\n671\n00:31:57.417 --> 00:32:03.170\nprobably tripped across but may not even\nthink about the fact that we can use it.\n\n672\n00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:08.530\nBut this is kind of like our Task Manager\ntool but with a little bit more detail.\n\n673\n00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.491\nIt's been around since 2008,\nI think as well, or 2008 or two.\n\n674\n00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:13.519\nOn the server site,\n\n675\n00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:17.820\nI think Widows Vista is the first time\nwe see this show up on the desktop side.\n\n676\n00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.770\nBut you can see that we do have up here,\nlet's just get rid of CPU.\n\n677\n00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.500\nLet's go up under Networking.\n\n678\n00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.940\nWe do have the ability to look at\ninformation on the networking side.\n\n679\n00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.450\nYou'll go in and see information about\nwhat's happening, so we can go in and\n\n680\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.660\nwe can drill down right here,\nprocesses with network activity, right?\n\n681\n00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.650\nSo we can get some information\nhere about utilization.\n\n682\n00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.605\nWe can look at network\nactivity here as you saw.\n\n683\n00:32:42.605 --> 00:32:47.140\nWe can look at up right up here,\nTCP connections, so\n\n684\n00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.580\nwe could see inbound and\noutbound connections.\n\n685\n00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.360\nWe can look at listening ports.\n\n686\n00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.024\nSo this brings together\nthings like netstat,\n\n687\n00:32:54.024 --> 00:32:58.399\nbrings together other information from\nthe command line and displays it for\n\n688\n00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:01.156\nus in a graphical tool\nthat we can't leverage.\n\n689\n00:33:01.156 --> 00:33:05.320\nSo it may be valuable for us to take a\nlook and to again, not forget about it but\n\n690\n00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.700\njust be aware of it.\n\n691\n00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.191\nThese are the kind of things that you\nmay not use on a regular basis but\n\n692\n00:33:09.191 --> 00:33:11.128\nkeep in mind you may get\nasked about it at some point.\n\n693\n00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:13.149\nSo it'll be helpful for you to know.\n\n694\n00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Nice to know that we have this\nrealtime tool at our fingertips.\n\n695\n00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwe've got all that in there.\n\n696\n00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.090\nDon't overlook and don't forget about\nthe fact that in our networking areas,\n\n697\n00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:25.610\nlet's just go to networking and\nsharing center for just a moment,\n\n698\n00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:30.440\nthat we do have the ability to go in and\nto do troubleshooting of problems.\n\n699\n00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.270\nWe have a troubleshooter specific\nto the Windows networking stack, so\n\n700\n00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.530\nthe network troubleshooter, kinda that\nwizard that says, hey, what's wrong?\n\n701\n00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.590\nAsks you some questions, kinda narrows\ndown in theory your thought process.\n\n702\n00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.805\nSo the Windows network diagnostics,\nright, just the troubleshooting there.\n\n703\n00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:46.635\nWe can go in and take a look at that.\n\n704\n00:33:46.635 --> 00:33:51.805\nWe also can go in and use a tool\ncalled the Microsoft Message Analyzer.\n\n705\n00:33:51.805 --> 00:33:54.825\nNow you may not know it by this name,\nthis is been re-branded recently.\n\n706\n00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:56.730\nYou probably may know\nthis as the oldie but\n\n707\n00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:01.040\ngoodie Network Monitor, cuz that's\nwhat this is now being rebranded as.\n\n708\n00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.610\nBut Microsoft Message Analyzer\nused to be Network Monitor,\n\n709\n00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.750\na network sniffing tool that\nwe can download and use.\n\n710\n00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.820\nAnd that can be used to monitor\ntraffic flow inbound and outbound.\n\n711\n00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.830\nAnother great and, from Microsoft,\nfree tool that we can use to analyze.\n\n712\n00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.300\nThis will be equivalent of Wireshark or\nEthereal or\n\n713\n00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.300\nany of those network sniffers that\nyou may use or are familiar with.\n\n714\n00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.910\nIt's the same idea.\n\n715\n00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:26.600\nIt's just Microsoft's version, but\nthe Message Analyzer is now available.\n\n716\n00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.760\nYou can go and grab it,\ndownload it, use it, install it.\n\n717\n00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.170\nIt is supported on Server 16.\n\n718\n00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.830\nYou can run it there,\nrun it on Windows 10 on the desktop,\n\n719\n00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.280\non just the client side to do monitoring,\nwhatever you wanna do.\n\n720\n00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.300\nSo there's lots of different for\nyou to go in and\n\n721\n00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.135\ndo some troubleshooting for\nIPv4 base network information.\n\n722\n00:34:43.135 --> 00:34:46.640\nSome of these tools will give you IPv6\nsupport as well, as we saw, and it's good\n\n723\n00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.210\nto be thinking about and understanding\nthe fact that we can do one or\n\n724\n00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.490\nboth in many cases using any number\nof these tools in any combination.\n\n725\n00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n726\n00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.530\nSo we've talked about a lot\nof different tools and\n\n727\n00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.830\na lot of different IP version 4 concepts.\n\n728\n00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.430\nAnd the whole, I guess idea,\nconcept behind this particular\n\n729\n00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.300\nexam is gonna be centralized,\ncentric to a lot of these topics.\n\n730\n00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.460\nSo we're kinda just getting started,\nAdam, right?\n\n731\n00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're getting started just with\nthe overview for IPv4, and just reminding\n\n732\n00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:19.380\nus of where we come from before we look at\nsome of the network services, DNS, DHCP.\n\n733\n00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.540\nWe look at IPv6 support.\n\n734\n00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.870\nWe look at remote access,\nwe talked about that and\n\n735\n00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.140\nthat'll be coming up IPAM,\nIP Address Management.\n\n736\n00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.559\nWe look at software defined networking or\n\n737\n00:35:29.559 --> 00:35:33.678\nadvanced Hyper-V networking features\nin the virtualization site.\n\n738\n00:35:33.678 --> 00:35:36.760\nAll that stuff's gonna be part of our\nconversations here in upcoming episodes.\n\n739\n00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.290\nBut we're just laying the foundation.\n\n740\n00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.290\nNow before we finish up cuz we're just,\njust, just about out of time.\n\n741\n00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.810\nBut I just wanna go back quickly show you,\nif we could bring this up.\n\n742\n00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:44.610\nWe waited long enough.\n\n743\n00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:48.490\nWe did actually get our trace\ncomplete results from our,\n\n744\n00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.830\nas you can see here pathping, and\nyou'll see computing statistics.\n\n745\n00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:54.490\nEventually, once we wait long\nenough we get that back.\n\n746\n00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.700\nYou'll see that we do get back our hop.\n\n747\n00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.790\nWe get back our round trip time.\n\n748\n00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.580\nWe get back our lost and sent metric.\n\n749\n00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.598\nSo did we lose anything?\n\n750\n00:36:01.598 --> 00:36:05.353\nNo, we sent, and you'll see here percent\nzero meaning we sent four paths to\n\n751\n00:36:05.353 --> 00:36:08.594\nwhatever we sent, and\neverything got there, nothing was lost.\n\n752\n00:36:08.594 --> 00:36:13.802\nAnd so we see that both for every hop as\nwe go and then we see the actual address.\n\n753\n00:36:13.802 --> 00:36:17.443\nAnd so we do get the same information,\nas you can see, that we got from,\n\n754\n00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:21.110\nwell, I don't know if trace route is up,\nwe got from trace route.\n\n755\n00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:25.190\nBut we then get the additional\ninformation on how many packets?\n\n756\n00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.350\nWhat were the milliseconds in latency?\n\n757\n00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.060\nAnd whether we lost\nanything along the way.\n\n758\n00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.897\nSo as you suggested, combining ping and\ntrace route together,\n\n759\n00:36:31.897 --> 00:36:33.525\nwhich is really what path ping does,\n\n760\n00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.204\nit gives us a little bit more detailed\ninformation, again helping us to diagnose,\n\n761\n00:36:37.204 --> 00:36:41.013\nperhaps further understand, whether or not\nwe have a routing problem along the way.\n\n762\n00:36:41.013 --> 00:36:43.128\nSo good for\nus just to remind ourselves on that.\n\n763\n00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:46.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and one thing to keep in kind\nwhen you're utilizing a tool that has\n\n764\n00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.064\nICMP as the underpinning technology,\n\n765\n00:36:48.064 --> 00:36:51.492\nsometimes we have devices that are going\nto block that for security reasons.\n\n766\n00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:55.808\nSo you might not get all the information\nyou wanted to, if that's the case,\n\n767\n00:36:55.808 --> 00:36:58.540\nyou run across something like that.\n\n768\n00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.860\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, for instance,\n\n769\n00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.800\nif we try to ping cnn.com,\nyou can see I'm getting a response back.\n\n770\n00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.410\nBut what I'm probably getting a response\nback from is a firewall or gateway device.\n\n771\n00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:10.416\nI'm not really getting a response\nback necessarily from cnn.com, or\n\n772\n00:37:10.416 --> 00:37:11.378\nwhatever it would be.\n\n773\n00:37:11.378 --> 00:37:14.184\nMeaning the web server,\nit's probably not responding,\n\n774\n00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:17.849\nit's probably literally the publicly\nrouteable IP address we talked about\n\n775\n00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:21.530\nthat's on the outside of the gateway\nthat's allowing me in to see traffic.\n\n776\n00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.520\nBut I could easily try to ping\nsomething that would block that, and\n\n777\n00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.380\nif it did then it may not respond.\n\n778\n00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.290\nAnd so you would just have to understand\nthat not every endpoint is willing to\n\n779\n00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.820\ntalk to us.\n\n780\n00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.596\nOr is allowed to talk to us, and\nit's good point for us to think about and\n\n781\n00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:35.170\nto remind ourselves as well.\n\n782\n00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.050\n&gt;&gt; Cool, well, thank you for showing that,\nand thank you for being with us as well.\n\n783\n00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:39.890\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n784\n00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.410\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n785\n00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.120\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n786\n00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.060\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n787\n00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.102\n&gt;&gt; Happy IP'ing, everybody.\n\n788\n00:37:46.102 --> 00:37:48.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n789\n00:37:48.538 --> 00:37:54.056\n[MUSIC]\n\n790\n00:37:54.056 --> 00:37:56.778\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.403\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:12.277\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:15.440\nWelcome back to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.594\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:20.767\nAnd in today's episode we're\ncontinuing through our networking with\n\n8\n00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.375\nWindows Server 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:25.772\nAnd in the first part of this episode,\nwe showed you installing DNS, so\n\n10\n00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:26.856\nwe're done, right?\n\n11\n00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:29.019\nI mean, this is gonna be the shortest\npart two you've ever seen, right?\n\n12\n00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't need to do anything else.\n\n13\n00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.209\nI kid.\n\n14\n00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:34.156\nActually, there's a lot more when\nit comes to configuring DNS.\n\n15\n00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:37.870\nAnd joining us to show us all the lovely\nDNS badness is Mr. Mike Rogers.\n\n16\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.750\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n17\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, thanks for\nhaving me back, Wes.\n\n18\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.450\nAnd yeah, there is a little more to it,\nwhich we should probably go over,\n\n19\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.420\nespecially seeing as DNS is about 20% or\nso of your grade on this exam.\n\n20\n00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.477\nSo let's get to the fun stuff,\nmaking DNS work.\n\n21\n00:00:53.477 --> 00:00:54.776\nMaking it efficient.\n\n22\n00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:56.950\nSetting it up to do what we want it to do.\n\n23\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.842\nWe saw the process of basically how DNS\nworks and how everything is split up,\n\n24\n00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:02.386\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:07.010\nThat hierarchical structure,\nthe root, the top level domain names,\n\n26\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.183\nthe come, that AU, the go,\nthe biz, all that.\n\n27\n00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:14.743\nWe saw our second level domains\nthat we register, Apple, Google,\n\n28\n00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:18.989\nITPro.TV there's another top level domain,\n.TV, right?\n\n29\n00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.156\nYou should know that one\nsince you're here with us.\n\n30\n00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:25.260\nSo when we set up our DNS server, right?\n\n31\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.880\nSo we've registered the name ITPro.TV,\nthere's a few things we gotta do to\n\n32\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.740\nconfigure it to work, so that my users\ncan resolve names of internal resources,\n\n33\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.940\nas well as resolve names of\nexternal resources, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.000\nWe're silly to think that everything\nwe need is on our network.\n\n35\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.940\nThat might've been way back in the day.\n\n36\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.980\nAnd I mean like way, way back.\n\n37\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.040\nBut now, everything we need\nis out there on the internet.\n\n38\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.400\nWe couldn't get by, I don't think,\nwithout internet access.\n\n39\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.720\nYou guys know how it is.\n\n40\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.240\nWork, internet connection goes down.\n\n41\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.364\nWhat's everybody going to do.\n\n42\n00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.046\nAah, right?\n\n43\n00:01:57.046 --> 00:01:57.788\nAnd starts freaking out.\n\n44\n00:01:57.788 --> 00:01:58.353\n&gt;&gt; That's what I do.\n\n45\n00:01:58.353 --> 00:01:59.657\n&gt;&gt; Or break out the deck of cards.\n\n46\n00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:01.181\nYou really can't do anything, right?\n\n47\n00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:03.506\nAll right, so anyway, let's see.\n\n48\n00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:04.939\nWe're gonna talk about\na couple of things here.\n\n49\n00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.222\nI want to talk about forwarders, root\nhints, delegation and a few other things.\n\n50\n00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.361\nBut those are gonna be on top of our\nlist for this particular episode.\n\n51\n00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:16.761\nSo let's start with forwarders, right?\n\n52\n00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.884\nForwaders, when you configure\na DNS server with a forwader,\n\n53\n00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:26.120\nyou're saying I want you to forward\nqueries that get, that you can't resolve\n\n54\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.696\nto this other DNS server, whatever this\nsever is, whatever I configure in there.\n\n55\n00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:32.959\nLet's break that down a little bit more.\n\n56\n00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.172\nLet's go to my drawing, so we can get\nan idea of why we might need this.\n\n57\n00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:43.189\nLet's change Apple, let's say this\nis actually a TV and this is ITPro.\n\n58\n00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.190\nAll right, so this is our DNS\nserver sitting right here, right?\n\n59\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.990\nOn that DNS server is a database.\n\n60\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.519\nWe'll find us a little database,\nwe're looking at the thing and\n\n61\n00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.942\nwe'll dump it out there.\n\n62\n00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.742\nLet's say,\n\n63\n00:02:56.742 --> 00:03:02.060\non that server is our little database that\ncontains what's called resource records.\n\n64\n00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.687\nAnd we'll go more over that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n65\n00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:06.765\nBut all the names to IP addresses, right?\n\n66\n00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:08.078\nFor ITPro.\n\n67\n00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:12.676\nSo all of the computers, the nodes,\nthat exist in our network.\n\n68\n00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:16.270\nWes' laptop, our file server,\nthings like that.\n\n69\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.778\nTheir name ends in ITPro.TV.\n\n70\n00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:24.173\nMy laptop is MikesMacBook.lab.ITPro.TV,\nfor example.\n\n71\n00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:28.631\nWell, this DNS server is the one that\nholds those names to IP address mappings.\n\n72\n00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.875\nSo if I'm a client inside the network, and\n\n73\n00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:36.755\nI need to resolve the name,\nI need to connect to our file server.\n\n74\n00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:41.743\nWell, I can simply send a query to my\nDNS server, ITPro DNS server that's here\n\n75\n00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:45.762\nin house, I say hey I need to\nconnect to file01.ITPro.TV.\n\n76\n00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:49.177\nHe looks into his database and\nsays sure here is the IP address and\n\n77\n00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:51.906\nthen I can connect to that file server,\nall right?\n\n78\n00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:55.162\nSo as long as I'm resolving a name or\nquery or\n\n79\n00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:58.949\ntrying to connect to a name\nthat ends in ITPro.TV.\n\n80\n00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.761\nThis is the only DNS server I need.\n\n81\n00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.275\nHe knows all of the names\nthat end in ITPro.TV, and\n\n82\n00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:06.577\nthere associated IP addresses.\n\n83\n00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:09.740\nGreat, but what happens when I\nwanna go beyond that, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.370\nWhat if I wanna connect to Google, or\nMicrosoft, or Apple, or whomever, right?\n\n85\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.459\nHow do I do that?\n\n86\n00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.388\nI send a question to my DNS server, hey,\nwhat's the IP address of www.Google.com?\n\n87\n00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:27.303\nMy DNS server looks in his little\ndatabase and has nothing for Google.com.\n\n88\n00:04:27.303 --> 00:04:31.753\nIt doesn't end in ITPro.TV, my DNS\nserver doesn't know about it, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:31.753 --> 00:04:33.577\nThat's where two different things,\n\n90\n00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:36.769\ntwo different technologies are gonna\ncome into play, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.393\nRoot hints and forwarders.\n\n92\n00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:42.694\nAnd really conditional forwarders too,\nwe'll throw those in there as well.\n\n93\n00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:47.587\nSo let's set up, let's go and add,\nlet's get Microsoft out of the way here.\n\n94\n00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:50.545\nLet's throw Google,\nwe'll move this guy over, oops.\n\n95\n00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:52.680\nThat little arrow was\nevidently not attached.\n\n96\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.808\nWe'll throw that there,\nand we'll bring this over.\n\n97\n00:04:56.808 --> 00:05:00.009\nAnd we'll make this a COM server,\nall right, so\n\n98\n00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.785\nthat top level domain there, and\nlet's do some switching here as well.\n\n99\n00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:07.027\nLet's make this pretty again.\n\n100\n00:05:07.027 --> 00:05:11.422\nDoing this on the fly is\nalways a fun endeavour, so\n\n101\n00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:17.702\nwe'll make it look nice and neat so\nwe can understand what's going on,\n\n102\n00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:22.537\nbring that guy over there,\nmove him and his database.\n\n103\n00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:24.101\nAnd we'll put Google here.\n\n104\n00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:29.751\nAnd we'll dump one more arrow\njust to be complete down to here.\n\n105\n00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:35.760\nWhoops, get that little green dot,\nthere we go, and attach it.\n\n106\n00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.859\nSo again, when my computer, and I'm on\nthe itpro tv network says, hey I need\n\n107\n00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:46.125\nto connect to www.Google.com, my DNS\nserver doesn't know that IP address.\n\n108\n00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.358\nSo what do we need to do\nto find that IP address?\n\n109\n00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:52.522\nWell, we need to make it over\nto here to Google's DNS server.\n\n110\n00:05:52.522 --> 00:05:58.103\nGoogle's DNS server, just like ITPro's DNS\nserver knows all the names for ITPro.TV.\n\n111\n00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:01.201\nGoogle's DNS server\nknows all the names for\n\n112\n00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:05.647\nall the nodes on google.com,\nincluding www.Google.com.\n\n113\n00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:07.079\nSo we need to get to this guy somehow.\n\n114\n00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:09.070\nThat's the one that can\nanswer my question.\n\n115\n00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.118\nBut again, my DNS server doesn't know it.\n\n116\n00:06:11.118 --> 00:06:15.477\nSo what happens is, and we'll break this\ndown a little bit further and in more\n\n117\n00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:20.122\ndetail as far as the types of queries and\nhow this is working in upcoming episodes.\n\n118\n00:06:20.122 --> 00:06:24.872\nBut just to get that kind of over\nviewing or over arching picture here.\n\n119\n00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:27.587\nMy DNS server needs to get to the top.\n\n120\n00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.405\nWe already said that in a previous\nepisode, we start at the top and\n\n121\n00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:31.236\nwork our way down.\n\n122\n00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:32.242\nWe start at the root.\n\n123\n00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:36.382\nHe sends us to the appropriate top level,\ncom, gov, biz, whatever, and\n\n124\n00:06:36.382 --> 00:06:38.768\nthen guy sends us to\nthe actual DNS server.\n\n125\n00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:41.267\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nyou were saying that it resolves name.\n\n126\n00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.607\nSo my question would be,\nhow does it know root?\n\n127\n00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:45.351\nI mean, how does it know root?\n\n128\n00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:45.996\nDoes it know the names?\n\n129\n00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:47.696\nSays, hey root, I need to talk to you.\n\n130\n00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:49.366\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Wes.\n\n131\n00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:53.854\nAnd how does he get to the root, because\nif we've decided we've gotta start at\n\n132\n00:06:53.854 --> 00:06:58.800\nthe top and work our way down, that means\nI need to know how to get to the top.\n\n133\n00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.271\nThat's where root hints come into play.\n\n134\n00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:05.282\nIf we take a look at,\nit doesn't matter what DNS server,\n\n135\n00:07:05.282 --> 00:07:07.714\nwe'll use whichever one this is.\n\n136\n00:07:07.714 --> 00:07:09.952\nLet's open up DNS on this guy.\n\n137\n00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:14.819\nAnd I'm gonna pull up\nthe properties of this DNS server.\n\n138\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.960\nAnd I'm gonna go to something\ncalled the Root Hints tab.\n\n139\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.130\nAnd on the Root Hints\ntab are the IP addresses\n\n140\n00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.340\nof all of the root servers out there.\n\n141\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.830\nSo this is how my DNS server is\nable to start at the top and\n\n142\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.230\nwork it's way down, right?\n\n143\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.490\nAnd it kinda make sense, when you think\nabout it you gotta have a starting point,\n\n144\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.720\neasy enough to give them a few IP\naddresses of the starting point.\n\n145\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.307\nI'm don't have to list\nmillions of addresses.\n\n146\n00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:41.008\nI'll just list a few in there.\n\n147\n00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:43.402\nGet to the top, and\nthen work your way down.\n\n148\n00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:46.298\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now I gotta call you\nout on your diagram there Mike.\n\n149\n00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:49.532\nCuz when I look at this list versus\nthe root that you have on that diagram,\n\n150\n00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:51.880\nit seems be just a little\nbit more than just one root.\n\n151\n00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.750\nCan you explain that for me?\n\n152\n00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.663\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n153\n00:07:53.663 --> 00:07:58.273\nMy drawing simply needs to\nbe duplicated a few times.\n\n154\n00:07:58.273 --> 00:07:59.350\nThere we go.\nWill that work?\n\n155\n00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.034\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is great.\n\n156\n00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:02.334\n&gt;&gt; Let's undo that.\n\n157\n00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:04.170\nNo, it's a great point, Wes.\n\n158\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.820\nObviously, even with the workload split\nup that we talked, taking the route and\n\n159\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.690\nsaying, look, you just need to know\nwhere the top level domains are.\n\n160\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.675\nThat's all you need to know.\n\n161\n00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:16.851\nThat's still a lot of work when you're\ntalking about millions of people that\n\n162\n00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:19.431\nare surfing the Internet, 24/7, right?\n\n163\n00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.788\nSo, these root servers\nare constantly getting quarries, and\n\n164\n00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:26.903\nthey're constantly redirecting people\nto the dot com, or the the dot tv, or\n\n165\n00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:28.950\nthe dot gov, or what have you.\n\n166\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.840\nSo there's 13 root servers, right?\n\n167\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.230\nWe look at this list, you're gonna\nsee that it's actually a through m,\n\n168\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.600\nwhich is 13, and if we count them up\nin our English language, 13 letters.\n\n169\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.390\nSo, that's 13, what they call root\nservers, and we don't stop there, even 13\n\n170\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.860\nwould be a little bit low on the number of\nservers we need to support the workload.\n\n171\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.010\nSo, when you look at root server g,\n\n172\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.440\nthat's not just one little Dell\nserver in a server closet somewhere,\n\n173\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.020\nthat's actually geographically\ndispersed server farm, right?\n\n174\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.590\nIt's many, many servers in many\ndifferent places for fall tolerance,\n\n175\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.550\nredundancy, load balancing, security,\nthings like that, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.650\nSo, even though you'll read in books\nthat say there's 13 root servers,\n\n177\n00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.660\n13 logical root servers.\n\n178\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.800\nBehind each one of these root servers is\nactually anywhere from a few to dozens\n\n179\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.480\nof actual servers that are doing the work,\nall right?\n\n180\n00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.070\nBut that's a great question, and\nhopefully that answers the question,\n\n181\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.960\nthat's how you find the very\ntop of that infrastructure.\n\n182\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.400\nIn fact, if you remove all these, if I was\nto select all these guys and remove them,\n\n183\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.920\nmy DNS server would not be able to resolve\nnames on its own outside the organization.\n\n184\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.480\nSometimes we actually wanna do that.\n\n185\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.340\nWe want to prevent,\n\n186\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.550\nif I've got a development environment\nthat's highly sensitive, and it can't have\n\n187\n00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.910\nInternet access, one way to do that or one\nway to one of the pieces in the puzzle,\n\n188\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.460\nthat wouldn't be the complete solution,\nbut one piece would be\n\n189\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.620\nto remove the root hits from that DNS\nserver for that particular environment.\n\n190\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.210\nThat way,\n\n191\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.490\nthe DNS server could not even attempt\nto start to resolve external names.\n\n192\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.520\nObviously not gonna prevent anybody from\ngetting out if they know the IP address,\n\n193\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.590\nthey could simply type it in.\n\n194\n00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.290\nI'm just saying that's\none piece of the puzzle.\n\n195\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.750\nAll right, so now,\nmy server can make it to top.\n\n196\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.300\nYou can use those root hands to find\nthe root DNS servers and say, hey,\n\n197\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:33.110\nmy users asking me about www.google.com.\n\n198\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.970\nWhat's the IP address?\n\n199\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.120\nHow can I get to there?\n\n200\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.970\nThe root, of course, is I don't know, but\n\n201\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:42.020\nit directs my DNS server\nto the dot com DNS server.\n\n202\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.330\nThe dot com DNS server tells my DNS server\nI don't know that IP address either, but\n\n203\n00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.710\nI do know the IP address of\nthe Google.com DNS server,\n\n204\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.080\nwhy don't you go check with him?\n\n205\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.210\nMy DNS server goes and\nchecks with Google, and Google says yeah,\n\n206\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.980\nsure, here's the IP address for\nwww.google.com.\n\n207\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.900\nGives it back to my DNS server,\nwho finally answers my client's query and\n\n208\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.020\nsays here's the IP address\nyou're looking for, and\n\n209\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.724\nmy browser opens up to www.google.com,\nright?\n\n210\n00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:09.450\nSo, that's the process\nthat it goes through.\n\n211\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.150\nAnd again, we'll talk about that again.\n\n212\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.680\nWhat forwarders allow me to do is\n\n213\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.850\nforward queries on that my DNS\nserver can't resolve on its own.\n\n214\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.150\nAll right,\njust like we were talking about.\n\n215\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.090\nWith ITPRO.TV's DNS server,\n\n216\n00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.480\nhe cannot resolve any names\nthat don't have an ITPRO.TV.\n\n217\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.230\nWhat I can do, is I can tell my DNS\nserver look, if a node questions you,\n\n218\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.009\nqueries you, it says what's the IP address\nfor file1.itpro.tv, give him the answer.\n\n219\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.790\nIf they ask you for Google.com,\nwell, you get two choices.\n\n220\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.240\nYou could go to the root and find it for\nthe user, or you could just forward that\n\n221\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.010\nquery on to somebody else and\nlet them do all the work.\n\n222\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.900\nAnd that's what we typically do\nin our corporate environments.\n\n223\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.810\nMy DNS servers are busy enough\nresolving names for all of my users.\n\n224\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.510\nAll the log on traffic,\nall the connections to servers.\n\n225\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.380\nTo other nodes, I mean,\nall that stuff is requiring DNS.\n\n226\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.350\nSo my DNS servers are busy all day long,\nresolving named IP address queries for\n\n227\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.100\ninternal resources and an itpro.tv.\n\n228\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.950\nWhen one of my users needs\nto go an external site,\n\n229\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.720\nI tell my DNS server don't waste your\ntime on it, I know you could get it.\n\n230\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.690\nYou could go to the root and\nfigure it out.\n\n231\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.350\nJust forward it on to this guy,\nlet him do all the work.\n\n232\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.070\nYou get back to doing what you best,\nresolving internal names.\n\n233\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.230\nThat's what a forwarder allows me to do.\n\n234\n00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.330\nNow, who do we forward it to?\n\n235\n00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.998\nAnd I keep saying, well,\nwe'll let that guy do it.\n\n236\n00:12:32.998 --> 00:12:34.311\nWho is that guy?\n\n237\n00:12:34.311 --> 00:12:38.660\nA lot of times it's your ISP DN server.\n\n238\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:44.570\nYour ISP got big, bad, beefy DNS servers\nto support all their customers, right?\n\n239\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.790\nI can tell my DNS server,\nhey, just go give it to him.\n\n240\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.170\nLet him do the work.\n\n241\n00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.610\nHe'll tell you the answer.\n\n242\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.330\nYou can give it back to the client,\nand we're happy.\n\n243\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.960\nYou're busy doing your\ninternal DNS resolution.\n\n244\n00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.030\nYou're passing the workload off\non the external resolution.\n\n245\n00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.600\nEverybody can still get Internet access,\nall right?\n\n246\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.270\nHere's an example.\n\n247\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.060\nIf we look at, let's switch over\nto my other domain controller.\n\n248\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.035\nAll right, this is my domain\ncontroller for lab.itprotv,\n\n249\n00:13:12.035 --> 00:13:18.376\nall right, and if I try to,\nlet's open up Command Prompt here.\n\n250\n00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:23.473\nIf I try to ping, I don't know, node01.\n\n251\n00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:27.200\nWell, that's one of my nodes and\nhe's not gonna respond on the pings.\n\n252\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.360\nI didn't open up the firewall,\nbut nah, but anyway,\n\n253\n00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.750\nyou'll see that it was able to resolve\nthe name into an IP address, right?\n\n254\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.100\nBecause that information\nis in my zone file.\n\n255\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.690\nLab.itprotv, there's node01,\nand there's his IP address.\n\n256\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.320\nRight there, node01, so that's how it's\nlooking that up and it's giving back to,\n\n257\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.110\nin this case PowerShell, my application,\nthe IP address that he's asking for.\n\n258\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:14:01.100\nBut, in here, you don't see anything for\nwww.google.com, right, or microsoft.com.\n\n259\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.480\nLet's see what happens if I try\nto ping Microsoft, all right,\n\n260\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.467\nlet's see somebody that'll respond,\nGoogle.com, all right?\n\n261\n00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:14.840\nNotice it's still able to resolve\nthe name into the IP address, and\n\n262\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.212\nthat's because it's got these two choices,\nit can go to the root,\n\n263\n00:14:18.212 --> 00:14:21.552\nor it can use forwarders, and\nin my case, I'm using forwarders.\n\n264\n00:14:21.552 --> 00:14:24.686\nSo, I'm gonna pull up the properties\nof this DNS server, and\n\n265\n00:14:24.686 --> 00:14:26.626\nI'm gonna look at my forwarders tab.\n\n266\n00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:30.199\nAnd here we can see that I've\ntold my DNS server hey, look,\n\n267\n00:14:30.199 --> 00:14:34.631\nIf somebody sends you a query that you\ncan't lookup in your own database,\n\n268\n00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:38.890\njust forward it on to this guy right here,\nlet them do the work.\n\n269\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.130\nThat happens to Google's\npublic DNS servers, right?\n\n270\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.120\nAnd I've got more than listed.\n\n271\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.570\nIf the first one doesn't respond,\nif I try to forward it on, and\n\n272\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.946\nthat server doesn't respond to me,\nI've got an alternate.\n\n273\n00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:53.600\nThat guy must be down,\nI'll forward it onto this guy, all right?\n\n274\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.300\nAnd that way, my DNS server can be busy\ndoing his internal name resolution.\n\n275\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.080\nExternal names can still get resolved,\n\n276\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.770\nbecause I can just forward\nthem on to somebody else.\n\n277\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Mike, now what happens with the results\nof that query, as far as when you do get\n\n278\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.340\nthat answer back, your server,\nthe local machine gets an answer?\n\n279\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.300\nWhat happens to the results\nof that query once it's done?\n\n280\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think you're\ntalking about caching, right?\n\n281\n00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.410\nAnd we'll get back to that.\n\n282\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.790\nI wanna hold that thought until we get\na little more into the types of queries.\n\n283\n00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.030\nBut they are,\nthose results are gonna be cached, so\n\n284\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.130\nthat we don't actually have to\ngo look it up every single time,\n\n285\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.520\nwhich is a real big time saver\nwhen it comes to name resolution.\n\n286\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.700\nSo we will, great question, but\nlet's put a pause on that one.\n\n287\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.800\nAll right, now, you'll also\nnotice there's a question here.\n\n288\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.070\nUse root hints if no\nforwarders are available.\n\n289\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.330\nSo, what I'm basically\ntelling my DNS server is,\n\n290\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.210\nanything that you can look\nup in your own database do.\n\n291\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.203\nIf it's not in there, forward it on to one\nof these guys, either 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4.\n\n292\n00:15:49.203 --> 00:15:53.035\nIf none of those guys are responding,\nif you try to forward it on, and\n\n293\n00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:56.158\nneither one of them is available,\nuse your root hints.\n\n294\n00:15:56.158 --> 00:16:00.140\nJust go up to the top, you've already got\nthe IP addresses of all the roots servers.\n\n295\n00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.750\nJust do it yourself.\n\n296\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.690\nI don't want you to do the work, but\nif none of your folders are available,\n\n297\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.180\ngo ahead and do the work, all right?\n\n298\n00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.090\nLet's see what happens.\n\n299\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.650\nWhat if I uncheck use root hands?\n\n300\n00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.450\nEverything is still gonna work\nbecause those two guys are available.\n\n301\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.660\nWhat if I remove these guys?\n\n302\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.690\nLet's take them out of the list.\n\n303\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.570\nAnd click okay and click okay.\n\n304\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.620\nDo a change OS.\n\n305\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.180\nAnd I'm going to flush out any caches\njust to make sure we don't get any\n\n306\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.380\nmisleading results.\n\n307\n00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.110\nOops, if I can spell.\n\n308\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.722\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:16:39.722 --> 00:16:44.060\nWe'll flush that and there's actually\nanother cache that I want to flush.\n\n310\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.980\nDNS CMD/clear cache.\n\n311\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.740\nAnd again we'll; talk about\nall of this coming up.\n\n312\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.172\nAlright, so now, no roots hits available,\nI've unchecked that.\n\n313\n00:16:55.172 --> 00:17:00.390\nI've removed my forwarders I'm gonna ping\n\n314\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:05.050\nmicrosoft.com and see what happens.\n\n315\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:10.390\nIt's not looking good for\nthe home team, is it?\n\n316\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.350\nHey we can wait a little bit.\n\n317\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:17.140\nIt is going to fail and\nthe error that we should see is ping\n\n318\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.370\nrequest could not find host Microsoft.com,\nplease check the name and try again.\n\n319\n00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.260\nSo it looked in this database over\nhere and said, you know what,\n\n320\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.250\nthere's nothing named\nMicrosoft.com in here, all right.\n\n321\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.700\nIt doesn't have any root hints,\ncuz I unchecked it.\n\n322\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.500\nSo it can't go start at the top and\nfind it,\n\n323\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.240\nand there's nobody to forward it\nto cuz I removed all of those.\n\n324\n00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.560\nSi if i try to ping google.com,\nsame thing is gonna happen,\n\n325\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.700\nit's gonna time out and it's not going\nto be able to resolve that name.\n\n326\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.862\nIf I simply go back over here and\nturn on forwarding, oops,\n\n327\n00:17:52.862 --> 00:17:59.269\nthe wrong one, right click properties and\nI'm going to my forwarders and\n\n328\n00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:03.428\nI'll click edit and I'll add a .8.8.8.\n\n329\n00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:09.341\nAnd I'll click OK and OK.\n\n330\n00:18:09.341 --> 00:18:11.960\nAnd we'll try that one more time.\n\n331\n00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.300\nPing Google, look at that,\nworks like a charm.\n\n332\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.000\nLet's ping Microsoft and\nit worked like a charm as well.\n\n333\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.760\nNow Microsoft doesn't respond, but\nthat's not what we're looking at.\n\n334\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.340\nWe're looking at the fact that\nit was able to take the name and\n\n335\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.170\nturn it into an IP address.\n\n336\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.860\nThat's because my DNS server\ncan't resolve it, but\n\n337\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.420\nit forwarded it out to one of\nGoogle's public DNS servers.\n\n338\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.003\nAnd Google's public DNS\nserver can go to the root and\n\n339\n00:18:34.003 --> 00:18:38.150\nthe .com and then the Microsoft.com and\nget the answer I'm looking for.\n\n340\n00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.610\nSo that's the idea behind forwarders.\n\n341\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.550\nAnd that's really just one\nexample of forwarders.\n\n342\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.910\nAnother place you'll see forwarders\nis in a heavily domained forest.\n\n343\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.490\nWhen i have multiple domains in my forest,\n\n344\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.060\nif I'm in one of these way\ndown nested child domains, and\n\n345\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.960\nI need to get all over to another active\ndirectory tree to connect to a resource.\n\n346\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.290\nI've got to go through all these DNS\nservers and I will show you this later to\n\n347\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.880\nget over there to find the authoritative\nDNS server to get that IP address.\n\n348\n00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.640\nForwarding allows me to\nstraight to the guy, all right?\n\n349\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.090\nSo another good example.\n\n350\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.200\nIn a corporate environment, a lot times we\nhave multiple DNS servers for redundancy,\n\n351\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.510\nand fault tolerance, and load balancing.\n\n352\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.950\nI don't need every one of my DNS servers\ngoing out and resolving external names.\n\n353\n00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.510\nMaybe I don't want to forward to Google.\n\n354\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.880\nI want my DNS server doing\nthat external name resolution.\n\n355\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.610\nBecause I can one,\nI can log that information,\n\n356\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.710\nI can control what they're allowed\nto do and not do a little better.\n\n357\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.750\nSo maybe I don't wanna forward it.\n\n358\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.700\nI want one of my DNS servers to be\nthe guy that goes out to the root, and\n\n359\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.280\nworks his way down.\n\n360\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.790\nWell if I only want one of them to do it,\nwhat I do is,\n\n361\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.260\nall my other DNS servers,\nI take away their root heads.\n\n362\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.520\nAnd then I forward their external queries,\n\n363\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.070\nnames they don't know,\nto that one DNS server of mine, right?\n\n364\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.810\nSo he becomes the external\nname resolution point for\n\n365\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.280\nall the other DNS servers\nin my organization.\n\n366\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.040\nThat way, I've got.\n\n367\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.970\nThere's a lot to it.\n\n368\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.520\nWe haven't talked about caching.\n\n369\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.570\nWes brought that up a minute ago.\n\n370\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.300\nBut there's a lot of advantages\nof doing it that way.\n\n371\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.020\nOne of the big ones is actually caching.\n\n372\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.510\nSo a couple of uses for forwarding.\n\n373\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:17.050\nSo we've looked at forwarding,\nwe've looked at root hints, right.\n\n374\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.430\nNext thing I really want to talk about,\n\n375\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.970\nI might be skipping around on you here,\nWes, is conditional forwarding.\n\n376\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.000\nI actually don't even see it on the list.\n\n377\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.490\nMicrosoft, you're letting me down.\n\n378\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.830\nBut we're gonna do some\nconditional forwarding anyway,\n\n379\n00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.660\nbecause forwarding is just that.\n\n380\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.710\nI'm a DNS server.\n\n381\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.660\nI get a query.\n\n382\n00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.040\nIf I can look it up, great.\n\n383\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.430\nIf it's not in my\ndatabase I forward it on.\n\n384\n00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.890\nDoesn't matter who the query's for.\n\n385\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.260\nIf it's not in my database\nI'm gonna forward it on\n\n386\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.650\nto that IP address like I listed here,\n8.8.8.8.\n\n387\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.150\nConditional forwarding\nallows me to forward it\n\n388\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.520\nbased on the name I'm trying to resolve.\n\n389\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.760\nThe condition part of that.\n\n390\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.740\nIf they're looking for ABC.com,\nforward it to this guy, all right?\n\n391\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.030\nWhat if I know the IP address\nof Google's DNS server?\n\n392\n00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.170\nI actually do, because it's public\n[LAUGH], so that's not the best example.\n\n393\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.220\nLet's say you've got a business partner,\nContoso.com, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.610\nAnd your users are continuously\naccessing resources.\n\n395\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.550\nYou're in ITproTV, but\nyour users are always reaching out and\n\n396\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.120\nconnecting to resources\nover there at Contoso.com.\n\n397\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.200\nThat means, every time they go to connect,\n\n398\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.170\nI gotta query my DNS server, my DNS\nserver's gonna go up to the root, and\n\n399\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.830\nthen the .com, and then the Contoso.com,\nand then finally get the answer.\n\n400\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.550\nWhat if I could skip that?\n\n401\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.310\nIf I know I'm a good business\npartner with Contoso,\n\n402\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.490\nthey'll give me the IP\naddress of their DNS server.\n\n403\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.610\nIt's public information.\n\n404\n00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.250\nI can really get it anywhere.\n\n405\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.570\nWhat if I could just send\nthat query straight to them?\n\n406\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.510\nWithout having to go to the root and\nthe dot com.\n\n407\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.630\nBecause the only reason\nI'm going to the root and\n\n408\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.500\nthe dot com server is to find\nContoso.com's DNS server.\n\n409\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.230\nIf I already know that IP address,\n\n410\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.840\nshouldn't there be a way I can tell\nmy DNS server, hey, here it is?\n\n411\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.390\nAnd that's what conditional\nforwarding allows me to do,\n\n412\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.660\nit says, hey, I know the IP\naddress that you're looking for\n\n413\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.960\nof the DNS server that's responsible for\nthat.\n\n414\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.010\nHere it is, just go straight to them.\n\n415\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.270\nThat's conditional forwarding.\n\n416\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.240\nAnd you can set up as many\nconditional forwarding rules\n\n417\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.800\nas you need to if you have\nseveral business partners.\n\n418\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.390\nI can have one that says, hey, if you're\nquerying a name that ends in Contoso.com,\n\n419\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.140\nsend it here, if you're querying\na name that ends in practice-labs.com,\n\n420\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.010\nhere's their DNS server, send it there.\n\n421\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.960\nAnything else, still forward it\nout to my ISPs DNS server, but for\n\n422\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.450\nthose two namespaces, goes straight\nto them and save us some time.\n\n423\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you did make mention when\nyou were talking about the top level and\n\n424\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.690\nsecond level domains.\n\n425\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.730\nYou said anything past the second level\ndomain can get a little crazy, right?\n\n426\n00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.060\nWe can have all these dots\nin front of the name.\n\n427\n00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.700\nWhat if I have an internal company cuz\nyou're mentioning business partners.\n\n428\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.560\nWhat if I have my own company and\nlet's say we're so big we've got a,\n\n429\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.695\nfor instance,\n\n430\n00:22:46.695 --> 00:22:51.650\nFlorida.southeast.easternunitedstates.myc-\nompany.com.\n\n431\n00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.760\nCan we use conditional forwarding to\nmaybe get to our answer a little quicker?\n\n432\n00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n433\n00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.350\nif you've got a heavily domained forest\nlike that we can do the same thing.\n\n434\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.150\nIf most of the resources that\nyour users are accessing or\n\n435\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.240\nif they do it a lot, in another domain\nsimply set up conditional forwarding.\n\n436\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.520\nNothing says it has to\nbe external from you.\n\n437\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.316\nSo if I'm in east.us.itpro.tv, but\n\n438\n00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:23.420\na lot of the resources that I connect\nto are over there in west.au.itpro.tv,\n\n439\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.280\nI can set up conditional forwarder that\nsays, if it ends in west.au.itpro.tv,\n\n440\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.950\nhere's the IP address of their DNS server,\ngo straight to it.\n\n441\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.590\nSo it can definitely be internal,\nexternal, doesn't matter,\n\n442\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.890\ndoesn't change what we're doing or\nwhy we're doing it, all right?\n\n443\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.170\nAnd I don't need permissions for\n\n444\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.280\nconditional forwarding because again,\nif I was to go through the root and\n\n445\n00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.210\nthe dot com, I would eventually find\nContoso.com's DNS server's IP address.\n\n446\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.980\nIt's public information.\n\n447\n00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.454\nThey want people to be able\nto connect to their website.\n\n448\n00:23:52.454 --> 00:23:56.892\nSo it's not like I need permissions to set\nup conditional forwarding over to that\n\n449\n00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:58.142\nother organization.\n\n450\n00:23:58.142 --> 00:23:59.489\nOr if it is internal.\n\n451\n00:23:59.489 --> 00:24:03.470\nI don't need permissions in other\ndomain to be able to set this up.\n\n452\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.330\nIt's not necessary.\n\n453\n00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.720\nWhere do I do conditional forwarding?\n\n454\n00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.440\nWell, let's take a peek.\n\n455\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.520\nThere is a node.\n\n456\n00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.210\nThis used to be, a few editions ago,\nI think, 2003 or maybe 2008,\n\n457\n00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.420\nit used to be on the properties\nof the DNS server.\n\n458\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.060\nThat's where you saw\nconditional folders tab.\n\n459\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.180\nNow it's its own node out\nhere in the DNS console.\n\n460\n00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.970\nAnd you simply right-click and\nNew conditional folder.\n\n461\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.500\nAll right, before I do that,\nlet's do a little test.\n\n462\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.430\nI've got another domain, and I can't for\nthe life of me remember what I called it.\n\n463\n00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.915\nSo we're gonna flip over here,\ndev, I believe is what it is.\n\n464\n00:24:39.915 --> 00:24:44.190\nDebt.ITPRODITHE.US/G, The one\nthat we set up from a minute ago.\n\n465\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.900\nAnd let's make a quick record in here.\n\n466\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.069\nWhat we got to domain controllers' right.\n\n467\n00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:52.260\nAnd we can do that.\n\n468\n00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.060\nAll right, so, here's are 10 0 100, 151.\n\n469\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.460\nLet's make another one real quick for\nclient, the one.\n\n470\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:08.240\nNow we'll do 10.0.100.155 and\nI'll click Add Host, and OK, and Done.\n\n471\n00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.430\nI know we did that quick, that's okay,\nthis isn't the episode to learn about\n\n472\n00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.350\nresource records,\nthat's coming up so never fear.\n\n473\n00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.050\nBut now I've got another record\nin there for this client01.\n\n474\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.980\nIf I go back to my other domain\ncontroller, different domain.\n\n475\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.430\nAll right and I try to ping,\n\n476\n00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.330\nnot keeping, there's no kingpin here.\n\n477\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:38.459\nPing, well as client01.dev.itpro.us\n\n478\n00:25:40.471 --> 00:25:43.680\nSound right, I think.\n\n479\n00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n480\n00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.900\ncould not find host client01.dev.itpro.us.\n\n481\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.880\nAnd that's because my server,\n\n482\n00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.310\nactually we added a forwarder,\nbut I took away the root hence.\n\n483\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.430\nAnd these are internal test domains, so\n\n484\n00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.450\nthey're not registered like with a dot\ncom server, or anything like that.\n\n485\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.360\nSo it's not gonna work anyway, but\n\n486\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.240\nit does give me the opportunity to show\nyou how conditional forwarding can work.\n\n487\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.910\nIf I go to the DNS server for lab.ITPROTV,\n\n488\n00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:14.360\nwho we just saw could not\nresolve client01.dev.itpro.us.\n\n489\n00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.600\nWhat if I come over here and\nI make a new conditional forwarder?\n\n490\n00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:23.834\nAnd I say, anything that ends\nin itpro .us, all right.\n\n491\n00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:30.730\nActually let's make that dev.itpro.us.\n\n492\n00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.972\nMake sure I type that in correctly.\n\n493\n00:26:32.972 --> 00:26:34.570\nDev.itpro.us.\n\n494\n00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:41.170\nThe IP address of their DNS server\nof dev.itpro.us is 10.0.100\n\n495\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:46.830\n151 I believe is what I said, alright.\n\n496\n00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:52.420\nAnd it does have a little red x,\nit's telling me that it's validated,\n\n497\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.230\nI can't read that there.\n\n498\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.710\nI can't remember what that error says.\n\n499\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.240\nBut it'll actually work.\n\n500\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.800\nIt's a time thing, eventually it'll\nresolve it and it'll be okay.\n\n501\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.850\nAlright.\nI can also when I'm setting up conditional\n\n502\n00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.130\nforwarding, store this conditional\nforwarder in active directory and\n\n503\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.170\nreplicate it.\n\n504\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.930\nIf I have other DNS\nservers in my network and\n\n505\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.830\nI want them to have the same\nconditional forwarding rule,\n\n506\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.760\nI can store it in active directory and\nshare it with all my DNS servers.\n\n507\n00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.640\nI don't have to create this on\nevery single one of my DNS servers.\n\n508\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.100\nSo we'll store it in active directory and\nwe'll click OK.\n\n509\n00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.285\nSo I've got a conditional floating rule\nthat is a can anybody try to resolve\n\n510\n00:27:29.285 --> 00:27:34.120\ndiv.ITPRO.US here is the IP address for\nthat DNS sever just folded it over there.\n\n511\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.420\nSo let's go back over here and\nlet's try that again.\n\n512\n00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.750\nlet's clear out my cache,\n\n513\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.921\nclear my screen, and\n\n514\n00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:54.563\nI will ping that again.\n\n515\n00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:55.250\nAnd look at there.\n\n516\n00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.840\nAs soon as I clean my cache again\nthe cache is very important let's major in\n\n517\n00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.270\nthat earlier I gonna come back and\ntalk to you about that but\n\n518\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.210\nnotice that it was abler to resolve at\nthis time, it turned the IP as fake,\n\n519\n00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.260\nwe just made it up a second ago so\nit's not gonna reply.\n\n520\n00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.848\nBut it did take the name and\nturn it into an IP address.\n\n521\n00:28:11.848 --> 00:28:17.700\nBecause my [INAUDIBLE] said I\ndon't know client01.dev.itpro.us.\n\n522\n00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.070\nBut wait,\nI know where their DNS server is.\n\n523\n00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.920\nAnd sent it over that DNS server.\n\n524\n00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.640\nAnd that DNS server said yes,\nI know client01.\n\n525\n00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.170\nHere's the IP address right there.\n\n526\n00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.280\nThere you go.\nAll right, so\n\n527\n00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.060\nthat's conditional forwarding.\n\n528\n00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.790\nInstead of just forwarding everything you\ndon't know to a particular IP address,\n\n529\n00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.950\nconditional forwarding says,\nif it ends in this, forward it here.\n\n530\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.710\nIf it ends in this, forward it to here.\n\n531\n00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.680\nThat's what conditional\nforwarding is all about.\n\n532\n00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.520\nSo we got our forwarders down.\n\n533\n00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.710\nThat's for sending all unknown queries.\n\n534\n00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.450\nThat's what a forwarder is for.\n\n535\n00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.410\nWe got conditional forwarding\nwhere we can say forward it\n\n536\n00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.710\nto a certain IP address based on\nthe name you're trying to resolve and\n\n537\n00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.680\nwe can definitely mix and match, right?\n\n538\n00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.140\nMy dns server now, let's flip back\nover to dc1, has both going on.\n\n539\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.901\nIt's got a conditional forwarding\nrule that says if it ends in\n\n540\n00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:14.033\ndev.itpro.us send it here,\nbut it also still has.\n\n541\n00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.810\nA regular forwarder, 888.\n\n542\n00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.206\nSo now I can resolve names\nthat end in ITPro.tv.\n\n543\n00:29:21.206 --> 00:29:23.800\nnode01.itpro.tv All right.\n\n544\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:32.910\nDid I not spell that wrong That's odd.\n\n545\n00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.380\nSorry, lab.itpro.tv, wrong domain name.\n\n546\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.352\nCan't resolve that name cuz\nit doesn't exist in here.\n\n547\n00:29:38.352 --> 00:29:40.687\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n548\n00:29:43.215 --> 00:29:44.880\nSo I can resolve internal names.\n\n549\n00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.260\nI can also resolve names that end in a\ncompletely different domain because of my\n\n550\n00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.180\nconditional forwarding that still works.\n\n551\n00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.473\nAnd I can resolve just general\nexternal names, ping cnn.com.\n\n552\n00:29:58.473 --> 00:30:01.340\nAnd notice it's able to resolve that.\n\n553\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.420\nSo, by setting up my DNS\nproperly I can control,\n\n554\n00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.880\nare we resolving just internal names?\n\n555\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.970\nJust internal names and\na few business partners, external names.\n\n556\n00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.990\nWho's doing the work?\n\n557\n00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.730\nIs it my DNS server that's\nresolving those external names?\n\n558\n00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.890\nOr do I want to use forwarders and\npush that work load off to somebody else?\n\n559\n00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.590\nDo I want to take away the root hint so\nmy DNS server can't make it to the top and\n\n560\n00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.370\nresolve those external names?\n\n561\n00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.190\nIf I do forwarders but no root\nhints If I try to forward it on to,\n\n562\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.390\nsay, in this case Google's\npublic DNS server.\n\n563\n00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.250\nIf that server doesn't respond and I don't\nhave root hints, I'm dead in the water.\n\n564\n00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.140\nI won't be able to resolve those names.\n\n565\n00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.550\nSo you see how we can play with\nthese configurations to control\n\n566\n00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.870\nhow name Names get resolved\nin within our DNS hierarchy.\n\n567\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.950\nIf you looked at the logical drawing\nof where those queries are going,\n\n568\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.970\nI think we might need to\nstop Mike right now or\n\n569\n00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.193\nwe're gonna have a outline of\nCthulhu's face or something like that.\n\n570\n00:30:52.193 --> 00:30:53.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, boy, they are going everywhere.\n\n571\n00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.830\nThat's great information,\nbut you know it's so.\n\n572\n00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.230\nKinda looking at the notes in\nthe background here, we got so\n\n573\n00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.090\nmuch more to again,\n\n574\n00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.630\nit's such an awesome topic, but we are\ngonna have to save it for a part three.\n\n575\n00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.475\nWe're gonna work on DNS\nthe miniseries coming up.\n\n576\n00:31:05.475 --> 00:31:06.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike, before we do,\n\n577\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.890\nall joking aside,\nbefore we do end this one, but\n\n578\n00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.230\ndo you got anything else you'd\nlike to throw in this one.\n\n579\n00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.580\n&gt;&gt; I do but I guess we're out of time,\nso no not for this episode.\n\n580\n00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.890\nThere is more to come, though.\n\n581\n00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's awesome.\n\n582\n00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.620\nWell, thank you for being here and\nwe thank you for watching.\n\n583\n00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.250\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time to sign out.\n\n584\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.810\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n585\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n586\n00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.215\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n587\n00:31:25.215 --> 00:31:31.107\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:31:31.107 --> 00:31:33.570\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Franscisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.519\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:08.192\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:11.013\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:14.631\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:19.236\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n8\n00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.618\nnetworking and Windows Server 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:26.110\nAnd we're coming back with not a part two,\nbut a part three here in DNS.\n\n10\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.110\nAnd joining me back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.915\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:30.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing good.\n\n13\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.370\nThanks for having me back for,\nas you said,\n\n14\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.750\nour miniseries on DNS\nthat we're going through.\n\n15\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.130\nWe are getting close to the end.\n\n16\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.298\nThere's probably gonna be one more part,\njust don't tell Wes yet.\n\n17\n00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:42.020\n[LAUGH] All right, all right.\n\n18\n00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.790\nSo yes, we left off, we had talked\nabout root hints, and forwarders, and\n\n19\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.410\nconditional forwarding when it comes to\nconfiguring our DNS server to be able to\n\n20\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.960\nresolve internal names, external names,\nhow we handle that process.\n\n21\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.330\nThe next thing I wanna talk about is\ndelegation, and we've got to kind of go\n\n22\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330\nback to the beginning to understand\nwhy we need to delegate.\n\n23\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.190\nSo let's go back to my drawing here, and\nwe're gonna modify it a little bit again.\n\n24\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.730\nI'm gonna move client out of\nthe way just for a second.\n\n25\n00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.460\nAnd we're gonna add a domain\ninto the picture here.\n\n26\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.500\nCuz this is really where\nthis comes into play.\n\n27\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.180\nSo let's find a triangle, cuz that's\ntypically our symbol for a domain.\n\n28\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.090\nAnd I'm gonna say here's\nour ITPro.TV domain, right.\n\n29\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.720\nAnd obviously in that domain\nwe've got our DNS server\n\n30\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.410\nthat handles all of the names\nthat end in ITPro.TV.\n\n31\n00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.620\nBut we've grown.\n\n32\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.170\nWe are growing.\n\n33\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.250\nFour studios, five studios.\n\n34\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830\nWho knows what's next?\n\n35\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.480\nLet's say we're growing logically,\nas well, that we've added a child domain.\n\n36\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.420\nAnd I'm gonna have trouble\nfitting this on the screen.\n\n37\n00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.111\nSo let's just move everybody over here.\n\n38\n00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:55.240\nWe'll go root and then the TV,\nand then the ITPro.TV.\n\n39\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.290\nIf I can get that guy over there,\nlet's send him.\n\n40\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.879\nAgain, doing this on\nthe fly is always fun.\n\n41\n00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:03.935\nWe'll put him in there.\n\n42\n00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:05.787\nAnd that didn't actually help me out.\n\n43\n00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:11.180\nLet's move it up a little bit and\nput that guy there, all right.\n\n44\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.385\nSo we got a child domain.\n\n45\n00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.228\nHe's not really directly below there,\nbut that's okay.\n\n46\n00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:19.678\nWe're gonna steal an arrow and\n\n47\n00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:24.649\nmove this guy over here, as well.\n\n48\n00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:25.630\nSo I've got a child domain.\n\n49\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.590\nNormally this would be\ndrawn kind of like that.\n\n50\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.370\nI guess I could just\nscroll down a little bit.\n\n51\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.680\nHow about that, Mike?\n\n52\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.200\nThink smarter, not harder, or something.\n\n53\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.225\nAll right, so let's say we've got\nanother domain and let's call this one,\n\n54\n00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:40.660\nChild.ITPro.TV because I'm so\ndarn creative.\n\n55\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.045\nAnd I'm gonna throw another server cuz of\ncourse we have a domain controller for\n\n56\n00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.460\nChild.ITPro.TV.\n\n57\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.218\nAnd we'll go ahead and call him Child.\n\n58\n00:02:55.767 --> 00:03:00.770\nYeah, and we had a little glitch there,\nand I don't know what I clicked.\n\n59\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.360\nAnd I don't know where he went.\n\n60\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.822\nSo that server blew up, and we're gonna\ntake another server and put it out here.\n\n61\n00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:10.190\nAnd, gosh darn,\nget this guy to play along.\n\n62\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.617\nWe're going to do some white text for\nhim and we're gonna call it Child.\n\n63\n00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:21.730\nAnd I'll put it on the bottom so\nwe can actually see that.\n\n64\n00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.738\nThere we go, so that's their domain\ncontroller for Child.ITPro.TV.\n\n65\n00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:27.700\nIt took forever.\n\n66\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.240\nIt takes a long time in the real\nworld to set up a child domain.\n\n67\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.331\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n68\n00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:33.700\nAll right, but\nhere's the way this is gonna work.\n\n69\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.810\nSo Child,\nthat's a separate name space, right?\n\n70\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.831\nWe've got ITPro.TV and\nI've got nodes Client1.ITPro.TV,\n\n71\n00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:45.600\nClient2.ITPro.TV, file so File01.ITPro.TV.\n\n72\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.700\nWell, this is a child\ndomain Child.ITPro.TV and\n\n73\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.976\nthere is gonna be nodes in there.\n\n74\n00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:57.620\nClient01.Child.ITPro.TV,\nClient2.Child.ITPro.TV ect., ect.\n\n75\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.870\nWell, in the grand scheme of things,\nthough, this DNS server up here is\n\n76\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.440\nauthoritative or responsible for\nall of the names that end in ITPro.TV.\n\n77\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.198\nNo matter how far out to the left they go,\nincluding Child.ITPro.TV,\n\n78\n00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:13.760\nhe handles all of that.\n\n79\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.008\nOkay, but as we grow again,\nwe get this new domain.\n\n80\n00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:22.563\nThe admins down in Child.ITPro.TV\nare frustrated because every\n\n81\n00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:25.570\ntime they need to change\na resource record,\n\n82\n00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.900\nadd a DNS entry, do anything like that,\nthey can't handle it here.\n\n83\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.305\nThey're gonna have to call\nan admin in this other domain and\n\n84\n00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:36.390\nsay hey, look, can you modify\nthe record for this file server?\n\n85\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.670\nWe've changed its IP address, right,\nor something along those lines.\n\n86\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.610\nSo what we wanna do is we\nwanna give Child.ITPro.TV\n\n87\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.140\ncontrol over their own resource records,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.790\nLet this guy handle all the names\nthat end in Child.ITPro.TV.\n\n89\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.320\nThat process is known as delegation.\n\n90\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.840\nI'm gonna delegate authority for\n\n91\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.210\nthat small portion of the name space,\nChild.ITPro.TV.\n\n92\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.507\nI'm gonna delegate it away to\nthis DNS server down here, right?\n\n93\n00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:07.010\nThat's known as delegation.\n\n94\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.380\nThen they'll be responsible for\nany names that end in Child.ITPro.TV.\n\n95\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.160\nThis guy would still be responsible for\nITPro.TV and\n\n96\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.628\nanything else we came up with,\nTest.ITPro.TV, South.US.ITPro.TV.\n\n97\n00:05:20.628 --> 00:05:25.143\nAgain anything that ends in\nITPro.TV except Child.ITPro.TV,\n\n98\n00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:29.080\nbecause we delegated that away from him,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.760\nThat's the process of delegation.\n\n100\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.220\nSo let's see how this works\nout in the real world.\n\n101\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.765\nI have here is lab, and\nI do have a child domain set up.\n\n102\n00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:44.000\nWe've got DCO2 somewhere.\n\n103\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.673\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n104\n00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:49.024\nThere he is.\n\n105\n00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:52.780\nSo DCOO2, and we'll do administrator and\n\n106\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.950\nmy super secret password\nto connect over there.\n\n107\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.960\nAll right, so here's child,\nbut he's not running DNS.\n\n108\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.850\nSo we're going to install\nDNS on this machine.\n\n109\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.160\nNow it's already running Active Directory.\n\n110\n00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.770\nRemember, you don't have to install\nDNS when you install Active Directory\n\n111\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.008\nif you've got DNS somewhere else on\nthe network, which I did in Lab.ITPro.TV.\n\n112\n00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:19.426\nSo in Child.Lab.ITPro.TV,\nwe're gonna install DNS and\n\n113\n00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:21.171\nthat's not where you do that.\n\n114\n00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.047\nLet's go Manage &gt; Add Roles and Features.\n\n115\n00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:26.652\nAnd we'll run through this pretty\nquick cuz we've seen this already.\n\n116\n00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:31.571\nI will do Next, Next, and\nwe're gonna install DNS.\n\n117\n00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:33.269\nI'll add the features, and\n\n118\n00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:37.250\nthen just Next all the way through\nuntil we get the Install button.\n\n119\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.890\nAnd we'll click Install, and it'll install\nDNS .And it's not gonna take it very long.\n\n120\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.833\nSo once that gets installed,\nnow this guy is running DNS, and\n\n121\n00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.175\nso he's got his own database down there.\n\n122\n00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:56.672\nAll right, and he can start storing\nrecords for Child.Lab.ITPro.TV.\n\n123\n00:06:56.672 --> 00:07:01.058\nThe problem is this guy up here\nstill thinks he's in charge of\n\n124\n00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:07.620\nChild.Lab.ITPro.TV, because he's in charge\nof everything that ends in ITPro.TV.\n\n125\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.040\nHe doesn't know this guy's here,\n\n126\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.810\nthat this guy's now gonna start\ntaking care of those records.\n\n127\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.030\nSo again, that's the act of delegation.\n\n128\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.678\nSo back over here, it's still\nchugging along, just about done,\n\n129\n00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:21.341\n63, 59, 59% of the way done.\n\n130\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.210\nAnd we'll give it just\nanother second to finish up.\n\n131\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.070\n&gt;&gt; And you know, Mike, I do have\na question while it's installing here.\n\n132\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.852\nWhat happens after the delegation is done?\n\n133\n00:07:30.852 --> 00:07:33.300\nWe might even see this, so\nI might be jumping ahead.\n\n134\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.911\nIf somebody does in Child.ITPro.TV decides\nthat hey, they want to create a record,\n\n135\n00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:42.740\nis the parent aware of it or\ndid it just say that's it?\n\n136\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.270\nYou are in control and if somebody tries\nto resolve a name that I don't understand\n\n137\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.850\nbut I can see that it's in your domain,\nI'm just gonna point them to you.\n\n138\n00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.780\n&gt;&gt; That's what it does.\n\n139\n00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.730\nIt just says I don't know\nanything more about it,\n\n140\n00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.710\nall I know cuz you'll see\nwhat's gonna happen on DC1.\n\n141\n00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.902\nLet me click Okay or\nClose on this one, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:58.902 --> 00:08:04.180\nIf we go back to Lab.ITPro.TV's\ndomain controller, And we look,\n\n143\n00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.276\nhe has a zone for child.itpro.tv,\nor child.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n144\n00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:12.650\nright, he has all these resource records.\n\n145\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.778\nIn fact, there's the resource record for\n\n146\n00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.730\nDC02, what I'm installing\nDNS on right now.\n\n147\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.710\nOnce I do the delegation,\nall that's gonna go away.\n\n148\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.860\nEverything under child is gonna be gone.\n\n149\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.820\nExcept for a pointer that says,\nyou're no longer authoritative for\n\n150\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.730\nchild, you don't have\nanything to do with it.\n\n151\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.900\nIf anybody asks,\njust send them here, all right?\n\n152\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.000\nSo, does that answer your question?\n\n153\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n154\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.940\n&gt;&gt; It's just gonna now\npoint it to the other guy.\n\n155\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.980\nSo let's make sure we got DNS installed,\nand\n\n156\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.911\nit's successful back there on childdc02,\nand we'll take a look at our DNS console.\n\n157\n00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:52.445\nRight, so right now, we're kind of in\na limbo state, because DC02 thinks, hey,\n\n158\n00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:55.330\nI'm authoritative for child.labs.itpro.tv.\n\n159\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.069\nI'm gonna have a zone file for it.\n\n160\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.758\nAll right,\nhe hasn't created it yet, has he?\n\n161\n00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:07.029\nBut now he's running DNS, so\nhe can become authoritative or\n\n162\n00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.490\nstart hosting those records.\n\n163\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.388\nSo, once that's done, that's when we're\ngonna go and we're gonna delegate.\n\n164\n00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:16.854\nSo let's create,\nwe are gonna create a new zone first.\n\n165\n00:09:16.854 --> 00:09:20.664\nNow, we're gonna talk much more about\nzones and zone types in upcoming episodes.\n\n166\n00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:23.725\nSo, just quickly,\n\n167\n00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:29.488\nI'm gonna create a very basic zone for\n\n168\n00:09:29.488 --> 00:09:33.641\nchild.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n169\n00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:38.855\nMake sure I use the right names there,\nall right?\n\n170\n00:09:38.855 --> 00:09:43.573\nAnd we'll click next, and we'll do secure\nupdates, we'll talk more about that, and\n\n171\n00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:47.108\nfinish, so now he's got that zone for\nchild.lab.it.protv.\n\n172\n00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:49.099\nAnd I've got two DNS\nservers hosting a zone,\n\n173\n00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:52.110\neach one of them think they're\nthe one that should host it.\n\n174\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.120\nSo that's why we have to go back to.\n\n175\n00:09:56.686 --> 00:10:01.111\nThe parent domain can say,\nall right, right-click on child, and\n\n176\n00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:05.900\nchoose New Delegation, and\nit's simply creating the pointer.\n\n177\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.237\nI'm gonna click Next on the wizard,\nand it says,\n\n178\n00:10:09.237 --> 00:10:12.904\nwhat is the name of the DNS\ndomain you want to delegate?\n\n179\n00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:18.716\nChild [SOUND] spell\nthe name of the DNS domain.\n\n180\n00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.190\nThat's not right.\n\n181\n00:10:23.883 --> 00:10:25.050\nSilly me.\n\n182\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.982\nI right clicked on the wrong one.\n\n183\n00:10:25.982 --> 00:10:29.755\nI right clicked on the child, so it's\nassuming there is a domain below that.\n\n184\n00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:32.400\nTest.child.lab, I right\nclicked on the wrong one.\n\n185\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.830\nSo we get lab.itpro.tv, we right click and\nwe choose new delegation, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.070\nWe click Next on the wizard,\nand we're gonna delegate child.\n\n187\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.340\nNotice I'm not putting the full name, it's\ngonna take care of putting the full name\n\n188\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.690\ndown here, I put child, and\nit says it must be child.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n189\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.660\nWe'll click Next on our wizard.\n\n190\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.178\nWhat is the IP address of the DNS server\nthat's now gonna host those records?\n\n191\n00:10:58.178 --> 00:11:04.219\nAnd that is going to be dc02.child,\n\n192\n00:11:04.219 --> 00:11:09.527\nif I can remember the names I used,\n\n193\n00:11:09.527 --> 00:11:15.031\n.lab.itpro.tv, oops, .tv.\n\n194\n00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:20.643\nAnd the IP address is 10.0.100.\n\n195\n00:11:20.643 --> 00:11:21.874\nLet's verify.\n\n196\n00:11:21.874 --> 00:11:25.490\nI'm pretty sure I know,\nbut just to make sure.\n\n197\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.884\nLet's take a peek at that.\n\n198\n00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:31.675\nChild.lab.itpro.tv, and it's 199.\n\n199\n00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:35.910\nIf you get that wrong,\nit will cause things to not work so well.\n\n200\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:41.230\nSo that was 199, you notice it validated,\nit says I see you,\n\n201\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.950\nwe're good to go, we click OK, and\nthen we click next and finish.\n\n202\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.410\nAll right, and it's telling me the name\nalready exists to change the delegation,\n\n203\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.480\nright click the delegation,\nselect properties.\n\n204\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.880\nWe'll click OK, and you know what?\n\n205\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.120\nThey have changed that,\nnormal, hm, interesting.\n\n206\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.770\nLet's see if we remove that,\nI might have gotten my steps backwards,\n\n207\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.600\nI went ahead and create that zone\nover here, and it's now liking that.\n\n208\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:16.001\nSo let's delete that And\nlet's try that again.\n\n209\n00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:24.089\nYes to Window location.\n\n210\n00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:28.923\n[INAUDIBLE] Interesting.\n\n211\n00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:35.280\nI see what they're saying\nthey want me to do.\n\n212\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.050\nThat's crazy.\n\n213\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.640\nLet me cancel out of that.\n\n214\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.930\nAnd what they're saying is\nbecause I already have this zone,\n\n215\n00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.430\nthey want me to delete it, and\nthen create the delegation.\n\n216\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.856\nSo let's delete that.\n\n217\n00:12:52.257 --> 00:12:55.934\nAnd then let's recreate that delegation.\n\n218\n00:12:55.934 --> 00:12:58.210\nSo, it's not liking the fact\nthat I had that there already.\n\n219\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.230\nSo we'll just do the same thing,\nchild.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n220\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.076\nWe know the name of the server\n\n221\n00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:12.530\nwas DC02.child.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n222\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.736\nand the IP address was,\n\n223\n00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:22.377\n10.0.100.199 And I get a red x now,\n\n224\n00:13:22.377 --> 00:13:26.240\nbecause he doesn't have that zone anymore,\nbut that's okay, it should create it.\n\n225\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.730\nWe'll click OK.\n\n226\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.000\nWe'll click Next and then Finish.\n\n227\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.980\nAnd now we have our delegation.\n\n228\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.050\nSo now you can see the difference.\n\n229\n00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.690\nBefore I had a yellow folder here, and\n\n230\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.250\nthat was the place to actually\nstore resource records.\n\n231\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.270\nNow I've got this grayed out little\nfolder, and the only thing that's in that\n\n232\n00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:50.350\nfolder is this one pointer to\nthe new DNS server in child, right?\n\n233\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.943\nIf we go take a look at child.\n\n234\n00:13:55.674 --> 00:14:02.470\nAnd we refresh our screen, we'll see we\nnow have a zone for, and I don't yet.\n\n235\n00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.140\nWe are gonna have to create,\nI should not have deleted this one.\n\n236\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.710\nI should've deleted the other one.\n\n237\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.710\nSo let's recreate that.\n\n238\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.563\nWe'll go ahead and\ngive him a primary zone for\n\n239\n00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.509\nchild.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n240\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.150\nAnd there we go, right?\n\n241\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.980\nSo now we're set up.\n\n242\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.360\nNow, I did that a little bit backwards.\n\n243\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.360\nI deleted the wrong one\nwhen I got that error.\n\n244\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.800\nSo, let's make sure we understand\nwhat was going on there.\n\n245\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.660\nInitially, DC01 with authoritative for\nITProTV, including child.\n\n246\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.220\nAnd there was an actual zone here for\nchild.\n\n247\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.338\nRight, because when I install\nthe domain controller for\n\n248\n00:14:45.338 --> 00:14:50.163\nchild.lab.itpro.tv, I pointed\nit to this guy's IP address.\n\n249\n00:14:50.163 --> 00:14:51.570\nI did it intentionally.\n\n250\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.778\nI didn't want to install DNS, so\nI could show you the process.\n\n251\n00:14:54.778 --> 00:14:57.121\nAnd so, that created a zone\ninstead of a delegation,\n\n252\n00:14:57.121 --> 00:14:58.740\nso I needed to get rid of that.\n\n253\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.620\nBut when you do the delegation, this\npart is just telling the server for lab,\n\n254\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.630\nthat this is the person now\nresponsible for child.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n255\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.100\nSo, that's only half the battle, right?\n\n256\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.450\nI'm telling my DNS server in lab\nyou're no longer responsible for\n\n257\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.900\nchild, that's where you need to send\nthe queries to for child.lab.itprotv.\n\n258\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.080\nThat's half of it.\n\n259\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.020\nIf I didn't create the zone\nover here though, in child,\n\n260\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.130\nevery byte still point to it, but\nit wouldn't be able to answer anything,\n\n261\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.800\ncuz he wouldn't have his own file\nto store the resource records.\n\n262\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.270\nSo, I did have to create that zone.\n\n263\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.120\nThe delegation wizard did\nnot create that zone for me.\n\n264\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.732\nSo, understand there's two\nhalves to that puzzle.\n\n265\n00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:44.182\nI got those steps a little bit backward,\nbut you create the delegation, in\n\n266\n00:15:44.182 --> 00:15:49.360\nthe parent zone, you say you're no longer\nresponsible for child that lab in ITProTV.\n\n267\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.190\nYou create a zone in the child or\nin that subschild domain.\n\n268\n00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.563\nI should use different names\ninstead of calling it child.\n\n269\n00:15:56.563 --> 00:15:59.779\nI'm not the most creative, so\nyou have to do both parts,\n\n270\n00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:01.950\ncreate the zone in the child.\n\n271\n00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.014\nCreate the pointer in the parent,\nand then everything works.\n\n272\n00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:09.590\nAll right, so that is delegation.\n\n273\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.430\nAll right, next thing I wanna\ntalk about are some more\n\n274\n00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.070\nDNS settings that we need\nto be able to configure.\n\n275\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.010\nOne is the fact that we can use\nPowerShell, it's not really a setting but\n\n276\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.820\njust the fact we can use PowerShell.\n\n277\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.260\nThey have added just about every command\nyou can think of to PowerShell for\n\n278\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260\nDNS so any of these\nconfiguration changes that we're\n\n279\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.300\nmaking through the GUI I can\nmake through PowerShell as well.\n\n280\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.211\nIf I do a get-command and\nlet's do DNS, all right.\n\n281\n00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:44.050\nYou'll see there's quite a few\ncommands that have to deal with DNS.\n\n282\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.920\nSo for the exam should you know, you don't\nneed to know every one of them obviously,\n\n283\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.270\nbut you need to be familiar with\nsome of the more basic ones.\n\n284\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.430\nAnything that we've gone through here\nlike when we start creating zones,\n\n285\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.150\nor creating those delegations.\n\n286\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.340\nYou might wanna go and\ntry it using PowerShell.\n\n287\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.100\nFire up our practice labs,\ndo it through the GUI, blow them away.\n\n288\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.470\nDo it through PowerShell, get familiar\nwith some of those PowerShell commands.\n\n289\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.693\nFor example, we could do\n\n290\n00:17:10.693 --> 00:17:18.546\na add-dnsserverprimaryzone-networkid.\n\n291\n00:17:18.546 --> 00:17:26.326\nAnd I could do something\nlike 10.0.100.0/16.\n\n292\n00:17:26.326 --> 00:17:30.234\nAnd what else do I need with that one,\na replication scope.\n\n293\n00:17:30.234 --> 00:17:34.140\nThat could be forest and I'll hit Enter.\n\n294\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.228\nAnd I'm okay that you don't know exactly,\nwow, parameter network ID is incorrect.\n\n295\n00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:41.995\n10.0.100/16.\n\n296\n00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:43.679\nSilly me.\n\n297\n00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:49.040\nThere we go.\n\n298\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.350\nYou need to make sure you understand\nhow subnet masks works as well,\n\n299\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.060\nsorry about that.\n\n300\n00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.820\nSo yeah, again I'm not so\nconcerned with what I just created.\n\n301\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.110\nI'm more concerned with the fact that I\nwas able to use PowerShell to do it, okay.\n\n302\n00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.100\nWe'll talk about what, in this case,\nreverse lookup zones are cuz that's\n\n303\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.550\nwhat I just created is this\nzone right here, all right.\n\n304\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:14.160\nBut the point is hey, you can do all this\nfrom PowerShell which means I can script\n\n305\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.170\nall of this, right,\nthat's the power behind PowerShell.\n\n306\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.240\nAll right, next thing DNS Socket Pool,\n\n307\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.420\nlet's go back over to PowerShell and\nlet's take a look.\n\n308\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:30.180\nI'm gonna do a command, Get-DnsServer,\nnow I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n309\n00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.340\nAnd you're gonna see a whole\nbunch of stuff fly by,\n\n310\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.710\nlots of different settings or\nproperties, I guess you should say,\n\n311\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.270\non this DNS server, all right,\ngreat command to know.\n\n312\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:48.810\nOne that I'm looking for\nis all the way back at the beginning and\n\n313\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.960\nit is SocketPoolSize.\n\n314\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.920\nAnd how I love my trackpad.\n\n315\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.442\nThere we go, SocketPoolSize,\nthe default is 2,500.\n\n316\n00:19:00.442 --> 00:19:02.720\nWhat the heck is SocketPoolSize?\n\n317\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.930\nWell this is when DNS responds to queries,\nit can\n\n318\n00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.780\nuse random ports to help prevent certain\ntypes of attacks against the DNS server,\n\n319\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.710\nto protect from certain types of\nspoofing that be against the DNS server.\n\n320\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.970\nSo, the SocketPoolSize is saying hey,\nyou don't have to use port 53 every time,\n\n321\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.540\nright, you can use other ports to create\nthose sockets to respond to those queries.\n\n322\n00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.770\nAnd what's you're saying here is there's a\npool of 2,500 ports that you can pick from\n\n323\n00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.280\nso you can increase this pool size which\njust means more randomization, right.\n\n324\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.810\nIf you gave him three, if I watch your DNS\nserver long enough I'll probably figure\n\n325\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.700\nout what three ports it's allowed to use.\n\n326\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.471\nI give him 2,500 it's gonna take me a lot\nlonger to try to figure out what ports\n\n327\n00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:50.291\nare available, if I give him more\nthan that even longer, right?\n\n328\n00:19:50.291 --> 00:19:53.870\nSo the more ports you give it\nthe more secure it is is the idea.\n\n329\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:01.031\nThe default is 2,500, these can go from 0\nmeaning don't randomize at all to 10,000,\n\n330\n00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:03.770\nso you can go all the way up to 10,000.\n\n331\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.810\nNow this is one that I find very odd\n\n332\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.460\nin the fact that I cannot\nset this through PowerShell.\n\n333\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.080\nAll those commands I just showed you, none\nof them have to do with SocketPoolSize.\n\n334\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.130\nI don't know if that's a sign\nthat that part is going away and\n\n335\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.200\nit's gonna be an unconfigurable property,\nI don't know.\n\n336\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.170\nMaybe Microsoft,\nI'm sure they have a good reason for\n\n337\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.710\nit but you cannot set that property.\n\n338\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:32.000\nYou can see it but you can't set it using\nPowerShell, so it's a DNS CMD command.\n\n339\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.910\nWhich is a good old command prompt,\nthe old black and\n\n340\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:39.211\nwhite command prompt command so\nit's dnscmd/config/socketpoolsize.\n\n341\n00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:46.811\nAnd then you just specify your value,\nlet's say we want 5,000.\n\n342\n00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:51.550\nAnd you hit Enter, and\nit tells you it worked.\n\n343\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.660\nHow do we know,\nwe run another Get-DnsServer.\n\n344\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.500\nWe scroll back up to the top\nof those results and\n\n345\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.756\nwe see that we are now at\na SocketPoolSize of 5,000, all right.\n\n346\n00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:06.940\nSo SocketPoolSize controls the number\nof ports it has available to randomize\n\n347\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.800\nwhen it's responding to queries.\n\n348\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.680\nWe also need to be able to\nconfigure cache locking, another\n\n349\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.200\nproperty that Microsoft calls out on\nthe exam, or could call out on the exam.\n\n350\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:23.160\nSo let's do our Get-DnsServer again,\nsee if we can find our cache locking\n\n351\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.470\nsettings and those are going to be,\nif I can find that guy.\n\n352\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.190\nIt should be right in here.\n\n353\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.900\nLocking percent underneath\nmy server cache, so\n\n354\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.162\nthat's the category of properties and\nit's called locking percent.\n\n355\n00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:40.780\nWes had mentioned caching earlier,\n\n356\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.460\nwe haven't gone into detail about it but\nyour DNS server does cache responses.\n\n357\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.470\nAnd what that, the short version\nis if Wes goes to Microsoft.com,\n\n358\n00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.370\nDNS has to go through the process\nof getting that IP address and\n\n359\n00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.160\ngiving it back to Wes, all right.\n\n360\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.950\nNow Wes's computer can\nconnect to Microsoft.com.\n\n361\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.960\nIf I 30 seconds later go to Microsoft.com,\n\n362\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.390\nmy DNS server doesn't have to go\nthrough all those steps again.\n\n363\n00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.920\nIt just got the answer for Wes and\nit wrote it down, it cached it, and\n\n364\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.172\nit said hey Mike,\nyou wanna go to Microsoft?\n\n365\n00:22:10.172 --> 00:22:12.740\nI'm gonna give you the same\nanswer I gave Wes 30 seconds ago,\n\n366\n00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.630\nno point in me going and\nlooking it up all over again.\n\n367\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.150\nI just got the answer 30 seconds ago,\n\n368\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.200\nit probably hasn't changed,\nyou should be good to go.\n\n369\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.060\nThat speeds up DNS name resolution, but\n\n370\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.760\nit also can pose a problem because the bad\nguys can try to poison that cache.\n\n371\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.800\nIf I can put bad\ninformation in that cache,\n\n372\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.310\nyour server doesn't have any way of\nvalidating that cached information.\n\n373\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.250\nIt says hey, this is the answer I got\n30 seconds ago I'm gonna assume that\n\n374\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.220\nit's still good, I'm gonna hand it out.\n\n375\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.300\nIf I put bad stuff in there it's\ngoing to say here's a cached entry,\n\n376\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.340\nI'll just give you that one.\n\n377\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.900\nIt's not gonna take the time to\nvalidate it because if it was gonna\n\n378\n00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.180\ngo validate it why not just get the actual\nIP address from the authoritative source,\n\n379\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.040\nright, why use the cache at all?\n\n380\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.000\nSo it doesn't validate anything,\nwhich then that's where we can get\n\n381\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.780\nsome DNS spoofing and\nDNS poisoning attacks going on.\n\n382\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.700\nBecause if I can put a bad entry in\nthere and maybe point you to my server,\n\n383\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.770\nMike with a K Rosoft, or what have you.\n\n384\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.630\nI can put the right name but\n\n385\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.550\nthe wrong IP address, host a bad site on\nmy web server with that IP address I used.\n\n386\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.940\nAnd now I can do some cross-site\nscripting, or who knows what I try to do.\n\n387\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.950\nSo the cache is actually locked,\n\n388\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:31.000\nby default it's set to 100% which means\ncached entries cannot be modified.\n\n389\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.335\nThe only entries that go in there\nare responses that my server requested.\n\n390\n00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:39.410\nIt puts them in there and\nthose caches can't be modified for\n\n391\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.380\ntheir entire lifetime.\n\n392\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.308\nThey have what's called a TTL,\nwe'll talk much more about that later.\n\n393\n00:23:43.308 --> 00:23:48.900\nSo 100% means, let's say the TTL,\nthe time to live, was four hours.\n\n394\n00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.064\nWell, while that record is cached, it can\nonly be cached for four hours and then\n\n395\n00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:57.366\nI throw it out, and while it's in there\nfor those four hours it can't be changed.\n\n396\n00:23:57.366 --> 00:24:02.192\nIf I was to change the locking\npercent to 75 Well now\n\n397\n00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:05.933\nit's only locked for 75% of the TTL.\n\n398\n00:24:05.933 --> 00:24:09.410\nFour hours, 75% would be three hours,\nthat means for\n\n399\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.168\nthe last hour, somebody could modify that.\n\n400\n00:24:12.168 --> 00:24:15.098\nAnd when I say somebody,\nit should be the DNS server going,\n\n401\n00:24:15.098 --> 00:24:18.963\nhey I've updated this record, or I got\nword that this IP address has changed,\n\n402\n00:24:18.963 --> 00:24:21.230\nI can update that information.\n\n403\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.390\nBut a bad guy can also get in there and\nmodify that as well.\n\n404\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.020\nSo it's something you've\ngotta think about.\n\n405\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.320\nDo you want to let those records be\nmodified before their TTL runs out,\n\n406\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.150\nwhich can ensure that I\nhave correct information?\n\n407\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:41.180\nBut also open up us to the opportunity\nof DNS attacks, right.\n\n408\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.140\nTo change that one,\nit is a PowerShell command for this one.\n\n409\n00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:52.320\nIt's simply going to be,\nlet's clear the screen out.\n\n410\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.805\nIt simply gonna be set-dnsServerCache\n\n411\n00:25:00.108 --> 00:25:06.004\nAnd -lockingPercent 75.\n\n412\n00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.860\nNo red text, all looks good.\n\n413\n00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.230\nWe do another get-dnsServer,\nwe scroll back up to the caching section\n\n414\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.890\nand we should see that my lockingPercent,\nis now 75.\n\n415\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.170\nAgain, default is 100 you can now set\nit to any value between 0 and 100,\n\n416\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.970\nit is a percentage of\nthe TTL of the records.\n\n417\n00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike it seems like the last\ncouple of settings that you've\n\n418\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.300\nlooked at is really\nabout securing your DNS.\n\n419\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.370\nNow I say securing your DNS,\nI know there's more that you have to do,\n\n420\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.930\nit starts with basic things like hardening\nyour system, having firewalls in place.\n\n421\n00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.071\nBut it seems like this is to help keep\nyour database in an uncorrupted state, or\n\n422\n00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:47.611\nat least some of the methods you\ncan implement, that's the goal.\n\n423\n00:25:47.611 --> 00:25:51.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're absolutely right Wes, a\nlot of this is all about securing that DNS\n\n424\n00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:55.633\nserver because DNS is an important\npart of our Enterprise environment,\n\n425\n00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:58.680\nit is what allows us to\nconnect all those resources.\n\n426\n00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.429\nAnd if somebody can take,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n427\n00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:05.920\nIt's the basis of a lot of attacks,\nit's the first step in a lot of attacks.\n\n428\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.590\nBecause if I can modify DNS records,\nI can try to redirect you, and\n\n429\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.220\nthat's never gonna be a good thing.\n\n430\n00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.420\nIf I'm directing you somewhere\nyou didn't intend or want to go.\n\n431\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.090\nSo DNS has to be protected and\nthat's what these settings are about.\n\n432\n00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.190\nCouple more I want to look at.\n\n433\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.340\nDNS logging, so let me zoom back out.\n\n434\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.060\nLet's get rid of PowerShell here.\n\n435\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.120\nOops, let's close down,\nwhat happened to my window?\n\n436\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.050\nLet's get back into full screen mode\nwhere I can actually see everything.\n\n437\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.080\nThere's my little x,\nwe'll close down PowerShell and\n\n438\n00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.980\nback into my DNS server over here.\n\n439\n00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:46.420\nAgain, I'm still on dc01 or\nthat's the DNS server for lab at itpro.tv.\n\n440\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.840\nDNS logging, so when we look at\nthe properties of the DNS server,\n\n441\n00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.540\nthere's two tabs we want to pay attention\nto here, event logging and debug logging.\n\n442\n00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.620\nEvent logging, by default logs all events.\n\n443\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.110\nThese are going to be sent to the DNS\nlog which we can go through and\n\n444\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.510\nsee in our event viewer system.\n\n445\n00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.610\nYou see it maintains a record of errors,\nwarnings and\n\n446\n00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.460\nother events encountered\nby the DNS server.\n\n447\n00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.350\nI can change the level of\nlogging that we want to do.\n\n448\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.670\nMaybe I don't really need success events,\nI just want to see errors and\n\n449\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.580\nwarnings, or just errors, or no events at\nall which usually a very bad thing to do.\n\n450\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:27.140\nNow, you definitely at least want to see\nerrors and warnings, if not all events.\n\n451\n00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.647\nBut maybe you find that\nthe log is just too big,\n\n452\n00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:33.160\nyou can't find the important\nstuff by doing all of events.\n\n453\n00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.370\nWell, maybe you come in here and turn it\ndown to just errors and warnings, right?\n\n454\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.070\nWe also have Debug Logging.\n\n455\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.130\nNow this one you want to\nbe really careful with.\n\n456\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.620\nEvent logging, you want it on.\n\n457\n00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.640\nIn fact, ideally you'd leave it on\nall events but if you find that you\n\n458\n00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.980\nneed to for your environment,\nyou might want to step it down a little.\n\n459\n00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.970\nDebug logging, on the other hand,\nis very intensive logging.\n\n460\n00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.310\nIt's for debugging, for\nlooking to see what's going wrong,\n\n461\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.370\nwhen I'm troubleshooting something trying\nto figure out where the problem is\n\n462\n00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:06.220\noccurring in the DNS resolution process or\nwith DNS.\n\n463\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.440\nSo it's not turned on by default.\n\n464\n00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.650\nIf we want, we turn it on by\nputting a check mark there and\n\n465\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.610\nthen you see these different categories.\n\n466\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.270\nI can do incoming or outgoing,\neither TCP or UDP or\n\n467\n00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:23.130\nboth, I can do packets that are only\nqueries or updates or notifications.\n\n468\n00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.570\nNot updates like Windows updates,\nupdates to DNS records.\n\n469\n00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.530\nDo I want requests or response or both?\n\n470\n00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.730\nUnmatched incoming response packets,\n\n471\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.180\nresponses that never had an initiator,\nright?\n\n472\n00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.850\nWait, why am I getting a response,\nI never asked for anything.\n\n473\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.730\nDetails, you can filter packets\nby IP address to help control\n\n474\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.470\nsome of the amounts of data.\n\n475\n00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.410\nWhat you need to understand here is, if I\nturn this on, and start checking all this.\n\n476\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.240\nI can generate a very big log file,\nvery fast, and\n\n477\n00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.760\nI put a serious workload on this server.\n\n478\n00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.910\nIt will impact performance\nif it's having to log\n\n479\n00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.960\nevery single packet that's coming in or\ngoing out of the DNS server.\n\n480\n00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.140\nSo you turn this on,\nit's good for debugging,\n\n481\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.870\nfor troubleshooting,\nturn it on when you've got a problem.\n\n482\n00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:12.510\nOnce you've solved your problem, and\nyou've tested that your solution has fixed\n\n483\n00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.620\nthe problem, and you no longer have the\nproblem, turn this back off, all right.\n\n484\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.770\nDon't leave this one on, only use it\nwhen you're doing troubleshooting.\n\n485\n00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.890\nThe event logging,\nleave that on all the time.\n\n486\n00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.740\nThose are just basic messages\nabout somebody queried, or\n\n487\n00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.750\nwas unable to respond,\nor I could not find any,\n\n488\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.250\nthe name not found type thing,\nthose kind of errors.\n\n489\n00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.920\nThose you want to leave on all the time.\n\n490\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.060\nDebug logging, only when you\nneed to do some troubleshooting.\n\n491\n00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.290\nAll right we also want to talk about\ndelegating administration for DNS.\n\n492\n00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.430\nWhen you install DNS,\n\n493\n00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.870\na new group gets created in active\ndirectory called the DNS admins group.\n\n494\n00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:52.600\nThe DNS admins group has full control\nover this DNS server, all right.\n\n495\n00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.920\nYou can see it doesn't say full\ncontrol but it is basically,\n\n496\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.830\nthe only they can't do is\nthey're gonna install DNS.\n\n497\n00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.427\nThey have special permissions,\n\n498\n00:30:02.427 --> 00:30:06.200\nthey give them just full control over\nthe DNS console and everything in there.\n\n499\n00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.830\nAll right, so that's one way.\n\n500\n00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.289\nIf I need to make Wes\nan admin on this DNS server,\n\n501\n00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:15.407\nI'm not gonna make him a domain admin, I\nneed to make him a DNS admin, not DHCP or\n\n502\n00:30:15.407 --> 00:30:18.630\nanything else so\nI add him to the DNS admins group.\n\n503\n00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.310\nYou can also give somebody read permission\nover this console, you could add your help\n\n504\n00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:27.420\ndesk group to this access control list and\nyou can give them just read permission.\n\n505\n00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.750\nThat would allow them to open up\nthe console and view records and\n\n506\n00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.250\nthey could maybe troubleshoot a problem.\n\n507\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.790\nHey, I know why you can't connect\nto that file server Mr Employee\n\n508\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.750\nbecause you don't have a record in DNS for\nyour computer or whatever the case may be.\n\n509\n00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.535\nSo you can give somebody read permissions\njust by modifying the access control list\n\n510\n00:30:44.535 --> 00:30:48.170\nhere for DNS, again that was\nthe properties of the DNS server.\n\n511\n00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.500\nWhen it comes to recursion,\nI think I'm going to hold off.\n\n512\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.400\nWell, recursion's a little\nbit difficult to explain\n\n513\n00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.530\nbecause we haven't looked at\nthe different types of queries yet.\n\n514\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.180\nBut recursion is basically,\nif I send a query and\n\n515\n00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.880\nI want that DNS server\nto go find the answer.\n\n516\n00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.430\nLike what I said earlier\nabout ITPro TV's DNS server,\n\n517\n00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.270\nmy client sent the query\nto the DNS server.\n\n518\n00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.337\nThe DNS server then talked to the route,\nthe .com,\n\n519\n00:31:16.337 --> 00:31:20.200\nthe google.com, found the answer,\ngave it back to the client.\n\n520\n00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.570\nThe DNS server did all the work.\n\n521\n00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.916\nThe client just sat back and\nsaid let me know when you're done,\n\n522\n00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:28.215\nall right, that's recursion.\n\n523\n00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:31.799\nDoing that, sending a query where you're\ngoing to say you do all the work and\n\n524\n00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:34.240\njust let me know when you're done.\n\n525\n00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.480\nIf we don't want our DNS servers doing\nrecursion, there is a check mark that we\n\n526\n00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.030\ncan check, uncheck if I pull up the right\nproperties here to disable recursion.\n\n527\n00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.660\nSo on that Advanced tab\nright up here at the top\n\n528\n00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.780\nwe can choose to disable recursion.\n\n529\n00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.620\nNotice it also disables forwarders, right.\n\n530\n00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.564\nWhat that's gonna do is it's basically\ngonna tell your DNS server the only names\n\n531\n00:31:57.564 --> 00:32:00.465\nyou can lookup are names that\nyou have in your own database.\n\n532\n00:32:00.465 --> 00:32:04.170\nYou can't go anywhere else, you can't go\nout to the root, you can't do any of that,\n\n533\n00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.208\nyou can't forward it.\n\n534\n00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:10.150\nNo recursion is allowed on\nthat DNS server, right.\n\n535\n00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:10.770\nSo, again,\n\n536\n00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.870\nthat's something in a really controlled\nenvironment you might want to enable.\n\n537\n00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:21.096\nWhen it comes to performance tuning my\nDNS servers, and I was trying to think\n\n538\n00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:25.997\nof something to say here, Wes,\nbecause I don't know really what else is.\n\n539\n00:32:25.997 --> 00:32:29.104\nDNS is a spectacular performer.\n\n540\n00:32:29.104 --> 00:32:34.098\nSome stats that I get from some sites\nthat have done workload analysis on DNS\n\n541\n00:32:34.098 --> 00:32:34.820\nservers.\n\n542\n00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.416\nA 2016 box, DNS, Microsoft.\n\n543\n00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:43.465\n99.99 percent of queries can\nbe successfully answered\n\n544\n00:32:43.465 --> 00:32:48.820\nwhile they're receiving\n260,000 queries per second.\n\n545\n00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:54.500\nSo you're DNS server is gonna be able to\nrespond to every single query it gets,\n\n546\n00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.540\neven if you're sending 250, 260,000\nqueries per second to that DNS server.\n\n547\n00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.830\nI don't think you can overload.\n\n548\n00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.070\nI mean it's gonna be difficult, right?\n\n549\n00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.850\nYou're gonna have to get\nsome bot nets going.\n\n550\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.580\nAnd get multiple machines\nhitting this DNS server.\n\n551\n00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.790\nWhen you get over 260,000\nqueries per second,\n\n552\n00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.030\nthe percentages of responses\nstarts to drop a little bit.\n\n553\n00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.350\nBut again, that's extreme.\n\n554\n00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.900\nThat's a lot of darn queries per second.\n\n555\n00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.540\nIt's not an hour per hour.\n\n556\n00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.490\nI mean I was like wait really?\n\n557\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.190\nWhat else?\n\n558\n00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.860\nTwo million records, if you had a zone\nfile that had all the ip addresses for\n\n559\n00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.780\nall the nodes, in that zone file\nyou could have two million records.\n\n560\n00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.830\nTwo million.\n\n561\n00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.178\nI don't have 2 million, though.\n\n562\n00:33:38.178 --> 00:33:40.490\nI mean it would be a large company\nto have that many records.\n\n563\n00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, my first thought is going back\nto some of the fundamental networking.\n\n564\n00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.780\nWhere 2 million, you're talking about\na block of class A addresses, and\n\n565\n00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.800\nyou have to actually get\naccess to all of that.\n\n566\n00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.890\nThat's interesting.\n\n567\n00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:50.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n568\n00:33:50.845 --> 00:33:54.160\n[LAUGH] Well, if you have a zone\nthat contains 2 million records,\n\n569\n00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.400\nit's probably only eating up\nabout 2 Gigabytes of memory.\n\n570\n00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.170\nSo if you add another gigabyte\nof memory to your server,\n\n571\n00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.190\nyou could go well beyond the two\nmillion records on your zone size.\n\n572\n00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.010\nAnd again, it's not really\ngonna stop it from working.\n\n573\n00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.870\nIt'll slow it down because it needs to be\nable to load those zones up in memory for\n\n574\n00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:12.950\nquick response.\n\n575\n00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.780\nAnd if it can't fit the entire zone\ninto memory now it has to start\n\n576\n00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.280\ndoing paging and some other things so\nit'll slow down.\n\n577\n00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.850\nBut until you get up to two million\nrecords two gigs is plenty to\n\n578\n00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.070\nstore your zone.\n\n579\n00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.530\nKeep in mind, that's over and above what\nthe operating system is using, right?\n\n580\n00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:27.710\nWe always talk about that.\n\n581\n00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.740\nWindows itself wants two gigs of memory.\n\n582\n00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.500\nI'm gonna put DNS on here and\n\n583\n00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.470\nI expect we're gonna have a large zone\nwith hundreds of thousands of records.\n\n584\n00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.780\nI'm gonna throw in another two gigs in\nthat machine to support DNS above and\n\n585\n00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.040\nbeyond what the operating system requires.\n\n586\n00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.660\nWhat else?\n\n587\n00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.290\nAnd I think we've hit everything we\nneed to talk about there with some of\n\n588\n00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.430\nthe settings for DNS.\n\n589\n00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:54.370\nWe do still have DNS sec, another really\ncool one, and something brand new,\n\n590\n00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.320\nresponse rate limiting.\n\n591\n00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.950\nThat we need to talk about but\nI know Wes is giving me the evil eye,\n\n592\n00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.113\nand I think he's telling\nus we're out of time.\n\n593\n00:35:01.113 --> 00:35:02.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We are.\n\n594\n00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.480\nMike, are you gonna wanna maybe\ngo into another part here so\n\n595\n00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.080\nwe can round off a complete\nDNS novel here for sure?\n\n596\n00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.580\nThat's right, we are coming to\nthe end of another episode, but Mike,\n\n597\n00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.500\nbefore we sign off for this one, do you\nhave any additional things you'd like to\n\n598\n00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.340\nthrow in about things we talked\nabout like delegation and stuff?\n\n599\n00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.760\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.\n\n600\n00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's gotta be\none of the easiest answers I've had.\n\n601\n00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.929\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for ITProTV.\n\n602\n00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:25.511\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n603\n00:35:25.511 --> 00:35:28.194\n&gt;&gt; And as much as I talk,\nthere's really nothing left to say,\n\n604\n00:35:28.194 --> 00:35:29.570\nand I'm Mike Rodrick [LAUGH].\n\n605\n00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:30.790\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:35:30.790 -->

--> 00:00:12.169\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.867\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV, I'm your host,\n\n5\n00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:16.514\nWes Bryant.\n\n6\n00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.739\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.255\nwe're continuing through our\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.481\nYep, brand new, it's shiny,\nwe're coming back with a part four in DNS.\n\n9\n00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:28.880\nAnd you might be asking yourself,\nwell, wait a second, why do we have so\n\n10\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.210\nmany parts in DNS?\n\n11\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.600\nWell, honestly guys, we can make it\nan entire week out of just this one topic.\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.830\nIt's very important, and we got joining\nus in the studio is none other than Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.970\nDNS himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.050\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n15\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Doing great until you said part four,\nI have my notes for\n\n16\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.980\npart five sitting in front of me,\nI said, wait, that's not good.\n\n17\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.380\nBut never fear, just rearrange my papers,\nwe're good to go.\n\n18\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nthanks for having back.\n\n19\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.040\nA little there, a little confusion\nthere which episode we were doing next,\n\n20\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.120\nbut my fault, we're good to go now.\n\n21\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.980\nWe are continuing on, and as Wes said,\nI mean, DNS is a huge topic, it's also 20,\n\n22\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.680\nI think it's 15 to 20% of the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.260\nSo, it's a big portion of your exam.\n\n24\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.040\nYou gotta understand it.\n\n25\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.700\nAnd when you get out in the real world,\nI mean, DNS is what makes everything work.\n\n26\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250\nSo, if you don't have a good\nunderstanding of DNS,\n\n27\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.460\nyou're gonna have trouble fixing\nthings when they go wrong, or\n\n28\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.640\nunderstanding why things aren't working,\nso very important.\n\n29\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.440\nAnd some of the things we're gonna go over\nthese next couple of episodes with DNS\n\n30\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.810\nare really cool,\nsome of the newer features.\n\n31\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.118\nAnd we've looked at installing DNS and\nsome of the basics there of configuring\n\n32\n00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.280\nDNS, we haven't got into zones and\nresource records inside DNS yet.\n\n33\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.337\nBut there are couple of cool\nthings that I wanna show you.\n\n34\n00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:39.512\nI wanna take the time to do\na couple of demonstrations for you,\n\n35\n00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:42.333\nbecause they're brand new\nto Server 2016 in DNS.\n\n36\n00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.715\nAnd there are things that\ncan help us secure DNS.\n\n37\n00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.515\nNow, DNS is a big target for the bad guys.\n\n38\n00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:51.721\nCuz we rely on it for everything,\nand the way it's setup is not a,\n\n39\n00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:56.557\nwhen it was originally designed,\nthere wasn't a lot of security in mind.\n\n40\n00:01:56.557 --> 00:02:02.142\nSo, security has been bolted on to it\nover the years to try to improve that,\n\n41\n00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:06.390\nbut it's still a big vulnerability,\nif I can say that.\n\n42\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.570\nIt's an easy way to attack somebody,\nwith GNS spoofing, and things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.980\nImportant that we can secure it,\nkeep it safe, so that we can use it.\n\n44\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just recently,\nat the time of this recording,\n\n45\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.860\nit's only been about a month or so.\n\n46\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.580\nWe had one of the biggest,\ndistributed denial of service attacks,\n\n47\n00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.740\nand from what I was hearing,\n\n48\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.870\nis it was a direct attack against, well,\nthe Internet's phone book, DNS, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, the thing is,\nwe rely on it.\n\n50\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.240\nMy computer, when I type in something\ninto my browser, in the background,\n\n51\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.880\nit's taking that name and turning it\ninto an IP address, we understand that.\n\n52\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.470\nThat response is coming back\nfrom these DNS servers, and\n\n53\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.360\nit's really hard to how do I verify, how\ndo I know that that response is correct?\n\n54\n00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.350\nA server has cache, and if we get bad\ninformation in the cache, the server\n\n55\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.070\njust uses that information, and doesn't\nhave any way to validate it, all right?\n\n56\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.550\nSo again, it's just a common avenue\nof the beginning of a lot of attacks.\n\n57\n00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.835\nToday, we're gonna look at\nsomething called DNSSEC, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:11.470\nDNSSEC is a way that we\ncan digitally sign our\n\n59\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.737\nzones files, and let me rephrase that.\n\n60\n00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.430\nBecause usually, you'll hear people say,\nwe're gonna sign the zone.\n\n61\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.810\nIt's really not signing the zone, itself.\n\n62\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.980\nIt's signing the individual\nresources records.\n\n63\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.250\nAnybody out there who is familiar\nwith the way hashing works,\n\n64\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.150\nthe way digital signatures work.\n\n65\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.990\nIf we tried to sign the zone, what would\nhappen when a client updated their record?\n\n66\n00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.994\n&gt;&gt; I'm not exactly sure.\n\n67\n00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:39.407\n&gt;&gt; The signature would no longer match,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:40.225\nWe were talking about matches.\n\n69\n00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.194\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's right, that's right.\n\n70\n00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:43.333\n&gt;&gt; And now that you've heard\nme say that you're like, yeah,\n\n71\n00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.635\nthat makes sense, right?\n\n72\n00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:46.725\nYeah, if we sign the zone,\nthat's well and good.\n\n73\n00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.295\nI can verify that the zone hasn't changed.\n\n74\n00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.085\nBut the problem is it needs to change.\n\n75\n00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:52.575\nWe have new clients registering.\n\n76\n00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:54.834\nWe have clients updating\ntheir IP addresses.\n\n77\n00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.438\nSo, that zone's gonna be\nchanging all the time.\n\n78\n00:03:57.438 --> 00:04:01.087\nAnd if I sign it, well, the signature\nis invalid after the first change.\n\n79\n00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:04.067\n&gt;&gt; So, you can't speak to me\nlike a network administrator,\n\n80\n00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:05.017\nsystems administrator.\n\n81\n00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:07.847\nYou gotta speak to me as\nthe support desk guy.\n\n82\n00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:08.907\nI'm thinking drivers, right?\n\n83\n00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:12.010\nIt's one of the reasons we signed drivers,\nso that we can verify that they\n\n84\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.560\nare a valid piece of code, and they're\nnot corrupting our hardware in general.\n\n85\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.490\nSo you're saying that's\npretty well close to it,\n\n86\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.250\nthat I can trust that signature\nthat is on that record.\n\n87\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.410\nAnd I know that record is valid.\n\n88\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.650\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely right.\n\n89\n00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.786\nIt just an understanding that\nwe're not signing a zone,\n\n90\n00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:26.350\nwe're signing the individual records.\n\n91\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.470\nBecause, just as Wes said,\n\n92\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.050\nthe whole point of signing something like\nthat is to verify, one, that it hasn't\n\n93\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.270\nbeen modified, and two, that we can,\nwe can get what we call non-repudiation.\n\n94\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.760\nWe can identify the source of\nthe information because of the keys used\n\n95\n00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.710\nin creating that signature.\n\n96\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.090\nIf I know that it was my DNS server's\nkey to use to create that signature,\n\n97\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.910\nI know that it came from my DNS server.\n\n98\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.120\nI can trust that response.\n\n99\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.960\nHe's also telling me that\nthe record hasn't been modified.\n\n100\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.010\nI'm good to go.\n\n101\n00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.460\nIt's when I get a response\nthat's not signed.\n\n102\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.390\nI hope it's from my DNS server,\nbut I could've been spoofed.\n\n103\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.650\nI could've been redirected\nin the background there, and\n\n104\n00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.560\nbeen getting that response for\nsomebody else.\n\n105\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.000\nSomebody could've messed with the cache\non my DNS server and modified entries.\n\n106\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.510\nIf we don't sign this stuff,\nwe have no way of knowing.\n\n107\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.925\nSo, that's what DNSsec is all about.\n\n108\n00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:14.175\nSecuring a DNS zone by using signing.\n\n109\n00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:17.050\nBut again, it's the individual records.\n\n110\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740\nAlso, another great point I'd like to\ndo to the straight from Microsoft adds\n\n111\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.140\nvalidation support without changing\nthe basic mechanisms of DNS.\n\n112\n00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.335\nLet's paraphrase from them,\n\n113\n00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:29.700\ncuz Microsoft will make an entire\nparagraph out of that sense.\n\n114\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.062\nBut that's here, so I paraphrased\na little bit, but the really cool thing\n\n115\n00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:38.270\nabout DNSsec, Because it didn't\nchange everything with DNS, right?\n\n116\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.100\nEverything still works the same,\nqueries still works the same.\n\n117\n00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.200\nWe didn't have to modify\neverything else to make this work.\n\n118\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.040\nThat's a really cool way of doing it.\n\n119\n00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.290\n&gt;&gt; When you talk about security,\nyou talk about modifying something.\n\n120\n00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.651\nLet's just take encryption, right?\n\n121\n00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:54.758\nAnd if I add encryption to secure\nsomething, then we're gonna have\n\n122\n00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:58.264\nprocessing overhead, we're gonna have\nkeys that need to be distributed.\n\n123\n00:05:58.264 --> 00:06:01.261\nAnd so you're saying that even though\nwe still get kind of security,\n\n124\n00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.845\nthe underlying architecture\nis gonna remain the same, and\n\n125\n00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.990\nwe shouldn't see too much of an effect\non it, other than been safe.\n\n126\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.709\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n127\n00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:11.923\nYour clients don't have to be rewritten to\nask the query in a different way now that\n\n128\n00:06:11.923 --> 00:06:15.387\nwe're using DNAsec, they still\nsend the query just like normal.\n\n129\n00:06:15.387 --> 00:06:20.200\nSo, it's really neat that we can do this,\nget this level of security,\n\n130\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.020\nand not have to change\neverything around itself.\n\n131\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.180\nSo, how does it work?\n\n132\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.590\nWell, again, we're gonna do a little demo,\nwe're gonna go in, and\n\n133\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.480\nwe call it signing the zone.\n\n134\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.480\nKeep in mind, we're not signing the zone\nitself, it's the individual records.\n\n135\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.700\nA couple of things we're gonna need to\nbe familiar with before we get into\n\n136\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.620\nthe demo though, just some terminology.\n\n137\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.430\nWhen we sign a zone,\nwhen we implement DNSsec on a zone,\n\n138\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.390\nnew records are going to be created in\nour zone, along with our A records and\n\n139\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.100\nour MX records and our C name records and\nall that good stuff.\n\n140\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.620\nThere's gonna be something called\nResource Records Signatures, or\n\n141\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.430\nRRSIG Records, all right?\n\n142\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.060\nThese are the actual signatures.\n\n143\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.810\nSo, for every record that I'd have,\n\n144\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.510\nsay an A record, there is an RRSIG\nrecord that's associated with it.\n\n145\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.080\nThat represents the signature\nof that A record, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.690\nWe also have NSEC, which is Next Secure.\n\n147\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.490\nAnd NSEC3, which is the replacement or\nthe new and improved version of NSEC.\n\n148\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.990\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nI gotta jump in here real quick.\n\n149\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.130\nNow, wait, we've got two different\ntypes of this NEC secure.\n\n150\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.440\nWe've got a NEC secure and\nNEC secure three.\n\n151\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.620\nWhat are the differences here?\n\n152\n00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.500\nCan we use them both?\n\n153\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.010\nAnd is three, three times better?\n\n154\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.280\n&gt;&gt; It's three times three better.\n\n155\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.610\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n156\n00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.180\nNSEC3 is the new and improved NSEC.\n\n157\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.070\nYou can use one or the other.\n\n158\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.460\nYou can't use both, unfortunately.\n\n159\n00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.930\nAnd the real difference, and\nwe don't wanna get into the too technical,\n\n160\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.720\nlike the algorithms that's\nused in behind the scenes.\n\n161\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.370\nBut the idea here is this is\nthe concept you've gotta understand.\n\n162\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.718\nIf we're doing DNSsec, that means that\nour records are digitally signed.\n\n163\n00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:57.888\nAnd so when a client queries DNS,\nthat says, hey, by the way,\n\n164\n00:07:57.888 --> 00:07:59.400\nI understand DNSsec.\n\n165\n00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.885\nSend me that information as well.\n\n166\n00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:04.081\nAnd the DNS server responds\nwith that A record.\n\n167\n00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:09.844\nIn that RRSIG record for that, so we can\nvalidate where the response came from and\n\n168\n00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:13.140\nwhether or not it's been modified.\n\n169\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.660\nThat's great.\n\n170\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.360\nWhat if I queried DNS for\nsomething that doesn't exist?\n\n171\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.380\nWhat if we got, I don't know, just for\ngiggles, client one to client ten, and\n\n172\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.710\nI happen to type in ping client\n22 dot lab dot IT proto TV.\n\n173\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.680\nOr, you know, I try to connect to it.\n\n174\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.100\nDNS is gonna send me back.\n\n175\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.880\nThere is no record,\nbecause that computer doesn't exist.\n\n176\n00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.120\nSo, there's no signature for that\nnon-existent record, cuz it doesn't exist.\n\n177\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.510\nSo what is DNS supposed to do?\n\n178\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.600\nHow can I validate the name\ndoesn't exist response, right?\n\n179\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.920\nCuz I can do a DOS attack on you by\nforging name doesn't exist, right?\n\n180\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.110\nWest is trying to connect\nto that file server.\n\n181\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.580\nBut if I can get in between him and the\nDNS server, I can just respond with, hey,\n\n182\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.160\nname doesn't exist.\n\n183\n00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.180\nAnd he's like.\n\n184\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.430\nWell, sorry, user.\n\n185\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.380\nYou typed in the wrong name.\n\n186\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.900\nThat name doesn't exist, even though\nthe server's sitting right there.\n\n187\n00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.320\nYou can't connect to it, right?\n\n188\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.640\nSo we need some way to also respond\nwhen there is no record and\n\n189\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.990\nthere is no signature.\n\n190\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.200\nAnd that's what NSEC is all about is\nthe next secure, is what it's short for.\n\n191\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.070\nAnd it allows me to have some kind of\nresponse for when names don't exist.\n\n192\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.460\n&gt;&gt; You know you're talking about\nsignatures and cryptology and\n\n193\n00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.350\none of the things I kind of understand\na little bit about the cryptology part is\n\n194\n00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.080\nthere's got to be some kind of key.\n\n195\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.010\nSome kind of a not an encryption, but\n\n196\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.905\nsome kind of key that helps us to\ndo this digital signature, right?\n\n197\n00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nThere's several keys, and\n\n198\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.030\njump right back to NSEC3 real quick.\n\n199\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.400\nNSEC3 is better than NSEC because it\nprevents something called zone walking.\n\n200\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.070\nAll right, with NSEC it worked, it was\nable to provide a response when there was\n\n201\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.370\nno record and\nI could validate that response.\n\n202\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.950\nBut the problem was the bad guys figured\nout how they could start enumerating my\n\n203\n00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.910\nzone, simply by querying\nfrom all different names and\n\n204\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.190\nfinding out which once don't exist,\nand which ones do exist.\n\n205\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.776\nSo there were some tactics\nyou could do there.\n\n206\n00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:08.440\nNSEC 3 is designed to prevent that\nzone walking as they like to call it.\n\n207\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.960\nAnd as what's mentioned earlier,\nthe next one I want to mention is DNS key.\n\n208\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.660\nA DNS key Is an abbreviation for\nDNS key, it's kinda funny.\n\n209\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.790\nThe abbreviation is DNSKEY.\n\n210\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.435\nWhich stands for DNS space K-E-Y.\n\n211\n00:10:24.435 --> 00:10:26.283\nYeah, you saved a space there.\n\n212\n00:10:26.283 --> 00:10:30.887\nAnyway, the DNS key stores the public\ntopography key used to verify\n\n213\n00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:32.112\nthe signatures.\n\n214\n00:10:32.112 --> 00:10:35.580\nSo, it's one of several\nkeys that we'll see.\n\n215\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.990\nBut this is the public key, right?\n\n216\n00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.660\nAnd if you go back to your\ncryptography lessons or\n\n217\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.110\nepisodes in some of our other classes.\n\n218\n00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.030\nYou remember public key cryptography.\n\n219\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.800\nYou got a public and private key.\n\n220\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.010\nPrivate key stays private,\npublic key gets distributed.\n\n221\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.757\nSo if I'm a client and I've got that\nserver's public key, I can use it to\n\n222\n00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:57.119\ndecrypt the signature, which means it has\nto have been encrypted with the server's\n\n223\n00:10:57.119 --> 00:11:01.190\nprivate key, which means I can validate\nthe originator of that information.\n\n224\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.360\nAll right?\n\n225\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.470\nDNS keys can also store some of\nother keys we'll use in DNS sec.\n\n226\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.040\nThere are zone sign-in keys.\n\n227\n00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.040\nThe ones that are used to actually\nassign the resource records.\n\n228\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.540\nAnd there's key sign-in keys, which\nare used to sign the zone signing keys.\n\n229\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.130\nYeah I know.\n\n230\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.200\nCrazy, right?\n\n231\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.600\nSo there's a lot of keys involved, a lot\nof checks that go on in the background to\n\n232\n00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.250\nmake sure we're getting the information\nfrom the appropriate DNS server.\n\n233\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.309\nThen there's some DS records, or\ndelegation If I can say that.\n\n234\n00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:38.380\n[LAUGH] Delegation signer,\nused to secure a delegation.\n\n235\n00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.590\nBuild authentication\nchains to child zones.\n\n236\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.047\nSo we're gonna have DNS sec implement\non a parent zone and then a child zone\n\n237\n00:11:46.047 --> 00:11:50.790\nlike lab.itprotv, test.lab.itprotv.\n\n238\n00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.220\nWe can build that trust chain between\nthose different parent and child zones.\n\n239\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.070\nAnd then there's trust anchors.\n\n240\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.440\nTrust anchors are the DNS key and the DS\nis the delegation signer resource records,\n\n241\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.460\nthese get distributed to\nthe non-authoritative DNS servers for\n\n242\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.080\nthat zone that are hosting\ncopies of the zone.\n\n243\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.480\nBecause they need to be able to\nagain validate the information.\n\n244\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.900\nThey're the public key side\nof the cryptography solution.\n\n245\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.960\nAll right, so\na lot of different terminology there.\n\n246\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.820\nLet's see how it's implemented.\n\n247\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.450\nIt's so much easier than it was\nin past versions of Windows.\n\n248\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.970\nWe do now have a GUI, we can still\ndo a lot of this from PowerShell,\n\n249\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.660\nor all of this from PowerShell.\n\n250\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.150\nI am going to use our\ngraphical user interface.\n\n251\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.240\nI'm gonna open up our DNS console here,\nand\n\n252\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.950\nI'm simply gonna go to\nmy forward lookup zone.\n\n253\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.770\nAnd let's take a look at what I've got so\nfar.\n\n254\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.890\nI know we haven't gone over\nthe different records just yet, but\n\n255\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.760\nyou'll see I have a few different\nA records, some NS, an SOA record.\n\n256\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.730\nBut all in all, not that many, all right.\n\n257\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.460\nBut this zone is not signed.\n\n258\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.100\nNow what I wanna do,\nIs a couple of things.\n\n259\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.410\nTo get it started just right\nclick on the zone itself and\n\n260\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.130\nchoose DNSSEC &gt; sign the zone.\n\n261\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.340\nThat's gonna launch a handy dandy wizard.\n\n262\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.980\nIt's gonna walk me through\nthe process of signing the zone.\n\n263\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.150\nWe'll click next on the intro screen.\n\n264\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.970\nThen I've got a couple of options here.\n\n265\n00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.700\nI can either customize\nzone signing parameters,\n\n266\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.910\nsign the zone of parameters of an existing\nzone, use the default settings.\n\n267\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.960\nThe sign with the existing zone,\n\n268\n00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.540\nif I had already signed another\nzone over here on my DNS server.\n\n269\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.330\nI could choose this and say hey, this new\nzone, I wanna use the same options I did\n\n270\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.350\nwith the last zone I did, so\nit just saves you some time, all right?\n\n271\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.060\nDefaults are really what\nI'm gonna end up using, and\n\n272\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.120\nwhat most of us will end up using.\n\n273\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.110\nSo this is the easiest way.\n\n274\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.300\nYou pretty much use this, and\nyou click next/finish and you're done.\n\n275\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.820\nI'm gonna choose Custom for this demo,\nbecause I want you to see all the things\n\n276\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.640\nthat we have to possibility or\nthe ability to configure.\n\n277\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.400\nSo I'll click next.\n\n278\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.190\nAnd who's gonna be the key master.\n\n279\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.380\nWho's gonna be responsible for\nsecuring the keys and\n\n280\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.770\ndistributing the keys to other\nDNS servers when necessary?\n\n281\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.120\nBy default it'll be the server\nthat you're initializing this on.\n\n282\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.880\nYou could select another\nserver if you needed to.\n\n283\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.790\nI'm gonna leave it as this server.\n\n284\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.350\nI'll click next.\n\n285\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.050\nAnd then I've gotta generate some keys\nthat we're gonna use for this process or\n\n286\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.870\nI should say key pairs really.\n\n287\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.210\nThere's the key sign in key, this is\nthe one that protects the keys themselves.\n\n288\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.540\nThe zone sign in keys that is.\n\n289\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.330\nSo it gives you a little intro here,\nkinda tells you about it.\n\n290\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.060\nI'll click next on here.\n\n291\n00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.140\nAnd then I'm gonna click add.\n\n292\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.460\nAnd we zoom back out a little bit.\n\n293\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.752\nHere's my new key, sign in key dialogue.\n\n294\n00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:38.925\nIt's gonna generate all this information,\n\n295\n00:14:38.925 --> 00:14:43.950\ncreate new sign in keys, I can adjust\nthe algorithm, the key length bits.\n\n296\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:49.478\nAnd down here at the bottom is the\nimportant one is the roll over frequency,\n\n297\n00:14:49.478 --> 00:14:52.389\nhow long is this key gonna be valid for?\n\n298\n00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:55.770\n755 days, for the key signing key.\n\n299\n00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.190\nYou'll see that the zone signing key,\nis much more frequent.\n\n300\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.940\nAll right.\n\n301\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.750\nBut this one is again, really just\nto protect the zone signing key.\n\n302\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.800\nIt's that next level of security.\n\n303\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.220\nSo this one doesn't have to be changed,\nnearly as often.\n\n304\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.370\nThese bad guys aren't really gonna\nhave access directly to this,\n\n305\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.690\nto try to break it.\n\n306\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.900\nWe'll click okay on that.\n\n307\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.420\nAnd it generates my key.\n\n308\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.400\nI'll click next, and\nthen I need a zone sign in key.\n\n309\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.962\nI'll click next on our wizard,\nand same thing.\n\n310\n00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:27.410\nI'm gonna click add, and\n\n311\n00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.060\nit's going to show me the properties\nof the zone sign in key.\n\n312\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.040\nNotice the key length is\na little bit smaller,\n\n313\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.910\nwhich is usually a bad thing when\nit comes to cryptography, but\n\n314\n00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.980\nwe've got to find the balance\nbetween security and performance.\n\n315\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.660\nThis one does the bulk of the work this is\nthe one that actually signs the records\n\n316\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.200\nthat's being distributed\nout to the clients,\n\n317\n00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.360\nthat the clients are gonna\nhave to reverse, right?\n\n318\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.850\nSo you don't put too\nmuch workload on them, so\n\n319\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.380\nwe find that balance this was a little\nshorter it also rolls over every 90 days.\n\n320\n00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.606\nWhich is a good thing, right?\n\n321\n00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:58.317\nIt's a little bit shorter, which means it\nmight not take as long to try to break,\n\n322\n00:15:58.317 --> 00:16:00.074\nbut we're gonna roll it over faster.\n\n323\n00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:01.284\nSo.\n\n324\n00:16:01.284 --> 00:16:04.082\nThey better get their butt in gear\nif they're gonna try to break it,\n\n325\n00:16:04.082 --> 00:16:06.850\nbecause we're gonna be on to\na new one in 90 days, right?\n\n326\n00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.335\nSo the idea is a less key,\nshort key length but\n\n327\n00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:13.060\nwe roll it over more frequently, right?\n\n328\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.090\nWe'll click OK on that, it's gonna\ngenerate that key, we'll click Next.\n\n329\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.650\nAnd then here, I can choose to\nuse NSEC3 or good old NSEC.\n\n330\n00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:28.370\nWe'll leave it on NSEC3, click Next and\nthen I've got my trust anchor information.\n\n331\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.190\nDo I want to enable the distribution\nof trust anchors for this zone?\n\n332\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.380\nIf this is a domain controller,\nwhich it is, and\n\n333\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.380\nI had other domain controllers that\nwere also DNS servers that were hosting\n\n334\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.190\nthis zone, they would need\ncopies of those keys as well and\n\n335\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.350\nit would distribute to all the other\ndomain controllers enforced.\n\n336\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:48.560\nIf it's not a domain controller, this is\ngonna be added to the local store and\n\n337\n00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.480\nI'd have to manually distribute that out.\n\n338\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.290\nEven though I don't have any\nother domain controllers,\n\n339\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.670\nI would choose Yes just to\nshow you best practices here.\n\n340\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.740\nAnd then Enable automatic update\nof trust anchors on key rollover.\n\n341\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.310\nSo, when that 90 days occurs and\n\n342\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.760\nwe generate a new key, I need to make sure\nall the people that are using the key,\n\n343\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.960\nthe other DNS servers,\nhave a copy of the new key, right?\n\n344\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.560\nSo automatic update on key roller,\nwe'll click Next.\n\n345\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.950\nSome settings for the Signing and Polling.\n\n346\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.205\nHow long it waits before checks to see if\nthere's any changes, things like that,\n\n347\n00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:26.115\nwe're just gonna leave all the defaults,\nclick Next.\n\n348\n00:17:26.115 --> 00:17:31.302\nAnd Next again and\nthen Finish and we're done.\n\n349\n00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:35.332\nWe just signed the zone, all right,\nor set up DNSSEC on the zone.\n\n350\n00:17:35.332 --> 00:17:38.842\nAgain, I hate saying signing the zone,\neven though that's how we talk about it.\n\n351\n00:17:38.842 --> 00:17:41.170\nCuz remember,\nyou're not really signing the zone itself.\n\n352\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.220\nNow, it doesn't look like\nanything's changed, right?\n\n353\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.771\nIt's like eh, nothing changed, beautiful.\n\n354\n00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:46.643\nNo, not so.\n\n355\n00:17:46.643 --> 00:17:48.628\nGo ahead and\ngo back to my screen for a second.\n\n356\n00:17:48.628 --> 00:17:52.128\nAnd remember, this console does\nnot refresh automatically.\n\n357\n00:17:52.128 --> 00:17:56.140\nSo I'm gonna go click the refresh\nbutton up here, and, hm,\n\n358\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.880\nI guess there was a little\nbit of change to my zone.\n\n359\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.730\nI like things organized and\nneat and this drives me crazy.\n\n360\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.339\nI will tell you,\nthe first time I implemented DNSSEC,\n\n361\n00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:13.449\nI was like,\nwhat did they do to my zone file?\n\n362\n00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:16.736\nCuz there's a lot of additional\nrecords that are gonna be in here.\n\n363\n00:18:16.736 --> 00:18:21.120\nYou'll see the RRSIG,\nthose resource record signatures.\n\n364\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.650\nThe DNS keys that are gonna be used.\n\n365\n00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:28.330\nAll the NSEC3 records,\nall right, that get generated.\n\n366\n00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:32.910\nSo it's a lot [LAUGH] of\ninformation gets dumped in here.\n\n367\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.250\nLuckily for us we can filter this or\norganize it by type and\n\n368\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.860\nI can still find all my A records and\nI can order the rest of them.\n\n369\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.330\nMe personally, as a DNS admin, I really\ncan't read these or look at these, right?\n\n370\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.960\nThese are just records that\nare there to support DNSSEC,\n\n371\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.049\nI almost wish they get dumped in a little\nnode somewhere in kinda set aside but.\n\n372\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.185\nYeah, I didn't design it.\n\n373\n00:18:55.185 --> 00:18:57.750\nAnywho, that is our sign zone.\n\n374\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.530\nAll right, now we've assigned the zone but\nwe're not done yet, okay?\n\n375\n00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.288\nThe clients,\nanybody that's querying this DNS\n\n376\n00:19:06.288 --> 00:19:10.787\nserver needs to understand\nthat DNSSEC has been enabled.\n\n377\n00:19:10.787 --> 00:19:13.462\nAnd we wanna force them to check.\n\n378\n00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:16.449\nWhen a zone is signed like this,\nif somebody queries it,\n\n379\n00:19:16.449 --> 00:19:18.830\nthe DNS server will\nrespond with the answer.\n\n380\n00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.489\nIt'll throw them out the A record,\nthen the RRSIG record.\n\n381\n00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:25.335\nBut the other end doesn't\nnecessarily have to validate it.\n\n382\n00:19:25.335 --> 00:19:27.180\nThey can say, I don't know what this\nother record's for, I don't care.\n\n383\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.991\nYou gave me the IP address,\nwe're good to go, all right?\n\n384\n00:19:29.991 --> 00:19:33.456\nBut the whole point of doing this is\nto force the end to actually validate\n\n385\n00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:34.392\nthe information.\n\n386\n00:19:34.392 --> 00:19:38.469\nBecause if I don't tell the client to\nvalidate it and it just uses it anyway,\n\n387\n00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:42.545\nwe might as well not set it up on the\nfirst place, they can still get spoofed,\n\n388\n00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:44.290\nnot gonna be a good day.\n\n389\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:49.340\nSo what we need to do is we need to\nconfigure the client to use the DNSSEC.\n\n390\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:55.080\nAnd for that, we're actually gonna\nuse our name resolution policy table.\n\n391\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.924\nI'm gonna just close DNS for now and\n\n392\n00:19:58.924 --> 00:20:03.802\nI'm gonna open up group policy management.\n\n393\n00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:07.623\nAnd we're gonna do a no-no, and\nyou know what, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n394\n00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.899\nI was gonna say I'm gonna do\nwhat I tell you guys not to do,\n\n395\n00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:11.668\nI'm gonna modify the default and I'm not.\n\n396\n00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:14.946\nI'm gonna make a new DNSSEC policy,\n\n397\n00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:19.296\nattach it to the domain,\nright-click, Edit.\n\n398\n00:20:19.296 --> 00:20:24.544\nAnd in the Settings for DNSSEC, or I\nshould say for the name resolution policy\n\n399\n00:20:24.544 --> 00:20:30.942\ntable, Computer configuration &gt; Policies &gt;\nWindows settings &gt; Name resolution policy.\n\n400\n00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:34.030\nThis is unlike any other\npolicy you see in here.\n\n401\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.260\nIt's got this form that you fill out and\nAccept and Apply buttons all over it.\n\n402\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.030\nIt's crazy.\n\n403\n00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.493\nSo to which part of the namespace\ndoes this rule apply?\n\n404\n00:20:42.493 --> 00:20:50.061\nIt's gonna be to the suffix,\nlab.itpro.tv is gonna be my suffix.\n\n405\n00:20:50.061 --> 00:20:52.767\nAnd, then I've got this tab here, DNSSEC.\n\n406\n00:20:52.767 --> 00:20:57.929\nI wanna enable DNSSEC and I wanna require\nDNS clients to check that the name and\n\n407\n00:20:57.929 --> 00:21:01.690\naddress data has been\nvalidated by the DNS server.\n\n408\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.600\nVery important that I check\nthat checkmark there.\n\n409\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.420\nThen, you have to click Create.\n\n410\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.280\nAnd this bugged me the first\ntime I went and look at this.\n\n411\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.860\nCuz you Create and, look, all my\ninformation is gone, did it do anything?\n\n412\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.642\nWhat did it do?\n\n413\n00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:16.745\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look like it did anything.\n\n414\n00:21:16.745 --> 00:21:21.206\nAnd, Mike, while you got it on that page\nright there, whatever, the settings,\n\n415\n00:21:21.206 --> 00:21:24.181\nI noticed something that we\ndidn't have to set up, and\n\n416\n00:21:24.181 --> 00:21:26.160\nmaybe you can help me out on that.\n\n417\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.838\nYou didn't have to set up\nan internal PKI for this.\n\n418\n00:21:28.838 --> 00:21:32.145\nThis server generated its own certificate,\nis that what I'm understanding?\n\n419\n00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:33.078\n&gt;&gt; It did, it generated the keys.\n\n420\n00:21:33.078 --> 00:21:34.536\nWhen we went through that wizard,\n\n421\n00:21:34.536 --> 00:21:37.925\ngave it all the parameters that we wanted\nit to use when it generated those keys.\n\n422\n00:21:37.925 --> 00:21:40.790\nWith how long, how strong,\nwhat algorithms, everything.\n\n423\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.840\nSo it's all generated behind the scenes.\n\n424\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.687\nSo if I scroll down, and I missed this\nthe first time, I was like, wait,\n\n425\n00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:48.708\nI don't understand, why is this not,\nI remember when this first came out.\n\n426\n00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:53.019\nName resolution, policy, TML came out,\nwhat, back in 2008 with direct access.\n\n427\n00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n428\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.560\n&gt;&gt; And I was like, wait,\nI don't get it, where did my rule go?\n\n429\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.301\nYou have to scroll down a little bit and\nyou'll see, here's a table and\n\n430\n00:22:00.301 --> 00:22:02.242\nthere's the rule that I just created.\n\n431\n00:22:02.242 --> 00:22:04.877\nCuz the idea is I can go back and\ncreate other rules,\n\n432\n00:22:04.877 --> 00:22:06.604\nadd them to this table down here.\n\n433\n00:22:06.604 --> 00:22:09.995\nBut what you wanna do is after\nyou do the enable DNSSEC,\n\n434\n00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:13.111\nmake sure your rule shows up for\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n435\n00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:15.445\nDNSSEC is set to Yes.\n\n436\n00:22:15.445 --> 00:22:20.185\nAnd down at the bottom here,\nI should have, I'm gonna zoom back out and\n\n437\n00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:22.010\nscroll the rest of the way.\n\n438\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.057\nThere's the hidden Apply button\nway down there at the bottom.\n\n439\n00:22:26.057 --> 00:22:30.545\nAnd I hit it two or three times because I\ncan't tell if it's actually doing anything\n\n440\n00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:32.546\nor not, so I click it a couple times.\n\n441\n00:22:32.546 --> 00:22:35.677\nHelp us out there, Microsoft,\ngive us some kind of a response there.\n\n442\n00:22:35.677 --> 00:22:38.356\nAll right, so now I've got that\npolicy set up, I'll go ahead and\n\n443\n00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.172\nclose the Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n444\n00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:43.616\nI'm gonna minimize group\npolicy console and\n\n445\n00:22:43.616 --> 00:22:49.240\nI'm gonna open up PowerShell\nbecause we need to update policy.\n\n446\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.410\nWe could wait 90 minutes or\nreboot the server.\n\n447\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.000\nBut in a production environment,\na lot of times that is not an option.\n\n448\n00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.620\nSo we'll wait for\nmy PowerShell to come up.\n\n449\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.840\nI'll blow up my fonts a little bit so\nyou can see it, but\n\n450\n00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.410\nI'm not doing anything we haven't\nseen before, most likely.\n\n451\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:11.640\nIf not,\nenjoy my Active Directory shows and\n\n452\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.480\nyou'll learn about gpupdate switch force.\n\n453\n00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.285\nWe're just gonna update that policy\non this DNSserver/domaincontroller.\n\n454\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Bow Mike, while we're waiting for this,\nI got just a quick question on namespace.\n\n455\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.980\nSo, it's gonna look at this policy and\nit's gonna say, if you were trying to\n\n456\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.490\nresolve something with this namespace,\nyou're gonna send it to this server.\n\n457\n00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.662\nBut anything else, it's just gonna use\nthe normal interface defying DNS server?\n\n458\n00:23:35.662 --> 00:23:37.279\n&gt;&gt; It's not so\nmuch who it's sending it to,\n\n459\n00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.610\nit's whether or\nnot it's gonna validate it.\n\n460\n00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.990\nLike if I'm querying for a name that ends\nin lab.itpro.tv, I better make sure I get\n\n461\n00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.400\nthat resource record signature and\nI validate the information.\n\n462\n00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.408\nBut if I'm querying for Google.com or\nEbay.com, well, I don't know if\n\n463\n00:23:52.408 --> 00:23:57.663\nthey've set up NSEC or DNSSEC and\nmy client shouldn't expect that from them.\n\n464\n00:23:57.663 --> 00:23:58.792\nSo that's why we use that table.\n\n465\n00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:03.763\nWe don't say Every DNS query you ever\nsend out, make sure it's signed.\n\n466\n00:24:03.763 --> 00:24:07.580\nBecause I don't have control over\neverybody else's DNS servers, right?\n\n467\n00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.560\nSo I'm saying hey, if it's\na lab.ITPro.tv name you're looking for,\n\n468\n00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.450\nmake sure you check the DNSSEC and\nmake sure it's validated.\n\n469\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.820\nAnd that's what we use that name\nresolution policy table for\n\n470\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.850\nis to say, when do I check,\nwhen don't I check?\n\n471\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.600\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n472\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.610\nIt doesn't make any decisions\non where to route it to.\n\n473\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.480\nIt's just, if it's in that name space,\nI better have a signature on it.\n\n474\n00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.690\n&gt;&gt; It better be signed.\n\n475\n00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.270\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna be,\n\n476\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:31.950\nit's gonna be normal if I could say this\nright, like any other normal DNS query.\n\n477\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna switch\nover to the client now and\n\n478\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.390\nsee what's going on over there.\n\n479\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.590\nI disabled the link real\nquick on the policy,\n\n480\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.900\nbecause I forgot we haven't\nswitched to the client yet.\n\n481\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.340\nI wanted to show you that the policy\nresolution table that we created\n\n482\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.370\nis not there yet.\n\n483\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:49.604\nSo let's first look at, I'm gonna do\n\n484\n00:24:49.604 --> 00:24:55.670\na git-dns client nrpt policy, all right.\n\n485\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.770\nAnd I get nothing back.\n\n486\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.444\nRight?\nWhich means there is no name resolution\n\n487\n00:24:59.444 --> 00:25:02.149\npolicy table policy in\nplace on this client.\n\n488\n00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:08.233\nI'll go back over to the domain controller\nand I'm just gonna enable a link for\n\n489\n00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:12.934\nthat policy we had just created,\nbasically turn it back on,\n\n490\n00:25:12.934 --> 00:25:17.050\nback over to the client,\nand we'll update policy.\n\n491\n00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.831\nGP update switch force to\nrefresh our group policy.\n\n492\n00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:30.200\nAnd then as soon as that's done,\n\n493\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.320\nrun that same command again,\nget-DNSclient NRPT policy.\n\n494\n00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.070\nAnd now we can see the policy is in place,\nand what we want to verify,\n\n495\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.490\nis we set our policy correctly\nDNS SEC validation required,\n\n496\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:49.050\nis now set to true, so\nthat tells me the policy is in place.\n\n497\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.280\nNow let's see if we can resolve a name.\n\n498\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.440\nLet me just clear that screen,\nget us back up to the top.\n\n499\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:03.140\nI'm gonna do my resolve-dnsname and\n\n500\n00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.020\nwe'll look for the SVR01 just as one of\nthe computers I know that's in there.\n\n501\n00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:13.200\nTell it to use server DC01,\nthat's my DNS server.\n\n502\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.510\nAnd I also wanna do a DNSsecok\nwhich turns on that flag.\n\n503\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.840\nNow in the client that policy is in place\nand when it queries DNS in the background.\n\n504\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.015\nIf I open up my browser and\nI type in Google.\n\n505\n00:26:26.015 --> 00:26:30.690\nSorry, not Google, something.itpro.tv,\nit's gonna use that table.\n\n506\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.030\nIt's gonna validate the securities\nin place, the table tells it to.\n\n507\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.890\nWhen I'm doing it through PowerShell\nlike this with the resolve-DNS name I'm\n\n508\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.130\nbypassing that stuff, so I want to force\nit to do the same thing the client\n\n509\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.490\nwould normally be doing,\nwhich is why I use this -DNS sec ok.\n\n510\n00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:51.030\nThat basically says, turn on the DNS\nsec flag within the packet or\n\n511\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.080\nthe query that's being sent so\nthat way the DNS server,\n\n512\n00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.280\nif it has any DNS sec information,\nlike a resource record signatures\n\n513\n00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.520\nit'll send that information back\nwith the a record or the response.\n\n514\n00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.750\nSo we'll hit Enter, and there we go.\n\n515\n00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.090\nWe can see that I did get an answer.\n\n516\n00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.330\nAnd really what I'm looking\nat is right down here.\n\n517\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.800\nThat it is signed, who signed it.\n\n518\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.350\nIt's got the signature,\nthat doesn't do me a lot of good, but\n\n519\n00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:21.420\nthat's being validated using those DNS\nkeys by the client in the background.\n\n520\n00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.250\nRight and that my friends is DNSsec.\n\n521\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.790\nA little,\njust a quick demonstration on one,\n\n522\n00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:32.290\nhow we can turn it on and how we see\nthe client validating that information.\n\n523\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.730\nOr how we tell the clients, more\nimportantly, that they should use DNSsec\n\n524\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.350\nif they're using that particular zone or\nanything ends in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n525\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty interesting.\n\n526\n00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.060\nI like that, Mike.\n\n527\n00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.300\nYou know you were talking about\nthe non-repudiation part there where now\n\n528\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.110\nI know that it's gonna have to be coming\nfrom the DNS server that we think it is.\n\n529\n00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.840\nNow it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode here.\n\n530\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.630\nBut Mike, before we sign out,\ndo you have any additional\n\n531\n00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.500\nthings you'd like to throw in this one or\nare we headed for a part five?\n\n532\n00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.860\n&gt;&gt; No I don't think\nwe're good on this one.\n\n533\n00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.749\nWe do have another part but it's gonna\nbe dealing with DNS policies, and\n\n534\n00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:06.720\nanother new feature in Server2016.\n\n535\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, well we appreciate\nyou all being here and watching us,\n\n536\n00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.710\nwe're gonna go and sign out for\nITpro.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n537\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.439\n&gt;&gt; An I am Mike Rodrick and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:28:15.439 -->

00:00:07.202\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:11.893\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.330\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.950\nwe're continuing through our\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.230\nAnd we've actually been in this topic for\na little bit, because it is a very,\n\n9\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.190\nvery diverse topic.\n\n10\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.590\nAnd really, we could spend the rest\nof the time in server and DNS so\n\n11\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.670\nwe're gonna be looking at\nsome really cool things.\n\n12\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.490\nI don't want to blow the surprise here for\n\n13\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.790\nyou because of the fact that\nI've seen some of the notes and\n\n14\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.370\nto help us out of this topic is\nnone other than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n15\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.260\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n16\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n17\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.070\nThanks for having me back here.\n\n18\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.530\nDNS, I think I've said it a few times,\na few different episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.730\nOne of my favorite topic also,\nas Wes pointed out,\n\n20\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.720\na big big portion of the exam and in the\nreal world, You've got to understand your\n\n21\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.980\nDNS cuz a lot of troubles that our\nclients end up having come back to DNS.\n\n22\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.030\nSo to this episode, what we're gonna\nbe looking at is something known as\n\n23\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.850\nDNS policies, these are new 2016.\n\n24\n00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.680\nSo if you probably, something that you\nhaven't had the chance to play with yet,\n\n25\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.040\nmake sure you jump over to our labs and\ntry these things out.\n\n26\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.510\nCuz we're gonna go over some of\nthe things you can do with this.\n\n27\n00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.560\nI've got a demonstration set up where\nwe're gonna demonstrate one of the things\n\n28\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.420\nI can do with it.\n\n29\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.100\nBut I can't possibly\ndemonstrate all those.\n\n30\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300\nYou really need to play around with this.\n\n31\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.530\nCuz it does get a little complex\nwith some of these policies\n\n32\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.820\nthat we can end up setting up.\n\n33\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.570\nA lot of new, and it's all new.\n\n34\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.650\nNew parameters that we have to set,\nnew options with our DNS or\n\n35\n00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.280\nour PowerShell commands that we can run.\n\n36\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.920\nSo let's start by talking about you know,\nwhat the heck these DNS policies are and\n\n37\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.360\nreally it is just a policy that's going to\n\n38\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.290\naffect the way our DNS\nserver responds to queries.\n\n39\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.980\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n40\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.150\nWe're creating policies that\nare gonna modify the default behavior\n\n41\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.820\nof our DNS server when\nit responds to policies.\n\n42\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.240\nWhy, why should I modify anything,\nDNS works great.\n\n43\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.400\nWhat is there to modify?\n\n44\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.780\nWell some of the things that\nwe could do with DNS policies\n\n45\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.690\nApplication high availability.\n\n46\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.870\nWe can actually re direct based on\nthe health of the application server.\n\n47\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.340\nIn other words my DNS\nserver when you query for\n\n48\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.080\nthe name of the application server you get\na user that's connecting that application,\n\n49\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.480\nin the background the application\nis reaching out talking to DNS.\n\n50\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050\nGet the IP address of the server that's\nhosting the application or the data for\n\n51\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.680\nthe application.\n\n52\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.340\nThe DNS server can say wait,\nI'm gonna change my answer\n\n53\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.320\nbased on the health of those nodes\nthat are hosting that application.\n\n54\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.250\nIf that was then, I'm not gonna give\nit to you, I'm gonna give you this one.\n\n55\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.240\nOr we can do traffic management,\nredirect to the closest data center.\n\n56\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.050\nWe can basically Lump subnets, we can\ncreate these geolocations basically.\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.300\nLike USA and Europe or\nAmericas and Europe.\n\n58\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.580\nAnd I might have a data center in both.\n\n59\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.490\nAnd if the requester is coming from an IP\naddress based out of the US, then I'm\n\n60\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.460\ngonna give him the IP address of the web\nserver that's hosted in my US data center.\n\n61\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.320\nBut if the request is coming from an IP\naddress range that's European based,\n\n62\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.620\nthen I'll give them the IP address\nof the web server that's hosted\n\n63\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.360\nin my European data center.\n\n64\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.540\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n65\n00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.380\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that kind of reminds me of\na topic that you talk about pretty\n\n66\n00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.640\nheavily in your Active Directory episodes\nwhen you talk about defining sites.\n\n67\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.740\nRight, Active Directory's a logical\nboundary doesn't necessarily map\n\n68\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.240\nto our physical locations.\n\n69\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.270\nYou say pretty much we can do something\nlike that where we can map this logical\n\n70\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.590\ninfrastructure more to a physical layout.\n\n71\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.810\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and these are nodes that\nare not part of my active directory.\n\n72\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.480\nThese are just visitors to my\n\n73\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.310\nwebsite if they-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n74\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.120\n&gt;&gt; Happen to be coming\nfrom a European address.\n\n75\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.270\nNow one thing I will point out here,\nwhile we're on this subject, and\n\n76\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.970\nit affects all of these really,\nis when these DNS policies kick in.\n\n77\n00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.140\nYou know,\nif we think about the way DNS works,\n\n78\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.400\nback to our first episode\nmany moons ago on DNS.\n\n79\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.510\nWhen we started this, well I don't know,\nwe're five, six episodes in now.\n\n80\n00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.540\nYou know,\nwe talked about the way DNS works.\n\n81\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.810\nMy client sends a query to my local DNS\nserver or the ISP that I'm connected to.\n\n82\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.220\nThat ISP goes to the root, the top level,\nfinds the authoritative server,\n\n83\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.530\nsends the request, gets the information,\ngives it back to the client.\n\n84\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.130\nSo in other words, the authoritative\nserver, the one we're gonna be creating\n\n85\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.470\nthese policies on,\nwhose IP address is he seeing?\n\n86\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.630\nHe's not seeing the client's, he's\nactually seeing the client's DNS server.\n\n87\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.000\nThat's the one that actually does\nthe request to the authoritative.\n\n88\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.010\nSo, yes we can, but understand that\nthere's a little bit of give in there,\n\n89\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.070\nor a little but of, I'm trying to\nthink of a good word to describe that.\n\n90\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.890\nMost likely, you're in the same\nlocation as your ISP, so\n\n91\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.620\nit's really not gonna cause a big problem,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.970\nIt's very doubtful that you're\nhere in the States, yet\n\n93\n00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.940\nyou happen to be bouncing\nthrough a DNS server\n\n94\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.700\nthat's over there in Europe somewhere,\nso it's not gonna be that far off.\n\n95\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.480\nHopefully that makes sense.\n\n96\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.290\nMy ISP might be in Tampa,\n\n97\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.040\nmight be in Georgia,\nsomewhere in Atlanta or something.\n\n98\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.990\nIt's still gonna see it\nas a US-based IP address,\n\n99\n00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.000\nI'm still gonna get redirected\nto the US-based data center.\n\n100\n00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.200\nWe can just split brain DNS,\nand we can do this with DNS but\n\n101\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.780\nit was a very manual thing that\nwe did with this policies.\n\n102\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.610\nI can give you a different IP address\nbased on whether you're coming\n\n103\n00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.790\nfrom an internal IP address or\nan external IP address, right.\n\n104\n00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.780\nWe can do filtering.\n\n105\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.570\nWe can query from a list of malicious\nIP address, it can be blocked.\n\n106\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.140\nSo if we know, that we've got,\n\n107\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.610\nwe see in our log files somebody is\nhammering our DNS server or trying to do\n\n108\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.190\nsomething malicious on our network,\nI can completely drop those DNS queries.\n\n109\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.910\nI can say look, any DNS queries coming\nfrom this subnet just don't even bother.\n\n110\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.150\nBlock them before they get there.\n\n111\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.750\nWe can do forensics.\n\n112\n00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.160\nWhere malicious clients are redirected\nto what they call a sinkhole\n\n113\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.210\ninstead of the computer they're\ntrying to reach, all right.\n\n114\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.700\nNow that's a little misleading.\n\n115\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.600\nBasically it's not so\nmuch malicious clients.\n\n116\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.380\nAs what we're doing is we would take\nknown bad sites and if one of my users,\n\n117\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.595\nso they're not malicious but\nthey're I won't say it.\n\n118\n00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:14.315\nOn my users, if they try to connect\nto some place that's known bad,\n\n119\n00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:19.375\nI basically have a list and\nI can say redirect them somewhere else.\n\n120\n00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.015\nDon't allow them to go that place.\n\n121\n00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:24.625\nDon't go to those IP address ranges.\n\n122\n00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:29.555\nTime of day restrictions,\nwe can do redirecting to the data center\n\n123\n00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.590\nhere If it's a certain time of day.\n\n124\n00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.720\nIf it's midnight, 1 o'clock, we'll\nredirect you to a data center that's in\n\n125\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.410\nan area of the world that's up running\nat 9 to 5, or whatever the case may be.\n\n126\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.460\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like it would be really\nhandy if you're running some kind of\n\n127\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.820\ntraffic analysis and you realize there's\na peak time in your data centers that\n\n128\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.360\nyou can direct that if you\nneed to direct the queries.\n\n129\n00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.770\nAbsolutely, so\na lot of cool things it can do.\n\n130\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.950\nAnd there's more really if we start\ngetting creative with some of these rules\n\n131\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.790\ncuz we can also combine\nsome of these policies.\n\n132\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.340\nThere are some new DNS objects that we\nneed to be familiar with that allow these\n\n133\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.680\npolicies or\nallow us to create these policies.\n\n134\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.104\nThere are client subnets.\n\n135\n00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:08.530\nOkay, client subnet, that's not new.\n\n136\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.880\nIt is in respect to DNS, right?\n\n137\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.490\nI can create an object\nin DNS that represents\n\n138\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.890\na subnet that I can use in these policies.\n\n139\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.350\nI can represent an IPV4 or an IPV6 subnet.\n\n140\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.820\nWe also have recursion scopes.\n\n141\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.590\nWe can actually control the whether or\nnot we're allowed to use,\n\n142\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.470\nrecursion based on the namespace\nthat you're trying to resolve.\n\n143\n00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.130\nWe can do zone scopes.\n\n144\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.060\nThere is a new object called zone scopes.\n\n145\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.460\nZone scopes are really cool, I'm gonna\nput those in the demonstration here.\n\n146\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.410\nBasically, we're gonna create\ninstances of our zone.\n\n147\n00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.342\nAnd we can modify records\nin one instance of that.\n\n148\n00:07:51.342 --> 00:07:53.418\nSo it's a copy of the default zone.\n\n149\n00:07:53.418 --> 00:07:56.310\nLet's say I had a zone for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n150\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.942\nI can create a zone scope,\nThat's all those same records.\n\n151\n00:07:59.942 --> 00:08:01.290\nIt's a logical thing.\n\n152\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.568\nAnd I'm gonna give it a name.\n\n153\n00:08:02.568 --> 00:08:06.940\nAnd then I can go in and modify\nthe records that are in that zone scope.\n\n154\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:12.550\nSo that if you, when you send that query\nbased on what you're doing with that query\n\n155\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.080\nI can say don't give them the answer,\nthe IP address from the normal zone.\n\n156\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.260\nGive him the IP address\nfrom the zone scope and\n\n157\n00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.240\nthat will make more sense\nas I go through this demo.\n\n158\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.840\nI know that's kind of twisted\nto just hear me say that, but\n\n159\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.240\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n160\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.380\nThere's also policy types\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n161\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.870\nWe can do query resolution policies,\n\n162\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.710\nhow those queries are handled\nby the incoming server.\n\n163\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.200\nWe've got our recursion\npolicies that handle\n\n164\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.610\nhow DNS server does\nrecursion based on the name.\n\n165\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.490\nAnd then we've got zone transfer\npolicies that effect whether or\n\n166\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.010\nnot a zone transfer is allowed based on\nwhere maybe that request is coming from.\n\n167\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.370\nAnd I know most of this can\nbe done by other means, but\n\n168\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.710\nnow we're able to implement it again\nthrough these policies which are reusable.\n\n169\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.910\nWe can take them from one\nDNS server to another.\n\n170\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.520\nReally neat stuff.\n\n171\n00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.720\nSo let's take a look at it.\n\n172\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.700\nLet's see if we can't make\nanymore sense out of it.\n\n173\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.380\nI'll go through these different\npieces parts and I'll explain.\n\n174\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.060\nSo what I just defined will start to\nmake sense as I go through this lab.\n\n175\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.340\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n176\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.456\nAnd what I'm gonna do, I'm on our domain\ncontroller who's also our DNS server.\n\n177\n00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:23.929\nAnd I'll go ahead and open up DNS just so\nwe can see what's going on over there.\n\n178\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.000\nI've got one zone should for\nITPro or Lab.ITPro.TV.\n\n179\n00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.900\nI forgot we digitally signed\nthis in a previous episode, so\n\n180\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.670\nit looks really messy.\n\n181\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.389\nBut it's secure,\nthat's the good thing, right?\n\n182\n00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:38.493\nAll right, so we got DNS there.\n\n183\n00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:41.084\nWhat I'm gonna do is open\nup a PowerShell window.\n\n184\n00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:47.490\nLet's just do a little PowerShell.\n\n185\n00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:54.880\nAnd my computer's just\nbogged down right now.\n\n186\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.120\nThere we go, we get our PowerShell\nwindow opened up, all right.\n\n187\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.040\nSo the first thing we're gonna do,\n\n188\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.119\nis we're gonna create these\nDNS client subnets, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:10.826\nSo the command for that is gonna be,\nadd-dnsserverclientsubnet and\n\n190\n00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:15.450\nwe'll give it a chance\nto tab auto fill here.\n\n191\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.170\nAgain, it's acting a little slow,\n\n192\n00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.770\nI probably have a Windows\nupdate at the background.\n\n193\n00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.165\nDash name.\n\n194\n00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:23.808\nWow really slow.\n\n195\n00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:25.290\nThere we go.\n\n196\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.196\nIt'll pick up in a second.\n\n197\n00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:31.891\nAnd I'm going to call\nthis one internalIPs.\n\n198\n00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:34.460\nThat ends my quote.\n\n199\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.663\nAnd then I'm going to do,\nthis is an IPV4subnet,\n\n200\n00:10:39.663 --> 00:10:45.237\nand the range is going to be 10.0.0.0/16.\n\n201\n00:10:46.654 --> 00:10:47.598\nAnd I'll hit Enter.\n\n202\n00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:52.150\nNo red text, we're good to go.\n\n203\n00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.370\nThen I'm gonna do that same command again,\nso I'm gonna cheat and\n\n204\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.670\njust fix a couple things here.\n\n205\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.120\nAnd I'm gonna make another\nDNS server client subnet,\n\n206\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.000\nthis one is gonna be external IPs.\n\n207\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.870\nAnd I'm doing this all virtually,\nso I'm just gonna fake it out.\n\n208\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:19.310\nWe're gonna say 192.168.100.0/24,\nand I'll hit enter.\n\n209\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.437\nSo basically, I want to say anything\nthat's coming from that range,\n\n210\n00:11:22.437 --> 00:11:25.098\nwe're pretending the 192168\nis the outside world.\n\n211\n00:11:25.098 --> 00:11:26.672\nOkay?\n\n212\n00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:31.552\nAnd I've been doing\nGet-DnsServerClientSubnet\n\n213\n00:11:31.552 --> 00:11:36.110\nwe should see those two\nthat we just created.\n\n214\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.090\nOne called ExternalIPs,\none called InternalIPs.\n\n215\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.380\nAnd so this is how you would set it up.\n\n216\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.170\nYou know when I was talking about like for\nthe data centers.\n\n217\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.150\nYou can go out and you can find,\nI'll try to find that website I was using.\n\n218\n00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.910\nYou can see where blocks of\nIP addresses are assigned, so\n\n219\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.970\nhow do I know European subnets,\nright, how do I make that.\n\n220\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.470\nI need to know what blocks\nare assigned over there, so\n\n221\n00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.927\nthere's a pretty cool website that you\ncan use to find some of that information,\n\n222\n00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:07.470\nI'll see if I can throw\nthat in the notes for you.\n\n223\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.650\nAll right, so so\nfar we've got our client subnets created.\n\n224\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.810\nNext thing we want to do, Wes,\nis create the scope of the zones.\n\n225\n00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.660\nThese are going to be unique\ninstances of the zone.\n\n226\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.230\nAgain, I've got the zone right here.\n\n227\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.400\nBut I want to make changes to it,\nbut not to the actual zone.\n\n228\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.516\nI want to make a copy of the zone and\nthen make changes to that copy, so\n\n229\n00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:32.286\nthat depending on what IP address you're\nusing when you hit the DNS server I can\n\n230\n00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:36.866\nuse either this information or I can\nuse that information out of that copy.\n\n231\n00:12:36.866 --> 00:12:38.435\nAll right?\n\n232\n00:12:38.435 --> 00:12:41.597\nThat's where the power comes in\nis being able to create these\n\n233\n00:12:41.597 --> 00:12:43.430\ninstances of that zone.\n\n234\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:48.820\nThe default zone scope has the same\nname as the zone itself so\n\n235\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.930\nthat all our legacy DNS\noperations can still occur.\n\n236\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.975\nSo we're gonna do add-dnsserverresource,\nit's a long one.\n\n237\n00:12:58.975 --> 00:13:01.170\nAdd-dnsserverresourcerecord.\n\n238\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.080\nSorry that's not what we're doing.\n\n239\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.730\nServer zone scope, gotta do that.\n\n240\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.370\nZone scope.\n\n241\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.740\nAnd this one's gonna be a dash zone name,\nand I'm gonna call this one,\n\n242\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:22.480\nwell my zone is lab.itpro.tv and\nthen the dash name.\n\n243\n00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.540\nOops, forgot my quote there, sorry.\n\n244\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.787\nDash name.\n\n245\n00:13:27.787 --> 00:13:28.681\nAnd this is the name,\n\n246\n00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:31.520\nyou're gonna assign to the unique\ninstance that we're creating.\n\n247\n00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.400\nSo, I'm just gonna call it\ninternal scope and I'll hit enter.\n\n248\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.820\nAnd I'm gonna do the same command again\n\n249\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.079\nexcept I'm gonna make an external scope.\n\n250\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.800\nSo, let's do a Get -DnServerZoneScope.\n\n251\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.014\nAnd there's too many S's in there.\n\n252\n00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:10.804\nAnd the zone I want,\nI forgot my parameter is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n253\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.010\nAnd there I can see, let's zoom in real\nquick on this, there's the default scope.\n\n254\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.430\nThat's my normal DNS zone that's\nbeing hosted by this DNS server, but\n\n255\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.630\nthen there is two more.\n\n256\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.760\nThese unique virtual scopes or\n\n257\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.930\ninstances that I've\ncreated of that DNS zone.\n\n258\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.120\nNow, we're gonna add records,\nnot to the zone itself but\n\n259\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.900\nto the zone scopes that we just created.\n\n260\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.259\nThe command for that is gonna be add\n\n261\n00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:51.409\n-DnsServerResourceRecord-zone name\n\n262\n00:14:53.574 --> 00:14:59.972\nAnd that's gonna be lab.itpro.tv -a,\n\n263\n00:14:59.972 --> 00:15:04.592\ncuz I'm gonna add an a record,\n\n264\n00:15:04.592 --> 00:15:07.810\nall right, -name.\n\n265\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.388\nWhat's the record I'm adding?\n\n266\n00:15:09.388 --> 00:15:13.278\nwww in this case.\n\n267\n00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:18.218\n-IPV4 address.\n\n268\n00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:20.709\nAnd let's see what did we say\nwe're adding this first one?\n\n269\n00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:22.290\nWe're gonna do my internal.\n\n270\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:28.445\nSo that's gonna be 10.0.100.101,\n\n271\n00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:33.724\nI believe is the IP\naddress I gave that guy.\n\n272\n00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.930\nAnd we'll hit, I'm sorry, that's 100.\n\n273\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.710\nLet me just double check that.\n\n274\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.427\nYou know my memory is fantastic.\n\n275\n00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:53.603\nLet's just pull up quick,\nlittle PowerShell.\n\n276\n00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:57.876\nI say quick, nothing is being\nquick on these machines today.\n\n277\n00:15:57.876 --> 00:15:59.803\nAnd there we go, a little PowerShell.\n\n278\n00:16:12.866 --> 00:16:15.655\n10.0.100.100, all right.\n\n279\n00:16:15.655 --> 00:16:16.392\nGood to go there.\n\n280\n00:16:22.383 --> 00:16:25.245\nAll right, so again, back up,\njust had to switch over there and\n\n281\n00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:27.610\nverify that IP address that I'm typing in.\n\n282\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.254\nSo I've got my\nAdd-DnsServerResourceRecord,\n\n283\n00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:39.232\nthere's ZoneName lab.itpro.tv,\nA record, Name ww, IPV4 address.\n\n284\n00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:47.190\nAnd dash zone scope is going\nto be internal for this one.\n\n285\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.960\nSo that's the, what did we name that one?\n\n286\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.831\nInternal scope.\n\n287\n00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:55.110\n&gt;&gt; Internal IPs?\n\n288\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.200\n&gt;&gt; No, we're going to do it\nto this scope right there.\n\n289\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.000\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n290\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.270\nAll right, so let's make sure\nwe understand what we're doing.\n\n291\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:09.460\nWe took our zone, our normal lab.itpro.tv\nzone that's being hosted by DNS,\n\n292\n00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.190\nand we created two separate\ninstances of that zone.\n\n293\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.650\nOne called internal scope,\none called external scope.\n\n294\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.250\nNow I'm adding records to those instances.\n\n295\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.900\nIt's not going to show up in\nthe zone file itself, right?\n\n296\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.270\nI'm adding them to these\nlogical instances.\n\n297\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.800\nThat's what this command is doing.\n\n298\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.596\nSo I'm going to do another one,\nAdd-DnsServerResourceRecord,\n\n299\n00:17:32.596 --> 00:17:35.972\nsame zone name,\nsame A record, same name www.\n\n300\n00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:43.123\nIt's gonna be a different IP address,\n192.168.100.100,\n\n301\n00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:47.197\nand I need to add this\nto the external scope.\n\n302\n00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:50.350\nAnd I'll hit Enter.\n\n303\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.145\nAll right, so\nthink about what we're doing there.\n\n304\n00:17:54.145 --> 00:18:00.956\nWe're basically saying now,\nif you're part of the internal IP range,\n\n305\n00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:05.320\nwe're gonna pull your\nanswer when you query.\n\n306\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.240\nWe're gonna pull your answer\nfrom the internal scope and\n\n307\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.648\nyou'll get this IP address for www.\n\n308\n00:18:10.648 --> 00:18:16.440\nBut if you're coming from an external IP\naddress that's in that external subnet,\n\n309\n00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.440\nwe're going to use the external scope\nin the same query, is going to give you\n\n310\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.760\na different result based on the IP\naddress of the query initiator, right?\n\n311\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.010\nSo you see what we're doing there?\n\n312\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.660\nWe're creating two different records,\ntwo different IP addresses for\n\n313\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.620\nthe same server,\nput them in these unique instances, and\n\n314\n00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.690\nthen depending on where you come from\ndetermines what instance I use to\n\n315\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.490\nlook up the answer for your query, which\nis going to determine what answer you get.\n\n316\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.920\nPretty cool, right?\n\n317\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.000\nAll right, so we've got everything set up\nright now, we've got our scope set up.\n\n318\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.990\nWe've got our client subnet,\n\n319\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.930\nwe've got our scope,\nwe've added our records to the zone scope.\n\n320\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:57.170\nNow we're gonna add record to\nthe default zone scope because when\n\n321\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.210\nwe add them to those unique instances,\nagain like I said, it doesn't add it to my\n\n322\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.890\nactual scope that's being hosted by DNS,\nthat zone there, I should say.\n\n323\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.160\nAnd the rest of the world,\n\n324\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.045\nwhat if you're not coming from\neither one of those subnets, right?\n\n325\n00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:15.120\nIt still need to be able to resolve one\nof those IP addresses from the name so\n\n326\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.530\nthat you can connect to my resource.\n\n327\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.490\nSo, we are gonna add records\nto our actual zone as well.\n\n328\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.770\nWhich pretty much the same command.\n\n329\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.400\nI'm just going to take off ZoneScope.\n\n330\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.290\nI'm saying,\nhey just add this to lab.itpro.tv.\n\n331\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.530\nThe default zone, all right.\n\n332\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.000\nI'll do the same thing for the ten dot.\n\n333\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.986\nI'll take off ZoneScope, And\n\n334\n00:19:38.986 --> 00:19:43.440\nif we take a look at the zone itself,\nwe do a little refresh over here.\n\n335\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.970\nWe should see, there's the two\nrecords I just added, oops for\n\n336\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.240\nwww with the two different addresses,\nall right.\n\n337\n00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.080\nSo if you weren't coming from one of\nthose scopes, what's DNS gonna do?\n\n338\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.190\nIt's gonna give you both of these and\n\n339\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.849\nthen your client would determine\nwhich one it wants to use.\n\n340\n00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.510\nAll right, back over to PowerShell.\n\n341\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.300\nSo we got all the pieces in place but we\nhaven't defined the policies yet, right?\n\n342\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.380\nWe haven't made the rule that says,\nhey DNS, look at that incoming query,\n\n343\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.320\nlook at the source address, and use that\nto determine what instance of that zone\n\n344\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.030\ndo you use when you\ngenerate your response.\n\n345\n00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.540\nSo let's create those next these.\n\n346\n00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.700\nLet's just clear this screen.\n\n347\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.660\nGives us a little room.\n\n348\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.579\nWe're gonna be doing\nAdd-DnsServerQueryResolution policy.\n\n349\n00:20:33.579 --> 00:20:38.350\nThat's a mouthful.\nAdd-DnsServerQueryResolution policy,\n\n350\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.280\n-name, and we'll give it a name.\n\n351\n00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.370\nI'm gonna call the first\none internalpolicy.\n\n352\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.770\nAnd for the action, I'm gonna do allow.\n\n353\n00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.180\nWe can either do allow,\nif I'll let this flip through there.\n\n354\n00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.630\nWe can do allow, deny, ignore, right?\n\n355\n00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.366\nAnd you might think wait, what service\nare we gonna allow, or I'm sorry,\n\n356\n00:21:05.366 --> 00:21:08.291\nwhat's the difference between deny and\nignore, right?\n\n357\n00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:11.876\nCuz remember all the other things we can\ndo other than redirect them to the closest\n\n358\n00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:13.680\none, we can use this to filter traffic.\n\n359\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.050\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, does that one\njust completely drop the query and\n\n360\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.460\nthe other one will give you not the answer\nbut it will give you a response?\n\n361\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.606\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, right?\n\n362\n00:21:21.606 --> 00:21:27.170\nThe deny is gonna return\na failure on the query, right?\n\n363\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.240\nBut the ignore is not\ngonna respond at all.\n\n364\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.590\nSo you're not giving the bad guy or\nwhomever it might be any information,\n\n365\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.980\nwhether at work or not, name exists or\nnot, or anything like that.\n\n366\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.960\nSo sometimes you wanna block it.\n\n367\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.480\nAnd you're okay with them, letting them\nknow that, hey, this is not working.\n\n368\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.370\nSometimes you wanna just\nignore it altogether.\n\n369\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.450\nAnd that's where that black hole, like\nwhen we talk about doing forensics and\n\n370\n00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.810\nredirecting malicious clients, that's the\nkind of black hole we can lead them to.\n\n371\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.670\nWe can just ignore them completely and\n\n372\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.560\nthey don't know of what's\ngoing on at that point.\n\n373\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.860\nWe wanna allow and\nthen we've got to do the client subnet,\n\n374\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.540\nwhich is one of the subnets\nthat we defined earlier.\n\n375\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.050\nAnd this one it's gonna be,\nthis is my internal policy, so\n\n376\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.540\nodds are we're gonna wanna\ndo the internal subnet.\n\n377\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.570\nYou have to use a qualifier here.\n\n378\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.490\nLet me zoom in just a little bit.\n\n379\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.790\nYou see I put eq, equals.\n\n380\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.020\nYou can also do not equals.\n\n381\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.810\nCuz I can say everything but\n\n382\n00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.560\nthis particular subnet would be another\nway to set up one of these policies.\n\n383\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.070\nAnd you can do some ands and\nors in here and\n\n384\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.120\nyou can make some pretty complex policies.\n\n385\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.140\nSo we're going to say equals internal IPs.\n\n386\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:44.415\nThat was that name of that\nsubnet we created earlier.\n\n387\n00:22:44.415 --> 00:22:49.800\n-zonescope is going to be internalScope.\n\n388\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.670\nThat's another one that\nwe created earlier.\n\n389\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.770\nAnd we're gonna set that to a 1 or true.\n\n390\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.328\nWe'll make an end quote.\n\n391\n00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:04.671\nAnd then -ZoneName is\ngoing to be lab.itpro.tv.\n\n392\n00:23:08.025 --> 00:23:09.400\nAnd we'll end that quote.\n\n393\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.190\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n394\n00:23:12.652 --> 00:23:16.730\nAll right, so there's one policy in place\nthat's basically saying here's an internal\n\n395\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.580\npolicy.\n\n396\n00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.730\nWe want to allow if clients\nare coming from the internal IP, so\n\n397\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.300\nif it equals internal IP client subnet,\n\n398\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.000\nthen use this scope for this zone.\n\n399\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.220\nIf they are querying a name\nthat ends in lab.itprotv,\n\n400\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.760\nget the answer from that internal scope.\n\n401\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.600\nThat unique instance that\nwe made of lab.itprotv,\n\n402\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.780\nwhere we added that different IP address.\n\n403\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.070\nWe're going to do another one for\nthe externals, of course.\n\n404\n00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:48.188\nSo let's just start back at the beginning.\n\n405\n00:23:48.188 --> 00:23:52.157\nWatch the little cursor move across there,\nso\n\n406\n00:23:52.157 --> 00:23:56.946\nwe're gonna make another\none called external policy.\n\n407\n00:23:56.946 --> 00:23:59.408\nWe're also gonna allow and\n\n408\n00:23:59.408 --> 00:24:04.977\nwe're going to say if the client\nsubnet equals external IPs,\n\n409\n00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:10.545\nthen let's use our external\nscope if they're trying to query\n\n410\n00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:16.775\na name that ends in lav.itpro.tv and\nwe'll hit enter, all right.\n\n411\n00:24:16.775 --> 00:24:22.970\nAnd I should be able to do a git-dns\nserver query resolution policy.\n\n412\n00:24:24.744 --> 00:24:26.953\nAnd for the zone, sorry I forgot the.\n\n413\n00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:34.471\nZone name, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n414\n00:24:34.471 --> 00:24:38.299\nAnd there we can see those two\npolicies that we have in place.\n\n415\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.340\nAll right, so now everything is set up.\n\n416\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.934\nAnd we're gonna see if it works.\n\n417\n00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:46.970\nKeep your fingers crossed.\n\n418\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.080\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n419\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.229\nAll right, so what I wanna do\nis I'm gonna go to the client,\n\n420\n00:24:55.114 --> 00:24:56.940\nAnd we're gonna try to trick it up.\n\n421\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.180\nSo let's open up my network and\nsharing center.\n\n422\n00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.510\nTake a look at my network adapters.\n\n423\n00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.114\nAnd I've got ethernet turned on, and\nif we look at the settings on this guy.\n\n424\n00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:16.801\nI can see it's at 10.0.100.11\nwhich means it should be\n\n425\n00:25:16.801 --> 00:25:20.150\nconsidered part of the internal, right.\n\n426\n00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.729\nSo let's open up PowerShell.\n\n427\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.072\nAnd wait for it.\n\n428\n00:25:31.072 --> 00:25:38.253\nWe'll do ping, www.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n429\n00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:43.990\nand take a look at the IP\naddress that it gave me.\n\n430\n00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:50.238\nIf I zoom in there, you can see\nit resolved it to 10.0.100.100.\n\n431\n00:25:50.238 --> 00:25:54.960\nNow what if that same laptop\nwas outside the network?\n\n432\n00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.889\nLet's say it's a salesperson traveling,\nI'm going to disable this network adapter.\n\n433\n00:26:02.819 --> 00:26:04.379\nEnable this one, and\n\n434\n00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:09.330\nif I can do it fast enough before I\nlose my connection, and I did not.\n\n435\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.489\nSo I have to reconnect to that guy.\n\n436\n00:26:15.606 --> 00:26:16.690\nWe'll just do it from over here.\n\n437\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.740\nWhen you're playing around with\na network adapter's remote desktop for\n\n438\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.310\nsome reason it gets a little finicky.\n\n439\n00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.875\nBut we'll use our virtual machine\nconnection on the Hyper V host itself,\n\n440\n00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:30.762\nI'll log back in real quick.\n\n441\n00:26:40.226 --> 00:26:43.760\nI say real quick but none of my machines\nare moving all that fast today.\n\n442\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.760\nWhat is today?\n\n443\n00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.566\nWednesday?\n\n444\n00:26:46.566 --> 00:26:49.290\nI don't know if there were\nsome updates that came out.\n\n445\n00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.816\nThey are taking their sweet time.\n\n446\n00:26:50.816 --> 00:26:52.048\nSo we'll get logged back in, and\n\n447\n00:26:52.048 --> 00:26:54.570\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nchange the IP address of the client.\n\n448\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.070\nI'm going to enable that other\nnetwork adapter that has a 192168,\n\n449\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.660\nwhich we were pretending\nis an external address, and\n\n450\n00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.780\nlet's see if the DNS server gives me\na different answer because of that.\n\n451\n00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.860\nSo I'm going to again go\nto my network adapters\n\n452\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.590\nbecause I didn't get to finish enabling\nthat guy before I lost my RDP connection.\n\n453\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.820\nSo we'll right click and we'll enable.\n\n454\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.080\nAnd since everything else\nhas been giving me fits,\n\n455\n00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:32.380\nlet's double check and\nmake sure I do have a 192.168 address set.\n\n456\n00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.154\nAnd I do, so we're good to go there.\n\n457\n00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:36.930\nCortana's the guilty one.\n\n458\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.510\nShe's the one that's taking\nup all my resources.\n\n459\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.170\nMy network cable is unplugged.\n\n460\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.640\nThat's not gonna help us.\n\n461\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:49.160\nSo let's make sure we\nget that guy enabled.\n\n462\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.211\nI'm going to go into settings.\n\n463\n00:27:55.942 --> 00:28:00.850\nAnd we're gonna connect that.\n\n464\n00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.310\nAnd then jump back over to the client.\n\n465\n00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.070\nSo now, let's just prove to ourselves,\n\n466\n00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.470\ncuz Mike's been doing a lot\nof flipping around here.\n\n467\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:15.994\nLet's open up PowerShell, and\nlet's do a little IP config.\n\n468\n00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:24.426\nAnd I can see I do have\na 192.168.100.11 address.\n\n469\n00:28:24.426 --> 00:28:33.610\nSo let's ping www.lab.itpro.tv and\nlook at that.\n\n470\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:38.630\nSure enough I get a different now\ndon't worry about the destination host\n\n471\n00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.760\nunreachable I didn't put a record\nin there or my server doesn't know\n\n472\n00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.180\nto respond to that ip address but\nthat's not the important part.\n\n473\n00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.730\nThe important part is look what dns did.\n\n474\n00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.440\nIt gave me a completely different\naddress for the same query, all right.\n\n475\n00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.860\nSame name I'm trying to resolve.\n\n476\n00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.126\nThe first time it gave me 10.0.100.100,\n\n477\n00:28:59.126 --> 00:29:02.889\nthe second time it gave\nme 192.168.100.100.\n\n478\n00:29:02.889 --> 00:29:04.740\nSo you can see our policy is working.\n\n479\n00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.500\nIt's looking at the IP address\nof that incoming query,\n\n480\n00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.200\nthe source address on that query.\n\n481\n00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.520\nAnd based on that It's determining what\nunique instance of the zone it's going to\n\n482\n00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.760\nget the answer from,\nwhich is fantastic stuff.\n\n483\n00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.320\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n484\n00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.850\nI was amazed at the fact that you can\ncompletely control the responses there and\n\n485\n00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:27.540\nalso amazed by the fact by how much I like\nthe auto fill abilities of PowerShell.\n\n486\n00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.980\nSeeing that how long some\nof those commandlets are.\n\n487\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.710\nMike, it does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another great episode here\n\n488\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:33.320\non DNS.\n\n489\n00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.270\nBut before we do, do you want\nto add anything to this episode?\n\n490\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.370\n&gt;&gt; You know, I would say this is one\nof those things that's a new thing in\n\n491\n00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.860\nWindows Server 2016,\n\n492\n00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.760\nso there's a good chance they're\ngoing to call it out on the exam.\n\n493\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.120\nSo if you're preparing for the exam,\ntest this out, play around with it, try\n\n494\n00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.483\na couple of those different options, see\nif you can do some of the filtering and\n\n495\n00:29:54.483 --> 00:29:56.955\nhave it drop certain queries all together.\n\n496\n00:29:56.955 --> 00:30:01.771\nCuz you can basically create a list and\nsay look, if any of my clients try to go\n\n497\n00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:05.620\nto malicioussite.com I'm just\ngonna drop those queries.\n\n498\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.500\nI'm not even gonna respond to them or\nI'm gonna block them.\n\n499\n00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.110\nThat way they can't ever get\nto the site in the first place\n\n500\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.580\nto pick up that malicious content.\n\n501\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.770\nSome really cool things\nyou can do with this.\n\n502\n00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.440\nWe really just scratched the surface.\n\n503\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.720\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike well we thank you for\n\n504\n00:30:17.720

00:00:12.057\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexiting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.590\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.360\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n7\n00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.440\nAnd we're continuing along the road,\nlearning a lot more about DNS.\n\n8\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.790\nAnd joining us in the studios for\nthis is none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.630\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes, and I'm excited\ncuz we are continuing on with DNS.\n\n11\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.940\nIn this episode we're actually going\nto progress into DNS a little bit.\n\n12\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.980\nWe spent quite a few episodes\nlooking at DNS itself.\n\n13\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.640\nGetting it installed,\ngetting it configured,\n\n14\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.470\nsome of the new things we can do like\nDNS policies, we took a look at DNSsec.\n\n15\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.670\nNow we're gonna look at\nactually inside DNS.\n\n16\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.340\nSo the zones, the records,\nthings like that.\n\n17\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.940\nAll the little parts that make\nDNS magical and do what it does.\n\n18\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.310\nSo let's start by, I've got a server\nhere that's part of my domain, but\n\n19\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.370\nit's just a member server.\n\n20\n00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.080\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall DNS on it.\n\n21\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.300\nI'll do it quick cuz I\nknow we've seen this.\n\n22\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.000\nWe saw it in one of our first episodes.\n\n23\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.200\nI'm just gonna go through my Add Roles and\nFeatures wizard.\n\n24\n00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.280\nAnd choose DNS,\nadd the required features, next,\n\n25\n00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.270\nnext, next and install.\n\n26\n00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300\nNot too much thinking to do there.\n\n27\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.370\nAnd that's just going to get DNS,\nthe service and\n\n28\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.810\neverything installed,\nthen we can configure it.\n\n29\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.970\nWhile that's going, I'm going\n\n30\n00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.450\nto flip over to my domain controller which\nis already running DNS, as we've seen.\n\n31\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.570\nWe still have our lab.itpro.tv zone,\nand it is signed.\n\n32\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.250\nAnd I wanna take a look at\nthe properties of this zone.\n\n33\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.830\nSo I'm gonna right-click on it and\nchoose Properties.\n\n34\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.692\nAnd right here at the top of this\nGeneral tab, I see we have a Type,\n\n35\n00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:54.340\nActive Directory-Integrated.\n\n36\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.190\nAnd that's the first thing\nwe need to talk about,\n\n37\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.590\nis the different types of\nzones we can create in DNS.\n\n38\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.430\nWe can create primaries,\nwe can create secondaries,\n\n39\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.210\nwe can create stub zones and\nwe can do Active Directory-Integrated.\n\n40\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.036\nAll right, primary and secondaries\nhave been around since forever,\n\n41\n00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.604\nwe'll just say that.\n\n42\n00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.050\nThey've been around for a long time.\n\n43\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.110\nIt's what we've always\nhad when we set up DNS.\n\n44\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.910\nAnd back in the day,\nwhen we had these primary and\n\n45\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.740\nsecondary zones, primaries were\na read-write copy of the zone file.\n\n46\n00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.090\nSo in other words,\nthis is my zone file, this lab.itprotv,\n\n47\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.740\nall these records here,\nall this information.\n\n48\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.800\nNamed IP address mappings,\nthese are resource records, and\n\n49\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.840\nthey're contained within a zone file,\nall right?\n\n50\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.620\nNow if it's a primary zone,\nthat means this file is read write.\n\n51\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.650\nI can make changes to it,\nI can add new records,\n\n52\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.860\nI can remove records,\nall of that good stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.460\nA secondary is a read-only\ncopy of the zone file,\n\n54\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.220\nsame information, but\nit's a read only copy.\n\n55\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.740\nNo changes, no updates, no new records.\n\n56\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.970\nBack in the day, before we had Active\nDirectory-Integrated zones You could have\n\n57\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.270\nonly one primary zone.\n\n58\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.730\nIn other words I can only have one\ncopy that was read/write capable.\n\n59\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.520\nI could create as many\nsecondaries as I needed for\n\n60\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.100\nload balancing and for fault tolerance.\n\n61\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.370\nBecause we know if I setup a DNS server on\nmy organization and I make a primary zone.\n\n62\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.650\nCuz you have to have a primary zone, you\nhave to have a read/write copy Somewhere,\n\n63\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.540\nso I can add new records to it, right?\n\n64\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.940\nSo you set up your DNS server.\n\n65\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.236\nYou create a primary zone for your domain.\n\n66\n00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:41.750\nMikerodrick.com or lab.itpro.tv,\nand it's read/write, it's primary.\n\n67\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.510\nBut if that server ever goes down,\nnobody can resolve names.\n\n68\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.280\nBecause the server's not available.\n\n69\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.750\nSo we want more than one DNS server\nhosting a copy of that zone.\n\n70\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.430\nBut I can only have one read, write copy.\n\n71\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.268\nSo the additional ones that I made,\nthe second, the third, the forth server,\n\n72\n00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:59.802\nthey would host secondary\ncopies of that zone file.\n\n73\n00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:03.142\nWe'd have secondary zones for\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n74\n00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.803\nThat way if the primary went down,\n\n75\n00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:08.750\nthe others can still respond to queries,\nthey have the same information.\n\n76\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.360\nSo, if you asked it, hey,\nwhat's the IP address of Client 02?\n\n77\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.570\nIt could look it up, and\nit could return you the answer.\n\n78\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.570\nThe only thing the secondary\ncouldn't do is if you said, hey,\n\n79\n00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.900\nI need to update my IP address.\n\n80\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.640\nSorry, you're gonna have to wait until\nthe primary is back online, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.680\nThat's the way it was for a long time.\n\n82\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.670\nThen we had and then we get\nActive Directory-Integrated zones.\n\n83\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.297\nAnd what Active Directory-Integrated zones\nare, we're gonna take that same zone but\n\n84\n00:04:33.297 --> 00:04:37.502\ninstead of storing as a .dns file, a flat\nfile on the DNS server's hard drive.\n\n85\n00:04:37.502 --> 00:04:40.040\nWe're gonna put it in\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n86\n00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.160\nThe Active Directory database,\n\n87\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.210\nas we'll learn in this class,\nis divided up into these partitions.\n\n88\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.320\nAnd we're just gonna create a new\npartition within that database and\n\n89\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.250\nput the DNS information in there.\n\n90\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.030\nHence the name,\nActive Directory-Integrated.\n\n91\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.600\nWe're integrating the DNS information into\nthis database, and it kind of makes sense.\n\n92\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.920\nYou've already got a database there for\n\n93\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.890\nActive Directory, why have a separate\nfile for all the DNS info?\n\n94\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.500\nWhy not put it in\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n95\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.940\nAnd so that's what they did with\nActive Directory-Integrated.\n\n96\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.870\nCouple of really cool benefits\nthat we get from doing\n\n97\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.200\nActive Directory-integrated zones.\n\n98\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.980\nOne of them is the fact that I can\nhave multiple read-write copies,\n\n99\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.290\nright?Because now I'm gonna have\nmore than one domain controller.\n\n100\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.120\nAnd if I make\nan Active Directory-integrated zone on\n\n101\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.830\none domain controller, when that domain\ncontroller replicates the Active Directory\n\n102\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.690\ndatabase to the other domain controller\nit's gonna include that zone.\n\n103\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.140\nAnd those are gonna be read write copies,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.420\nBecause Active Directory has ways of\ndealing with multiple read write copies.\n\n105\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.050\nWe're gonna get into that in our\nActive Directory discussions.\n\n106\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.360\nWe'll talk about what multi master\nwith loose convergence is all about.\n\n107\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.350\nBut for now what we just need to\nunderstand is I can have more than one\n\n108\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.470\nread write copy.\n\n109\n00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.220\nBecause back in the day,\nbefore we had this, the issue was,\n\n110\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.140\nif I had more than one writable copy,\nhow did I prevent?\n\n111\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.130\nWhat if an admin on one was changing the\nsame record that an admin on another DNS\n\n112\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.530\nserver that had a copy Was changing.\n\n113\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.140\nTwo people making changes to the same\nrecord at the same time at two\n\n114\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.280\ndifferent locations.\n\n115\n00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.470\nNow when they try to\nreplicate their information\n\n116\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.410\nI don't know which one to keep.\n\n117\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.010\nAnd I'm gonna have to lose one of those\nsets of data, I don't know which one.\n\n118\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.770\nNow we've got Active Directory that has\nways of dealing with those types of\n\n119\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.310\nconflicts so\nwe can have more than one read write copy.\n\n120\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.750\nAgain, don't get too hung up on the whole\nMulti master loose convergence just yet.\n\n121\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.460\nWe'll come back to the concept.\n\n122\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.720\nFor now with DNS,\n\n123\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.290\njust understand, there's primary zones\nthat I can create, read-write copy.\n\n124\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.490\nThere's secondaries that I can create,\nread-only copy.\n\n125\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.490\nI could only have one primary, and I\ncould have as many secondaries as I want.\n\n126\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.250\nOr I can up the any and\ngo to Active Directory-Integrated zones.\n\n127\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.340\nAnd now I can have multiple\nread write copies, right?\n\n128\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.530\nI can still have secondaries, that\nare hosted on, non-domain controllers.\n\n129\n00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.080\nBut I can have as many read\nwrite copies as I want or\n\n130\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.470\nmy domain controllers can host to copy\nat that zone, so really cool there.\n\n131\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.540\nLet's see how we go\nabout making a new zone.\n\n132\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.126\nI'm gonna right click over here on Forward\nLookup Zones, I'm gonna choose New Zone.\n\n133\n00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:05.500\nIt's gonna launch my New Zone wizard.\n\n134\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.080\nWhere I'll click next on the wizard,\nand then there's my choices.\n\n135\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.890\nDo I wanna do a primary,\na secondary, or a stub?\n\n136\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.710\nAnd do I wanna store it\nin Active Directory.\n\n137\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.450\nIf I uncheck this, right,\nI'm gonna create a primary zone.\n\n138\n00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:27.340\nNow this option is only available if the\nDNS server is also a Domain Controller.\n\n139\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.590\nThink about that for\na second, it'll make sense.\n\n140\n00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.810\nIf I've got DNS running on another\nserver that's not a Domain Controller,\n\n141\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.800\nhow can I integrate it\nin Active Directory?\n\n142\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.222\nIt's not a domain controller therefore it\ndoesn't have an Active Directory database.\n\n143\n00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:43.560\nWhich means they can't create an Active\nDirectory-Integrated zone, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.580\nSo let's do that though,\nlet's do just a standard primary zone.\n\n145\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.364\nI'll click next and\n\n146\n00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:55.934\nwe'll call this one standard primary.\n\n147\n00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.628\nSo we can remember what the heck it was.\n\n148\n00:07:57.628 --> 00:08:02.169\nI'll click next and I get to choose\nthe name of the file Which, by default,\n\n149\n00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.925\nis just gonna be the name of the zone,\n.dns.\n\n150\n00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:07.470\nThat's that flat file it's gonna create.\n\n151\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.810\nWe'll click Next, and\nhere I can either do,\n\n152\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.720\ndo not allow dynamic updates, or\nboth nonsecure and secure dynamic updates.\n\n153\n00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.000\nDynamic updates are when the client,\nkeep this in mind when I'm\n\n154\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.370\ntalking about a client,\nI don't mean client operating system.\n\n155\n00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.134\nAny machine that consumes the DNS service,\n\n156\n00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:31.792\nwhether that machine is using\na client operating system,\n\n157\n00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:36.736\na server operating system, a phone\noperating system, that's a DNS client.\n\n158\n00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:37.780\nIt's talking to DNS.\n\n159\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.660\nIt's consuming that service,\nso it's a DNS client.\n\n160\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.780\nSo when I say DNS client, could be\na server, could be a client, all right?\n\n161\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.258\nBut if I create a new machine and\nI give it an IP address,\n\n162\n00:08:48.258 --> 00:08:53.044\nI need to get a record made for it in DNS,\nso that other machines can find it.\n\n163\n00:08:53.044 --> 00:08:56.659\nHey, what's the IP address of\nthat new machine named Client 42?\n\n164\n00:08:56.659 --> 00:09:01.970\nWell, if there's no record in the zone,\nthen I can't give it the IP address.\n\n165\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.270\nSo somehow, I have to create that record.\n\n166\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.408\nI can do it manually, and\nwe'll see how to do that in a second, but\n\n167\n00:09:07.408 --> 00:09:10.480\nI sure would like [LAUGH] it if\nthe client can do it itself.\n\n168\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.150\nAll right, and\nthat's what dynamic updates are all about.\n\n169\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.600\n&gt;&gt; So in a case where you do have\nan Active Directory integrated zone,\n\n170\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.200\nI joined 50 computers to the domain,\nthey can not only,\n\n171\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.960\nnow that they've got an object in\nActive Directory, they could say, okay,\n\n172\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.470\nsince we're already here, let's go\nahead and take the DNS database and\n\n173\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.430\nwe'll register those records\ninside of the database.\n\n174\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that way I don't have\nto manually create all those records.\n\n175\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.712\nIt also means if their IP address changes,\n\n176\n00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:35.822\nlet's say somebody on one of those\nclients changes their IP address.\n\n177\n00:09:35.822 --> 00:09:39.981\nThe client can then call up DNS and say,\nhey, my IP address has changed, can you\n\n178\n00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:44.289\nupdate my record so people can still find\nme when they're trying to connect to me?\n\n179\n00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:46.940\nI don't have to manually go in there and\nchange that.\n\n180\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.850\nIf I don't do dynamic updates, then I\nhave to manually do all of that stuff.\n\n181\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.930\nSo you think, why is that even an option?\n\n182\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.600\nWell, what if I've got\na DNS server out in my DMZ?\n\n183\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.650\nAll right, the only records that\nthing is really hosting are for\n\n184\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.660\nmy publicly available resources like my\nwebsite, the front-end of my mail server,\n\n185\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.900\nmy VPN or direct access server,\nand things like that, right?\n\n186\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.300\nJust a few,\nI can manually create those and\n\n187\n00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.970\nI don't want anybody maliciously trying\nto send dynamic updates to it or\n\n188\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.100\neven accidentally trying to\nsend dynamic updates to it.\n\n189\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.440\nI don't need that happening.\n\n190\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.110\nSo there are definitely times when\nI use do not allow dynamic updates.\n\n191\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.570\nUnderstanding that I'll\nhave to manually create,\n\n192\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.270\nas well as update all records in there.\n\n193\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.230\nAllow both secure and\nnon-secure dynamic updates.\n\n194\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.590\nSo I wanna turn dynamic updates on.\n\n195\n00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:40.810\nThe only option I get is both secure and\nnon-secure dynamic updates, all right?\n\n196\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.790\nThat's because this zone is not\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n197\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.420\nAnother cool benefit of\nActive Directory integrated zones\n\n198\n00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.300\nis that I can do secure\nonly dynamic updates.\n\n199\n00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.630\nSecure only means if\nthe DNS client is trusted,\n\n200\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.450\nthen it'll be allowed to make an update,\na dynamic update.\n\n201\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.520\nIf the client is not trusted, then it\nwon't be allowed to create a record or\n\n202\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.270\nupdate an existing record.\n\n203\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.570\nThis is a great thing,\n\n204\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.610\ncuz think about vendors that\ncome into your network, right?\n\n205\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.563\nThey get an IP address from\nyour wireless access point and\n\n206\n00:11:13.563 --> 00:11:17.687\nit includes their IP address, their\nsubnet mask, their default gateway, and\n\n207\n00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:20.105\nwho they're supposed to use for\nDNS, right?\n\n208\n00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:22.625\nWell, if I give them my\nDNS server's IP address,\n\n209\n00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:26.105\nthe first thing their client's gonna\ndo is call up DNS and say, hey,\n\n210\n00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:29.837\nI'm vendor laptop, here's my IP address,\ncan you make a record for me?\n\n211\n00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:33.125\nDNS, if I allow secure and\nunsecured updates, is gonna say, great,\n\n212\n00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.320\nI'll create a record for you.\n\n213\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.080\nNobody on my network needs to\nconnect to the vendor laptop.\n\n214\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.990\nThe vendor's gonna be gone as\nsoon as I kick him out, and\n\n215\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.370\ntell him that his product\ncosts way too much anyway.\n\n216\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.730\nAnd the laptop's never gonna\nbe on my network again.\n\n217\n00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.690\nYet, there's a record on my DNS server for\nthe name and\n\n218\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.880\nthe IP address of that laptop, right?\n\n219\n00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.440\nBy doing secure only,\nthose guys can't create records.\n\n220\n00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.890\nThey're not going to be allowed, so\n\n221\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.180\nit helps keep my zone clean amongst other\nthings, it helps it keep it secure.\n\n222\n00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.500\nBut since this is not Active Directory\nintegrated, I don't get that option.\n\n223\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.680\nThis is a standard primary zone.\n\n224\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.350\nSo it's only no dynamics,\nor secure and non-secure.\n\n225\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.640\nAnd I'll do the secure, non-secure,\nand we'll click Next and\n\n226\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.120\nFinish and I now have a new zone file for\nstandard primary, all right?\n\n227\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.460\nWhere we can start creating records but\nsince I allow dynamic updates, we could\n\n228\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.190\nhave other nodes or nodes registering\nthere, and let's just make one real quick.\n\n229\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.480\nI'm gonna talk about the different\ntypes of records as we progress.\n\n230\n00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.576\nFor right now,\nI'm just gonna call this test client 01.\n\n231\n00:12:36.576 --> 00:12:38.897\nJust so we'll have something in there.\n\n232\n00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:42.743\nAnd we'll make up an IP address for\nit, 10.0.100.2.\n\n233\n00:12:42.743 --> 00:12:48.238\nAnd we'll add that host, so we'll have\nsomething in there, so that we can see.\n\n234\n00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:50.423\nAll right, so\nthere is my standard primary.\n\n235\n00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:53.948\nNow let's make an Active Directory\nintegrated zone,\n\n236\n00:12:53.948 --> 00:12:56.100\nand see what that one looks like.\n\n237\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.745\nI'm gonna go back to forward look up\nzones, I'm gonna right-click, New zone.\n\n238\n00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:02.741\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n239\n00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.739\nLet's move this out here,\nzoom in a little bit.\n\n240\n00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:09.098\nThis time I'm gonna do a primary, but\n\n241\n00:13:09.098 --> 00:13:13.280\nI'm gonna choose store\nthe zone in active directory.\n\n242\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.080\nWe'll click Next.\n\n243\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.310\nAnd now I get different options, right?\n\n244\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.620\nIt doesn't ask me about the flat filename.\n\n245\n00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.546\nIs this where in the Active Directory\ndatabase do you wanna store this?\n\n246\n00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:27.820\nAnd that decision affects\nwhat domain controllers\n\n247\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.480\nare gonna get a copy of this part\nof the Active Directory database.\n\n248\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.800\nAgain, we'll talk more about that\nwhen we get into Active Directory.\n\n249\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.908\nFor right now,\nI'm gonna leave it on the default,\n\n250\n00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:38.522\nall DNS servers running on domain\ncontrollers in this domain.\n\n251\n00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:43.546\nI'll click Next, I'll call this one\n\n252\n00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:48.268\nADintegrated, I'll click Next.\n\n253\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.261\nAnd you know what, that was kinda silly.\n\n254\n00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:58.739\nI should've said adintegrated.com or\n.local or something like that but\n\n255\n00:13:58.739 --> 00:13:59.954\nwe'll click Next.\n\n256\n00:13:59.954 --> 00:14:04.254\nNow I get the option for\nonly secure dynamic updates.\n\n257\n00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:05.692\nI like that idea.\n\n258\n00:14:05.692 --> 00:14:12.560\nWe'll click Next and Finish and there I\nhave my Active Directory integrated .com.\n\n259\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.150\nAnd you can see right here that it's\nan Active Directory integrated primary,\n\n260\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.970\nwhereas this one is just\na standard primary.\n\n261\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.600\nI left off my extension, [LAUGH] I left\noff my top level domain on that one, which\n\n262\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.820\nmeans it probably wouldn't work too well\nif we were actually trying to use this.\n\n263\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.350\nIn fact, let's fix that.\n\n264\n00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.700\nLet's go to Properties there and it's\nnot gonna let me change the name of it.\n\n265\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.050\nI would have to actually delete it and\nrecreate it.\n\n266\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.000\nSo we'll leave it like it is for now.\n\n267\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.659\nIt's not gonna hurt us.\n\n268\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.810\nAll right, so\nwe saw how to create primary zones,\n\n269\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.210\nwe see how to create Active Directory\nintegrated primary zones.\n\n270\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.605\nNext thing I wanna do is\ncreate some secondary zones.\n\n271\n00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:53.730\nAll right, so again secondary\nzones are read only copies.\n\n272\n00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.470\nThey give us that fault tolerance and\n\n273\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.340\nalso load balancing cuz\nthey can answer queries.\n\n274\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.970\nSo I could split the workload.\n\n275\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.230\nAnd if wanna do a secondary,\nlet's go check on the other DNS server and\n\n276\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.980\nsee how he's doing.\n\n277\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.420\nLet's go to Server 1,\nDNS is finished installing,\n\n278\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.350\nso we click Close and\nlet's open up the DNS console.\n\n279\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.000\n&gt;&gt; It's alphabetical, Mike.\n\n280\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.500\nThere you go.\n\n281\n00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:22.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI'm gonna expand out my console.\n\n282\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.590\nI'm gonna go down to my server.\n\n283\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.140\nAnd we'll see we do not\nhave any zones yet.\n\n284\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.140\nSo I'm gonna right-click,\nNew Zone, and I'll click Next.\n\n285\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.718\nAnd this time I'm gonna do Secondary,\n\n286\n00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:40.765\nwhich means it's a read-only copy of\na zone that exists on another server.\n\n287\n00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.540\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n288\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.957\nNow this Active Directory\nintegrated's not available,\n\n289\n00:15:44.957 --> 00:15:47.610\nbecause this is not a domain controller.\n\n290\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.380\nI'll click Next.\n\n291\n00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.611\nThe zone name needs to match the name\nof the zone that I'm trying to make\n\n292\n00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:54.911\nthe copy of, right?\n\n293\n00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:57.811\nIf I wanna host a copy\nof ADintegrated.com,\n\n294\n00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:01.397\nI better use the right name here\ncuz if I use the wrong name\n\n295\n00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:05.080\nit's gonna not be able to\nfind it to get a copy of it.\n\n296\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:12.140\nSo ADintegrated.com is the zone I want\nto hold a copy of, we'll click Next.\n\n297\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.270\nThen it asks me for my master.\n\n298\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.870\nRemember this is a read-only copy.\n\n299\n00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.860\nSo it needs to get the information\nfrom someone else.\n\n300\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.660\nWe're not gonna be able to make\nnew records, right-click New, or\n\n301\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.380\nanything like that.\n\n302\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.150\nClients aren't gonna be able to\nconnect to it and make new records,\n\n303\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.480\nit's a read-only copy.\n\n304\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.610\nSo where does it get the copy from?\n\n305\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.170\nIts master, all right?\n\n306\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.610\nWe have to tell it who has the copy or\n\n307\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.420\nwho has the file that we\nwanna get the copy of.\n\n308\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.508\nIn that case, that's gonna be that\ndomain controller 10.0.100.200 and\n\n309\n00:16:42.508 --> 00:16:47.040\nyou can see it found it, resolved it,\nsays everything looks good.\n\n310\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.326\nSo we'll click Next and Finish and\n\n311\n00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:55.433\nnow I have a secondary zone for\nADIntergrator.com.\n\n312\n00:16:55.433 --> 00:16:58.944\nBut it looks like there's a problem,\nI got this red X up here and\n\n313\n00:16:58.944 --> 00:17:00.810\nit says the zone wasn't loaded.\n\n314\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:08.880\nThe reason is you have control over who's\nallowed to get a copy of that zone file.\n\n315\n00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.586\nThe zone file is a map to your network,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:18.180\nIt's a bad guy's, I'm trying to\nthink of a way to say this without,\n\n317\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.050\na bad guy would drool if he thought he\ncould get a copy of your zone file.\n\n318\n00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.270\nBecause think about\nwhat's in the zone file.\n\n319\n00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:31.820\nEvery one of your machine's names and IP\naddresses, what services they're running.\n\n320\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.490\nThat's a domain controller,\nthere's their web server,\n\n321\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.700\nthere's their mail server,\nthere's their SQL Server, right?\n\n322\n00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.920\nIt can find all those out\nthrough that zone file.\n\n323\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.770\nAnd so if they can get a copy of it\n\n324\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.620\nthey've got a map of\nyour network basically.\n\n325\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.400\nSo we're very careful about\nwho's allowed to get a copy.\n\n326\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.340\nWe're gonna go back over to DC1 and\ntake a look at my options.\n\n327\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.830\nSo lets pull up\nActiveDirectoryIntergrated.com's\n\n328\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:03.670\nproperties and\nthere's a zone transfers tab.\n\n329\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.750\nAnd as by default you can see it is\nunchecked, allow zone transfers.\n\n330\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.228\nSo I'm gonna choose to\nallow zone transfers,\n\n331\n00:18:10.228 --> 00:18:12.910\nthen I'm gonna make\na decision to any server.\n\n332\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.593\nDoes that sound like a good one, Wes?\n\n333\n00:18:15.593 --> 00:18:16.506\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n\n334\n00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:17.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n335\n00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.370\nThe problem with that is anybody,\n\n336\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.255\nthat means my DNS server\nthat should get a copy.\n\n337\n00:18:24.255 --> 00:18:27.750\nWes has DNS server that should get a copy,\nheck, Wes can open up\n\n338\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.670\na command prompt on his client, and do his\nown transfer of the other command line.\n\n339\n00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.620\nNot good idea, right?\n\n340\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.190\nSo we definitely don't\nwanna choose to any server.\n\n341\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.010\nOnly servers listed on\nthe name server tab, well\n\n342\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.990\nthe name server tab is right here, and\nthat would include all my names servers.\n\n343\n00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.545\nNow, the one we've just installed\nisn't showing up on this list because\n\n344\n00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:49.660\nwe just installed it.\n\n345\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.230\nGive it a little bit of time,\nit'll populate the record here,\n\n346\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.050\nwe could also do it manually.\n\n347\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.320\nBut I don't wanna do that, I'd rather\nlet it do it on its own when it's ready.\n\n348\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.789\nSo I'm gonna choose only the following,\nand I'm gonna click Edit.\n\n349\n00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:07.865\nAnd I'm gonna come in here and\ntype in 10.0.100.101,\n\n350\n00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:11.490\nif I remember his IP address correctly.\n\n351\n00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.160\nWe'll give it a chance to try to resolve.\n\n352\n00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.580\nYou actually don't have to wait for it to\nresolve, I can click OK right now, and\n\n353\n00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.280\nit'll finish, as long as I know\nI'm right on that IP address.\n\n354\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.330\nBut you know me and my memory,\ntime out occurred, interesting.\n\n355\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.687\nSo we'll see what's gonna happen.\n\n356\n00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:31.192\nWe could double check that IP address.\n\n357\n00:19:31.192 --> 00:19:32.223\nDid I not use the right one?\n\n358\n00:19:32.223 --> 00:19:38.842\nMaybe I didn't put the right IP\naddress in there, let's double check.\n\n359\n00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:47.076\n10.0.100.100 not 101 Mike.\n\n360\n00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:50.317\nSo let's fix that.\n\n361\n00:19:50.317 --> 00:19:54.672\nSo let's take that and\nlet's make that a 100.100.\n\n362\n00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:58.780\nI like to, oops I put an f in there\nthat time, a little misclick.\n\n363\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.090\nI like to tab out of it and\ngive it a second and it should resolve.\n\n364\n00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.575\nThat time it did not, but that's okay.\n\n365\n00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:10.848\nIt says the server with this IP address is\nnot authoritative for the required zone.\n\n366\n00:20:10.848 --> 00:20:12.530\nWe know that, we're trying to set that up.\n\n367\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.320\nSo I'm gonna leave it there,\nI know my IP address is correct.\n\n368\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.520\nI'm gonna click OK and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n369\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.400\nSo now, the host of the primary copy\nof the zone knows that it's okay for\n\n370\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.118\n10.0.100.100 to ask for\na copy of the zone.\n\n371\n00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:36.200\nSo now my secondary zone\nshould be working properly.\n\n372\n00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.680\nSo I'll go back to server 1,\nget rid of that, and we'll refresh.\n\n373\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:48.430\nAnd it'll probably take it a minute\nto actually pick up this zone.\n\n374\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.830\nSo we'll refresh and there it goes.\n\n375\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.240\nSometimes you gotta play around and\nrefresh a little bit higher on the menu.\n\n376\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.240\nNow we've got a read only\ncopy of ADIntegrated.\n\n377\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.870\nSo if the DC was unavailable for\nsome reason,\n\n378\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.890\npeople could still talk to this DNS\nserver and resolve names to IP addresses.\n\n379\n00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.600\nPretty cool, right?\n\n380\n00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:14.330\nLet's switch back to over to DC01 and\nlet's just make a new record in here.\n\n381\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.235\nI will call this client22,\njust making one up,\n\n382\n00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:24.505\n10.0.100.5, we'll pick add host.\n\n383\n00:21:24.505 --> 00:21:28.629\nAdd OK, and done.\n\n384\n00:21:28.629 --> 00:21:33.300\nAnd if we go back over to Server 1,\nnow as far as how long it takes for\n\n385\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:40.800\nthis information to replicate over, I'm\ngoing to reload and see if I can force it.\n\n386\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.670\nThat's something that we're gonna\ntalk about in another one cuz\n\n387\n00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.930\nit doesn't do it immediately.\n\n388\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:49.270\nIt's not as soon as that name changes,\n15 minutes is the default value that it's\n\n389\n00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.410\ngoing to wait before it checks to\nsee if there is any new information.\n\n390\n00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.170\nWe'll let that go, it will probably\nreload here in just a second.\n\n391\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.070\nAlright, so that's a secondary zone.\n\n392\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.230\nWe can also create something\nknow as stub zones.\n\n393\n00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.970\nThe thing about secondaries is you\nsaw that I needed permission, right?\n\n394\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:14.640\nWell, imagine this if you will,\nimagine a door, just kidding,\n\n395\n00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.520\nlets say I do a lot of work with another\ncompany called dev.ITPro.us, right?\n\n396\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.740\nAnd I want my users so\n\n397\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.180\nbe able to connect to resources in\ntheir network at little bit quicker.\n\n398\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.820\nWell, we talked about how DNS works and\nwe can go to the root and\n\n399\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.300\nI can go to the dot com or\nin this case the dot US and\n\n400\n00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.080\nthen I can get to the dev.itpro da.us and\nI can get that IP address I'm looking for.\n\n401\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.200\nI could also do conditional forwarding and\nbounce it over there to their server.\n\n402\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.790\nBut that still network traffic,\nright, that's gotta go and\n\n403\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.870\nfind there to get to their DNS server,\nget that query, get that answer back.\n\n404\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.850\nAnother way I could do that is to\nset up a secondary zone, right?\n\n405\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.950\nWe could do that.\n\n406\n00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.520\nThe downside of it is I need permission,\nokay?\n\n407\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.940\nI can't just go and set up a secondary\nzone on my DNS server for Microsoft.com.\n\n408\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.680\nMy DNS server is going to call up\nMicrosoft.com's DNS server and say hey,\n\n409\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.660\ngive me a copy of your zone file.\n\n410\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.780\nWes, what to you think\nMicrosoft's DNS server going to say?\n\n411\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.130\n&gt;&gt; It's going to say, absolutely, you can\nsee our entire internal infrastructure.\n\n412\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.420\nNow you know I'm kidding, I don't\nthink it's going to give you anything.\n\n413\n00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.730\n&gt;&gt; It is not gonna allow me And so if I\nknew somebody over there, I could say,\n\n414\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.210\nhey, can you add me to your list?\n\n415\n00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.780\nAnd they're probably gonna laugh at me,\nthey're gonna go,\n\n416\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.190\nno way we're gonna give you\na copy of our zone file.\n\n417\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.220\nSo that's the downside of trying\nto do a secondary zone for\n\n418\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.670\nsomebody external like that.\n\n419\n00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.160\nIt can be done, but again,\nyou need permission.\n\n420\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.000\nSo if I own both companies, right?\n\n421\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.067\nLet's say that I own Company A and\nCompany B, completely separate networks,\n\n422\n00:23:44.067 --> 00:23:49.591\nseparate enterprises, I could, since I own\nboth of them, I could go to the admins and\n\n423\n00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:54.703\nsay look, allow Company A to host a copy,\na read only copy, of your zone file.\n\n424\n00:23:54.703 --> 00:23:58.021\nThey could go to their DNS servers,\nCompany B, and they could say yes,\n\n425\n00:23:58.021 --> 00:24:00.085\nwe'll allow Company A to request the copy.\n\n426\n00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:03.129\nAnd I could host a copy of\ntheir zone file, right?\n\n427\n00:24:03.129 --> 00:24:06.760\nBut that's typically not the scenario,\nright?\n\n428\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.139\nSo that's where something\ncalled stub zones comes in.\n\n429\n00:24:10.139 --> 00:24:15.993\nStub zones are a way to,\nwhat's a good way to it?\n\n430\n00:24:15.993 --> 00:24:19.510\nDynamically well, let me back up.\n\n431\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:24.430\nSub zones are actually what I like to call\ndynamic conditional forwarding, all right.\n\n432\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.450\nRemember we've learned about\nconditional forwarding.\n\n433\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:32.312\nAnd I just said a minute ago, I at company\na could put in a conditional forwarding\n\n434\n00:24:32.312 --> 00:24:37.933\nrule that said any time you try to resolve\na name that ends in company b.com.\n\n435\n00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:41.401\nHere's the IP address of their\nDNS Server go straight to it, right.\n\n436\n00:24:41.401 --> 00:24:44.992\nThat was conditional forwarding I can\navoid going to the root and the .com,\n\n437\n00:24:44.992 --> 00:24:47.530\nI can go straight to their DNS Server.\n\n438\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.840\nThe downside of conditional forwarding\nthat I don't think I mentioned yesterday,\n\n439\n00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.810\nis that it is static.\n\n440\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.060\nRemember we set one up here.\n\n441\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.830\nI rolled this machine back.\n\n442\n00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.750\nNo this is the wrong machine.\n\n443\n00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.889\nLet's go to DC one.\n\n444\n00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.100\nBecause we did set up a conditional\nforwarder and in another show.\n\n445\n00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.370\nAnd I've rolled this go back as well.\n\n446\n00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600\nSo conditional forwarder,\n\n447\n00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.600\nthe downside of that conditional\nforwarding is that it's static.\n\n448\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.940\nWhen you create that rule, it's set.\n\n449\n00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.990\nAnd if that other server's\nIP address changes but\n\n450\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.450\nI'm not going to be able\nto connect to it anymore.\n\n451\n00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.450\nI'm gonna have to find\nout that it changed.\n\n452\n00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.120\nI'm gonna have to get the new IP address\nand update my record, all right.\n\n453\n00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.799\nFor example, I have another server,\njust like we did in the previous episode.\n\n454\n00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:33.136\nHere's dc1.dev.itpro.us and\nhe's running DNS,\n\n455\n00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:38.594\nand he's got a zone for\nhis domain here, his name space.\n\n456\n00:25:38.594 --> 00:25:47.270\nAll right, dev.itpro.us If I go\nback to DC1, and I try to ping.\n\n457\n00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.890\nI want to get my admin prompt up here.\n\n458\n00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:59.160\nIf I try to ping one of their nodes which\nlet's verify one of those names there.\n\n459\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.973\nLet's say I wanna try to talk\nto Client01.dev.itpro.us.\n\n460\n00:26:05.973 --> 00:26:13.792\nPing Client01.dev.itpro.us.\n\n461\n00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:14.344\nAll right,\n\n462\n00:26:14.344 --> 00:26:18.280\ncan't find the host we talked about\nthat because we don't have the record.\n\n463\n00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.785\nSo what I could do is do conditional\nforwarding, where I right-click,\n\n464\n00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:23.168\nDo conditional forwarder.\n\n465\n00:26:23.168 --> 00:26:27.202\nThe name is dev.itpro.us and\n\n466\n00:26:27.202 --> 00:26:35.899\nthe IP address of their DNS\nserver is 10.0.100.151.\n\n467\n00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:39.221\nAnd I'll store in Active Directory so that\neverybody else can get a copy of it, and\n\n468\n00:26:39.221 --> 00:26:40.830\nI'll click OK.\n\n469\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.600\nSo now I've got this conditional\nforwarding rule in place that says hey,\n\n470\n00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.360\nif you're trying to resolve\na name that ends in dev.itpro.us\n\n471\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.920\nhere's the IP address of their DNS server.\n\n472\n00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.482\nSo if I go back up here and\ntry that, and we flush our cache.\n\n473\n00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:00.189\nAnd we flush our other cache.\n\n474\n00:27:04.876 --> 00:27:06.180\nLet me try that one more time.\n\n475\n00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.690\nNotice it was able to\nfind it this time and\n\n476\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.290\nbecause I told it where the DNS server is.\n\n477\n00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.700\nBut the point I was trying\nto make out of all this is,\n\n478\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.570\nwhat if their DNA server\nIP address changes?\n\n479\n00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.020\nIt's not gonna update my rule, I'm gonna\nhave to come in here and edit this rule,\n\n480\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.230\nall right.\n\n481\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.880\nThat's the downside of conditional\nforwarding is that it's static.\n\n482\n00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.480\nWith stub zones, it's dynamic\nconditional forwarding, all right.\n\n483\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.120\nInstead of me creating a rule that says\nhere's the IP address of their DNS Server.\n\n484\n00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.657\nI'm gonna create a stub zone that's\ngonna talk to their DNS Server.\n\n485\n00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:43.416\nAnd say give me your IP address and\nthe IP address of your other DNS Servers.\n\n486\n00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:46.689\nAnd if that information changes, and\nit updates periodically it reaches out\n\n487\n00:27:46.689 --> 00:27:48.970\nperiodically and\nsays hey give me your information.\n\n488\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.350\nSo if the IP address of their\nDNS Servers change my stub zone is gonna\n\n489\n00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.580\nbe updated automatically and\nI won't have to worry about it.\n\n490\n00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.150\nThat's what a stub zone is for.\n\n491\n00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.590\nThink of it as dynamic\nconditional forwarding.\n\n492\n00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.150\nLet's try it, I'm going to go\nup to my forward lookup zones,\n\n493\n00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.490\nlet's get rid of our conditional\nforwarders that we've got now.\n\n494\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.855\nWe'll pull that out.\n\n495\n00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:15.881\nAll right, and\nwe're going to make a new zone And\n\n496\n00:28:15.881 --> 00:28:18.620\nthis time we're gonna choose stub zone.\n\n497\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.530\nAnd I'll click Next, and\nI'll use my defaults.\n\n498\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.982\nWe're gonna call this zone\n\n499\n00:28:26.982 --> 00:28:32.852\ndev.itpro.us, And we'll click Next.\n\n500\n00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.937\nAnd the master is one\nof their DNS Servers so\n\n501\n00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:41.869\n10.0.100.151 right, and\n\n502\n00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:47.460\nthen this part, use the above server to\ncreate a local list of master servers.\n\n503\n00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.126\nThat's the key because if I\nonly have one listed there,\n\n504\n00:28:51.126 --> 00:28:55.192\nand that IP address changes,\nit is gonna break this, right.\n\n505\n00:28:55.192 --> 00:28:57.880\nBecause I can't check with them to\nget their updated IP addresses.\n\n506\n00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.360\nSo you need more than one to\nreally make this work well.\n\n507\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.576\nSo use the above server to get a list\nof all their other DNS Servers.\n\n508\n00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:09.420\nClick Next and Finish.\n\n509\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.370\nAnd now I have this stub zone.\n\n510\n00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.182\nAnd we'll give it just a second here.\n\n511\n00:29:14.182 --> 00:29:16.230\nAnd we'll see if we can't\nget this to refresh.\n\n512\n00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:24.380\nBecause a cool thing about stub zones and\nI'm gonna say just transfer for master.\n\n513\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:29.140\nSee if I can get this to kick in and\nthere it goes, right?\n\n514\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.610\nNow, wait a second then we just say,\n\n515\n00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:37.020\nWes, that to get a secondary I had to have\npermission to get a copy of the zone file.\n\n516\n00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.620\nHere I didn't need it, did I?\n\n517\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.090\nBecause I'm not getting\ntheir entire zone file.\n\n518\n00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.460\nI'm only getting publicly\navailable information.\n\n519\n00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.560\nI'm getting the IP address of\ntheir DNS Servers then that's it.\n\n520\n00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.730\nNow I can talk to their DNS Servers and\nget the rest of the information.\n\n521\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.040\nBut I'm not replicating\ntheir entire zone file.\n\n522\n00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:59.740\nSo to set up a stub zone you don't need\npermission from that other namespace.\n\n523\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.280\nYou can set it up and it'll just\nreplicate that information over.\n\n524\n00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.590\nThese are known as glue records in case\nthey ask you that on the question.\n\n525\n00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.910\nOn the test [LAUGH] if they\nask you that on the question.\n\n526\n00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.300\nYeah, that's a good one.\n\n527\n00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.470\nIf they ask you on the exam what\ninformation is included in a stub zone\n\n528\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.620\nit's what we call the glue records.\n\n529\n00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.800\nYes, like Elmer's.\n\n530\n00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.950\nThe glue records.\n\n531\n00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.310\nYou're gonna get the A record for\n\n532\n00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.270\ntheir name servers and\nthe NS record for their name servers.\n\n533\n00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.330\nAnd the SOA, the start of authority.\n\n534\n00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:32.330\nWe'll learn about what these records are\nin just a couple of episodes coming up.\n\n535\n00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.200\nBut the SOA, the start of authority.\n\n536\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.170\nAnd then for each name server they have\nyou'll get an A record and an NS record.\n\n537\n00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.070\nAll right, and those will be updated.\n\n538\n00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.870\nEvery time, periodically, my server is\ngonna call out to their DNS Server and\n\n539\n00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.590\nsay, hey, has anything changed?\n\n540\n00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.840\nAnd if any of their DNS Server's IP\naddresses have changed, that information\n\n541\n00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.400\nwill get updated and we'll always be\nable to connect to their DNS Servers.\n\n542\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.970\nDynamic conditional forwarding is\nreally what stubs zones is all about.\n\n543\n00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, thanks,\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n544\n00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.614\nAnd thank you for taking a complex topic\nand breaking it down a little bit now\n\n545\n00:31:04.614 --> 00:31:07.921\nI know we have more to go in our\ntopics here inside of this episode.\n\n546\n00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:11.349\nBut looks like we're coming to the end\nof another episode so, Mike do you have\n\n547\n00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:15.040\nanything else you would like to throw in\nthis one or are we going for a par 2?\n\n548\n00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.950\n&gt;&gt; I have a ton of stuff but\nwe're short on time.\n\n549\n00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.810\nSo, we'll come back for another one.\n\n550\n00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.620\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nMike well we appreciate you being here and\n\n551\n00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.270\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n552\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.910\nSigning out for ITPROTV.\n\n553\n00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.160\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n554\n00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.618\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:35.613\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:31:35.613 --> 00:31:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.611\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.281\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another exciting\nepisode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.935\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.266\nIn today's episode we're continuing\nalong that journey that is\n\n7\n00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.689\nthe networking with Windows Server 2016,\nand just when you thought we were done,\n\n8\n00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.097\nwe're back with more DNS.\n\n9\n00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.464\nAnd it kinda shows you\nhow important it is and\n\n10\n00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.219\nhow much you need to pay\nattention on it in the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:31.883\nSo joining us back again is none\nother than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:33.259\nMike, how are you doing sir?\n\n13\n00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.139\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:35.427\nThanks for having me back, and yeah,\n\n15\n00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.247\ncontinuing with my favorite subject,\ngood old DNS.\n\n16\n00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:39.801\nSo we got a few more\nthings we need to discuss.\n\n17\n00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:41.352\nWe've looked at a lot of it already.\n\n18\n00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:44.093\nInstallation configuring of\nthe DNS servers themselves.\n\n19\n00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:47.575\nWe talked about zones, zone types,\nActive Directory integrated,\n\n20\n00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:48.843\na lot of that good stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:53.121\nNow we're gonna take a look more at\nsome of the things we do inside DNS\n\n22\n00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.085\nto make name resolution work.\n\n23\n00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:56.475\n&gt;&gt; You know, speaking of zones,\n\n24\n00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:58.831\nyou showed us a few of those\nzones in a prior episode.\n\n25\n00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:00.063\nWe looked at what?\n\n26\n00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:02.241\nIf I can recap and\nremember this right, primary zones.\n\n27\n00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:03.711\nWe looked at secondary zones.\n\n28\n00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.415\nWe looked at stub zones as well.\n\n29\n00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.117\nDo we have any other zones here or\nwe covered it?\n\n30\n00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:11.961\n&gt;&gt; We do, we've got a new one,\nor I shouldn't say a new one,\n\n31\n00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.597\nwe've got another one to cover.\n\n32\n00:01:13.597 --> 00:01:16.815\nAnd that is out GlobalNames Zone.\n\n33\n00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.437\nAnd GlobalNames Zones\nis an interesting one.\n\n34\n00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:24.215\nThe idea behind GlobalNames Zones is it\nallows me to resolve what we would call\n\n35\n00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.063\nsingle label names, right?\n\n36\n00:01:26.063 --> 00:01:31.916\nWe know a node, a computer,\na device has a name like serv01 or\n\n37\n00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:37.666\nfile02 or dc01 or Client 25 or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n38\n00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.555\nWe give our machines names, and\n\n39\n00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:43.482\nthen we take our DNS suffix when\nthose machines belong to a domain.\n\n40\n00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.182\nWe take that DNS suffix like lab.itpro.tv.\n\n41\n00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:52.043\nWe plug it together with the host name and\nwe get client25.lab.itpro.tv and\n\n42\n00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:56.541\nthat's known as the FQDN or\nthe fully qualified domain name.\n\n43\n00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:01.215\nAnd the way DNS works is it needs\nthe FQDN to be able to resolve a name\n\n44\n00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.661\ninto an IP address.\n\n45\n00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:06.539\nAnd you might think well wait Mike,\nI don't always type in the full name.\n\n46\n00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.199\nWhen I'm going to file server 01,\nI type file 01 and it goes there,\n\n47\n00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.364\nhow is that possible?\n\n48\n00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:15.610\nAnd that's the way DNS works,\nis it take the DNS suffix for the node.\n\n49\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.798\nIf you don't type a fully qualified domain\nname, it has to make some assumptions.\n\n50\n00:02:19.798 --> 00:02:23.908\nAnd it says all right, most likely the\nresource that you're trying to get to is\n\n51\n00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:25.292\nin the same domain as you.\n\n52\n00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:29.960\nSo I'm gonna use your host, your nodes,\nDNS suffix, plug it in with the name that\n\n53\n00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.154\nyou've typed, and\nprobably be able to find that name.\n\n54\n00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:35.271\nCuz without the fully\nqualified domain name,\n\n55\n00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.342\nhow do I know what DNS server to go to,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:41.157\nWe talked about route, .com, and\n\n57\n00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:46.768\nthen Contoso.com or\nroot.tv itpro.tv, right?\n\n58\n00:02:46.768 --> 00:02:50.575\nSo how would I know what server to\ngo to if you just told me client 25.\n\n59\n00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:52.563\nIs that client25.google.com?\n\n60\n00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:55.323\nIs that client25.lab.itpro.tv?\n\n61\n00:02:55.323 --> 00:02:56.717\nWhat the heck is it?\n\n62\n00:02:56.717 --> 00:03:01.184\nSo DNS makes some assumptions,\nplugs us together and tries it that way.\n\n63\n00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:04.036\n&gt;&gt; So you've been saying that if I\nunderstand it right is a higher rate,\n\n64\n00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:05.658\na higher article name space right, and\n\n65\n00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:07.790\nyou have divisions in those\ndifferent levels now.\n\n66\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.699\nHow does that come?\n\n67\n00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.326\nWhat would be the contrast if we're\nlooking at a GlobalName Zone?\n\n68\n00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.611\nWhat are we looking at that would be\ndifferent than that hierarchical approach?\n\n69\n00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.061\n&gt;&gt; Well GlobalName Zone is\na flat namespace, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:20.828\nAnd this goes back to we've had\nflat naming conventions before,\n\n71\n00:03:20.828 --> 00:03:22.271\nthere's still around.\n\n72\n00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:26.475\nThey’ve been telling us they're gonna\ngo away forever but we have nNet BIOS,\n\n73\n00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:28.777\nright, which is a flat naming structure.\n\n74\n00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:33.499\nWhen you install Windows for example,\nyou still give your node a Net BIOS name.\n\n75\n00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.965\nIt just takes the first characters of\nwhatever your host name is gonna be, and\n\n76\n00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:42.721\nuses that for the Net BIOS name, cuz Net\nBIOS is still used by older applications.\n\n77\n00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:46.146\nAnd so for backwards compatibility,\nit's still around.\n\n78\n00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:48.493\nBut it was limited because of\nthe fact that it was flat.\n\n79\n00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:50.343\nThere was not dot this, that, the other.\n\n80\n00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:56.461\nIt’s just client 25, which is very\nlimiting because that has to be unique.\n\n81\n00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:59.500\nSo I'm already limited by the number\nof names I can come up with,\n\n82\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.936\nwith the note-character\nlimitation that I have.\n\n83\n00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:04.182\nI couldn't come up with\na global unique name for\n\n84\n00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.108\nevery single device out there, right?\n\n85\n00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.125\nSo, Net BIOS is not routable.\n\n86\n00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:11.479\nIt’s not used, but\ninternally on your internal network.\n\n87\n00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.548\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I know that you've,\nI'm going to age Mike here for a second.\n\n88\n00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:17.268\nI know you've definitely had to\ndeal with Net BIOS in your days.\n\n89\n00:04:17.268 --> 00:04:21.011\nNow if I remember right, it also had\nthe tendency to give you some performance\n\n90\n00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.998\ndegradation on your networks, because\nit was always broadcast communication.\n\n91\n00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.781\nSo everybody's trying to find this by\nbasically standing up in the middle of\n\n92\n00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:29.484\nthe room and\nyelling at the top of their lungs.\n\n93\n00:04:29.484 --> 00:04:30.426\nIs this a little bit different?\n\n94\n00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:32.178\nAre we asking a direct\nquestion of a dns server, or\n\n95\n00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:34.702\nare we still getting up on the table and\nshouting at the top of our lungs?\n\n96\n00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:37.564\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely different, and\nthat's a great point in a Net BIOS.\n\n97\n00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:41.074\nOne of the downsides of Net BIOS was what\nwe call a noisy protocol because it did\n\n98\n00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:43.456\ngenerate a lot of broadcast\ntraffic on the network.\n\n99\n00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:45.690\nAnd we had ways to deal with that.\n\n100\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.788\nWe had what was called a WIN server,\na Windows Internet Name server,\n\n101\n00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:52.487\nthat we could install,\na role just like DNS.\n\n102\n00:04:52.487 --> 00:04:54.376\nThat would basically do\nthe same thing as DNS.\n\n103\n00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:58.602\nIt was a little database of NetBIOS\nnames to IP address mappings and, so,\n\n104\n00:04:58.602 --> 00:05:02.625\ninstead of just hollering out,\nyou could connect to the WINSserver,\n\n105\n00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:07.219\nsay what's the IP address of client 25,\nand it could tell you the IP address.\n\n106\n00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:12.346\nThe idea behind GlobalName Zones is we\nknew Net BIOS was going away eventually,\n\n107\n00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:17.472\nit's not used very much, and having two\ndifferent name resolution services,\n\n108\n00:05:17.472 --> 00:05:21.449\nhaving to run DNS and having to\nrun WINS to support both of these\n\n109\n00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.610\nname resolution protocols,\nwas unnecessary.\n\n110\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.268\nDNS is where we wanna be.\n\n111\n00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.542\nSo Microsoft said,\nwell tell you what we're gonna do,\n\n112\n00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:31.848\nwe're gonna add a new zone type to DNS.\n\n113\n00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:36.520\nWe'll call it GlobalNames, and\nwe'll use it to host single label names.\n\n114\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.814\nAnd we can use that and\ntry to get rid of our dependency on WINS.\n\n115\n00:05:41.814 --> 00:05:46.707\nSo we can use GlobalNames basically as\na single label name that functions very\n\n116\n00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:50.395\nsimilar to WINS that allows you\nto have one name resolution\n\n117\n00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:52.822\nsolution rather than have to do both.\n\n118\n00:05:52.822 --> 00:05:56.432\nI can do it all within DNS and\nI can get rid of my WIN servers.\n\n119\n00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:58.200\n&gt;&gt; And that brings me to my question.\n\n120\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.534\nOne of the things I was thinking about,\nMike.\n\n121\n00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:03.711\nAre we looking at a replacement for WINS,\nor are we talking about down at the DNA\n\n122\n00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:06.450\nlevel, throw another acronym out of DNS,\nright?\n\n123\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.988\nDown at its entirety,\nare they two completely separate things?\n\n124\n00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:12.031\n&gt;&gt; Great question and\nvery important that we understand\n\n125\n00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:16.030\nthe answer to this one because it\ndepends on your perspective I think.\n\n126\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.375\nAnd one way you can say GlobalName Zones\nis a replacement for WINS, but\n\n127\n00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:24.436\nyou'd be wrong in most cases when\nyou say it that way, all right.\n\n128\n00:06:24.436 --> 00:06:28.534\nIt is intended to replace\nour dependency on WINS, but\n\n129\n00:06:28.534 --> 00:06:31.729\nit's not a direct replacement for WINS.\n\n130\n00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.699\nIn other words, if you have an older\napplication that understands NetBIOS or\n\n131\n00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.037\nunderstands WINS, you can't just point\nthat application to the DNS server that's\n\n132\n00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:42.742\nhosting the GlobalName Zones and\nexpect it to work.\n\n133\n00:06:42.742 --> 00:06:45.056\nCompletely different protocols, right?\n\n134\n00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:51.044\nSo, in one way,\nGlobalName Zones is meant to replace WINS.\n\n135\n00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:53.359\nBut understand that in a technical sense,\n\n136\n00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:56.068\nGlobalNames Zones is not a replacement for\nWINS.\n\n137\n00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:58.948\nIt does the same thing as WINS,\nand it will allow me to\n\n138\n00:06:58.948 --> 00:07:03.017\nget rid of my WINS dependencies, but\nit doesn't replace WINS directly.\n\n139\n00:07:03.017 --> 00:07:05.250\nIf you've application\nthat has to have WINS,\n\n140\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.150\nyou're gonna have to run a WIN server.\n\n141\n00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.420\nYou can't point it to\nthat GlobalName Zone.\n\n142\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.348\nAll right, so now let's talk about the way\nit works is you have to create a new zone.\n\n143\n00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:19.750\nAnd it's not a different type of zone,\nit's just a standard, it's a primary zone.\n\n144\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.369\nIt can be standard it can be\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n145\n00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:26.483\nAnd so when we go to create it,\nwe just create a new zone, same way,\n\n146\n00:07:26.483 --> 00:07:27.809\nand choose primary.\n\n147\n00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:33.090\nThe key is to name it GlobalNames\nall one word, no spaces.\n\n148\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.745\nAnd that is plural, GlobalNames.\n\n149\n00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:38.226\nOnce you create that zone named,\nGlobalNames, DNS sees that and\n\n150\n00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:42.548\nwe have to turn on the functionality for\nit because it's not enabled by default.\n\n151\n00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:46.859\nOnce we turn that on, and\nit sees that zone it will start using it.\n\n152\n00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:50.462\nNow within that zone,\nwe have to manually create the records.\n\n153\n00:07:50.462 --> 00:07:54.812\nThere's no dynamic updates, or\nanything like that for GlobalName Zones.\n\n154\n00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:56.519\nYou have to go in and create them.\n\n155\n00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:00.411\nAnd the records you create within your\nglobal name zones are gonna be CNAME\n\n156\n00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:01.130\nrecords.\n\n157\n00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.216\nNow, we haven't talked about all\nthe different types of records yet,\n\n158\n00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.279\nthat's coming up in this episode.\n\n159\n00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.090\nBut a CNAME record is basically an alias.\n\n160\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.651\nAnd so, what that means is, and\nlet's talk about, actually,\n\n161\n00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:13.625\nwhy we would do this first.\n\n162\n00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:18.060\nIf I've got a file server, and\nin order to connect to that file server,\n\n163\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:24.952\npeople had to type in, http:, or ftp:,\nor whatever they're trying to do,\n\n164\n00:08:24.952 --> 00:08:32.010\nfile01.east.lab.itpro.tv to\nconnect to this site, right?\n\n165\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.752\nWhat I can do is, I can say,\nI'm gonna make it easy on my users.\n\n166\n00:08:33.752 --> 00:08:39.614\nI'm gonna make a single label\nname called files or data 01.\n\n167\n00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:43.689\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is\nI'm going to make a C name, or\n\n168\n00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:49.612\nan alias record that says the data1\nis actually file01.eas.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n169\n00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:54.201\nAnd now my users can use that single short\nlittle name that's easy to remember,\n\n170\n00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:58.480\ninstead of that big old long fully\nqualified domain name, right?\n\n171\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.130\nThat was an advantage of netBios, it was\nnames were short and easy to remember.\n\n172\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.550\nSo, that's what global names lets us do.\n\n173\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.470\nWe create these single label names for\n\n174\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.990\nresources that we want our\nusers to connect to, or\n\n175\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.390\napps to connect to without having to\nuse that fully qualified domain name.\n\n176\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.320\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I know that things like the\nDNS client is built into your operating\n\n177\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.990\nsystem, and let me kind of reiterate\nsomething that Mike's already said, so\n\n178\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.090\nI ask my question right,\nmake sure it makes sense.\n\n179\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.620\nThe DNS client, I'm not talking\nabout a client operating system,\n\n180\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.870\nI'm talking about an operating system\nthat's relying on the services of DNS.\n\n181\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.640\nAnd my point is, and\n\n182\n00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.100\nthis question is, do I have to\nconfigure the client any different, or\n\n183\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.490\nis it just piggybacking off of what\nit's already got in it, the DNS system?\n\n184\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.320\n&gt;&gt; That's it, all it's gonna do is\nquery DNS, just like it does normally.\n\n185\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.300\nAnd then, what DNS is gonna do\nis it's gonna look, it actually,\n\n186\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.070\nit does use the Google name first,\nit's gonna look in the normal zone file.\n\n187\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.970\nIf it doesn't find using its normal, take\nthat single label name that you typed in,\n\n188\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.840\ntake your own DNS suffix, or\n\n189\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.300\nany DNS suffix search list you've added\nto that machine, and try all those.\n\n190\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.130\nSo, it's really gonna try\nit the normal way first.\n\n191\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.310\nAnd if none of that works,\nthen it's gonna say, well,\n\n192\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.670\nmaybe this is a single label name.\n\n193\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.670\nAnd I've got a global name zone.\n\n194\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.270\nI'll go check there, right?\n\n195\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.450\nAnd if it finds it there,\nit's gonna point it back to the correct\n\n196\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.070\na record in the normal zone, and\nit'll be able to return that IP address.\n\n197\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.220\nSo, to get back to your question then,\n\n198\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.390\nnothing different on\nthe DNS Client end of things.\n\n199\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.740\nThey just send the query to DNS as normal,\nand\n\n200\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.160\nthen DNS figures out what to do with it,\nonce we've enabled it.\n\n201\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.610\nThe other thing I do want to mention,\nglobal names are forest wide, all right?\n\n202\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.430\nSo, in a single domain environment,\na single domain forest, no big deal.\n\n203\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.140\nAll your names have to be unique.\n\n204\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.130\nWhen we start getting into\nmore complex forests,\n\n205\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.320\nif I have multiple domains, one of\nthe things we will have to keep in mind,\n\n206\n00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.560\nthose names still have to\nbe unique forest-wide.\n\n207\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.040\nSo, in other words, in my domain,\nif I decide to take my file server and\n\n208\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.260\ngive it a single label name of corp docs,\nanother domain cannot do the same thing.\n\n209\n00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.320\nThat name's already taken, they can\ncall it corp docs 01, or corporate\n\n210\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.350\ndocumentation, but they can't use that\nsingle label name that I've already used.\n\n211\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.580\nIt has to be unique throughout\nthe entire forest, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.070\nAll right, so let's try it out.\n\n213\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.300\nLet's take a look at how we\ncan set up a global name zone.\n\n214\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.780\nSo, let's look at my screen here,\nI'm back over to my domain controller.\n\n215\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.150\nI did reset it, so,\n\n216\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.290\nsome of the zones that we created in\nprevious episodes are gonna be gone.\n\n217\n00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.390\nI wanted to clear the slate here, so\neverything's looking good and clean.\n\n218\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.783\nI'm gonna open up my DNS console.\n\n219\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.840\nIf my menu will stay open, there we go.\n\n220\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.800\nAnd in my DNS console,\nI'm simply going to expand out my\n\n221\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.820\ndomain controller here,\nmy DNS server, I should say.\n\n222\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.850\nExpand out Forward Lookup Zones, I'm gonna\nright click on Forward Lookup Zones and\n\n223\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.100\nchoose new zone.\n\n224\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.250\nI'll click Next on the Wizard,\nand I'm gonna choose primary and\n\n225\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.420\nstore it in active directory.\n\n226\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.950\nSo you can see no different\nthan creating a normal zone.\n\n227\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.568\nClick Next.\n\n228\n00:11:56.568 --> 00:12:01.890\nI am gonna replicate this to all\ndomain controllers in the forest,\n\n229\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.860\nbecause it is a forest wide resource.\n\n230\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.340\nAnd I want to make sure that domain\ncontrollers from those other domains\n\n231\n00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.880\nhave a copy of this zone, as well.\n\n232\n00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.282\nWe'll click Next.\n\n233\n00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:16.180\n[COUGH] And\neven if I was in a single domain forest,\n\n234\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.410\nI would still replicate it to all\ndomain controllers in the forest,\n\n235\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.460\nbecause that puts it in\nthe forest DNS zone.\n\n236\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.300\nAnd in the future, if we grow,\n\n237\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.990\nwe add other domains, they'll\nautomatically get a copy of this sum.\n\n238\n00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.108\nWe'll click Next.\n\n239\n00:12:29.108 --> 00:12:34.379\nAnd then for the zone name,\nthis is where it has to be global names.\n\n240\n00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:35.510\nAll right, we'll zoom in there.\n\n241\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.210\nGlobalNames, all one word.\n\n242\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.600\nWe'll click Next, and it really\ndoesn't matter what you choose here,\n\n243\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.440\nyou can choose\nAllow Secure Dynamic Update.\n\n244\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.650\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n245\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.860\nI cannot do dynamic updates on your\nglobal name zones, I'll click Next.\n\n246\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.350\nAnd actually,\nI'm gonna change that to do not allow.\n\n247\n00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.650\nAnd we'll click next, just to be thorough.\n\n248\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.370\nThen I'll click finish.\n\n249\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.370\nAnd there we go.\n\n250\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:03.180\nI now have my new global names zone,\nall right?\n\n251\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.949\nThe next thing I'm gonna need\nto do is enable global names,\n\n252\n00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.550\nbecause DNS isn't gonna use it.\n\n253\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.720\nEven though it's there, it's not gonna\nuse it until we turn this feature on.\n\n254\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.370\nSo, let me find a PowerShell\nwindow that we can use.\n\n255\n00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.300\nI'll run that as an admin, make sure\nI've got the appropriate credentials.\n\n256\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.620\nYou need to be at least\nin the DNS admin's group\n\n257\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.410\nto do this if you have administrator's\nright over the DNS server.\n\n258\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.630\nYou don't have to be a domain or\nenterprise admin for this one.\n\n259\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.042\nAnd the command is going to be dnscmd,\nso it's not a PowerShell command.\n\n260\n00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:42.523\nYou could do this from\na command prompt as well,\n\n261\n00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:46.643\ndnscmd, name of my server dc01.\n\n262\n00:13:46.643 --> 00:13:52.619\nAnd then forward slash config, space,\n\n263\n00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:59.315\nforward slash enable global names support.\n\n264\n00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:03.050\nI gotta spell it right, because there's\nno tab auto-fill for CMD commands in\n\n265\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.330\nthe PowerShell, so I'm gonna make\nsure enable global names support.\n\n266\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.620\nIt is names plural, so\nthere's two SSs there.\n\n267\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.510\nNames support, and\na space and the number one.\n\n268\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.235\nTrue, right?\n\n269\n00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:15.040\nThat one is true, so\n\n270\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.210\nturning it on, which means you can also\nturn this off by putting a zero there.\n\n271\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.380\nI'll hit Enter, and it tells me that\nthe registry property enable global name\n\n272\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.970\nsupports successfully reset\nthe command completed successfully.\n\n273\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.470\nAnd we are good to go.\n\n274\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.350\nWe are set up with our global name zone.\n\n275\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.830\nI'll just minimize that for now, in fact,\n\n276\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.632\nI'm gonna pin it, because we might need\nthat for some future demonstrations.\n\n277\n00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:41.740\n[COUGH] All right, so now,\nI want to create some records.\n\n278\n00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.980\nWe talked about the replication,\n\n279\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.830\nI've already set that to\nreplicate to the entire force.\n\n280\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.270\nIf you didn't, and\nyou needed to change that,\n\n281\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.470\nyou could always go back into\nthe properties of the zone, and\n\n282\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.150\nthen go to the replication and\nchange, and change your option there,\n\n283\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.930\nsame wizard or same dialog box that you\nsaw during the creation of this zone.\n\n284\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.770\nAll right, so\nlet's create a global name record.\n\n285\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:09.409\nSo, I'm gonna go back over to my normal\nzone, and let's say I wanted, I don't\n\n286\n00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:14.219\nknow, DCO1, we'll use that one as an\nexample, I think, or let's do a new one.\n\n287\n00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:19.477\nLet's just create a new A record for\nglobal.\n\n288\n00:15:19.477 --> 00:15:24.683\nLet's just call this test server, and\n\n289\n00:15:24.683 --> 00:15:32.583\nI'll give it an IP\naddress of 10.0.100.168.\n\n290\n00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.045\nJust random number.\n\n291\n00:15:34.045 --> 00:15:36.240\nNow I gotta remember that, though.\n\n292\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.108\nAnd we'll click Add Host.\n\n293\n00:15:39.108 --> 00:15:40.683\nAll right, and we're gonna come back and\n\n294\n00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:42.348\ntalk about these A records\nin just a minute.\n\n295\n00:15:42.348 --> 00:15:45.368\nSo I've got a record, a normal DNS record,\n\n296\n00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:48.976\nthat says this name maps\nto this IP address, right?\n\n297\n00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:51.332\nBut that is test server,\nyou guys saw that, right?\n\n298\n00:15:51.332 --> 00:15:55.408\nThat is testserver.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n299\n00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:58.519\nSo now, what I wanna do is\ngo to my global name zone.\n\n300\n00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:03.250\nRight-click, and new alias,\nor C name record.\n\n301\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.582\nAnd the alias is gonna be, let's call\nit Data, well, let's do CorpDocs.\n\n302\n00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:15.971\nAll right, and\nthen notice what it's asking me for,\n\n303\n00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:19.124\nthe Fully qualified domain name for\nthe target host.\n\n304\n00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:22.460\nAnd that would be\n\n305\n00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:29.374\ntestServer.lab.itpro.tv and\n\n306\n00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:32.715\nI'll click OK.\n\n307\n00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:35.076\nWhat I want you to notice\nabout this window, though,\n\n308\n00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:37.180\ndo you see the IP address\nI'm putting in there?\n\n309\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.580\nWe don't, do we, right?\n\n310\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.800\nI'm not telling you what\nthe IP address of this is.\n\n311\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.555\nThat means there must be some way to\nturn this back into an IP address.\n\n312\n00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:53.365\nSo DNS is gonna say, CorpDocs is\nactually testserver.lab.itprotv,\n\n313\n00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:59.981\nand hold on,\ntestserver.lab.itpro.tv is 10.0.100.68.\n\n314\n00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:01.510\nSo you see how that works?\n\n315\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.900\nIt looks up the global names and\nsays, I found it and\n\n316\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.810\nnow I know what its real name is.\n\n317\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.891\nAnd I can go and look up its real name and\nget you the IP address.\n\n318\n00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:12.218\nSo my end users can use this nice,\n\n319\n00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:16.135\nsimple name to get connected\nto this much complex name.\n\n320\n00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.976\nThey don't have to remember\ntestserver.lab, blah, blah, blah.\n\n321\n00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.614\n&gt;&gt; So it's no different than like www,\nright?\n\n322\n00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:25.252\nWe were pointing www to an actual website,\nI gotta be careful.\n\n323\n00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:27.458\nI don't wanna say pointer cuz I know\nwe're gonna talk about records and\n\n324\n00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:28.839\nthere is something called pointer record.\n\n325\n00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.560\nBut it's a reference, essentially,\nas in, you're really not,\n\n326\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.020\neven though you're typing the name, you're\nactually pointing back to our A record.\n\n327\n00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, I mean,\nit is a c_name record.\n\n328\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.298\nYou saw me right-click New c_name.\n\n329\n00:17:41.298 --> 00:17:46.256\nSo it's no different than an alias\nthat I would create in my normal zone,\n\n330\n00:17:46.256 --> 00:17:48.386\nit's really not, all right?\n\n331\n00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:51.570\nAnd that is Global name zones.\n\n332\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.590\nLike I said,\n\n333\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.330\nit's something that if you need single\nlabel support, this is the way to do it.\n\n334\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.720\nIf your enterprise still has\ndependencies on NetBIOS and\n\n335\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.280\nWINS, this is a chance to start\nmigrating away from that.\n\n336\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.510\nSee if you can reconfigure your\napplications to use DNS and\n\n337\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.040\nset up a global name zone.\n\n338\n00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.150\nNow you can still do single label\nname resolution, but you can,\n\n339\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.680\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n340\n00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.350\nDepreciate or shut down and get rid of,\nremove, your WINS servers altogether and\n\n341\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.660\neliminate some of that nasty NetBIOS\ntraffic that exists on your network.\n\n342\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.630\nOf course, if you have WINS,\n\n343\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.210\nhopefully you've got your WINS\nproperties set correctly and\n\n344\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:35.030\nyou're doing WINS lookup before broadcast\nanyway, so you can eliminate a lot of it.\n\n345\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.580\nAll right, so that is global name\nzones and how we set that up, and\n\n346\n00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.380\nwhat they're gonna be used for.\n\n347\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.111\nNext thing we wanna talk about is\nsomething called zone level statistics.\n\n348\n00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:48.733\nMicrosoft has given us some PowerShell\ncommands that we can use to look at\n\n349\n00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:51.096\nstatistics on our different zones.\n\n350\n00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:55.700\nWhen I say statistics, I need to monitor\nthe performance on my DNS server.\n\n351\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.200\nI need to see what's going on.\n\n352\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.090\nI need to be able to look at how\nmany queries we're getting, how many\n\n353\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.610\nqueries were returned successfully or\nunsuccessfully, things like that.\n\n354\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.770\nAnd the statistics allow me to do that.\n\n355\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.480\nWe do have statistics at the server level,\nso we can look at the entire server.\n\n356\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.810\nBut if my server has multiple zones, I\nmight wanna be able to break those numbers\n\n357\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.240\nup and say, wow, we're getting a lot of\nqueries per second here on this server.\n\n358\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.130\nBut which zone is it that's busy,\nall right?\n\n359\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.920\nSo I can go and\nlook at each one of those zones and\n\n360\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.750\nsay, it's this zone that's\ngetting all the requests.\n\n361\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.150\nMaybe I wanna move that to another server,\nor\n\n362\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.390\ndo something to help the performance\nof that particular zone, all right?\n\n363\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.850\nSo let me show you how we can\nget access to those statistics.\n\n364\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.960\nWe're gonna go back over to PowerShell,\nand I'll clear my screen and\n\n365\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.160\ngive us a little bit of space here.\n\n366\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:52.820\nAnd there's just a couple of commands,\nget -dns Serverstatistics.\n\n367\n00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.389\nNow we'll give it a second,\nif I spelled that right.\n\n368\n00:20:00.935 --> 00:20:01.573\nThere we go.\n\n369\n00:20:01.573 --> 00:20:03.720\nShould tab autofill.\n\n370\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.483\nThere we go.\nAnd if I just hit Enter right now,\n\n371\n00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:10.970\nit's gonna return some data,\neventually, I promise.\n\n372\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.580\nBut theses are for\nthe entire server, all right?\n\n373\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.772\nSo when we look at packet statistics,\n\n374\n00:20:17.772 --> 00:20:23.358\nwhen we look at record statistics and\nthings like that, this is for\n\n375\n00:20:23.358 --> 00:20:28.269\nthe entire server,\nno matter what zone it is using it for.\n\n376\n00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.249\nIt's a total of all the zones together,\nall right?\n\n377\n00:20:31.249 --> 00:20:35.685\nIf I want individual zones,\nI simply put the zone name, and\n\n378\n00:20:35.685 --> 00:20:41.299\nwe take that same commandlet and\nadd a parameter, zone names, all right?\n\n379\n00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:47.496\nAnd I'll do lab.itpro.tv, and\nI get the same statistics.\n\n380\n00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:52.503\nWith the same information, but\ndone at a zone level, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.983\nActually, and\nthen there are some different statistics,\n\n382\n00:20:54.983 --> 00:20:56.560\nit looks like, as well.\n\n383\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.802\nEach one of these statistics,\nit breaks it out by record type.\n\n384\n00:20:59.802 --> 00:21:01.477\nSo this is A records and\n\n385\n00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:06.601\nI can see 34 queries responded to\nquery's name error, all right?\n\n386\n00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:10.227\n28 where we queried for\na name that doesn't exist for example.\n\n387\n00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.977\nQueries received, 34.\n\n388\n00:21:11.977 --> 00:21:16.500\nAlways good if I received 34 queries and\nresponded to 34 queries.\n\n389\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.200\nObviously this is a teeny-tiny number.\n\n390\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.410\nYour DNS servers in production are gonna\nbe in the hundreds of thousands,\n\n391\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.860\nmost likely, when you start\nlooking at these statistics.\n\n392\n00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.710\nHow many A records were queried for,\nor received,\n\n393\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.130\nreturns, pointer records, cname records.\n\n394\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.520\nSo each one gets broken up\ninto its own little statistic.\n\n395\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.830\nAll these things we're looking at\nhere are zone query statistics,\n\n396\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.670\nall about the queries that\nare being sent to that DNS server.\n\n397\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:47.770\nWe also have, if I could scroll down\nfar enough, zone transfer statistics,\n\n398\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.490\nwhen one DNS server sends a copy\nof its zone to another DNS server.\n\n399\n00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.740\nAnd you can see success sent,\nresponses received, etcetera.\n\n400\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.160\nThere's also zone update statistics,\nall right?\n\n401\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.930\nSo, when the zone was updated or\nnot and there's these zone,\n\n402\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.078\nthis has to do with something\ncalled resource record.\n\n403\n00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.890\nI gotta remember that term.\n\n404\n00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.780\nResponse rate limit is what that is.\n\n405\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.360\nSo we can start limiting responses.\n\n406\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.620\nThere are certain types of DUS attacks\nthat could be done against a DNS server.\n\n407\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.797\nIf I sit here and I just hammer it with\nqueries from several different machines or\n\n408\n00:22:30.797 --> 00:22:35.509\nthe Botnet, or something like that,\nI can try to just make a DNS server so\n\n409\n00:22:35.509 --> 00:22:37.386\nbusy that it can't keep up.\n\n410\n00:22:37.386 --> 00:22:40.622\nAnd what resource,\nI'm sorry, what the heck.\n\n411\n00:22:40.622 --> 00:22:43.872\n[LAUGH] If I can remember that again,\nresponse rate limits,\n\n412\n00:22:43.872 --> 00:22:47.642\nwhat that allows to do is say, look,\nwhen you get so many requests for\n\n413\n00:22:47.642 --> 00:22:52.485\nthe same name from the same client subnet,\nhow about you just stop responding.\n\n414\n00:22:52.485 --> 00:22:55.990\nCuz it's most most likely\nnot a legitimate request.\n\n415\n00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.770\nWe can throttle that a little bit.\n\n416\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.450\nA bunch of stuff you can actually\ndo with the response rate limits,\n\n417\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.390\nwhich we'll talk about in another episode.\n\n418\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.890\nAll right, so now we can look\nat the entire report like that,\n\n419\n00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.760\nwhich showed me all of the categories for\nthat zone.\n\n420\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.940\nYou can also look at\nthe individual categories.\n\n421\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.770\nI don't really see a lot of usefulness for\nthis because it's all right here.\n\n422\n00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.850\nBut maybe you wanna get a report\nthat just has query statistics.\n\n423\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.490\nThat's what your boss asked you for,\nyou need a hard copy.\n\n424\n00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.270\nI don't need all the extra information.\n\n425\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.987\nSo let me just get\nthe zone query statistics.\n\n426\n00:23:29.987 --> 00:23:33.718\nHow you would do that\nis create a variable,\n\n427\n00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:39.636\nwe'll just call it $report = and\nthen you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n428\n00:23:39.636 --> 00:23:42.507\nI'm gonna cheat,\ncuz I've already got the command here.\n\n429\n00:23:42.507 --> 00:23:46.812\nGetDNSserverstatistic, that's\nthe one that gets everything, right?\n\n430\n00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:51.417\nI'm just gonna add to the front of it\ndollar sign, I'll call it stats this time,\n\n431\n00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:55.171\n\"$stats =\" and then the command\nthat returned all that data.\n\n432\n00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:58.744\nSo now, what's gonna happen is\nPowerShell's gonna run this command just\n\n433\n00:23:58.744 --> 00:24:01.975\nlike it did before, But\ninstead of spitting all this information,\n\n434\n00:24:01.975 --> 00:24:04.770\nit's gonna store it in this variable,\nall right?\n\n435\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.335\nSo if I hit Enter,\nit runs the command, but\n\n436\n00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:09.773\nthis time I don't get any results back.\n\n437\n00:24:09.773 --> 00:24:14.067\nIf I want to see the results,\nall I have to do is call that variable,\n\n438\n00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:17.160\nand I get exactly what we got before.\n\n439\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.408\nBut what I can do now that I've got it\nstored in the variable is I could do\n\n440\n00:24:20.408 --> 00:24:27.380\nstats.zone query statistics.\n\n441\n00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.220\nAnd I'm gonna get just\nthe zone query stuff.\n\n442\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:36.083\nNotice the other information,\nzone transfers and responses, is all gone.\n\n443\n00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:40.382\nI just wanna see,\nwhoops scrolled a little too far,\n\n444\n00:24:40.382 --> 00:24:44.360\nlet's do zone transfer statistics.\n\n445\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.720\nAnd all I see are the zone transfers and\nnot the query results.\n\n446\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.070\nSo you can use that same command,\npump it into a variable and\n\n447\n00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.810\nthen just call certain parts of\nthe report when you need it.\n\n448\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.926\nAll right, the other command you\nshould probably be familiar with is\n\n449\n00:24:59.926 --> 00:25:01.441\nclear-DnsServerStatistics.\n\n450\n00:25:01.441 --> 00:25:07.371\nIt's the exact same command as\nthe Get-dnsServerStatistics,\n\n451\n00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:10.711\nexcept we would change the word get,\n\n452\n00:25:10.711 --> 00:25:15.690\nwe change the verb on our\ncommandlet from get to clear.\n\n453\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.920\nAll right, and it says,\nare you sure you want to do that?\n\n454\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.898\nScary and I'll hit y for\nyes, and it's gone.\n\n455\n00:25:21.898 --> 00:25:26.580\nAnd if I do another one real quick\nbefore anybody uses my DNS server.\n\n456\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.770\nYou'll see everything is zeroed out,\nall right?\n\n457\n00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.717\nSo maybe you had a problem.\n\n458\n00:25:31.717 --> 00:25:35.231\nAnd some of those numbers were just way\nout of range, you could see my gosh,\n\n459\n00:25:35.231 --> 00:25:36.790\nsomething's wrong here.\n\n460\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.040\nI went and fixed the problem or\n\n461\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.370\nI think I fixed the problem,\nhow do I know if it worked?\n\n462\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.310\nI need to clear those statistics and\nstart measuring again, and\n\n463\n00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.800\nsee if they jump up like they did before.\n\n464\n00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.160\nSo sometimes you need to be\nable to clear those statistics.\n\n465\n00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you've been talking\nthroughout DNS we've been mentioning\n\n466\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.840\nsomething known as records now.\n\n467\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.290\nAnd I know you've probably been waiting,\nbut\n\n468\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.890\nI'm gonna force him to tell us\nwhat these records are about.\n\n469\n00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.940\nMike can you do just that?\n\n470\n00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.850\nCan you tell us a little bit\nabout these DNS records?\n\n471\n00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.721\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n472\n00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:05.310\nI was kidding.\n\n473\n00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.600\nYes, of course I can, all right.\n\n474\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.850\nThat's what I'm here for.\n\n475\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.090\nWe have we've talked about as Wes said.\n\n476\n00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.155\nWe keep saying records, a records.\n\n477\n00:26:12.155 --> 00:26:13.840\nYou heard me saying CNAME record.\n\n478\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.950\nWhat the heck am I talking about?\n\n479\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:23.760\nWell, inside our zone are what we call\nResource Records or RRs for short.\n\n480\n00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.619\nThe Resource Record is\nthe actual entry in the zone.\n\n481\n00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.533\nLike this one right here.\n\n482\n00:26:29.533 --> 00:26:32.095\nResource record, let's look at this one.\n\n483\n00:26:32.095 --> 00:26:34.612\nThis is the resource record for client01.\n\n484\n00:26:34.612 --> 00:26:38.844\nSo when client01 first got installed,\ndynamic updates are turned on,\n\n485\n00:26:38.844 --> 00:26:42.326\nclient01 called up DNS once it\njoined the domain and said,\n\n486\n00:26:42.326 --> 00:26:45.200\nhey, mister DNS, my name is client01.\n\n487\n00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.470\nMy IP address is 10.0.100.11,\ncan you make a record for me?\n\n488\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.310\nSo that if anybody ever calls you up and\nsays what's the IP address of client01,\n\n489\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.100\nyou'll know what it is and\nyou can tell them.\n\n490\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.440\nThat's what these resource records are.\n\n491\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.240\nThey're entries in our DNS zone.\n\n492\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.410\nThat are many different types of resource\nrecords that you'll see in this zone.\n\n493\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:12.050\nA records are the primary resource\nrecord type because an a record\n\n494\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:17.670\nis the one that maps a fully qualified\ndomain name to an IP address.\n\n495\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.480\nMake sure you make a little asterisk\nnext your notes on that one.\n\n496\n00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.610\nNotice what I said it maps a fully\nqualified domain name to an IP address,\n\n497\n00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.900\nthis is NetBIOS, all right?\n\n498\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.650\nIt doesn't map a single able name,\nit's a fully qualified domain name.\n\n499\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.578\nAnd although the whole piece\nclient01.lab.ITpro.TV maps to\n\n500\n00:27:37.578 --> 00:27:41.890\n10.0.101, let me double click on it and\nI'll show you.\n\n501\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.440\nWell wait Mike you just said it's\na full name not just the host name.\n\n502\n00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.140\nWell when we type it in we\ntype in just the host name and\n\n503\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.290\nit automatically plugs\nour dns suffix into it\n\n504\n00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.910\nto create the FQDN all right just\nsaves us a little bit of typing.\n\n505\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.240\nSo that's it.\nAn a record just maps a name.\n\n506\n00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.776\nA fully qualified domain\nname to an IP address.\n\n507\n00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:06.150\nAnd again,\nthat is the primary resource record type.\n\n508\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.650\nAs far as IPv4 goes, we now have IPv6.\n\n509\n00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.090\nAnd DNS fully supports IPv6.\n\n510\n00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.740\nBut IPv6 A records are not A records.\n\n511\n00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.920\nThey are actually AAAA records.\n\n512\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.140\nOr as we like to call them,\nquad A records.\n\n513\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.170\nThere's four A's.\n\n514\n00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.280\nDrove me crazy, it reminds me\nof the old commercial A, A, A,\n\n515\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.406\nwhen the guy's calling\nthe transmission shop or something.\n\n516\n00:28:34.406 --> 00:28:37.206\nAnd I forget what\nthe commercial's even for but\n\n517\n00:28:37.206 --> 00:28:40.970\nhe's like Hello, A-A-A-A-A-A Automotive.\n\n518\n00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.050\nBecause companies always wanted\nto get at the first of the list.\n\n519\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.390\nSo as you're sorting the phone book\nyou got the as at the beginning.\n\n520\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.190\nIf your name started with A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a\nyou could get to the front and\n\n521\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.090\nhopefully be the first one people called.\n\n522\n00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.717\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna enroll you in\nsome kinda speech therapy class for\n\n523\n00:28:53.717 --> 00:28:55.090\nstuttering or something, but.\n\n524\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:59.460\nSo the quad a, as we call them,\nwe're talking about IPv6,\n\n525\n00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.528\nare they four times better?\n\n526\n00:29:01.528 --> 00:29:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about better,\nbut four times bigger, right?\n\n527\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.127\nThink about how many binary bits are in\nan IPv4 address, you've got 32, right?\n\n528\n00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:14.090\nHow many bits are in a IPv6 record?\n\n529\n00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.442\nOr IPv6 address.\n\n530\n00:29:15.442 --> 00:29:16.401\n&gt;&gt; It'd be 128.\n\n531\n00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 128, or\nfour times the number of bytes.\n\n532\n00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.278\nSo the brilliant minds\nthat developed the RC and\n\n533\n00:29:23.278 --> 00:29:27.340\ndeveloped the DNS said hey,\nwe're gonna call it an AAAA record.\n\n534\n00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.228\nI think a B record would have been a lot\neasier or something, I don't know,\n\n535\n00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:34.810\nbecause it's really annoying\nto say the AAAA record.\n\n536\n00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.150\nBut anyway, that's just me being silly.\n\n537\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.770\nSo you will see quad A records in here,\nwhat are some other ones?\n\n538\n00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.210\nIn fact,\nlet's just take a look at the list.\n\n539\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:48.780\nIf I right click on my zone,\nlook at the options I have.\n\n540\n00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.530\nI can create a new host, A or quad A.\n\n541\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.450\nI can also make a CNAME record.\n\n542\n00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.500\nA CNAME, C stands for Canonical.\n\n543\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.660\nA Canonical Name or alias is a much\neasier way to think of it, all right?\n\n544\n00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.447\nAnd it's just that.\n\n545\n00:30:03.447 --> 00:30:05.340\nYou guys know what an alias is.\n\n546\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.945\nMy name's Mike Rodrick but\nmy alias is Mike D.\n\n547\n00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:10.080\nNo, not really.\n\n548\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.160\nBut it's like a nickname or\nan alternate name.\n\n549\n00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.180\nSo www is a great example\nthat Wes was using earlier.\n\n550\n00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.550\nI have a web server.\n\n551\n00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.668\nIts name is server42.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n552\n00:30:23.668 --> 00:30:27.476\nBut when you go to my website, you don't\nknow what the name of my server is, and\n\n553\n00:30:27.476 --> 00:30:29.860\nI have no way of getting that to you.\n\n554\n00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.942\nSo what do you type in?\n\n555\n00:30:31.942 --> 00:30:34.990\nWww.lab.it.pro.tv.\n\n556\n00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.180\nWell, I don't have a machine named www.\n\n557\n00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.500\nSo how are you connecting to my website?\n\n558\n00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.680\nBecause there's an alias in here that\nsays www is actually server 42, right?\n\n559\n00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.650\nSo we can give alternate names or\n\n560\n00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:53.620\naliases to our machines to allow the same\nIP address to respond to multiple names.\n\n561\n00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.810\nThat's really the idea behind cnames.\n\n562\n00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.900\nMultiple names can point\nback to the same IP address.\n\n563\n00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.180\nAll right, oops,\nsorry I wasn't done with that.\n\n564\n00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.680\nLet's pull that up again.\n\n565\n00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.300\nWe also have MX records.\n\n566\n00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.680\nThese are how we find our mail servers.\n\n567\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.130\nWhen mail gets delivered to our network,\n\n568\n00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.220\nhow does it know what server\nis the mailbox server?\n\n569\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.389\nIt checks with DNS and\nlooks for the MX record.\n\n570\n00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.780\nIt's the mail exchanger.\n\n571\n00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.560\nOther new records that we can create,\ncuz there are more.\n\n572\n00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.780\nThose are just the most common ones so\n\n573\n00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.670\nthey put them right there in your\ncontext menu, your right click menu.\n\n574\n00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.300\nThere are so many that we don't\nneed to be familiar with all these.\n\n575\n00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.824\nDo not worry.\n\n576\n00:31:33.824 --> 00:31:38.427\nIf I look at my objectives from the exam\nA records, we talked about that,\n\n577\n00:31:38.427 --> 00:31:41.001\nquad A records, we talked about those.\n\n578\n00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:43.660\nC name records, MX records.\n\n579\n00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.210\nWe also have NS records.\n\n580\n00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.180\nI'll show you this list,\nit is pretty long.\n\n581\n00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.467\nSo if the one you're trying to create\nis not on that right click menu,\n\n582\n00:31:51.467 --> 00:31:53.961\njust choose other records and\nit's probably in this list.\n\n583\n00:31:56.032 --> 00:31:57.739\nWhere was I going with that, NS records.\n\n584\n00:31:57.739 --> 00:32:04.879\nMX records, point to your mail server\nNS records point to your name servers.\n\n585\n00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:09.040\nSo when I'm trying to find a name\nserver for a particular domain,\n\n586\n00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.030\nI can ask DNS, hey give me your\nNS records and it can find those.\n\n587\n00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.220\nThere's one right there,\nright, so there's a NS record.\n\n588\n00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.950\nNotice when I double click on it though,\nit doesn't do like it did for\n\n589\n00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.080\nthe A record.\n\n590\n00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.520\nA record pulls up an actual object,\nor a resource record.\n\n591\n00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.770\nWhen I double click on the name server\nrecord, it actually takes me to\n\n592\n00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:35.360\nthe properties of lab.itpro.tv which means\nI could also get to that by right clicking\n\n593\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.160\non lab.itpro.tv and choosing properties\nand then go into my name servers tab.\n\n594\n00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.220\nTypically, we don't have to create these.\n\n595\n00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.650\nWhen a new DNS server gets added to\nour domain, it is gonna register and\n\n596\n00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.080\nit's gonna create an NS record for it.\n\n597\n00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.980\nYou can go in here, though,\nand add new NS records.\n\n598\n00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.260\nBut understand that this is\na record that's different.\n\n599\n00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.090\nTo create it, you don't right click and\nchoose new host or other new records.\n\n600\n00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.780\nYou pull up the properties,\ngo to name servers, and you click add.\n\n601\n00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.840\nThis is where you can\ncreate a new NS record, so\n\n602\n00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.650\na little different from the other ones.\n\n603\n00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.020\nMake sure you pay attention\nto that if they ask you.\n\n604\n00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.340\nLet's talk about SRV records next.\n\n605\n00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.980\nSRV records are service locator records.\n\n606\n00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:27.340\nThese are how we find what machine\nis offering a particular service.\n\n607\n00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:32.610\nLike if when you go to log in, your\ncomputer has to find the domain controller\n\n608\n00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.580\nor the machine that's running Kerberos, so\n\n609\n00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.790\nthat your password can be verified,\nwe can retrieve your group information and\n\n610\n00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.630\nwe can generate your security token and\nallow you to log on.\n\n611\n00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.060\nHow does your machine find\nthe domain controller?\n\n612\n00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.440\nYou don't just holler and\ngo hey, Mr. Domain Controller.\n\n613\n00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.500\nThere's no notes on your machine that\ntells it where the domain controller is.\n\n614\n00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.680\nIt talks to DNS.\n\n615\n00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.435\nIt says hey, who's running Kerberos?\n\n616\n00:33:55.435 --> 00:33:59.980\nDNS looks in a special place.\n\n617\n00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.588\nThere's this _msdcs.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n618\n00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:10.960\nIn here I will find my SRV records, the\nsame records are also located in the zone.\n\n619\n00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.730\nI can see it right here,\n\n620\n00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.300\nthis is basically a pointer back\nup to this guy here, all right?\n\n621\n00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.960\nAnd you have things like DC.\n\n622\n00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.830\nAnd if I expand this out,\nI'll see this is an SRV record.\n\n623\n00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.950\nKerberos, service location record.\n\n624\n00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:32.140\nLet me expand this out just a little bit,\nand we'll see that Kerberos is being\n\n625\n00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.540\noffered by dco1.lab.itpro.tv, all right?\n\n626\n00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.520\nSo that's how these work.\n\n627\n00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:43.600\nIf we had other sites,\nwell let's not go too far in it.\n\n628\n00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.200\nWhen we talk about sites and things like\nthat, we'll come back to that concept.\n\n629\n00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.850\nFor now I want you to know, SRV records,\n\n630\n00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.990\nthey are service locator records and\nmachines generate them.\n\n631\n00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.520\nLike if I install,\nif I make a new domain controller.\n\n632\n00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.840\nWell when that domain controller\nregisters his IP address in DNS and\n\n633\n00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.210\nsays, hey, I'm DCO2, here's my IP address,\nmake an A record for me.\n\n634\n00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:10.360\nThe other thing it's gonna do is say,\nby the way, I'm running this service, and\n\n635\n00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.700\nthis service, and this service, will you\nmake some SRV records for me as well?\n\n636\n00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.330\nThat way, anybody that asks for\nit can find it.\n\n637\n00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.250\nWhat if I need a global catalog?\n\n638\n00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.920\nWell, I can come in here and I can say.\n\n639\n00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.639\nLet's see, let's go to TCP and\nthere we go.\n\n640\n00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:29.360\nDC01 is offering\nthe Global Catalog Service.\n\n641\n00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:33.530\nHow about that actually,\nLDAP, interesting.\n\n642\n00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.072\nWho's the PDC emulator?\n\n643\n00:35:35.072 --> 00:35:35.909\nIt's DC01.\n\n644\n00:35:35.909 --> 00:35:40.380\n[LAUGH] I only have one server, so\neverything kind of pointing back to him.\n\n645\n00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.400\nBut you get the idea, right?\n\n646\n00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.140\nSRV records allow you to find\nmachines that are offering\n\n647\n00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.410\na service to the network.\n\n648\n00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:52.025\nThis is how your machine can find the PDC\nemulator so it can synchronize its time.\n\n649\n00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:55.893\nThis is how your machine finds\nthe domain controller, so it can log on.\n\n650\n00:35:55.893 --> 00:35:58.945\nOr retrieve group policy every 90 minutes,\nright?\n\n651\n00:35:58.945 --> 00:36:01.285\nThe SRV records are what do that.\n\n652\n00:36:02.555 --> 00:36:06.110\nOne thing that I do wanna talk\nabout with the SRV records is, no,\n\n653\n00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.120\nI'll save that one too.\n\n654\n00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.410\nI know I keep giving you\nguys all these cliffhangers.\n\n655\n00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.370\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n656\n00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.790\nIt doesn't really fit right here.\n\n657\n00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.350\nOther records though we need to talk\nabout are the PTRs and the SOAs.\n\n658\n00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.310\nLast two I want to talk about here.\n\n659\n00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:23.120\nSOA is known as the start of authority.\n\n660\n00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.040\nThat's what SOA stands for.\n\n661\n00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.710\nWhen you create a brand new zone, the very\nfirst record that gets created is the SOA.\n\n662\n00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.330\nIt's the first thing that happens.\n\n663\n00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.880\nWhen I go to lab.itpro.tv,\n\n664\n00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.480\nyou'll see right here is my\nstart of authority or my SOA.\n\n665\n00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.260\nAnd what this SOA,\nnotice it's like the name servers.\n\n666\n00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.630\nIn the fact that when I tried\nto pull up its properties,\n\n667\n00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.720\nit actually opened up the zone properties.\n\n668\n00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.900\nSo you can also get to this by\nright clicking on the zone and\n\n669\n00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.200\nchoosing Properties.\n\n670\n00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.000\nAnd on the SOA,\nwe have a lot of important information.\n\n671\n00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.420\nThe SOA defines the fact that\nthis zone has been created and\n\n672\n00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.370\nthat this server is the authoritative\nserver for this name space.\n\n673\n00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.150\nThat means it actually has the record,\n\n674\n00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.360\nsomething we haven't really\ntalked about in here.\n\n675\n00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.930\nThat gets into our Advanced DNS later on.\n\n676\n00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.120\nWe start talking about the authoritative\nand non-authoritative servers.\n\n677\n00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.120\nBut it says that the primary\nserver is dc01.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n678\n00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.880\nAlso has a serial number.\n\n679\n00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.670\nEvery time we make changes to the zone,\nlike make a new record,\n\n680\n00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.020\nmodify an existing record,\nthat serial number gets incremented.\n\n681\n00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.850\nThat's how other DNS servers or\nother servers that are holding\n\n682\n00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:34.610\na copy of the zone,\nthey know if their copy is up to date.\n\n683\n00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:38.540\nIf I'm looking at my copy and my serial\nnumber is 25, and I talk to DC01, he\n\n684\n00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.870\nsays no, the serial number number should\nbe 30, I know I'm missing five updates.\n\n685\n00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.790\nHey, let's replicate, give me that\ninformation, so I can catch up.\n\n686\n00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:49.300\nIt tells you who you're\nsupposed to come in here, and\n\n687\n00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.990\nput the name and email address basically\nof whoever's responsible for DNS.\n\n688\n00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:59.220\nSo that if there is a problem,\npeople can contact the appropriate person.\n\n689\n00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.050\nNot many people do that but\nthat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n690\n00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.560\nAlso these numbers here, when we get\ninto our advanced conversations and\n\n691\n00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.564\nwe start talking about\nreplication between DNS servers.\n\n692\n00:38:09.564 --> 00:38:13.500\nWe'll talk about what\nthese numbers mean here.\n\n693\n00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.350\nThe TTL is coming up in just a minute,\nbut I'm getting that look again,\n\n694\n00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.690\nI've been talking way too long, so\nI'm gonna turn it back over to Wes here.\n\n695\n00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right, before we get to, I don't\nknow, maybe the hangman's noose out there.\n\n696\n00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.060\nBut there's a lot of records and\nthey're important,\n\n697\n00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.100\nI mean when it comes down to it,\nit's vital to know anything that's in your\n\n698\n00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.440\nDNS zone file, you probably gonna\nwant to know a little about.\n\n699\n00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.920\nNow, Mike, you're right.\n\n700\n00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.730\nWe are coming to the end\nof another episode.\n\n701\n00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.640\nBut before we go into another episode,\ndo you got anything more for this one or\n\n702\n00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.080\nyou think we're gonna hold off for\na part three?\n\n703\n00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna save it for\nthe next part, yep.\n\n704\n00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.570\nAll right so he's giving you\nanother one of those cliffhangers.\n\n705\n00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.190\nWell, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll wrap it up right here.\n\n706\n00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.170\nIt's been a great episode.\n\n707\n00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.000\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n708\n00:38:55.000 -->

00:00:08.175\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.577\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.493\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.014\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.204\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.216\nwe're continuing down that journey that\nis networking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:25.599\nAnd we're coming back with yet another\nminiseries in DNS, but very important,\n\n10\n00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.508\nsome topics that we definitely\nhave to touch base on.\n\n11\n00:00:28.508 --> 00:00:31.852\nAnd joining us back in the studios again\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:32.932\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:33.733\n&gt;&gt; Doing good, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.719\nThanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.369\nThank you guys for coming back.\n\n16\n00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.401\nAnd you're right,\nwe left off in the middle of talking about\n\n17\n00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.744\ndifferent types of records that\nwe're gonna find in our DNS zone.\n\n18\n00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:47.506\nWe had a couple more to go and Wes cut\nus off, so let's get back in there and\n\n19\n00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.025\ntake a look at the rest of the records.\n\n20\n00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:52.420\nAnd now for the rest of the story.\n\n21\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.740\nSo, we can take a look at my screen here.\n\n22\n00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.750\nWe talked about A records and\nAAAA records and SRV records,\n\n23\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.890\nSOAs, NSs, MXs, CNAME records.\n\n24\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.737\nThe only one we had left, really,\nthat we need to know for now, again,\n\n25\n00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:11.970\nthere's a lot more but the common ones\nthat we need to know for the exam, and for\n\n26\n00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.046\nmost applications in the real world.\n\n27\n00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:19.712\nThe last one is gonna be\nknown as a PTR record, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:26.080\nPapa, tango, Romeo PTR or pointer record.\n\n29\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.190\nA pointer record is a little bit\ndifferent than our other records.\n\n30\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.340\nMost of our records are gonna be\nwhat we call forward lookup records,\n\n31\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.595\nand notice that my zone,\nlab.itpro.tv, if I take a look here,\n\n32\n00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:43.065\nmy zone is underneath something\nknown as forward lookup zones.\n\n33\n00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:45.215\nThere is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n34\n00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.845\nSo before we go any further,\nlet's find that.\n\n35\n00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:52.090\nA forward lookup is when you know\nthe name, and you want the IP address.\n\n36\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.420\nHey, I wanna connect to server 22.\n\n37\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.140\nWell here's his IP address.\n\n38\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.160\nI know the name, I ask DNS,\nand it returns the IP address.\n\n39\n00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.070\nThat's a forward lookup.\n\n40\n00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.800\nA reverse lookup is we go the other way,\nhence the name reverse lookup, right?\n\n41\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.330\nWhen I know the IP address, and I now\nwanna get back the name of the machine.\n\n42\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.860\nThose are located here.\n\n43\n00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.340\nHere's my reverse look up zones,\nI don't have one yet, but\n\n44\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.070\nwe could create one real quick.\n\n45\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.914\nRight click new zone, now, click Next,\nand this is actually not part\n\n46\n00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:25.647\nof this particular objective,\nbut hey, bonus material, right?\n\n47\n00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:27.894\nSo, here's my new zone wizard, and\n\n48\n00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:32.109\nI'll do primary stored in active\ndirectory, and I'll click Next.\n\n49\n00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.861\nAnd I'll do all the domain\ncontrollers in the domain.\n\n50\n00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.690\nAnd here, little bit different,\ndo I want an IPv4 or IPv6 reverse?\n\n51\n00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.370\nI'm gonna stick with IPv4, now click Next.\n\n52\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.192\nAnd then you're gonna\nput in your network ID.\n\n53\n00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:49.495\nMine would be 10.0.100, all right, and\n\n54\n00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:55.751\nthen let's see what else I need to\nshow you guys here, that should be it.\n\n55\n00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:58.340\nNow, you put this in in the right order,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.297\nThat's my subnet ID if you want to call\nit, we'll click Next, and the new,\n\n57\n00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:05.790\nif I want to allow updates or not.\n\n58\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.000\nSo, just like our forward lookups,\nnow click Next and Finish.\n\n59\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.217\nAll right, so now I have this reverse\nlookup zone for the 10.0.100 network.\n\n60\n00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:19.120\nBut look at this, see how it's reversed?\n\n61\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.728\nIt's 100.0.10.in-adder.arpa.\n\n62\n00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:27.433\nRight, that whole last part,\nin-adder.arpa.\n\n63\n00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:29.480\nI don't know if they\nactually say it that way.\n\n64\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.850\nThat's the way I've said it for\nthe last ten years, and it works for me.\n\n65\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.890\nBut Internet address,\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n66\n00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.749\nI have no idea what the last A stands for.\n\n67\n00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.755\nYou ask [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think it's address routing\n\n68\n00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.305\nparameter area.\n\n69\n00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Parameter area, there we go.\n\n70\n00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.000\nThe address routing parameter area.\n\n71\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.930\nThat's a reserved DNS suffix,\njust for reverse look up zones.\n\n72\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.270\nAnd when you go to create a new\nrecord in here, New, Pointer.\n\n73\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.980\nBecause pointer records are not\nlocated in our forward lookup zones.\n\n74\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.665\nThey are the only records\nthat exist in the reverse.\n\n75\n00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:04.079\nWell, I shouldn't say only records, but\n\n76\n00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.903\nPTRs won't be found in\nyour forward lookup zone.\n\n77\n00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:10.108\nPTRs are only found in\nyour reverse lookup zone.\n\n78\n00:04:10.108 --> 00:04:13.034\nAnd so my host,\nnotice it's not asking me for a host name.\n\n79\n00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:17.572\nIt's asking me for the IP address,\nand I can say 200.\n\n80\n00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:21.268\nAnd then the host name is dc01, oops,\n\n81\n00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:27.150\nI'll zoom back out there, and\nI'll click OK, and there we go.\n\n82\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.950\nWe now have a pointer record,\nand I probably should have\n\n83\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.850\nused the fully qualified domain name for\nthat, live.it.pro.tv.\n\n84\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.090\nWanna do it, make it look right.\n\n85\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.986\nSo, that's a reverse look up.\n\n86\n00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:42.324\nI know the IP address,\nI can call up DNS and say hey,\n\n87\n00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:47.157\nwhat's the name of the machine\nthat's got 10.0.100.200?\n\n88\n00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Now I gotta ask a question.\n\n89\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.270\nI mean, here was are with DNS, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.820\nOf all the episodes we've done,\nit's pretty counterintuitive to DNS.\n\n91\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.800\nWe've always said, well,\nwhat have we said?\n\n92\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.290\nI have a name, and I don't wanna have\nto remember all these IP addresses.\n\n93\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.410\nSo, I can only imagine that as a human,\n\n94\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.450\nI'm probably not gonna\nbe using this too much.\n\n95\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Not that much.\n\n96\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.880\nI liken it to your phone.\n\n97\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.180\nIf you think about your phone, right?\n\n98\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.190\nWhen you call somebody,\nyou don't look them up by numbers.\n\n99\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.146\nYou look at your contacts, you look for\ntheir name, you touch it, and\n\n100\n00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:21.440\nyour phone is basically saying that\nname is actually, when he touches dad,\n\n101\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.150\nthat's 352-555-1212, right?\n\n102\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.183\nAnd that's what our normal DNS look up is.\n\n103\n00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:31.373\nI know DC01 is, if I look it up,\nis 10.0.100.200.\n\n104\n00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.610\nOccasionally, though I'll get\na number on my caller ID.\n\n105\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.310\nAnd it just says call missed from blah,\nblah, blah.\n\n106\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.270\nI wanna know who that is that's\ntrying to call me that I missed.\n\n107\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.755\nI can go do a reverse look up, or I go up\nto the Internet find with those sites,\n\n108\n00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.097\nand try to reverse that\nnumber back into a name, and\n\n109\n00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.676\nthat's what reverse lookup name and\nDNS allow me to do.\n\n110\n00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:53.458\nNow, where you use these, as Wes said,\nit's not too often in me as a human,\n\n111\n00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.416\nI need to know to connect,\nI don't need it to connect to it,\n\n112\n00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:59.464\nbecause if I know the IP address,\nwho cares what its name is?\n\n113\n00:05:59.464 --> 00:06:02.614\nI can type in the IP address, and\nthen I can connect, that's what's gonna\n\n114\n00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:05.860\nhappen in the end anyway,\nwe always make connection by IP address.\n\n115\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.510\nBut what if I'm looking at a log file,\nright?\n\n116\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.890\nAnd I need, I see all of these attempted\naccesses from this IP address.\n\n117\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.810\nWhat node, who is sitting at what node?\n\n118\n00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.827\nI shouldn't say who,\nyou're not gonna know who's sitting there.\n\n119\n00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:21.530\nBut what machine was somebody was trying\nto use when they were connecting?\n\n120\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.059\nI see the IP address, but\nheck all my clients use DHCP.\n\n121\n00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.460\nSo their IP addresses change.\n\n122\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.130\nI don't know the,\nI don't recognize 10.0.100.45.\n\n123\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.713\nWhat machine is that?\n\n124\n00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:37.821\nI can do a reverse look up, and go,\nthat's lab client one.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n125\n00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.009\nSo I know that it's over in the lab room,\nand\n\n126\n00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.820\nI can go see what's going\non in that machine, right?\n\n127\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.840\nSo, that's one use for\nthem, analyzing log files.\n\n128\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.700\nA lot of utilities can\ngive you more information\n\n129\n00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.290\nif you have reverse look up zones set up.\n\n130\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.560\nNS look up is a utility to work\nwith DNS from the command line.\n\n131\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.840\nIf you don't have reverse look up zones,\nit'll show you the IP address of the DNS\n\n132\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.420\nserver you're testing, but not the name\nof the DNS server you're testing.\n\n133\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.970\nIf I have reverse look ups, it can say\nhey, you're testing this server, right?\n\n134\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.010\nIt can show me the name.\n\n135\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.860\nWhat's another one which\nyou could use this with?\n\n136\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.440\nWhat am I thinking of?\n\n137\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.830\nIP set conversations, when you're\nlooking at the IP set console, and\n\n138\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.480\nyou're monitoring these connections.\n\n139\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.030\nIt'll show you that this IP address has\na secure connection to this IP address.\n\n140\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.461\nI know that IP address is my server,\nI recognize that.\n\n141\n00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.247\nBut what IP address has\na secure connection to it?\n\n142\n00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:29.850\nAll right, or who is that?\n\n143\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.670\nI see the IP address,\nbut what node is that?\n\n144\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.220\nIf I have reverse lookups, there's\nactually an option in my IP set console.\n\n145\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.630\nI can say display names, and it'll show\nfriendly names, instead of IP addresses.\n\n146\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.420\nSo, reverse look up\nzones are not necessary.\n\n147\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.590\nYou don't have to create them.\n\n148\n00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.980\nDNS works fine without it,\npeople can still connect to resources.\n\n149\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.484\nBut there are some advantages of having a\nreverse lookup, and that's things like log\n\n150\n00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:53.417\nfile analysis, certain applications\nthat can use that information.\n\n151\n00:07:53.417 --> 00:07:56.665\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, I know what\nthe best DNS administrators, and\n\n152\n00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:58.867\nI know you are OCD about your zone file.\n\n153\n00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:02.085\nAnd if you don't think so,\njust check out our DNS sec episode,\n\n154\n00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:02.863\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:04.526\n&gt;&gt; And watch Mike's reaction when all\n\n156\n00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.965\nthose extra records get in there,\nnow As time goes,\n\n157\n00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:08.751\nI know our database can grow, right.\n\n158\n00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:12.140\nI know that maybe we get to a point\nwhere we gonna deploy new machines,\n\n159\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.960\nmaybe we change the infrastructure, well.\n\n160\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.250\nNow we gotta do some spring\ncleaning on that database.\n\n161\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.600\nIs there ways that we can do that?\n\n162\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.170\n&gt;&gt; There is and that's a great question.\n\n163\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.650\nNow the thing that happen with\nDNS is as Wes points out,\n\n164\n00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.820\nis that records get created.\n\n165\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.940\nBut they don't get removed\nautomatically right.\n\n166\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.670\nIn dynamic environments especially like\nfor me lab environments where we're\n\n167\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.070\nbringing up virtual machines\nall the time to test things.\n\n168\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.596\nAnd then we're blowing those\nmachines away and they're gone.\n\n169\n00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:41.886\nBut the record that it created when it\nwas up online, It reached out to DNS,\n\n170\n00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:44.470\ndid a dynamic update and made a record.\n\n171\n00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.320\nBut now the machine's gone but\nthat record's still sitting there.\n\n172\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.000\nIn environments where you have\na lot of visitors coming in.\n\n173\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.420\nYou get, I worked at one place where we\nhad a lot of students that brought in\n\n174\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.720\nphones and laptops.\n\n175\n00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.720\nOr vendors coming by.\n\n176\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.500\nThey could end up creating\nrecords if we don't have\n\n177\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.100\nsecure dynamic updates only turned on.\n\n178\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.990\nHow do I got rid of those?\n\n179\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.040\nStale, resources, we call stale,\nresource records.\n\n180\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.480\nThat is where we're gonna enable\nsomething known as, aging and scavenging.\n\n181\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.597\nAnd what that allows DNS to do is look\nat these records, and if they're stale,\n\n182\n00:09:18.597 --> 00:09:21.960\nif they're beyond a certain point,\nwe can go ahead and get rid of them.\n\n183\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.040\nWe can remove them.\n\n184\n00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.020\nThat way, we keep the database clean.\n\n185\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.840\nNow, besides me having\nmy little tendencies of\n\n186\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.260\nwanting everything looking nice and\n\n187\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.560\nneat, is there any other advantages\nto keeping a clean DNS database?\n\n188\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.670\nAbsolutely.\n\n189\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.880\nFirst and foremost, it's gonna be\na smaller file size, a smaller database.\n\n190\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.520\nIf my list is shorter and it doesn't\nhave a bunch of unnecessary stuff,\n\n191\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.830\nqueries to it should be faster, right?\n\n192\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.172\nIf I've got a list of 10,000\nversus a list of 100,000,\n\n193\n00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:51.280\nprobably gonna be quicker to go\nthrough the list of 10,000, right?\n\n194\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.920\nSo little things like that,\nit can really help with performance,\n\n195\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.850\nreplicating that zone file across\nthe network to another DNS server.\n\n196\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.550\nWhy replicate all these\nunnecessary old useless records?\n\n197\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.220\nGet rid of them,\nthat reduces my replication size,\n\n198\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.760\ntherefore reducing the amount of bandwidth\nthat I'm using when I replicate.\n\n199\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.500\nSo a lot of advantages\nto keeping this clean.\n\n200\n00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.850\n&gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking of one thing,\ncuz like Mike had mentioned,\n\n201\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.890\na place that we used to work,\nthey did a major deployment and\n\n202\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.940\nchanged the IP infrastructure.\n\n203\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.710\nAnd could this cause a problem if I'm\ntrying to do a dynamic update and\n\n204\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.730\nregister that dynamically?\n\n205\n00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.500\nAnd unfortunately,\nit finds a file that's already there.\n\n206\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.120\nBut yet we're changing things, and\nthose machines no longer exist.\n\n207\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you got a record in there.\n\n208\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.997\nI call up and say, hey, I'm client 22.\n\n209\n00:10:36.997 --> 00:10:40.016\nHere's my IP address,\nmake a record for me.\n\n210\n00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:43.430\nSorry, I already have\na client22.lab.itprotv.\n\n211\n00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.560\nAre you trying to update that record?\n\n212\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.980\nNo your information doesn't match.\n\n213\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.890\nYou are not the original client 22,\nnot even going to let you update it.\n\n214\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.032\nSo it can prevent a machine\nfrom creating records and\n\n215\n00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:54.846\nthen nobody's going to be able to connect.\n\n216\n00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:57.033\nOr they're going to get the wrong\nIP address cuz they're going to get\n\n217\n00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:57.920\nthat old record.\n\n218\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.860\nThat's pointing to the wrong machine.\n\n219\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.190\nSo let's talk about how we can\nturn on aging and scavenging.\n\n220\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.840\nAging is just the normal process\nthat we all do every day.\n\n221\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.310\nThese records do the same thing.\n\n222\n00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.730\nThey get time stamped when\nthey get created, and\n\n223\n00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.075\nthen tomorrow it'll be a day old.\n\n224\n00:11:12.075 --> 00:11:15.260\nTwo days from now,\nit will be two days old, right.\n\n225\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.110\nThat's the aging process.\n\n226\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.483\nScavenging is removing the records,\n\n227\n00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:24.684\nscavenging them up is done during what's\ncalled the garbage collection process.\n\n228\n00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.310\nWhich is a background process that\nruns periodically on our servers.\n\n229\n00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.925\nAnd it scavenges anything\nthat's marked as too old,\n\n230\n00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:36.599\nit's actually called tombstoning a record,\nthey'll be removed.\n\n231\n00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:39.010\nSo where do we set this up,\nhow do we do this?\n\n232\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.770\nWell, two different places, actually.\n\n233\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.140\nThe first thing you're gonna have to\ndo is do it at the server level, okay?\n\n234\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.490\nYou can assign aging and\nscavenging values at the server level and\n\n235\n00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.440\nat the individual zone level.\n\n236\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.370\nSo when I right click on my server,\nhere's the options, set aging and\n\n237\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.390\nscavenging for all zones.\n\n238\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.590\nAnd before I click OK to this,\nI'm just going leave it like it is now.\n\n239\n00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.730\nI'm going to click OK.\n\n240\n00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.930\nWe also have it on the zone themselves.\n\n241\n00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:14.140\nRight click, Properties, and\nthen Aging on that general tab.\n\n242\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.670\nAnd there's those same\nsettings right there.\n\n243\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.270\nSo the way this is gonna to work.\n\n244\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.230\nAnd this is one thing we gotta\npay attention to for the exam.\n\n245\n00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:25.140\nAging and scavenging won't do anything\nunless you set it at the server levels.\n\n246\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.730\nSo you have to turn it\non at the server level.\n\n247\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.060\nThat then becomes the default.\n\n248\n00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.700\nPay attention to what I'm saying here.\n\n249\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.600\nTo all newly created active\ndirectory integrated zones.\n\n250\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.310\nOnce I turn it on at the server, then I go\ncreate a new active directory integrated\n\n251\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.110\nzone, it'll automatically inherit\nthose settings from the server.\n\n252\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.490\nNotice I said newly created.\n\n253\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.800\nActive directory integrated zones that had\nbeen created before I enabled aging and\n\n254\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.120\nscavenging at the server level\nwill not pick up those properties.\n\n255\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.783\nAlthough, when you turn it on,\nyou do have the option,\n\n256\n00:12:57.783 --> 00:13:00.920\nhey do you want me to go back and\nset this on all the old zones.\n\n257\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.570\nI'm gonna do it for all the new zones you\ncreate, do you want me to go back and\n\n258\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.110\ndo it for the ones you already created?\n\n259\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.520\nYou can say yes or no.\n\n260\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.860\nTurn it on server level,\nthat becomes the default for all new ones.\n\n261\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.680\nAlso notice I said active\ndirectory integrated zones.\n\n262\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.730\nStandard primaries that\nare stored in the flat file\n\n263\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.470\nthat are not part of active directory,\nthey're not stored in the database,\n\n264\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.030\nthey're not active directory integrated,\nthey will not look at the server settings.\n\n265\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:30.510\nYou have to set them on the zone itself\nfor standard primary zones, all right?\n\n266\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.429\nSo a couple key things to make a note of\nwhen you're studying for this exam there.\n\n267\n00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:41.150\nAll right, now, let's take a look at what\nthe heck those numbers actually mean.\n\n268\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.200\nRight, cuz when we look at this we've got,\n\n269\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.640\nwe can turn it on by choosing\nscavenge stale resource records.\n\n270\n00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.930\nAnd then the default is gonna be seven\ndays for a no refresh interval and\n\n271\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.260\nseven days for a refresh interval.\n\n272\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.110\nWhat the heck does that mean all right?\n\n273\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.040\nI got a drawing I'm gonna use to\nkind of explain how this works.\n\n274\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.480\nSo when a record gets created,\nit gets time stamped all right.\n\n275\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.810\nIt gets put into the data base,\nthat's day zero.\n\n276\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.970\nAnd for the first seven days,\nwe're going through what's called,\n\n277\n00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.360\na no refresh interval.\n\n278\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.540\nDuring the seven days,\nthis record cannot be refreshed.\n\n279\n00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.000\nWhat that means is when\na client calls up DNS and\n\n280\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.380\ncreates a record, it gets timestamped.\n\n281\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.710\nWell, that client doesn't just stop there.\n\n282\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:28.740\nEvery time we reboot that machine,\nperiodically, it's gonna call up DNS and\n\n283\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.970\nsay, hey, DNS.\n\n284\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.555\nMy name's client 22.\n\n285\n00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:34.680\nMy IP address hasn't changed.\n\n286\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.290\nI just wanted to let you know.\n\n287\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.000\nThat's called a refresh.\n\n288\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.660\nWell for seven days the server\ncompletely ignores refresh requests.\n\n289\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.030\nIt says, yeah, yeah whatever.\n\n290\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.670\nAnd it doesn't even write it down.\n\n291\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.710\nIt ignores it.\n\n292\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.920\nThe packet comes in he says hey nothings\nchanged, I just want to update my info.\n\n293\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.990\nThe sever says yeah,\nyeah whatever, go away.\n\n294\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.240\nAll right, for\nseven days that process occurs and\n\n295\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.010\nthat's to keep the workload\non my DNS server down.\n\n296\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.910\nIf during the first seven days I'm gonna\ncompletely ignore your refresh requests.\n\n297\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.720\nNot gonna ignore any change requests\nif you tell me, hey, I'm client 22,\n\n298\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.290\nmy IP address has changed,\nthat's different.\n\n299\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.790\nThat's not a refresh, that's an update.\n\n300\n00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.560\nAnd of course I'm gonna accept that\nbecause I need to make sure I've got\n\n301\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.240\ngood information.\n\n302\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.010\nI don't want to pass out bad info.\n\n303\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.420\nSo during this period, and\nif I was to update my information\n\n304\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.110\nit gets timestamped and\nthe counter starts all over.\n\n305\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.110\nAnd I'm gonna through this\nseven days of no refresh.\n\n306\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.790\nSo during the seven days no refresh.\n\n307\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.928\nWe get to this eighth day, all right.\n\n308\n00:15:33.928 --> 00:15:39.700\nNow we're in the refresh interval which\nby default is another seven days.\n\n309\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.220\nAnd the client has seven\ndays to refresh his record.\n\n310\n00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.361\nSo at some point during the second seven\nday period, the client calls up DNS and\n\n311\n00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:49.050\nsays, hey,\n\n312\n00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.272\nI'm client 22, my IP address hasn't\nchanged, just wanted to let you know.\n\n313\n00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:57.289\nAnd the DNS server says,\nokay this time I'll pay attention to you.\n\n314\n00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:02.381\nAnd when it does the refresh,\nit starts to counter all over again.\n\n315\n00:16:02.381 --> 00:16:05.031\nWe get a new time stamp,\nwe go back to day zero, and\n\n316\n00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.910\nwe've got seven days of\nno refreshes allowed.\n\n317\n00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.690\nAnd then during the next seven days,\nI need to refresh it.\n\n318\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.890\nAnd that's a normal process.\n\n319\n00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.410\nSometime during this period, that client\nis going to contact DNS, refresh it.\n\n320\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.080\nAnd that way the record is kept,\nand we know that it's current, and\n\n321\n00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.230\nit's being used, or\nit's used full, all right.\n\n322\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.120\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I'm gonna make it joke here,\nand it might be funny or it might not be,\n\n323\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.840\nbut that sounds like some pretty\ndemanding administration.\n\n324\n00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.880\nBecause it says in this seven days,\ndon't even talk to me.\n\n325\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.050\nIn that last seven days,\nyou better talk to me.\n\n326\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.130\n&gt;&gt; You better talk to me, that's right,\notherwise you're gonna get removed.\n\n327\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.590\nThat's exactly right though.\n\n328\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.530\nSo let's go back on my screen,\n\n329\n00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.850\nso let's pretend the node,\nlet's say the node got blown away.\n\n330\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.780\nIt was a virtual machine I was using for\ntesting.\n\n331\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.510\nWell, during the first seven days\nit wasn't allowed to refresh,\n\n332\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.960\nwe just completely ignored it.\n\n333\n00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.420\nThe second seven days,\nI'm waiting for that refresh.\n\n334\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.550\nI'm the DNS server saying,\nI hope you refresh.\n\n335\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.280\nBut since the machine's gone,\nit's never going to.\n\n336\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.060\nSo what happens is a time stamp\nends up making it to 14 days old.\n\n337\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.510\nAnd at that point we tombstone the record,\nall right?\n\n338\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:16.260\nSo we'll just kind of, I still got black,\nwe'll do a little rest in peace.\n\n339\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.860\nI can't write with a mouse,\nso, you get the idea.\n\n340\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:23.610\nThat's going to be a gravestone, but\nthe idea is the record gets marked.\n\n341\n00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:28.280\nIt gets marked for deletion or\nwhat we call tombstoned, and now the next\n\n342\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.400\ntime the garbage collection process runs,\nit's gonna look at all the records, and\n\n343\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.720\nany that marked for\ndeletion it's gonna remove.\n\n344\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.750\nIt'll just go through the list, nope,\nnope, this one's marked, yank it out.\n\n345\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.140\nNope, nope, nope, this one's marked,\nyank it out, all right?\n\n346\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.780\nAnd that keeps our database clean.\n\n347\n00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.210\nAnything that's over 14 days and hasn't\nbeen refreshed, we're gonna get rid of it.\n\n348\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.528\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you know Picasso eat\nyour heart out with a tombstone.\n\n349\n00:17:48.528 --> 00:17:50.132\nBut joking aside, serious question though.\n\n350\n00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:54.850\nOnce it's on that list,\nwe're in danger of losing that record.\n\n351\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.050\nDo I understand that right?\n\n352\n00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.410\nBecause it seems up until that point,\nif you had to do manual,\n\n353\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.860\nan intervention on that, you could.\n\n354\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.850\nBut once it goes in that list you\nhave to worry about that record is\n\n355\n00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.150\njust gonna automatically be deleted.\n\n356\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be gone.\n\n357\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.660\nAnd the garbage collection process runs\nI wanna say it's every couple of hours,\n\n358\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.060\nI can't remember exactly.\n\n359\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.150\nSo, it's not like,\nI bring that machine back tomorrow.\n\n360\n00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.220\nIt's Day 16.\n\n361\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.090\nMaybe I can get it to refresh that record.\n\n362\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.075\nBut in the end it doesn't matter because,\nlet's say I do.\n\n363\n00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:27.405\nI shut that machine down for\nthree weeks, well in the meantime,\n\n364\n00:18:27.405 --> 00:18:28.465\nits records got removed.\n\n365\n00:18:28.465 --> 00:18:31.945\nWell, as soon as I turn it back on,\nit's gonna say, hey, I need to update.\n\n366\n00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.275\nWhat do you mean you don't have, okay,\nI need to create a new record for myself.\n\n367\n00:18:35.275 --> 00:18:37.175\nIt's all it's gonna do,\nis it's gonna make a new record.\n\n368\n00:18:37.175 --> 00:18:40.035\nIt's gonna start on day zero and\nit starts the cycle all over.\n\n369\n00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.845\nSo in the end, it's not a big deal.\n\n370\n00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:44.135\nI mean,\nI could accidentally delete a record and\n\n371\n00:18:44.135 --> 00:18:47.700\nI know that the client is eventually\ngoing to recreate that record up there.\n\n372\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.430\nSo it's not the end of the world,\nwe don't have to worry about my gosh,\n\n373\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.280\nwe're never gonna get that record back.\n\n374\n00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.867\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of records and\nwe talked about time, right.\n\n375\n00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.310\nEverything's about time here.\n\n376\n00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.560\nDo we have other characteristics of\nrecords that we have to worry about when\n\n377\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.800\nit comes to time?\n\n378\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.220\n&gt;&gt; We do and before we get there though,\n\n379\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.450\nI do want to go back one more\nsecond to aging and scavenging.\n\n380\n00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.960\nLet's just pull up my screen here.\n\n381\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.180\nSo, now you understand what these values\nmean, why would I change them, right?\n\n382\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.440\nWell, cuz you can see,\nit's meant to be changed.\n\n383\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.440\nThis is just the default.\n\n384\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.760\nAnd the idea here is in\na dynamic environment,\n\n385\n00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.690\nseven days is a long time to wait.\n\n386\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.250\nIt's a long time to have those\nstale records sitting there.\n\n387\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.430\nDNS is replicating every 15 minutes.\n\n388\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.600\nI'm replicating unnecessary information.\n\n389\n00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.890\nIn a relatively static environment,\nthis causes me no problems.\n\n390\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.770\nBut in a dynamic environment,\nwe might wanna speed this up a little bit.\n\n391\n00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.390\nWe might say,\nyou know what let's do three and\n\n392\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.570\nthree and\nthey don't have to be the same either.\n\n393\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.690\nI'm just doing that from habit.\n\n394\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.680\nThey don't have to be the same,\nso you can change those values,\n\n395\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.610\nyou can even change them to hours if\nyou want it to be really really fast.\n\n396\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.260\nNow let's take a look, so\n\n397\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.870\nI'm gonna set it at the zone level,\nI mean sorry at the server level.\n\n398\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.510\nHere's the option.\n\n399\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.830\nDo I wanna apply these settings to\nexisting Active Directory zones?\n\n400\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.255\nIf I don't check that and I click OK,\nand we go and create a new zone.\n\n401\n00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:11.020\nRight-click, New Zone.\n\n402\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.870\nAnd I just real quick run through here.\n\n403\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.510\nPrimary, blah, blah,\nblah, blah, call it ASDF.\n\n404\n00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.150\nYep, yep, yep, yep, yep.\n\n405\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.110\nAnd we look at the properties\nof this new zone I just created.\n\n406\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.060\nNow we go to Aging.\n\n407\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.250\nLook, it's already turned on and\nit's set 7 of 7.\n\n408\n00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.236\nIf we go to the properties of that zone\nthat was created before I enabled it.\n\n409\n00:20:34.638 --> 00:20:36.820\nNotice it's not turned on, all right?\n\n410\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.040\nSo that check mark would've\nallowed me to go back.\n\n411\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.730\nAnd let's say I already had 20 zones and\nthen I decide to turn this on.\n\n412\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.760\nI don't want to go to each zone and\nturn it on manually.\n\n413\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.410\nSo that's what that little check\nmark is at the end of the wizard.\n\n414\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.640\nThe other one I wanted to\nshow you is the primary zone.\n\n415\n00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.860\nSo let's create a new primary zone.\n\n416\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.750\nStandard primary,\nnot active directory integrated.\n\n417\n00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.630\nSo I'm going to uncheck\nactive directory integrated.\n\n418\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.380\nI'll call this one the reverse there.\n\n419\n00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.200\nMake a little file, we'll do secure and\nnon secure, Next and\n\n420\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.881\nFinish and I will take a look\nat the properties of that zone.\n\n421\n00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:15.680\nAnd notice it didn't get turned on,\nall right?\n\n422\n00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.190\nBecause remember,\nstandard primaries do not understand\n\n423\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.100\nto look at the server properties and\ninherit those.\n\n424\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.500\nStandard for zones have been around\nmuch longer than this DNS console, and\n\n425\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.560\nthey just don't understand it.\n\n426\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.880\nSo you do have to,\neven if you turn it on at the server,\n\n427\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.880\nyou have to manually turn it on,\non your standard zones.\n\n428\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.820\nAll right, next thing is TTL.\n\n429\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.590\nWes was gonna hit in there about\nsomething else that is time related.\n\n430\n00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.690\nAnd that is our TTL, or Time To Live.\n\n431\n00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.130\nIn order to understand that,\nwe really need to understand caching.\n\n432\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.966\nAnd so we'll briefly hit caching here,\n\n433\n00:21:51.966 --> 00:21:54.830\nwe're going to cover it again\nin another episode, I'm sure.\n\n434\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:02.540\nBut caching is storing or\ntemporarily storing information.\n\n435\n00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.640\nWhen you hear the word cache,\n\n436\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.440\nnot like the money, but\nC-A-C-H-E think temporary storage, right.\n\n437\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.410\nWe talk about cache memory and\nother things, as always temporary.\n\n438\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.219\nWell, when a DNS server gets a response,\n\n439\n00:22:16.219 --> 00:22:20.930\nlet's say that I type in\nwww.microsoft.com in my browser.\n\n440\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:25.330\nMy client sends a query to my\nDNS server here on my network\n\n441\n00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.820\nsays what's the IP\naddress of Microsoft.com?\n\n442\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.810\nHe doesn't know, so\nhe goes to the root and then the .com and\n\n443\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:35.090\nthen the Microsoft.com, and\nmy DNS server finally gets the answer, and\n\n444\n00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:39.600\nit gives the answer to my client, and\nmy browser opens up to www.microsoft.com.\n\n445\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.110\nBut the server, after he gave that\nanswer to me, he also cached the answer.\n\n446\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.440\nHe stored it.\n\n447\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.490\nThat way of Wes, two seconds later,\nalso opens up a browser and\n\n448\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.020\ngoes to Mircrosoft.com.\n\n449\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.200\nIt sends a query to my local DNS server.\n\n450\n00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.580\nMy DNS server says,\nI don't know I'll go out and wait.\n\n451\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.550\nI just got that answer from Mike,\nhasn't change in the last five seconds,\n\n452\n00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.560\nI'll just give that to you, right.\n\n453\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.780\nSo it speeds up the the process,\nthat's what caching is for.\n\n454\n00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.810\nNow how long does the server cache it for?\n\n455\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.670\nThat's determined by the TTL or\nthe time to live on the record.\n\n456\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.500\nWhen Microsoft's DNS server sent\nthe answer back to my DNS server,\n\n457\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.130\nincluded in the answer was the name and\nthe IP address of their web server and\n\n458\n00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.040\nit was also a TTL value, a time to live.\n\n459\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.750\nMy server will cache it for\nwhatever that TTL says.\n\n460\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.450\nOnce that TTL expires, it goes away.\n\n461\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.650\nWe're gonna throw that cache record\nout and if I open up a browser and\n\n462\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.150\ngo to Microsoft.com again, it's gonna have\nto go through the whole process all over\n\n463\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.370\nagain, but then when it gets\nthe answer it'll cash it.\n\n464\n00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.060\nYou might think why,\n\n465\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.550\nwhy do we throw it away if once\nonce you've cached it, keep it.\n\n466\n00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000\nWell that'd be great until Microsoft\nchanges their IP address, right?\n\n467\n00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.100\nNow my cached entry is incorrect and\n\n468\n00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.800\nif I'm not ever gonna go look it up again,\nI'll never get the right one.\n\n469\n00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.430\nThe other one is load balancing.\n\n470\n00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.741\nMicrosoft doesn't want me hitting their\nsame web server every single time.\n\n471\n00:23:58.741 --> 00:24:03.037\nEvery time I hit DNS, they might rotate\nthrough the IP addresses because they have\n\n472\n00:24:03.037 --> 00:24:05.411\nseveral web servers to\nhandle the workload.\n\n473\n00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:08.630\nIf I cache one servers IP address,\nand let's just say for giggles,\n\n474\n00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.285\nmost of the people here cache\nthe same servers address,\n\n475\n00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:13.561\nthey're all gonna be\nhitting the same server.\n\n476\n00:24:13.561 --> 00:24:16.322\nThese other web servers are going to be,\nhey, I don't have anything to do,\n\n477\n00:24:16.322 --> 00:24:17.457\nI'll just twiddle my thumbs.\n\n478\n00:24:17.457 --> 00:24:20.875\nAnd that one server's going,\nhow come I'm getting all the work?\n\n479\n00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:23.589\nBecause we've cached a single entry.\n\n480\n00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:27.410\nSo TTL controls that.\n\n481\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.830\nThat is determined by the server\nthat has the information.\n\n482\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.060\nMicrosoft told my DNS server how\nlong to keep their information for.\n\n483\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.760\nWhen if I query for\nGoogle if I try to go to Google,\n\n484\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.900\nGoogle's DNS server is gonna tell me\nhow long to keep the information for.\n\n485\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.570\nAnd they might be completely different.\n\n486\n00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.270\nMicrosoft might say hey cache this for\nthree hours.\n\n487\n00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.520\nThat way my DNS server doesn't\nhave to hear from you.\n\n488\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.080\nYou can use that same IP for three hours,\nreduces the workload on my DNS server.\n\n489\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.505\nGoogle might say, hey,\ncache this for 15 seconds, right?\n\n490\n00:24:54.505 --> 00:24:56.200\nRight, why?\n\n491\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.480\nBecause they want you to get\nnew IP addresses every time and\n\n492\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.220\nnot use the same server over and over.\n\n493\n00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.600\nThey're okay with you querying again.\n\n494\n00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.790\nThey just do something\ncalled round robining,\n\n495\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.610\nwhich we might come back to in a second.\n\n496\n00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.840\nAlright.\n\n497\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.590\nSo TTL is set by the DNS server\nthat's providing the answer\n\n498\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.520\nnot the one that's getting the answer.\n\n499\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.720\nI don't decide how long to cache it for.\n\n500\n00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.890\nIf we look at my records in here\nthe TTL is actually on the SOA so\n\n501\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.350\nwhen I pull up the properties\nof my zone and\n\n502\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:32.260\nI take a look at the advanced\nview which is not on here.\n\n503\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.220\nWait, sorry the SOA.\n\n504\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.208\nBrain cramp for a second.\n\n505\n00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:39.927\nOn the SOA tab I can see the TTL.\n\n506\n00:25:39.927 --> 00:25:40.572\nRight down here.\n\n507\n00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.841\nTTL for this record is one hour.\n\n508\n00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:46.417\nThat's days, hours,\nminutes, seconds, all right.\n\n509\n00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:53.910\nThe TTL for the SOA determines the TTL for\nall the records in this zone, all right.\n\n510\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.970\nSo it becomes the default for all records.\n\n511\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:01.730\nIf I change the TTL at the SOA new\nrecords will get that new TTL.\n\n512\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.350\nThe old records will not,\nit does not update them.\n\n513\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.170\nBut any new records will\npick up that new TTL value.\n\n514\n00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.320\n&gt;&gt; Is this gonna be, or does it have\nto be a global configuration or\n\n515\n00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.200\ncan we get granular and do this on\nan individual record there Mike?\n\n516\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.310\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question because I\nmight want to really rotate through some\n\n517\n00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:21.250\nrecords fast but others I'd rather\nbe static like my exchange server.\n\n518\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.900\nThere's only one IP address so\nI want you to keep that and\n\n519\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.650\ndon't ask every five minutes because\nthe IP address isn't gonna change.\n\n520\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.440\nSo maybe I want you to keep that\nrecord a little bit longer.\n\n521\n00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.734\nBut the web server records I want you\nto only keep them for a few seconds and\n\n522\n00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:33.986\nthen throw them out right?\n\n523\n00:26:33.986 --> 00:26:37.793\nSo we can change the TTL on\nthe individual records as well.\n\n524\n00:26:37.793 --> 00:26:40.049\nIf I pull up the properties\nof one of these records.\n\n525\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.860\nAll right?\n\n526\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.340\nWe won't see the TTL.\n\n527\n00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.510\nMike, you're lying to me.\n\n528\n00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.840\nYou can't change the TTL\non an individual record.\n\n529\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.760\nYes, you can.\n\n530\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.340\nWhat you have to do is turn\non your advanced view.\n\n531\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.000\nWe go to the view menu on our DNS console.\n\n532\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.630\nWe choose advanced.\n\n533\n00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.282\nThen we pull up the same\nrecords properties.\n\n534\n00:27:00.282 --> 00:27:02.876\nAnd look at there, we got a TTL.\n\n535\n00:27:02.876 --> 00:27:05.790\nNotice it's one hour, all right.\n\n536\n00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:12.240\nIf I change the SOA TTL, so\nwe'll go to properties and\n\n537\n00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:20.130\nwe'll change the SOA TTL to two hours and\nI'll apply it.\n\n538\n00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.010\nWe go look at that record again.\n\n539\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.080\nIt's still sitting at one hour.\n\n540\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.621\nBut if I make a new record.\n\n541\n00:27:26.621 --> 00:27:29.056\nNew host, we'll call it test.\n\n542\n00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:34.540\nIP address,\n10.0.100 dot some other random number.\n\n543\n00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.480\nAnd we click add host,\nalthough it did see one there.\n\n544\n00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.110\nLet's see if it picks it up.\n\n545\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.897\nIt should pick it up.\n\n546\n00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:43.950\nBut it did not.\n\n547\n00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:48.280\nFor dynamically created records, if a\nclient was to call up and create a record,\n\n548\n00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.440\nthat would pick up the TTL from the SOA.\n\n549\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.010\nIf I'm manually creating it,\nevidently Microsoft says, hey,\n\n550\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.660\nyou're a big boy,\nyou can set the TTL yourself.\n\n551\n00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.204\nSo [LAUGH] only dynamically created\nrecords are gonna pick up that new default\n\n552\n00:28:01.204 --> 00:28:02.490\nTTL, all right?\n\n553\n00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.600\nSo just know for the exam.\n\n554\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.700\nKnow what the TTL is.\n\n555\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.000\nIt controls how long people\nare gonna cache the record for.\n\n556\n00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.160\nAnd then I can change it at the SOA for\n\n557\n00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.755\nall records, new records, new dynamically\ncreative records, not statics.\n\n558\n00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:18.985\nAnd you change on individual records\nif you turn on the advanced view.\n\n559\n00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:21.745\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nI know we got a few more things to go\n\n560\n00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:25.805\nthrough in here because well you\nknow DNS is a very big topic but\n\n561\n00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:28.625\nI know that we're stretching the envelopes\nof that time clock over there.\n\n562\n00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:33.525\nSo, looks like we might have to go another\npart here but before we've signed out do\n\n563\n00:28:33.525 --> 00:28:36.170\nwe have any additional things\nyou'd like to throw on this one.\n\n564\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.040\n&gt;&gt; No.\nBecause I'm running out of time.\n\n565\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.540\nI have too much to say, though.\n\n566\n00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.200\nWe do have a few more things I\nwanna go over but I'll save it for\n\n567\n00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.320\nthe next episode.\n\n568\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:44.920\n&gt;&gt; Well that's great.\n\n569\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.670\nThis looks like it's\ngood place to wrap up.\n\n570\n00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.058\nMike, we do appreciate you imparting\nall of this wisdom to us but\n\n571\n00:28:50.058 --> 00:28:52.870\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for ITProTV.\n\n572\n00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.270\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n573\n00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:08.325\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.982\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another exciting\n\n5\n00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:15.340\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.070\nwe're continuing through our\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.430\nWe're coming back with a part four on DNS,\nand now, like I said in the last one,\n\n9\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.300\nyou can see how important DNS is gonna be,\nnot only to your entire environment, but\n\n10\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.060\nto this exam.\n\n11\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.190\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.065\nMike, how are you doing sir?\n\n13\n00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:38.804\n&gt;&gt; Doing great, gonna try to wrap\nup DNS on this one, I promise.\n\n14\n00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.172\nOr not, I mean it is a fun topic.\n\n15\n00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:42.091\nIsn't it?\n\n16\n00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:44.666\nAll right, so,\nwe left off in that previous episode.\n\n17\n00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.940\nWe were talking about TTL,\nor time to live.\n\n18\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.520\nAnd I told you we had to turn on\nthat advanced view to see it, and\n\n19\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.620\nthat it was determined by the server\nthat's providing the answer,\n\n20\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.260\nnot the one that's asking the question.\n\n21\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.700\nSo, I get told my DNS server gets told by,\nsay,\n\n22\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.180\nMicrosoft, how long to\ncache that record for?\n\n23\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.900\nOr if people are talking to my DNS server,\n\n24\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.400\nmy server tells them how\nlong to cache the response.\n\n25\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.270\nOr it shows you where to set that.\n\n26\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.490\nAnother thing that they call out on\nthe exam when it comes to modifying record\n\n27\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.480\nproperties is weight, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.910\nWhen we talk about weight, really,\nthe only one that I know of that really\n\n29\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.810\nuses weight is the MX record is\nthe one that pops into mind.\n\n30\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.220\nBut with mail server records or\nMX records, we can set a priority.\n\n31\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.040\nThey didn't call it weight,\nwhich is always interesting to me.\n\n32\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.506\nWe just set a priority, so\nlet's take a look at what I mean by that.\n\n33\n00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:38.003\nSimply going to right-click on my zone.\n\n34\n00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:42.160\nAnd I'm gonna choose New Mail Exchange or\nMS Record.\n\n35\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.310\nAnd I'll leave this blank.\n\n36\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.457\nWe're not gonna get into exchange.\n\n37\n00:01:45.457 --> 00:01:50.286\nThat's a whole another topic that we don't\nhave time to get into as much time as I\n\n38\n00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:51.163\nspent on DNS.\n\n39\n00:01:51.163 --> 00:01:54.400\nSo, as far as how we fill this out,\nnot gonna get into that.\n\n40\n00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.320\nBut what I do wanna talk about\nit is this priority down here.\n\n41\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.920\nThis is how we can set\nweight on these records.\n\n42\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.630\nRight, the priority is a number.\n\n43\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.254\nI wanna say it goes to 65,000.\n\n44\n00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:08.760\nDon't quote me on that,\nnot super important.\n\n45\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.620\nDoubtful you're ever\ngonna get to that number.\n\n46\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.560\nBut what it is, the lower the number,\nthe higher the priority.\n\n47\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.394\nSo, a 10 has a higher priority than 20.\n\n48\n00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:22.344\nWhat we can do with this is if we have\nmultiple mailbox servers, and I want to\n\n49\n00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:27.120\nprioritize one over the other, we simply\nput a mail server priority on here.\n\n50\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.554\nAnd so, if I give one of them a ten,\none of them a 20, it's always gonna try\n\n51\n00:02:30.554 --> 00:02:33.511\nto deliver the mail to the mailbox\nserver with the lowest number,\n\n52\n00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.759\nhighest priority,\nthe one with the 10 first.\n\n53\n00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.304\nThat was unavailable,\nthen it can bump over and hit 20.\n\n54\n00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:42.035\nNow, there is no checking\nof these numbers.\n\n55\n00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:46.710\nIt's not gonna tell you if I go to another\nrecord, and I assign it a priority of ten.\n\n56\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.700\nIt's not gonna say, hey, you've already\nused ten, and you can go to one as well.\n\n57\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.250\nSo, one through 65,000,\nor something like that.\n\n58\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.820\nIf you have two servers with same\npriority, it just picks one randomly.\n\n59\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.790\nIt has no way of knowing which one,\nand you might do that intentionally,\n\n60\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.960\nyou might have two servers\nthat are about the same, and\n\n61\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.880\nyou don't care which one gets used,\nso you set up both to ten.\n\n62\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.830\nYou've got a third server that you want\nto be used primarily as a back up for\n\n63\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.430\nyour mail server,\nbecause it's doing other things, and\n\n64\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.808\nit doesn't have a lot of power.\n\n65\n00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:15.970\nMaybe I set that one to a 30, so that way,\n\n66\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.930\nit'll hit one of those two first,\nthat have a ten.\n\n67\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.320\nOnly if both of those don't respond,\n\n68\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.890\nthen we go to the one with\nthe priority over 30, right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.610\nSo, another thing that I can\nset on my resource records.\n\n70\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I have a question.\n\n71\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.780\nYou mentioned some pretty amazing\nstatistics about DNS, and\n\n72\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.860\nhow the performance of\na server really works.\n\n73\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.405\nLet me see if I can remember it.\n\n74\n00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:43.740\n260,000 queries per second and millions\nof records in a very small subset of RAM.\n\n75\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.330\nNow, it performs really well,\nbut in larger scenarios, is there\n\n76\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.920\na technique that we can use if maybe we\ndon't want to hit a single DNS server?\n\n77\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.460\nAlmost analogous to the mail\nserver that you did?\n\n78\n00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.252\n&gt;&gt; Sorta, kinda, but I think you're,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n79\n00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:02.600\nIt's not so much that we want\nto use different DNS servers,\n\n80\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.400\ncuz as you said,\nthey perform incredibly well.\n\n81\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.270\nYou have to hammer this thing.\n\n82\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.450\nMost organizations don't need\nmore than two DNS servers.\n\n83\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.530\nOne and then a back up, just in case\nsomething goes wrong with the one.\n\n84\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.870\nWe'll have more than that, but\n\n85\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.250\nprimarily for performance as far\nas geographical distribution.\n\n86\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.540\nI've got an office here, and\nI've got an office out in Los Angeles.\n\n87\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.150\nI don't need those clients in LA going\nacross the land back here to Florida\n\n88\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.150\nto hit the DNS service.\n\n89\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.620\nI'm gonna put another one out there.\n\n90\n00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.980\nEven though the one here could\ndefinitely handle the workload for\n\n91\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.490\nalmost all of my offices, but what you're\ntalking about, I think, is round-robining.\n\n92\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.620\nAnd this is a way not so much for DNS,\n\n93\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.180\nbut it's a way to use DNS to do\na poor man's load balancing, right?\n\n94\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.780\nI've got web servers.\n\n95\n00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.490\nI've got a web application.\n\n96\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.060\nI've got a store front\nthat I host on a website.\n\n97\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.600\nAnd that's where people come and\nbuy my widgets.\n\n98\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.330\nWell, one server wasn't enough.\n\n99\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.959\nBecause it was getting overloaded,\nmy widgets really took off.\n\n100\n00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:02.083\nAnd everybody wants a widget now,\nthey come to my site, and\n\n101\n00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:04.155\nthey're complaining cuz it's slow.\n\n102\n00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:07.870\nBecause there's so many people trying to\ngive me their credit card information.\n\n103\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.770\nSo, I get a second or a third web server,\nand I set them up, and\n\n104\n00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.260\nnow I've got three web servers\nall hosting the same site.\n\n105\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.840\nHow do I split the workload between\nthose three web servers, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.870\nHow do I make sure that each one's\ndoing about a third of the work?\n\n107\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.220\nWell, I wanna do it for real.\n\n108\n00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.850\nI go out and I buy a load balancer,\n\n109\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.440\nnot a hardware device that I set in\nthere that takes care of this for me.\n\n110\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.708\nIt redirects them equally across all\nthree, as those requests come in.\n\n111\n00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:39.467\nBut a poor man's load balancer,\nor another way to do it, and\n\n112\n00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:44.520\nit works with other technologies as well,\nis to do round-robining within DNS.\n\n113\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.449\nAnd that simply means I'm\ngonna take the same name and\n\n114\n00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.604\npoint it to three different IP addresses.\n\n115\n00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:56.773\nSo, www could point to a 10.0.100.5.\n\n116\n00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.591\nAnother record for www, 10.0.100.6,\n\n117\n00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:04.596\nanother record for 10.0.100.7, right?\n\n118\n00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.852\nAnd they don't have to be sequential.\n\n119\n00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:08.790\nI'm just doing that because\nthat's the way my brain works.\n\n120\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.760\nThen what happens,\nwhen you query DNS for a name, if there\n\n121\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.820\nis more than one answer for that name,\nit always just gives you all the answers.\n\n122\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.780\nIt says here, there's three different\ntests, here's all their IP addresses,\n\n123\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.850\nyou figure out which one you wanna use.\n\n124\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.640\nWell, it orders that list, right?\n\n125\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.148\nAnd what round-robining tells DNS to do\nis say hey, do this, when you respond,\n\n126\n00:06:30.148 --> 00:06:34.083\ngive them the list in a certain order,\nlet's say five, six, seven.\n\n127\n00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:37.006\nThe next time somebody asks, switch it up.\n\n128\n00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:39.209\nGo six, seven, five.\n\n129\n00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:42.259\nThe next time go seven, five, six, right?\n\n130\n00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.640\nSo in other words, the one on the top,\nthe one that was first.\n\n131\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.225\nCuz when a client receives more than\none IP address, he doesn't care, right?\n\n132\n00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:52.595\nHey, if all three of these IP\naddresses point back to www,\n\n133\n00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.800\nit's fine, that's great.\n\n134\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.025\nIt's just going to use\nthe first one in the list.\n\n135\n00:06:57.025 --> 00:07:00.175\nOnly if that first one doesn't respond,\nis it going to move to second one.\n\n136\n00:07:00.175 --> 00:07:03.815\nSo, by just giving them three answers,\nit's still going to use the first one in\n\n137\n00:07:03.815 --> 00:07:05.757\nthe list, that's always going to\nbe the same first one in the list,\n\n138\n00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:09.430\ncuz it's pulling him out of the zone\nfile in the order that it finds them.\n\n139\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.550\nIf I turn on round-robbining,\n\n140\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.890\nit's gonna switch up the order\nthat it gives the client.\n\n141\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.100\nWhen it gives them the answer,\nit's gonna change the order.\n\n142\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.810\nThat way the client's not always using,\n\n143\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.110\nit's still using the first one on\nthe list, but the list is rearranged.\n\n144\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.070\nSo now, you're not getting\nthat same server every time.\n\n145\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.240\n&gt;&gt; I just had a light bulb moment.\n\n146\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.240\nI was putting the carriage\nright in front of the horse.\n\n147\n00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.910\nSo, it's not about helping the DNS server,\n\n148\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.150\nas it is more about differentiating\nwhich response comes back,\n\n149\n00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.330\nin the case where you said,\nmaybe it's geographical distribution,\n\n150\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.080\ncould be a single area with multiple web\nservers in order to put load balancing.\n\n151\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.460\nSo, I was putting the DNS server,\nthinking of DNS instead,\n\n152\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.950\nwhen I should have been\nthinking about the response.\n\n153\n00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.563\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, and easy to do.\n\n154\n00:07:48.563 --> 00:07:52.449\nSo, we're using DNS to perform the load\nbalancing for some other servers, and\n\n155\n00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:56.567\nit could be Gosh, clusters, right, you\ncould have three different clusters and\n\n156\n00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:59.190\nyou'll wanna load balance\nbetween those clusters.\n\n157\n00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.948\nYou take the virtual IP\naddress of your clusters and\n\n158\n00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.862\nyou make records same name but\npoint to the three different addresses and\n\n159\n00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:08.060\nthen you can load balance between them.\n\n160\n00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.277\nSo it works with anything, it doesn't have\nto be web, it's just a very common use for\n\n161\n00:08:12.277 --> 00:08:16.860\nit, or some technology that maybe doesn't\nsupport load balancing any other way.\n\n162\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.295\nThis is a way you could do load balancing.\n\n163\n00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:20.030\nLet's test it.\n\n164\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.480\nWe could actually do\na pretty cool example and\n\n165\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.920\nshow you how it's working or\nprove to you that it's working, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.662\nI'm gonna create a couple\nnew records in here.\n\n167\n00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:33.410\nI'm gonna say new record, and\nI'm gonna call this RR test.\n\n168\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.703\nFor a round robin test.\n\n169\n00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:40.002\nAnd I'll give you an IP address 10.0.100.\n\n170\n00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:44.386\nI don't know we'll do 6.\n\n171\n00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:47.776\nAnd then I'll do the same thing,\nrrtest that has to be the same name,\n\n172\n00:08:47.776 --> 00:08:51.991\notherwise when it returns the results,\nit wouldn't give all three of them, right?\n\n173\n00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:55.109\nIt has to be the exact same name 10.0.100.\n\n174\n00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:56.219\nWhat did I say?\n\n175\n00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:59.149\n6 so this one will be 7.\n\n176\n00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:02.907\nAnd then we'll do rr test and\n\n177\n00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:07.450\n10.0.100.8 now we'll\n\n178\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.370\nclick add host, and OK and done.\n\n179\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.900\nAnd so now when I look in zone, actually\nhave three records with the exact same\n\n180\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.890\nname pointing to three\ndifferent IP addresses.\n\n181\n00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.140\nNow, where do I turn on round-robining?\n\n182\n00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.906\nThat's gonna be done on\nthe properties of the dns servers.\n\n183\n00:09:28.906 --> 00:09:33.680\nSo I'm gonna right click on my\ndns server and choose properties.\n\n184\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.498\nAnd then I'm gonna do the advance tab.\n\n185\n00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:41.143\nAnd you'll see the round robinning is\nactually enabled by default in 2016 DNS.\n\n186\n00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:45.030\nSo, as soon as it says, hey there's\nmore than one record with the same name.\n\n187\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.740\nI'll in turn give you all of them.\n\n188\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.900\nIt's gonna automatically rotate\nthe list if you query again.\n\n189\n00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.990\nAnd so I'll cancel that,\n\n190\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.620\nto show you where to turn that on,\nnow let's prove it to ourselves.\n\n191\n00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.060\nI'm going to use ns lookup.\n\n192\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.060\nAnd we'll do, what did I call it, rrTest.\n\n193\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.780\nAnd notice I get three records back.\n\n194\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.007\n7, 6, 8 is the order, can you see that?\n\n195\n00:10:10.007 --> 00:10:12.480\nI can run the same command again.\n\n196\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.176\nNotice it's 687, so\nthe one that was on the top, 7,\n\n197\n00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:18.335\nis now on the bottom, all right?\n\n198\n00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:19.580\n6 is now on the top.\n\n199\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.857\nIf I run it again, 6 is now on the bottom\nand 8 moved up from second to first.\n\n200\n00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:28.110\nIf I run it again, it's back to 7, right?\n\n201\n00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.390\nSo it just keeps rotating\nthrough that list every time.\n\n202\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.204\nNow it's not perfect\nload balancing all right?\n\n203\n00:10:34.204 --> 00:10:38.137\nBecause I might hit that server and\nget the answer 100.6.\n\n204\n00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:42.124\nThen two other people, in the meantime,\nquery for that same name and\n\n205\n00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:44.040\nthey get seven and eight.\n\n206\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.960\nI query again, I get six again, right?\n\n207\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.200\nThat's the same one I hit last time.\n\n208\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.466\nWhere's my load balancing?\n\n209\n00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:51.640\nAll right, so\nit's not perfect load balancing.\n\n210\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.020\nIt's not looking at the actual workload.\n\n211\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.080\nThe guy, I got six,\nthe next person got seven.\n\n212\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.420\nBut he might not have actually connected.\n\n213\n00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.800\nHe might've opened up the webpage and\ngo you know what?\n\n214\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.950\nI didn't wanna order anything.\n\n215\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.990\nSecond person says I opened up\nthe webpage, I don't wanna order anything.\n\n216\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.580\nThird person, is back to the first answer,\nand he does decide to order something,\n\n217\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.440\nso both people that are ordering,\nare using the same IP address, or\n\n218\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.610\nhitting the same server.\n\n219\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.150\nThe other two are sitting there idle.\n\n220\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.020\nCuz it doesn't know that\nthe connection was maintained or\n\n221\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.170\nnot looking at how busy the server is or\nanything like that.\n\n222\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.860\nThat's true load balancing that require\nspecial hardware or software to do.\n\n223\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:31.030\nBut DNS lets me to do like I like to\ncall it the poor man's load balancing.\n\n224\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:36.551\nAll right, so cool little example of how\nyou can see it in action using NSLookup.\n\n225\n00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:40.380\nAll right, secure dynamic updates,\nwe've already talked about that.\n\n226\n00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.390\nWe talked about how I can only\nif it's a standard primary\n\n227\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.090\nI can choose the option secure and\nnon-secure.\n\n228\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.590\nIf I'm doing an active directory\nintegrated I can do secure only updates.\n\n229\n00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.468\nAnd remember dynamic update is when\na node calls up DNS and says, hey,\n\n230\n00:11:57.468 --> 00:12:00.972\nhere's my name, here's my IP address,\nmake a record for me.\n\n231\n00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:03.502\nSo the admin doesn't have to go and\nright-click new record for\n\n232\n00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:05.170\nevery computer on the network.\n\n233\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.410\nIt's a dynamic update.\n\n234\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.360\nSecure means they have\nto be authenticated.\n\n235\n00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.760\nWhen you allow secure dynamic updates\non the DNS server's properties,\n\n236\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.720\nevery zone has an access control list\njust like any other file or folder.\n\n237\n00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.020\nThe authenticated users group\nIs given create child objects.\n\n238\n00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.450\nSo that's what gives those clients\nthe ability to create new records.\n\n239\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.190\nRemember, a computer is authorized, right?\n\n240\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.770\nWhen you turn a computer on, it has to\nauthenticate with active directory before\n\n241\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.730\nyou ever get to the login screen.\n\n242\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.410\nSo your computer is part of\nthe authenticated users group.\n\n243\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.100\nI know that seems strange\ncuz it's a not a user but\n\n244\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.693\nit is authenticated and\nthe computers are included in that.\n\n245\n00:12:46.693 --> 00:12:50.690\nSo when I say secure only,\nit's saying hey if you're authenticated,\n\n246\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.350\nif you've been authenticated by\nactive directory, I'll allow you.\n\n247\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.200\nBut if your computer is not\npart of Active Directory,\n\n248\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.120\nif it wasn't able to authenticate, then\nI'm not gonna let you create a new record.\n\n249\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.530\nThat way vendor laptops and visitors to\nyour location that happen to talk to your\n\n250\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:12.520\nDNS server aren't filling up your DNS zone\nwith unnecessary resource records right?\n\n251\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.390\nNext is going to be DNS auto events and\nanalytical or query events for\n\n252\n00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.120\nauditing and troubleshooting.\n\n253\n00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.436\nIt's a long one, right?\n\n254\n00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:23.440\nGood old Microsoft and their objectives.\n\n255\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.220\nIt's just more information, honestly.\n\n256\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.326\nYou know we've already looked at,\nand I can show you here,\n\n257\n00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:31.761\nwe took a look at this\nearlier in our episodes.\n\n258\n00:13:31.761 --> 00:13:34.459\nI pulled up the properties\nof my DNS server, and\n\n259\n00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:38.090\nwe talked about the the fact\nthat I can do event logging.\n\n260\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.670\nAnd I can control\nthe level of detail there.\n\n261\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.520\nWe've also got Debug Logging that I\ncan use when I am troubleshooting but\n\n262\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.620\nthat's very detailed logging and\nthat can hurt, or\n\n263\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.830\nhamper your performance on the DNS server.\n\n264\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.385\nSo we'll only turn it on when we need it,\nand then we turn it back off.\n\n265\n00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:58.148\nThere are some additional\nlogs that we can use and or\n\n266\n00:13:58.148 --> 00:14:00.405\ncheck when we're trouble shooting DNS.\n\n267\n00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:04.425\nThere's the audit logs and\nthe analytic logs.\n\n268\n00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:08.465\nThe audit logs are the ones\nwe've already seen.\n\n269\n00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:12.255\nIf I right click again on that,\nproperties, even logging.\n\n270\n00:14:12.255 --> 00:14:15.195\nNow this is basically my audit log.\n\n271\n00:14:15.195 --> 00:14:20.170\nAudit logs show you changes to the DNS\nserver like changes to the zone,\n\n272\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.730\nchanges to a resource record,\nthings like that.\n\n273\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.360\nThose will be in your audit log.\n\n274\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.200\nYour analytic log is going to be\ninformation about information sent\n\n275\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.230\nback and forth from the DNS server\nqueries, zone transfers, things like that.\n\n276\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.820\nYou have to turn that one on.\n\n277\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.070\nSo let me show you how to find it.\n\n278\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.446\nI'm gonna open up my\ngood old event viewer.\n\n279\n00:14:44.037 --> 00:14:46.960\nI'll make that a little bit bigger.\n\n280\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.199\nAnd I'm gonna go to the application and\nservice logs.\n\n281\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.210\nMake that a little bit wider so\nwe can see it.\n\n282\n00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.650\nIt's taking it a minute to expand it out.\n\n283\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.923\nIt's a big list, so give it just\na second to populate, there we go.\n\n284\n00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:06.220\nAnd you can see there's my\nDNS server application log.\n\n285\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.966\nAnd I'll see information about DNS\nserver wrote version one, zone data,\n\n286\n00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:13.906\nhere's the DNS server finish the\nbackground, loading and signing of zones.\n\n287\n00:15:13.906 --> 00:15:18.189\nBut if I expand out Microsoft,\nand then I expand out Windows.\n\n288\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.176\nAnd then we go down and we find DNS.\n\n289\n00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:26.680\nIt's alphabetical,\nthere we go, DNS server.\n\n290\n00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.830\nHere's my audit log.\n\n291\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.770\nAnd as I said, the audit log is enabled,\nI think I did,\n\n292\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.100\nI'll say it again if I didn't.\n\n293\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.230\nThe audit log is enabled by default.\n\n294\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.410\nAnd there I can see information.\n\n295\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.290\nRemember, this is information\nabout changes on the DNS server.\n\n296\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.240\nThe zone FSDA, was updated.\n\n297\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.940\nWhat's another exciting one here?\n\n298\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.644\nA resource record type one was created.\n\n299\n00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:51.042\nThat was me, just a second ago,\nmaking those RR test records for\n\n300\n00:15:51.042 --> 00:15:53.979\nour NS lookup and our round robin example.\n\n301\n00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:58.008\nSo anytime changes are made,\nthe auto log's where you're gonna go.\n\n302\n00:15:58.008 --> 00:16:02.145\nSo if you suspect somebody's been making\nchanges, this is a good place to go and\n\n303\n00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:05.790\nsee when and from by whom those\nchanges were made, all right?\n\n304\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.360\nYou don't see the analytic log.\n\n305\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.155\nFor that you're gonna\nright-click on DNS server, and\n\n306\n00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:16.480\nif I can do it there, make sure you\nselect it before you right-click it.\n\n307\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.630\nNotice, I got the wrong menu\nwhen I didn't select it first.\n\n308\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.490\nSelect it, right-click and where is it?\n\n309\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.740\n[SOUND] You know what?\n\n310\n00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.640\nI didn't do that right.\n\n311\n00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.100\nI've got to right-click on the,\ntry that again.\n\n312\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.980\nSilly me,\nit's under the view menu I forgot.\n\n313\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.222\nSo I right-click on the DNS-Server,\nI go to View, and\n\n314\n00:16:42.222 --> 00:16:44.970\nthis what I was looking for\non the main menu.\n\n315\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.676\nIt's under view and\nthen show analytic and debug logs.\n\n316\n00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:53.430\nAll right, so I right-clicked on it, and I\ndon't know why my screen goes a little bit\n\n317\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.710\ncrazy, as it filters out because I'm\nnot changing that for anything else.\n\n318\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.210\nBut yeah it freaks out for\na minute, so give it just a second.\n\n319\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.230\nNow I've got this new log,\nmy analytic log.\n\n320\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.336\nAnd this is where it will see\ninformation that's being sent back and\n\n321\n00:17:09.336 --> 00:17:11.190\nforth by the DNS server.\n\n322\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.460\nAll right, but notice there's nothing\nin here cuz I just turned it on.\n\n323\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.250\nSo I want to right-click on analytical\nbecause it is still not turned on.\n\n324\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.060\nUnlike auditing, analytical is not turned\non by default, even though I am showing it\n\n325\n00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.860\nnow by right-click show analytic log,\nit's still not turned on.\n\n326\n00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.140\nI have to right-click it\nnow that I can see it, and\n\n327\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.920\nI'm gonna go to\nthe properties of this guy.\n\n328\n00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:39.250\nAnd here, is where I can turn it on.\n\n329\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.190\nEnable logging.\n\n330\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.040\nAll right.\n\n331\n00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.410\nIt tells you it may lose\nevents when they are enabled,\n\n332\n00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.140\nbecause it might clear the log if you had\nturned it on, and then turned it off.\n\n333\n00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.050\nSo you might wanna make sure\nyou export those first.\n\n334\n00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.730\nI'll click OK to turn it on,\n\n335\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.570\nthe other things you wanna check\nis these settings right here.\n\n336\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.470\nAnd notice they grayed out on me,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.210\nI knew it was already on the override\nevents as needed, I'm gonna turn that off,\n\n338\n00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.210\nand I wanna change this.\n\n339\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.358\nNormally where you wanna put this,\nis do not overwrite events (clear\n\n340\n00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:12.880\nlogs manually), and that way if\nthe log file was to get full, so\n\n341\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.890\nI gotta start overwriting maybe really\nimportant data that I would miss.\n\n342\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.910\nIt also means that if it fills up,\nI'm gonna miss some data, so\n\n343\n00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.760\nI gotta make sure I come in here and\nread and clear the log every so often.\n\n344\n00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.850\nSo now I'll turn it back on,\nit tells me I might lose things.\n\n345\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.890\nI'll click OK, and we're good to go.\n\n346\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:34.638\nSo just know, you can only change this\nby disabling it, changing it, and\n\n347\n00:18:34.638 --> 00:18:36.259\nthen turning it back on.\n\n348\n00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:36.820\nAnd then I'll click OK.\n\n349\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.670\nAnd there's not gonna be\nanything in there, obviously,\n\n350\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.200\nbecause I just turned it on, but\nthat's very detailed logging.\n\n351\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.150\nAlthough this one, unlike the debug\nlogging on the properties of the DNS\n\n352\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.250\nserver that does hamper performance,\nMicrosoft says this one will not.\n\n353\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.450\nIt should not hamper performance\non my DNS server, all right?\n\n354\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:03.110\nThey say if that server's extremely busy,\nand I didn't write down the numbers in\n\n355\n00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.100\nmy notes, but it was another one of these,\nyeah, I don't have to worry about that.\n\n356\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.350\nI mean, it really had to be getting\nhundreds of thousands of queries\n\n357\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.310\nper second,\n\n358\n00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.810\nbefore this type of logging would have\nany impact on my server's performance.\n\n359\n00:19:16.224 --> 00:19:19.740\nAll right, so we looked at\nthe audit logs enabled by default,\n\n360\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.880\nwe see that right there, we looked at\nthe analytical log not enabled by default,\n\n361\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.080\nhave to show it first,\nthen you have to turn it on\n\n362\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.740\neven once you've shown it\nbefore it'll start logging.\n\n363\n00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:34.919\nAll right Wes, so I guess we've got,\nwhat have we got left here?\n\n364\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.300\nConfigure unknown record support.\n\n365\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.290\nThis is an interesting one.\n\n366\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.720\nWhen it comes to records, and\n\n367\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.105\nlet me flip back over to DNS,\nDNS again is not a Microsoft thing, right?\n\n368\n00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:52.097\nThere's RFCs out there,\nthis is like protocol,\n\n369\n00:19:52.097 --> 00:19:58.004\nthere's standards involved as far\nlike what an A record should contain.\n\n370\n00:19:58.004 --> 00:20:03.327\nHow that data is stored in that record,\nwe see this pretty graphical view,\n\n371\n00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:07.710\nbut we know that's not\nwhat really being stored.\n\n372\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.730\nThis information is stored.\n\n373\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.150\nSo the way it's stored,\n\n374\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:15.170\nclassified, field names,\nthings like that, that's all defined.\n\n375\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.520\nAnd all DNS servers,\n\n376\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.050\nwhether it's Microsoft DNS Server or\nBind, they follow these protocols.\n\n377\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.360\nSo that we have interoperability,\nall right?\n\n378\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.430\nBut you can use DNS outside of that.\n\n379\n00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.620\nYou can actually create your own format.\n\n380\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.980\nMaybe you've got an application\nthat does some weird things,\n\n381\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.080\nI shouldn't say weird, different things.\n\n382\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.680\nAnd maybe you need a record stored\nin a slightly modified format that\n\n383\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.340\ndoesn't follow DNS standards.\n\n384\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.528\nYou can still do that well beyond the\nscope of this class, in fact, it's beyond\n\n385\n00:20:47.528 --> 00:20:51.730\nmy scope, but what we need to know is that\nDNS, you can do that with Windows DNS.\n\n386\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:57.930\n2016 supports non-standard or\nunknown record support.\n\n387\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.900\nLike i said I've never had the need to, or\n\n388\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.660\neven seen an, I cant even say it,\nunknown record support.\n\n389\n00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.200\nI've never even seen a record like that,\nthat's not one of my standards.\n\n390\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.880\nBut are the, important thing we have for\nthis exam, is that 2016 does support that.\n\n391\n00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.890\nSo if you have any need for\n\n392\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.890\nthat, it does, there's nothing to do,\nyou don't have to try anything on.\n\n393\n00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.410\nJust know that what DNS and\nMiicrosoft will do is say,\n\n394\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.870\nI have no idea what that is, but\nI'm gonna let you do it anyway, all right?\n\n395\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.020\nBecause you probably know what you're\ndoing, so I'll let you store this strange\n\n396\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.880\nlooking record in the zone, and\nif somebody queries, and I need to\n\n397\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.350\nreturn that, I'll give it to them, and\nI'll give it to them in unmodified way.\n\n398\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.430\nI'm not gonna try to force it to fit the\nstandard, I'm not gonna change anything,\n\n399\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.460\nI'm gonna give it to them as is.\n\n400\n00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.330\nSo you can do your own custom work, and\ntake advantage of the DNS engine and\n\n401\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.030\nservice to provide these non standard,\nor unknown resource records,\n\n402\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:58.600\nand DNS will let you do that, which is\npretty cool from a developers perspective.\n\n403\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike,\nit's been a long journey here in DNS, and\n\n404\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.750\nI'm gonna hopefully get the answer that\nI'm thinking I'm getting in this one.\n\n405\n00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.820\nIt does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n406\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.779\nSo, are we about to bring this\njourney in DNS to an end, or\n\n407\n00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:13.385\nyou got some additional\nwords you'd like to say?\n\n408\n00:22:13.385 --> 00:22:17.756\n&gt;&gt; You know, I've got a lot more I'd love\nto talk about you with DNS, but it's not\n\n409\n00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:22.420\nin this exam, so we'll put that off for\nanother day, and we can say DNS is done.\n\n410\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.250\n&gt;&gt; That's great,\nit's a wealth of knowledge Mike, and\n\n411\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.330\nwe appreciate you being here, and\nwe appreciate you, the viewer, being here.\n\n412\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.560\nIt looks like we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up and come to an end.\n\n413\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.450\nSigning out for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n414\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.593\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n415\n00:22:34.593 --> 00:22:36.130\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n416\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:42.715\n[MUSIC]\n\n417\n00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:45.865\nThank you for watching

talk about DHCP.\n\n15\n00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.630\nAnd, first I thought it would\nbe good to start out with, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.040\nCherokee already defined the acronym for\nus.\n\n17\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.960\nBut talk about just what DHCP is used for,\nso\n\n18\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.910\nyes, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\nabsolutely.\n\n19\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.920\nBut that only tells\nthe beginning of the story,\n\n20\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.800\nthe idea is we're gonna\nhand out IP addresses,\n\n21\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.570\nwe're gonna give them out traditionally\nand normally most of the time dynamically.\n\n22\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.118\nBut DHCP also gives out\nstatic IP addresses.\n\n23\n00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:06.120\nAnd I mentioned this in one of our prior\nepisodes back in the first group of shows\n\n24\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.140\nthat we put together around understanding\nand planning for an IPv4 network.\n\n25\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.040\nIf you haven't seen those,\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n26\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.890\nWe talked about some interesting\ntools to use to troubleshoot.\n\n27\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.620\nTook a look at PowerShell a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.760\nTalked about Net SH,\ntalked about the concepts of IP addresses,\n\n29\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.800\nsubnet masks, all that kind of stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.700\nGood background and foundation material\nfor our conversations going forward.\n\n31\n00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.070\nBut I mentioned there, as we talked\nabout DHCP and broke down IP addresses,\n\n32\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.030\nthat traditionally we do see this\nthought process as being dynamic, but\n\n33\n00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.040\nusing a reservation, we can give\nout a static IP address using DHCP.\n\n34\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.490\nOr we can simply set the TTL value\non the lease to never expire,\n\n35\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.260\nin which case would essentially give\nyou a static IP address as well.\n\n36\n00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.670\nSo just don't wanna lose sight of that\nfact that traditionally, while we see DHCP\n\n37\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.720\nas being a give it to you for a period of\ntime lease and then have it count down.\n\n38\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.250\nYou may auto renew and\ncontinue to use that IP.\n\n39\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.382\nBut it is essentially defined as dynamic.\n\n40\n00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:00.910\nBut you also have a static capability and\n\n41\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.360\nwe'll explore that a little\nbit more as we get into this.\n\n42\n00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.970\nBut generically the idea behind DHCP is\n\n43\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.140\nto setup a system that allows us to\naccomplish three very important things.\n\n44\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.160\nNumber one,\nto provide a pool of usable IP addresses.\n\n45\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.820\nWe would call that a scope or address\nrange that is gonna be made available\n\n46\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.110\nthrough a central management console,\nan interface, that allows us to hand out\n\n47\n00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.600\nIP addresses either statically or\ndynamically as we've described.\n\n48\n00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.178\nAlong with handing out\njust the IP Address,\n\n49\n00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:33.147\nwe do the second very important thing\nwhich is to add scope options or\n\n50\n00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:36.979\nadditional configuration,\nthought processes, solutions and\n\n51\n00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.551\nitems that would be of interest\nsuch as our Default Gateway.\n\n52\n00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.476\nYou now know what that is.\n\n53\n00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:42.917\nWe took a look at it in prior episodes.\n\n54\n00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.934\nIf you haven't,\nthen you need to go back and take a look.\n\n55\n00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.060\nYou should know what your subnet mask is,\nwe would get that traditionally as well.\n\n56\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.970\nWe may get things like our DNS server.\n\n57\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.760\nWhere is our DNS server or servers,\nwe could give that out as a DHCP option.\n\n58\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220\nAlong with a bunch of other stuff,\n\n59\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.590\nwe have quite a number of options that are\navailable to us and we can assign those\n\n60\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.040\nand give those out as part of our lease so\nwe can configure those.\n\n61\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.368\nSecond thing DHCP does.\n\n62\n00:03:07.368 --> 00:03:09.839\nThird thing,\nequally important that it does,\n\n63\n00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.800\nis that it keeps track of all the stuff\nthat we give out in this database.\n\n64\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.770\nAnd that allows us to interact with\nthrough the management console and\n\n65\n00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.050\nunderstand what's going\non this information.\n\n66\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.590\nNow we can take that and notch up a level\nif we want with something known as IPAM,\n\n67\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.140\nIP Address Management,\nwhich is gonna be like managing DHCP, but\n\n68\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.190\nmanaging even more capabilities and\nresources from a central console,\n\n69\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.860\nseparate roles, separate features,\nseparate set of functions.\n\n70\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.510\nWe'll be talking about that in some\nupcoming episodes, but we do have these\n\n71\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.440\nthree distinct thought processes and\ncharacteristics that DCHP does provide,\n\n72\n00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.090\nbut we wanna make sure\nwe're aware of this.\n\n73\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.150\nIt is a client-server model,\nas many of these solutions are.\n\n74\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.520\nWe have a client component,\nin other words.\n\n75\n00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.390\nWe're gonna talk about what that\nlooks like and how we understand\n\n76\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.740\nthat we can go out and request a DHCP\ndriven address, and how we get that back.\n\n77\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.060\nWe have a server component, the server\nside is what we're gonna take a look at\n\n78\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.020\nhow to configure and set up right now.\n\n79\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.190\nLet's go in and\nlet's take a look at our interface.\n\n80\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.045\nI've already gone ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:12.390\nused PowerShell just to install the DHCP\nserver role on our Server 16 server.\n\n82\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.090\nDid that just because it takes a few\nminutes to go through the installation\n\n83\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.010\nprocess.\n\n84\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.850\nYou can see the command right there,\nso you're not missing anything.\n\n85\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.010\nYou can see we were successful, but\nI just didn't wanna have to wait for\n\n86\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.060\nit to actually do the install, and quite\nhonestly it's not that exciting to watch.\n\n87\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.890\nSo I figured, what the heck,\n\n88\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.580\nwe'll just get it done and\nthat way we can already work with it.\n\n89\n00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.570\nBut you can see here Add-WindowsFeature,\n\n90\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.080\nwe've talked about the ability to use\nPowerShell to do a variety of things.\n\n91\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.520\nCertainly the old school way of doing\nthis, go into the Server Manager onsole,\n\n92\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.320\nthe MMC for Server Manager,\nthat would be this beautiful\n\n93\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.510\nlittle tool right here that we're\nprobably all familiar with.\n\n94\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.990\nCould we go to the manage area?\n\n95\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.400\nCould we go to roles and\nfeatures and install from there?\n\n96\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.260\nAbsolutely.\nWe can do that all day.\n\n97\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.600\nNo different than what I just did.\n\n98\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.769\nThe only difference is I just used\nPowerShell in order to drive that\n\n99\n00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:56.570\ninstallation.\n\n100\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.010\nSo we just went to PowerShell.\n\n101\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.966\nAdd Windows feature, gotta of course\nknow the name of the feature.\n\n102\n00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.258\nDHCP, no mystery there, pretty easy.\n\n103\n00:05:04.258 --> 00:05:07.507\nIt would be funny if it was called\nsomething like IP Addresses for sale or\n\n104\n00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.155\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n105\n00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:12.179\nOr like just because we're kidding\naround and it's not really that, but\n\n106\n00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.627\nit was like winds or non-winds or\nsomething really funny.\n\n107\n00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:15.545\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\nNon-winds.\n\n108\n00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:18.789\n&gt;&gt; It would be like non-winds or\nsomething crazy, but it is DHCP.\n\n109\n00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.285\nI then include Management Tools.\n\n110\n00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.386\nImportant parameter we wanna put in there,\n\n111\n00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:25.748\nadd in all the additional tools\nnecessary for us to fully manage this.\n\n112\n00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:28.916\nYou always wanna think about using\nthe include management tools item,\n\n113\n00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:32.155\nthe additional parameter there when\nyou do an install from PowerShell.\n\n114\n00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:33.930\nGives you the ability to\nnot have to go back and\n\n115\n00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.901\nworry about adding them after the fact,\nbut puts them all in there for you.\n\n116\n00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.370\nYou can see it was successful,\nsuccess true.\n\n117\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.184\nJust cutting that off there.\n\n118\n00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:43.016\nLet's just move that\nover just a little bit.\n\n119\n00:05:43.016 --> 00:05:46.480\nSuccess true, restart needed no,\ngood to know.\n\n120\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.041\nExit code success, what was installed,\nwe got everything there.\n\n121\n00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:50.194\nSo that's good to know.\n\n122\n00:05:50.194 --> 00:05:51.292\nSo we have that.\n\n123\n00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:53.123\nSo now that we've got that installed,\n\n124\n00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:56.520\nlet's go over here to our server manager\njust where we were a minute ago.\n\n125\n00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.703\nLet's go over here to Tools and\nwe can go to DCHP.\n\n126\n00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:03.317\nNow just so\nyou know by the way before I load this up.\n\n127\n00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:05.439\nIf you're using PowerShell\nthe way I did and\n\n128\n00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.936\nyou're in the habit of doing that\nwith the Server Manager Console open,\n\n129\n00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:12.144\nyou do the install, which you may\nnotice as you come back here, and\n\n130\n00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:16.043\nalthough DHCP did install whatever the\nparticular role or feature or whatever it\n\n131\n00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:19.610\nmay be that you were installing was,\nit may not show you in the list here.\n\n132\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.460\nRemember, you've gotta refresh this\nconsole like any other console.\n\n133\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.490\nAnd so,\nif you don't see what you are doing, but\n\n134\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.820\nyou know it was successful, don't be\nafraid to come up here and hit Refresh.\n\n135\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.200\nThat will load the item in here on the\nleft to make sure it is substantiated and\n\n136\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.230\nthat it is set up and indeed you would\nhave to do that if you had Server Manager\n\n137\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.310\nopen and it didn't show up.\n\n138\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.060\nJust so you know just in case that\nhappens to you in the real world.\n\n139\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.070\nYou don't wanna panic.\nIt is there,\n\n140\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.312\njust that it doesn't always\nshow up the first time, so\n\n141\n00:06:41.312 --> 00:06:43.482\nyou have got to refresh to\nmake sure it is available.\n\n142\n00:06:43.482 --> 00:06:47.030\nLet's hit DHCP and we'll open this up.\n\n143\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.378\nJust one second there.\n\n144\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.585\nTry this one more time, but this time\nlet's try without actually, okay.\n\n145\n00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:56.341\nWe're getting our-\n&gt;&gt; Clipboard.\n\n146\n00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:56.846\nIs that what that is?\n\n147\n00:06:56.846 --> 00:06:58.244\n&gt;&gt; Our clipboard, yeah.\n\n148\n00:06:58.244 --> 00:07:01.477\nAll right, let's try this, there we go.\n\n149\n00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:04.973\nOkay, yeah we're just getting our, hey we\nwanna copy something clipboard function.\n\n150\n00:07:04.973 --> 00:07:06.742\nI'm not sure why that's coming up.\n\n151\n00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:09.341\nAll right, so we're probably gonna get two\nconsoles cuz I tried to open it twice.\n\n152\n00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:10.368\nBut we'll deal with that.\n\n153\n00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:10.965\nNo big deal.\n\n154\n00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:14.077\nSo let's just move this over\nhere just a little bit so\n\n155\n00:07:14.077 --> 00:07:16.359\nthat we can see what's going on here.\n\n156\n00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.841\nYou'll see our [INAUDIBLE] in this case\nSA01 name of the machine.practicelabs.com.\n\n157\n00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.870\nSo our fully qualified domain name for\nthe machine.\n\n158\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.175\nDHCP, just click here and\nyou'll see we have IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n159\n00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:31.828\nIt's probably almost impossible for\nyou to see it's really really tiny but\n\n160\n00:07:31.828 --> 00:07:33.570\nthere is a little circle here.\n\n161\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.660\nThe red arrow or red dot on the edge\nof the IPv4 and IPv6 server.\n\n162\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.540\nIf we go full screen, it may be a little\nbit more obvious to you if we do that for\n\n163\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.400\njust a second.\n\n164\n00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.102\nWhat this is showing us right here and\nright here is that\n\n165\n00:07:46.102 --> 00:07:50.717\nthe DHCP server service has\nnot been authorized yet.\n\n166\n00:07:50.717 --> 00:07:54.920\nWe haven't gone in and authorized our\nserver allowing us to be able to or\n\n167\n00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.402\nenabling us To be able to go in and say\nthis server will legitimately be able to\n\n168\n00:07:59.402 --> 00:08:02.430\nprovide services in\nthe active directory domain.\n\n169\n00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.181\nWe are domain integrated\nhere as you can see.\n\n170\n00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:08.555\nAnd as a result,\nwe do have a need to go in.\n\n171\n00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:11.920\nAnd we do have to manage and\nauthorize this server.\n\n172\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.210\nIt's the very first thing\nthat we're gonna do.\n\n173\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.040\nSo what we're going to do here,\nlet's come up here to the DHCP node.\n\n174\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.720\nJust the very top of the console.\n\n175\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.700\nManage authorized servers, click there.\n\n176\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.960\nYou'll notice we have, center this for\nyou so you can see it.\n\n177\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.470\nOur manage authorized\nservers dialogue box.\n\n178\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.820\nWe have the name of\nthe authorized server there.\n\n179\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.180\nAnd we have to click Authorize, right,\nso we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n180\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.270\nAnd then you'll see we can type in\nthe name of the server that we wanna\n\n181\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.260\nauthorize.\n\n182\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.400\nIf we have to authorize another server,\nright, or whatever it is.\n\n183\n00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.500\nWe'll just type that in just to\nshow you how this would be done.\n\n184\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.723\nSo we could go in, and\nwe can specify, you know whatever,\n\n185\n00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:55.135\nlet's says 192, 168, 05 or\nwhatever it would be.\n\n186\n00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:56.366\nJust type something in there.\n\n187\n00:08:56.366 --> 00:09:00.190\nWe would then go ahead, we would hit OK,\nand we would be set to go.\n\n188\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.010\nSo you're just gonna authorize,\ntype that in, hit OK.\n\n189\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.992\nAnd then you'll be able to go ahead.\n\n190\n00:09:04.992 --> 00:09:07.590\nAnd you'll be able to have\nthat system authorized.\n\n191\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.780\nNow, wanna unauthorize a server, just go\nahead and unauthorize it, I could do that.\n\n192\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.610\nAnd then, just go ahead,\nwe'll close here for one second.\n\n193\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.200\nI'll reauthorize it in just one second.\n\n194\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.790\nSo let's just go ahead,\ndo the following here real quick.\n\n195\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.470\nAnd let's refresh, all right,\nnow you'll see here I can come in and\n\n196\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.470\nI can also authorize right from\nhere because I'm on the server.\n\n197\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.940\nI can do it from either place, right.\n\n198\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.780\nDoesn't really matter if I do it here\ngoes out and authorizes it for me.\n\n199\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.230\nI don't have to go through to\nbother of having to do the wizard.\n\n200\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.260\nIt'll just come out and\nauthorize it either way.\n\n201\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.680\nSo I can specify additional systems.\n\n202\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.210\nThe difference between the two up there,\n\n203\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.970\njust the reason I wanted\nto point it out to you.\n\n204\n00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.120\nI can actually add additional servers and\nmanage them from the console.\n\n205\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.810\nOr authorize them outside\nof the one I'm using here.\n\n206\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.420\nOr I can just authorize\nthis instance either way.\n\n207\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.980\nSo I can go in and authorize this.\n\n208\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.842\nAnd once I've done this,\nyou'll see now, it may be hard to see.\n\n209\n00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:03.316\nBut it changed to green, it's a little\ngreen circle there with a white check.\n\n210\n00:10:03.316 --> 00:10:05.000\nSo you can see it's been authorized now.\n\n211\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.690\nAnd there we go,\nyou can kind of see it there.\n\n212\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.548\nAnd then when I click there,\nyou'll see it also goes green on the IPv6.\n\n213\n00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.220\nIndicating that we are authorized and\nwe are now able to go ahead.\n\n214\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.638\nAnd we're able to actually\noperate the system.\n\n215\n00:10:16.638 --> 00:10:18.877\nAnd start to use it to\nprovide IP addresses,\n\n216\n00:10:18.877 --> 00:10:20.640\nwhatever else we're going to do.\n\n217\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.810\nSo it is important for us to go in and\nensure that we are authorized.\n\n218\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.530\nVery important for us to do that.\n\n219\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.602\nKeep in mind that we can do that\neither with an IP address or\n\n220\n00:10:29.602 --> 00:10:32.036\na fully qualified domain\nname from up above.\n\n221\n00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:33.920\nOr right-click on the specific instance.\n\n222\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.242\nThe named instance as I showed you here.\n\n223\n00:10:36.242 --> 00:10:41.001\nAuthorize, goes out, figures out that the\nmachine is available, is in the domain,\n\n224\n00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:43.064\nis an authorized computer account.\n\n225\n00:10:43.064 --> 00:10:45.870\nAnd can then be granted that right and\nwe give it to that.\n\n226\n00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.410\nNow, remember when we\ninstall the DHCP server\n\n227\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.690\nonto a machine that's\na member of the domain.\n\n228\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.650\nAnd so that's why we're authorizing\nagainst the Active Directory.\n\n229\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.277\nIf this was a standalone machine that was\nnot in the domain we wouldn't be able to\n\n230\n00:10:57.277 --> 00:10:57.992\nauthorize it.\n\n231\n00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:00.680\nBecause there would be nothing to\nauthorize it against, just so you know.\n\n232\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.090\nDo you have a question or\nsomething you wanted to ask-\n\n233\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.673\n&gt;&gt; I was just saying it's nice that you're\n\n234\n00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:04.612\nshowing how to do this.\n\n235\n00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.889\nBecause I've actually had to\ndo this via PowerShell and\n\n236\n00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.266\ndidn't have the luxury of the GUI here.\n\n237\n00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:14.321\nBut for instance,\nlike with migrating DHCP, the role,\n\n238\n00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:19.404\nif you have an interim or auxiliary\nDHCP server during that migration.\n\n239\n00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:23.384\nThat's an important step that you need\nto do to go ahead and decommission or\n\n240\n00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:26.116\ndeactivate one before\npointing to that other one.\n\n241\n00:11:26.116 --> 00:11:27.830\nAnd just kind of keeping that in mind.\n\n242\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.277\nI don't know what maintenance would\nbe a good explanation of why we would\n\n243\n00:11:31.277 --> 00:11:36.197\ndeauthorize and decommission-\n&gt;&gt; Why we would deauthorize or\n\n244\n00:11:36.197 --> 00:11:38.500\ndecommission, because\nthey're two separate steps.\n\n245\n00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.650\nWe could deauthorize, but\nnot necessarily decommission.\n\n246\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.180\nIn other words, you saw me just in\ntheory unauthorize or deauthorize and\n\n247\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.880\nreauthorize the servers to demonstrate\nthe process- But I didn't decommission it-\n\n248\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Very invasive.\n\n249\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.246\n&gt;&gt; I just simply deauthorized it meaning\nI said, hey, it's not available.\n\n250\n00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:57.110\nAnd not allowed to be used to lease\naddresses but I didn't decommission it.\n\n251\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.720\nDecommissioning implies we're\ntaking down the server.\n\n252\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.560\nMost likely exporting the database if\nwe want to keep track of what we did.\n\n253\n00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.510\nAnd perhaps migrated as you were\ntalk about or added somewhere else.\n\n254\n00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.350\nWe'll talk about those steps in\nsome upcoming episodes around\n\n255\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.870\nhow we deal with the life cycle of DHCP.\n\n256\n00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.808\nBut decommissioning would involve,\ntypically,\n\n257\n00:12:14.808 --> 00:12:17.274\nif this is a physical infrastructure box.\n\n258\n00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:19.420\nAnd many these days, more often than not,\nprobably be virtual right?\n\n259\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.660\nSo may not have the old school,\nold thought process of\n\n260\n00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.450\nare we gonna decommission cuz\nthe hardware is just really old.\n\n261\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.610\nBecause virtual machines you don't\nnecessarily have to decommission them\n\n262\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.260\nbecause of aging out of\nthe infrastructure pool.\n\n263\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.694\nBut traditionally,\nif we were decommissioning.\n\n264\n00:12:34.694 --> 00:12:36.840\nIt would be because we want\nto take that instance down.\n\n265\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.990\nDo away with it or somehow consolidate it,\ndo something else with it.\n\n266\n00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.970\nDeauthorizing may simply be that we wanna\ndeauthorize or prevent that system from\n\n267\n00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.990\nbeing able to lease addresses for a period\nof time due to any number of reasons.\n\n268\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.360\nAnd then we're gonna\nreactivate it at some point.\n\n269\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.182\nBut not fully stand it down and\nessentially uninstall and\n\n270\n00:12:53.182 --> 00:12:55.078\ntake apart the DHCP infrastructure.\n\n271\n00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:56.220\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, yes.\n\n272\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.290\n&gt;&gt; So do want to differentiate those two,\nvery important.\n\n273\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.010\nRight, so we've gone ahead,\nwe've stood up our DHCP server.\n\n274\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.750\nWe do have our IPv4 and or IPv6 interface.\n\n275\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.260\nWe're gonna focus on IPv4 for the moment.\n\n276\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.738\nIn an upcoming conversation, we'll take\na look at, or upcoming conversations,\n\n277\n00:13:12.738 --> 00:13:13.346\nI should say.\n\n278\n00:13:13.346 --> 00:13:17.800\nWe'll talk about DHCP version 6 server and\nhow that differentiates here.\n\n279\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.930\nWe'll also talk about IPv6\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n280\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.615\nBut for the moment let's talk about IPv4.\n\n281\n00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:25.080\nAnd so down here on IPv4,\nfirst thing we're gonna do.\n\n282\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.332\nAnd they're nice enough to tell us,\nhey why don't you add a scope, right.\n\n283\n00:13:28.332 --> 00:13:30.748\nBecause we really can't\ndo anything with DHCP.\n\n284\n00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:35.593\nUnless we actually provide an address\npool for us to scope as an address pool,\n\n285\n00:13:35.593 --> 00:13:40.270\nfor us to provide IP addresses out of,\nand then provide scope options.\n\n286\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.740\nThat can be then used to\nassign further elements.\n\n287\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.770\nThe domain controller or, excuse me,\n\n288\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.420\nthe DNS server, the domain,\nthe default gateway.\n\n289\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.080\nKeep saying, I want to say domain gateway.\n\n290\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.390\nThe default gateway, the subnet mask.\n\n291\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.160\nAll that kind of stuff that we'd\nwant to provide, so first thing-\n\n292\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of reservations,\n\n293\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.930\nany kind of reservations?\n\n294\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.000\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of reservations,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.220\nWe'll put all that in here.\n\n296\n00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.780\nWe have a new set of items called DHCP\npolicies that are available to us here.\n\n297\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.590\nWe'll talk more about those and\ntake a look at those in a while.\n\n298\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.640\nBut let's start over here with IPv4.\n\n299\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.140\nYou'll notice we can just right-click,\ncreate a scope.\n\n300\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.010\nSo let's just go in and\n\n301\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.410\ndo that first, have a little\nwelcome to the new scope wizard.\n\n302\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.310\nMove this over just so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n303\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.590\nSo we'll go here,\nwe're gonna give our scope a name.\n\n304\n00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:30.452\nSo let's call this our PLABSA01 scope.\n\n305\n00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:35.060\nWe'll call it scope1 just to keep track\nof it so we know what scope it is.\n\n306\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.720\nProbably put a description in there\nif we want to do that as well, right.\n\n307\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.520\nSo something like demo scope 1.\n\n308\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.270\nNow in the real world,\n\n309\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.694\nwe would probably do something a little\nbit more meaningful like desktop scope or\n\n310\n00:14:47.694 --> 00:14:53.249\nRemote office user scope or\nsomething that tells us what the scope is.\n\n311\n00:14:53.249 --> 00:14:56.020\nSo we know what those IP addresses\nare going to be used for, right?\n\n312\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.150\nSo you'd want to do that,\nso we'll click Next.\n\n313\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.561\nWe then have to specify a start and\nend IP range here.\n\n314\n00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:05.048\nSo we obviously have to know what IP\naddress block we're going to be working\n\n315\n00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:08.040\nwith, what class, and\nwhat portion of that.\n\n316\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.324\nSo we'll do 192.168.0.50 for\nour starting IP address.\n\n317\n00:15:13.324 --> 00:15:17.573\nAnd notice, when I click there,\nI just hit the Tab key.\n\n318\n00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:19.276\nIt automatically goes down and\n\n319\n00:15:19.276 --> 00:15:22.620\nfills in the settings that will\npropagate out to the client.\n\n320\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.080\nPuts in the length for the subnet mask and\nputs in the default class C subnet mask.\n\n321\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.240\nReads the IP address,\nautomatically understands what that is.\n\n322\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.010\nProvides it there as a result,\nso it's nice.\n\n323\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.710\nSo we can modify that, of course,\nbut it provides it for us.\n\n324\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.590\nOne less thing we got\nto worry about doing.\n\n325\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:44.007\nSo 192.168, let's do 0.100.\n\n326\n00:15:44.007 --> 00:15:47.375\nI'll just give it 50 addresses that we can\nwork with in the pool there for the scope.\n\n327\n00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:50.791\nSo we've got all that.\n\n328\n00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:55.870\nWe'll leave our default subnet mask and\nour length.\n\n329\n00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.965\nThere click Next.\n\n330\n00:15:56.965 --> 00:15:59.031\nAre we gonna do any exclusions?\n\n331\n00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.672\nAre we gonna take any of those\nIP addresses out and say,\n\n332\n00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:05.866\nhey you know what even though I'm saying\n50 to a 100, maybe I wanna hold out 50,\n\n333\n00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:09.700\n51, and 52 for certain things,\nwho knows what they'll be used for.\n\n334\n00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.340\nSo I wanna exclude those IP addresses so\nI could offer an exclusion or\n\n335\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.160\na range of IP addresses that I wanna use.\n\n336\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.150\nSo I can view that, so\nI can put that in there if I need to.\n\n337\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.370\nWe can also, just go back here, we can\nalso do subnet delay in milliseconds here.\n\n338\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.115\nAnd the subnet delay is actually kind\nof interesting and important because\n\n339\n00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.742\nwhat the delay does, and we haven't\ntalked about the actual four-step\n\n340\n00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:36.740\nprocess to request and actually get an IP\naddress as a client from a DHCP server.\n\n341\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.080\nWe're gonna go through\nthat in just a moment.\n\n342\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.760\nYou may or\nmay not be familiar with the DHCP system.\n\n343\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.890\nDORA and ROSA who we often talk about.\n\n344\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.820\nBut we're gonna talk about\nthem in just a minute.\n\n345\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.110\nBut in that process one of the things that\nwe find is that when we go a head and\n\n346\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.890\nwe get to step two, whether we use\nthe pneumonic DORA, D-O-R-A, discover,\n\n347\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.480\noffer, request, acknowledge.\n\n348\n00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.490\nOr ROSA, request, offer,\nselect and acknowledge.\n\n349\n00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.210\nHowever, we go through\nthat thought process and\n\n350\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.460\nidentify those four stages,\nstage two is always DHCP offer.\n\n351\n00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.220\nAnd you'll see here,\n\n352\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.190\na delay in the time duration by which a\nserver would delay transmission of a DHCP\n\n353\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.740\noffer, message is what the subnet\ndelayed milliseconds will be.\n\n354\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.470\nYou got to keep in mind\nthis is milliseconds, so\n\n355\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.260\nsetting a 30 value there is 30\nmilliseconds not 30 seconds.\n\n356\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.450\nWe sometimes will load that\ndelay in to deal with or\n\n357\n00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.355\noffset either traffic conditions,\nor concerns we have about routing,\n\n358\n00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:33.730\nand/or to provide just a buffer, so\nthat maybe certain applications require\n\n359\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.080\na certain amount of time to do things,\nand there may have to be delay built in.\n\n360\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.680\nThere are reasons why we may use this so\njust keep in mind that we can actually\n\n361\n00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.300\nspecify a delay here to deal with\nthe second stage in the four-step process\n\n362\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:51.660\nas we do the actual walk-through of\na client requesting a DHCP address.\n\n363\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.700\nSo that's what this particular\ntime value is, just so you know.\n\n364\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.600\nWe can put in our lease duration.\n\n365\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.120\nEight days by default has been\nthe Microsoft default for some time now.\n\n366\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.120\nWe can modify that of course,\nbut it's up to us to decide.\n\n367\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.530\nEight days,\ndo you know how many hours that is?\n\n368\n00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.992\n&gt;&gt; I don't know off the top of my head,\nthere you go.\n\n369\n00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:11.790\n&gt;&gt; You're supposed to know those things.\n\n370\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.445\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's 24 hours times 8, right, so\n\n371\n00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:17.020\nwe got 160 and 32,\n192 hours by default, right?\n\n372\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.540\nSo we think of it as\nan eight day lease duration.\n\n373\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.990\nWe see it here, but the system actually,\nis going through that and\n\n374\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.770\ntranslating that into hours and minutes.\n\n375\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.320\nAnd we're thinking about that\nas a total all up value.\n\n376\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.130\nThe reason it's important to\nthink about this is twofold.\n\n377\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.920\nNumber one, we do have to know the maximum\nvalue of our lease, so that way,\n\n378\n00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.700\nwe know that IP addresses will be\navailable for, in this case, eight days.\n\n379\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.840\nBut, we also have to know that\nat half TTL, half that value,\n\n380\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.140\na client will automatically\nattempt to renew its lease\n\n381\n00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.900\nfirst time it connects to\nthe DHCP server to do so.\n\n382\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.381\nAssuming it's successful,\nit will renew the lease and\n\n383\n00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:52.197\ncontinue to keep the IP address,\nright, and extend its time.\n\n384\n00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:57.782\nIf it fails at 50% TTL, 87.5% TTL, right.\n\n385\n00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:00.728\nSo we're gonna go through,\nand seven-eighths,\n\n386\n00:19:00.728 --> 00:19:05.728\n87.5 is essentially seven-eighths of\nthe total value in this case at 50% ETL,\n\n387\n00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:09.430\nor four days would be the first try for\nthe client to renew.\n\n388\n00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.054\nIf it is successful, great no big deal.\n\n389\n00:19:11.054 --> 00:19:15.780\nIf it's not, we step back, continue\nusing that address at seven eights,\n\n390\n00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.770\n87.5% and/or 7 days in,\n1 day left, 24 hours to go.\n\n391\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.370\nWe'll try to renew again.\n\n392\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:26.450\nIf we're successful, great, it'll probably\nextend our lease, we keep the IP address.\n\n393\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.000\nBut if we're still unsuccessful for\n\n394\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.800\nany number of reasons, traffic management,\ncongestion, failure of path.\n\n395\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.750\nWhatever it may be,\nwe can't get to the DHCP server.\n\n396\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.885\nThen, that’ll count down to zero, when\nthat hits zero, that being the time to\n\n397\n00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:44.250\nleave the TTL value down to zero, then,\nyou know what’s gonna happen then, right?\n\n398\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.450\nWhat happens at that point?\n\n399\n00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Then, if you hit that T2 timer and\nthen you finally surpass that and\n\n400\n00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.480\nyou exceed your complete duration.\n\n401\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.420\nYou relinquish that IP address back into\nthat available pool of IP addresses, so\n\n402\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.610\nthe DHCP server will essentially\nabsorb it back into its available and\n\n403\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.140\ncould potentially lease\nit out to someone else.\n\n404\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.320\n&gt;&gt; It could.\nYou're absolutely right, and\n\n405\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.620\nthen what would happen to that client?\n\n406\n00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.810\nWould they, obviously now no\nlonger having that IP address.\n\n407\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.100\nHypothetically let's just\nsay it was 10005 right?\n\n408\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.480\nSo if that was the IP we take it back.\n\n409\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.580\nIt no longer has that.\n\n410\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.500\nDoes the client go to all zeroes?\n\n411\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.080\nDoes it get a different kind of address?\n\n412\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.810\nWhat would happen with it at that point?\n\n413\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.060\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, the client should\nhave obtained APIPA address so\n\n414\n00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.370\nthat it can still communicate\nwith our DHCP server\n\n415\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.490\nto perform a request whenever\nit decides to log on.\n\n416\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.400\n&gt;&gt; You like saying that word right?\n\n417\n00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.560\nSo much fun APIPA, right,\nthat's a cool little word to say.\n\n418\n00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.160\n&gt;&gt; It is a cool word.\n\n419\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.210\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee's absolutely right.\n\n420\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.760\nAnd we talked about\nAPIPA in prior episodes.\n\n421\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.820\nIt will get an automatic\nprivate IP address in the,\n\n422\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.880\nI'm thinking the first two subnet blocks?\n\n423\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.521\n&gt;&gt; Scope?\n\n424\n00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:42.516\n&gt;&gt; Yes, scope.\n\n425\n00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:43.266\n&gt;&gt; In the class B address range?\n\n426\n00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:44.324\n&gt;&gt; In the class B, right, of?\n\n427\n00:20:44.324 --> 00:20:48.162\n&gt;&gt; 169.254 dot whatever dot whatever.\n\n428\n00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:49.092\n&gt;&gt; Something, something,\nit doesn't matter, right,\n\n429\n00:20:49.092 --> 00:20:49.910\nwhatever it'll be, absolutely.\n\n430\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.492\nSo we're gonna get APIPA address\nin 169.254 something, something.\n\n431\n00:20:52.492 --> 00:20:58.230\n01, 05, 200.200, doesn't matter what,\nit'll be in that range.\n\n432\n00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.190\nAnd then we'll bind, it being the client,\nwe'll bind that IP address.\n\n433\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.650\nThat IP address is given to it\nlocally by it's network interface and\n\n434\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.620\nthe TCP IP stack on the machine, meaning\nit is not able to talk to the DHCP.\n\n435\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.610\nThat's what caused us to get into\nthis whole issue in the first place.\n\n436\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.980\nSo we don't need to be talking to DHCP\nto be able to get in APIPA address.\n\n437\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.600\nJust wanna make that clear to everybody.\n\n438\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.970\nWe get that based on our\ninability to talk to DHCP.\n\n439\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.752\nOur inability to bind and\nrenew a valid IP address.\n\n440\n00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:29.138\nSo that local and that happens regardless\nof connectivity, and then once we get that\n\n441\n00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:33.546\naddress, we stay connected to the IP\nsubnet or in this case the LAN on 169254.\n\n442\n00:21:33.546 --> 00:21:37.630\nNot usable to go out and\nroute and get to the internet.\n\n443\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.630\nBut usable to connect to\nthe network locally and\n\n444\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.210\ntry to get back to that DHCP server.\n\n445\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.310\nWe do that five minutes by default,\n\n446\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.160\nevery five minutes to try to hit that\nDHCP server and try to get that.\n\n447\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.420\nIf we power down and power back up,\nwe check on power up and\n\n448\n00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.890\nstart up automatically.\n\n449\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.210\nSo we're gonna be essentially going out\nand trawling trying to get to that DHCP\n\n450\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.860\nserver to renew that lease, and hopefully\nget one at some point eventually.\n\n451\n00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.180\n&gt;&gt; And you keep saying locally.\n\n452\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.970\nAnd it just sparked my memory.\n\n453\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.970\nI wasn't thinking in the prior episode.\n\n454\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.830\nBut link local is that term that a lot\nof other operating systems use for\n\n455\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.700\nthat same concept there.\n\n456\n00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Link local address is what you're,\nyes, correct.\n\n457\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.060\nAll right, so I just hit Next on that,\n\n458\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.440\ndo we now wanna configure DHCP options,\nright?\n\n459\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.380\nSo yes, I wanna configure these options.\n\n460\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.530\nNow remember, we talked about this, scope\noptions allow us to specify additional\n\n461\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.630\nitems that may be of interest to us.\n\n462\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.180\nDomain, information like\na default gateway, DNS servers,\n\n463\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.970\nthings of that nature, DNS prefixes, all\nsort of stuff we may wanna specify there.\n\n464\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.750\nSo, let’s go in, let’s go ahead and\nsay yes, I will configure.\n\n465\n00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.370\nNow, if we say no, by the way,\nwe could do this after the fact,\n\n466\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.060\nI'll show you when we go and\nedit these once we're done,\n\n467\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.540\nbut we could always go in and\nedit these after the fact and add them in.\n\n468\n00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.690\nIt's no big deal, it's just that we may\nwanna do this as part of the initial\n\n469\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.360\nsetup of the scope, right.\n\n470\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.470\nSo we have our router,\nour default gateway.\n\n471\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.810\nWe could go in and program in our\ndefault gateway, so we could do that.\n\n472\n00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.340\nWe could go in and specify our DNS,\ndomain and DNS servers.\n\n473\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.040\nSo our parent domain practicelabs.com,\nyou can see there.\n\n474\n00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.490\nWe do see that.\n\n475\n00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.190\nAnd we do see 192 168 01.\n\n476\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.300\nOur corresponding IP address for\nour DNS server is already there.\n\n477\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.060\nSo we can go in and\nspecify additional ones if necessary.\n\n478\n00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.010\nWe also, believe it or not,\nstill have the ability even here.\n\n479\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.375\nAll these decades later we\ncan still use WINS, right.\n\n480\n00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:28.550\nSo we still the name resolution\nservice that refuses to die.\n\n481\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.160\nIt is like the DOS command shell\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Of the Windows world,\n\n483\n00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.360\nexcept its a networking service, right.\n\n484\n00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.790\nBecause, WINS, we've been talking\nabout the fact that for years,\n\n485\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.130\nwe in theory could be able to get rid of\nnet bios name revolution services, right.\n\n486\n00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.140\nWINS is what that represents\nwhen it's internet.\n\n487\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.520\nName service, right?\n\n488\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.430\nUser friendly based names,\nNetBIOS space names, that we would use.\n\n489\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.990\nAnd while we still have this capability,\nit's really still lingering because of\n\n490\n00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.045\nbackwards compatibility for\ncertain applications that require it.\n\n491\n00:23:55.045 --> 00:23:58.533\nNot because any of the modern\noperating systems like Server 16,\n\n492\n00:23:58.533 --> 00:24:02.220\nWindows 10 on the client side,\netc., would require it natively.\n\n493\n00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.686\nQuite the opposite So we really don't\nuse it for anything, anymore at all.\n\n494\n00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:08.670\nBut they're may be backwards compatible\nissues or interoperability that they turn\n\n495\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.698\nyou off and you're referring to\nthe same issue that are out there\n\n496\n00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:15.495\noutstanding that we would have to\naccommodate them so it is good to know.\n\n497\n00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:18.515\nRight, that it's still there and\nif we do need it, we can use it.\n\n498\n00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:22.095\nI'm hoping that when we're back together\nseveral years from now and talking\n\n499\n00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:26.495\nabout Server 2025 that perhaps by then, it\nmay have done its swan song and it's gone.\n\n500\n00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:28.232\nBut who knows, we never know.\n\n501\n00:24:28.232 --> 00:24:29.752\nFor sure what will happen here.\n\n502\n00:24:29.752 --> 00:24:31.982\nBut for now we could still see it.\n\n503\n00:24:31.982 --> 00:24:33.702\nI'm gonna date myself after remember\n\n504\n00:24:34.862 --> 00:24:38.472\nconfiguring wins back in\nthe day in Windows NT 4.\n\n505\n00:24:38.472 --> 00:24:42.850\nI mean that's how long it's been\naround I can't say that, but-\n\n506\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.680\n&gt;&gt; No, you could not say that,\n\n507\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.900\nyou would not be that old.\n\n508\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.420\nThere's no way you could be that old,\nright?\n\n509\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.760\nBut I can be, because you see this right\nhere, this color right here, all white?\n\n510\n00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.420\nThis should be dark if I was not that old,\nand\n\n511\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.740\nthat is my natural hair color, by the way.\n\n512\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.860\nThat is really white.\n\n513\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.450\n&gt;&gt; I can't say the same for this either.\n\n514\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.370\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't implying that.\n\n515\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.890\nI was not going to say\nanything about that.\n\n516\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.670\nI was simply saying that\nI don't color it so\n\n517\n00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.360\nyou could see exactly how old I really am.\n\n518\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.470\nAll right, I am ancient, as they say.\n\n519\n00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.280\nLong in the tooth.\n\n520\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.500\nSo Win Server, we're gonna click Next.\n\n521\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.820\nNow, we didn't specify any options here\nand there were only three, by the way,\n\n522\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.670\nwe could do in this wizard.\n\n523\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.890\nThere are many more of them But\nwe have to go and\n\n524\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.140\nedit it separately in\norder to get to those.\n\n525\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.430\nThese are just the three most common ones\nthat we often will throw in with DHCP.\n\n526\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:30.240\nOur default gateway, our routed interface,\nin other words for external access.\n\n527\n00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.730\nOur DNS Servers and domain name.\n\n528\n00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.690\nAnd if necessary, our [INAUDIBLE]\neverything else will be programmed in\n\n529\n00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.270\nseparately outside of the wizard.\n\n530\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.980\nWe do have more options for more stuff.\n\n531\n00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.220\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll say yeah,\nwe want to activate the scope.\n\n532\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.230\nNow if we do that,\nwe'll begin to able to lease.\n\n533\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.940\nIf we don't, we'll obviously\nthen be able to go ahead and\n\n534\n00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.190\nactivate it after the fact.\n\n535\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.640\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nsay yes, just go ahead and\n\n536\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.130\nfinish this up here real quick, and\nwe'll notice we got a brand new folder\n\n537\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.200\nthat opened up here Just create them,\nand move that over.\n\n538\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.980\nYou can see it right over here, because\nsee it does say active demo scope one, and\n\n539\n00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.340\nour scope is there.\n\n540\n00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.060\nAnd if we open that up,\n\n541\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.780\nyou'll see we have our address pool,\naddress leases, reservations, those things\n\n542\n00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.060\nthat I talked about that give us the\nability to sign IP addresses statically.\n\n543\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.170\nYou can reserve them for\nsomebody with a MAC address so\n\n544\n00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.990\nwe could say yeah this machine when\nit shows up will get this IP address.\n\n545\n00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.830\nOur scope options,\n\n546\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.460\nthat's where we are going to go an take\na look at our other options if we\n\n547\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.670\nchoose to do that.\n\n548\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.290\nAnd then our policies, as we talked about.\n\n549\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.180\nSo our address for right here,\nyou can see is active, 50 to 100.\n\n550\n00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.910\nIt's the address range\nwe're using to distribute.\n\n551\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.600\nOur leases currently, right.\n\n552\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.030\nYou'll see 0, 50 was given out right here.\n\n553\n00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.150\nThis is the first one that was active and\ngiven out.\n\n554\n00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.160\nWe have a client out there,\nin other words, a Windows 10 machine\n\n555\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.220\nthat I have running as a VM,\nthat's running as a client set to DHCP.\n\n556\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.390\nSo as soon as I set this up,\nit went ahead and grabbed an IP address.\n\n557\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.490\nAnd we could see an active\nlease right there.\n\n558\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.970\nIf we go look at that,\nwe would see the information,\n\n559\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.700\nwhatever the scope options\nare that would be available.\n\n560\n00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.990\nWe have reservations.\n\n561\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.940\nI don't have any reservations here.\n\n562\n00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.000\nI can create one if I want to.\n\n563\n00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.280\nAnd then, scope options I said we could\ngo in and look at the existing options.\n\n564\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:08.370\nYou can see them there, our DNS server,\nour DNS domain name, option 006 is our DNS\n\n565\n00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.755\nserver, option 015, all the options have\nnumber as identifiers as well as names.\n\n566\n00:27:13.755 --> 00:27:16.555\nImportant to know that, and\nyou will see them here.\n\n567\n00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:19.725\nDNS domain names would be a good idea for\nyou, and\n\n568\n00:27:19.725 --> 00:27:22.145\nI did go to the trouble of\nputting together a little,\n\n569\n00:27:22.145 --> 00:27:25.667\nhey let's take a look at all\nour option code lists For you.\n\n570\n00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:27.247\nWould be good for\nyou to know what these are.\n\n571\n00:27:27.247 --> 00:27:28.827\nYou are expected to know them.\n\n572\n00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:31.337\nNow the realities if you're dealing\nwith DHCP on a regular basis,\n\n573\n00:27:31.337 --> 00:27:35.557\nyou probably know the common ones,\nzero three is our router, zero six is DNS.\n\n574\n00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:40.037\nAs you can see, zero one is our subnet\nmask, fifteen our domain name, but\n\n575\n00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:42.317\nthere are many others, as I pointed out,\nyou can see them here,\n\n576\n00:27:42.317 --> 00:27:45.137\nas I scroll down and\nyou may not know some of these.\n\n577\n00:27:45.137 --> 00:27:47.430\nAnd so,\nas a result Would be a good idea for\n\n578\n00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:52.590\nyou to go through and take a look at these\n&gt;&gt; There's our little T1 and\n\n579\n00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.230\nT2 timers we were just\ntalking about as well.\n\n580\n00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.380\n&gt;&gt; You mentioned that, absolutely.\n\n581\n00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.240\nSo you see them there.\n\n582\n00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.150\nAll right so,\nthat's our T1 which is the 50% timer.\n\n583\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:05.580\nCherokee called it a T2 timer, but\nwe generically just say 50% TTL as you\n\n584\n00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.620\nheard me say already, 7.5% or 7HTTL but\nformally which she rightly identified.\n\n585\n00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.100\nWe actually, in our documentation,\n\n586\n00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.980\nformally, will call them Renewal (T1) or\nRenewal Timer 1, Renewal Timer 2,\n\n587\n00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.090\nor Rebinding, sometimes,\nis what you often see.\n\n588\n00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.950\nAnd that's just the two items,\nthe 50% and-or the 87.5.\n\n589\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.390\nSo, you can see those there.\n\n590\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.220\nLease time,\nour total amount of lease time, option 51.\n\n591\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.350\nNetBIOS scope ID, if you're using WINS.\n\n592\n00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.150\nYou'll have to specify some of that stuff.\n\n593\n00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.540\nSo what would be good for\nyou to take a look.\n\n594\n00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.280\nthis is a word document included for\nyou in the show notes.\n\n595\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.580\nMake sure you have that.\n\n596\n00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.370\nWe have a little handy chart for\nstudying and other purposes.\n\n597\n00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.670\nIt also makes a great\nairplane if you print it out.\n\n598\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.350\nFly it.\n\n599\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.710\nYou can say that you were able to take\nflight with your IP scope options.\n\n600\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.830\nAll right, so you'll see here\nif we want to configure options.\n\n601\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.450\nYou'll see I can right click\nhere configure options,\n\n602\n00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.590\nAll I get is a little pick list here.\n\n603\n00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.910\nReal simple to work with.\n\n604\n00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:03.360\nI check off the appropriate\noption whatever it may be and\n\n605\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.050\nI specify whatever that\nparticular item is.\n\n606\n00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.920\nSome as you can see like time offset\nare just gonna be the hex value.\n\n607\n00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.540\nOther's you can see here are gonna be\nyou know information we provide as an IP\n\n608\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.130\naddress whatever the case may be.\n\n609\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.640\nSo you add these, you apply them and\nthen they get added in here.\n\n610\n00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.320\nVery simple to do.\n\n611\n00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.040\nAll right.\n\n612\n00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.450\nSo we have that.\n\n613\n00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.870\nWe have our IP address lease.\n\n614\n00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.450\nLet's take a look while we're here.\n\n615\n00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.760\nAnd you'll see that I can delete\nthe lease, getting rid of it.\n\n616\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.540\nI can refresh just to make\nsure I see that it's active.\n\n617\n00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.920\nI can also add this to a reservation.\n\n618\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.710\nTake a lease that's been given out and\nmake it into a reservation, binding it\n\n619\n00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.800\npermanently for that client, and keeping\nit as a static IP grant if I choose to.\n\n620\n00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.060\nIt's up to me to decide how to do that.\n\n621\n00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.340\nI can also go in, and since we're here\nlet's just take a look at reservations.\n\n622\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.220\nI want to create a brand new reservation,\na new reservation, right-click and\n\n623\n00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.900\njust come on over here.\n\n624\n00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:58.910\nAnd I can give the resolution a name,\nIP res 1, or whatever it may be.\n\n625\n00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.840\nNotice the part of the IP block\nis already configured for me.\n\n626\n00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.770\nThe network portion, because,\nthe interfaces is smart enough to know hey\n\n627\n00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.530\nyou're gonna probably reserve\nit in the active pool.\n\n628\n00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.480\nAnd, the active pool's\nnetwork ID is 192.1.68.\n\n629\n00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.410\nSo we're gonna put that in.\n\n630\n00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.110\nBut, remember it's the individual unique\nhost IDs that we have to specify.\n\n631\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:21.080\nSo, that's why the second part of that\nis not gonna be there so if I do 0.,\n\n632\n00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:27.170\nlet's say 65 cuz out of my\nblock of 50 to 100 I can do 65.\n\n633\n00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.330\nI have to provide a Mac address here for\na client.\n\n634\n00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.030\nThis is how I reserve,\n\n635\n00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.490\nI reserve based on the MAC address because\nif you think about the logic of it But\n\n636\n00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.250\nthe only unique identifier that the client\nwould have, they don't have an IP address.\n\n637\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.760\nIt's gonna be the MAC address.\n\n638\n00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.290\nThat in theory, should be unique for\nevery interface.\n\n639\n00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.450\nRight now we can play games and\nwe talk that in security Discussions and\n\n640\n00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.790\nhacking discussions about the fact that\nwe have tools that let us modify and\n\n641\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.850\nspoof MAC addresses.\n\n642\n00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.430\nBut let's assume that's not happening,\nlet's just assume for\n\n643\n00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:01.310\na minute standard network,\neverybody has one MAC address per\n\n644\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.370\nnetwork interface minimally,\nwe could bind secondary ones.\n\n645\n00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.920\nVirtual environments, we do that.\n\n646\n00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.650\nBut let's assume for\na minute that just standard rules apply,\n\n647\n00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.150\nno crazy stuff going on.\n\n648\n00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.870\nYou have a network interface.\n\n649\n00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.350\nWe have a MAC address associated with it.\n\n650\n00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.210\nIt's unique.\n\n651\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.150\nWe would put it in here when we\ndo that and the client shows up.\n\n652\n00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.650\nWe're going to talk about this\nmultistep process right now.\n\n653\n00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.070\nWhen they show up to make a request for\n\n654\n00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.250\na DHCP sponsored address\nthey present as part of\n\n655\n00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.810\nthe packet that they sent they present\ntheir MAC address in the packet header.\n\n656\n00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.640\nWe can match that MAC address\nto the reservation list.\n\n657\n00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.040\nIf we see it, we automatically give\nthem whatever address is on file\n\n658\n00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.360\nbecause that's what's been\ndetermined that they will get.\n\n659\n00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.460\nSo this how we actually\ndeal with our reservations,\n\n660\n00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.990\nif we choose or need to create one.\n\n661\n00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:51.290\nAnd you'll see we have both DHCP And\nor BOOTP.\n\n662\n00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.339\nBOOTP is sometimes called\nthe Bootstrap Protocol.\n\n663\n00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:57.650\nBOOTP is used for network boots, so\nPXE booting for instance, right?\n\n664\n00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.499\nYour ever see the Broadway\nshow Kinky Boots?\n\n665\n00:31:59.499 --> 00:32:02.800\nNo, but from,\nyou may be able to expand on this.\n\n666\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.400\nThis protocol,\npicking yourself up by your boot straps.\n\n667\n00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.240\nThere was some kind of like, mid-century\nfilm, where they got this name from.\n\n668\n00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.920\nAm I totally off base here?\n\n669\n00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.080\nBut, that's what I've been told.\n\n670\n00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.700\n&gt;&gt; To name the boot strap\nprotocol you're talking about?\n\n671\n00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.280\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Or picking yourself up by your boot\n\n672\n00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.010\nstraps\n&gt;&gt; Picking yourself up by your boot\n\n673\n00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:24.400\nstraps, coming originally from of show,\ncinema if you will, right.\n\n674\n00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.620\n&gt;&gt; Well the concepts of\nbootstraps actually come from,\n\n675\n00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:32.010\nVictorian era probably, Elizabethan era\nI would guess, somewhere in that range.\n\n676\n00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:36.500\nGentleman and ladies both, but especially\ngentleman if they were of a certain class,\n\n677\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.190\nwould have you know the big boots.\n\n678\n00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.630\nThey would pull them on, but\n\n679\n00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.060\nthey would have little straps that\nthey would use to actually bring.\n\n680\n00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Without assistance.\n\n681\n00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.500\n&gt;&gt; All the way up right,\n\n682\n00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.630\nthey actually had a tool it looked like\na little ice pick hook kind of thing.\n\n683\n00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.720\nYou would insert it, and\nyou would pull right to be able to pull\n\n684\n00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.280\nyour boots on by the straps,\nthat's where the concept comes from.\n\n685\n00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.220\nSo that's how you would put your boots on.\n\n686\n00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.548\nOf course,\ntaking them off was a whole other issue.\n\n687\n00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:57.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had to have like four other people,\n\n688\n00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.950\nand they had to pull, it was kinda crazy.\n\n689\n00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:02.780\nBut you would pull your\nbootstraps to pull your boots on.\n\n690\n00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.950\nThat was the idea.\n\n691\n00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.345\nThe linkage between that and\nthe bootstrap protocol,\n\n692\n00:33:07.345 --> 00:33:10.164\nthat part I'm not really\nthat I don't know.\n\n693\n00:33:10.164 --> 00:33:11.743\nYou got me, I don't know.\n\n694\n00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:13.660\n&gt;&gt; I think it's because\nyou're not relying.\n\n695\n00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.380\nYou don't have to have a hard drive.\n\n696\n00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.760\nYou don't have to have something else.\n\n697\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.210\nYou can just pull yourself up on\nthe network I don't know [LAUGH].\n\n698\n00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.720\n&gt;&gt; I mean in theory I can see more or less\nthe concept if that's what it refers to.\n\n699\n00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.358\nThe idea of bootstrapping or the boot-p\nprotocol, this idea of a network boot,\n\n700\n00:33:31.358 --> 00:33:33.401\npixie boot,\nwe can refer to different ways.\n\n701\n00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:37.889\nBut, ultimately the idea is that you're\nusing a prevloaded amount of information,\n\n702\n00:33:37.889 --> 00:33:40.194\ntypically in a boot ram\non the network card,\n\n703\n00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:44.459\nas opposed to having to boot from a hard\ndrive, as you suggested, with a fool OS.\n\n704\n00:33:44.459 --> 00:33:47.323\nTo be able to give yourself\njust enough information and\n\n705\n00:33:47.323 --> 00:33:51.680\nenvironmental control to be able to bring\nthe system up, go out over the network and\n\n706\n00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.503\nlook for, typically these days.\n\n707\n00:33:53.503 --> 00:33:54.835\nA multi cast system,\n\n708\n00:33:54.835 --> 00:33:58.450\nwhere we could download an image more\noften than not is what we're doing.\n\n709\n00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.029\nIf we're doing this and we're imaging.\n\n710\n00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:03.328\nAnd we would be doing that, it gives\nus the ability to be self-sufficient,\n\n711\n00:34:03.328 --> 00:34:04.740\nmaybe that's the tie in.\n\n712\n00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.760\nPerhaps, I like the logic of\nbeing able to boot locally from\n\n713\n00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.284\nthe machine without a fully installed or\nin this case without an operating system.\n\n714\n00:34:12.284 --> 00:34:14.985\nBut give us just enough to be\nable to get to the network,\n\n715\n00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:16.295\ngive us network connectivity.\n\n716\n00:34:16.295 --> 00:34:18.895\nThat comes from the network\ncard traditionally, right,\n\n717\n00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:20.255\nthat capability on the network card.\n\n718\n00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:23.535\nSo, that may very well be historically\nwhat they were referring to.\n\n719\n00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:26.335\nI'm not sure but that's what we can\ngo with, I like that so that's great.\n\n720\n00:34:26.335 --> 00:34:27.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that it sounds good.\n\n721\n00:34:27.888 --> 00:34:29.920\n&gt;&gt; So we do have that capability here.\n\n722\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.640\nAnd thank you for joining us in\nthe Elizabethan theater discussing IPv4,\n\n723\n00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.670\nand how that integrates with\nall those things today.\n\n724\n00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.890\nSo, we can see,\nif we go back to the interface,\n\n725\n00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.100\nyou will see that we do\nhave that capability.\n\n726\n00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.730\nTraditionally, you leave it set to both.\n\n727\n00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.620\nBecause that way,\nwe're able to provide support for\n\n728\n00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.870\nboth of those through a reservation.\n\n729\n00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.166\nI'm not gonna bother to create\na reservation, but you get the idea.\n\n730\n00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:52.820\nLet's just go through quickly, to wrap\nup this first part of our discussion.\n\n731\n00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.130\nWhat the thought process is for\n\n732\n00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.240\na client to actually be able\nto lease an IP address.\n\n733\n00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.410\nI keep referring to these four steps,\n\n734\n00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.360\nI'm referring to the ideas of the DHCP\nsisters that you often hear referred to.\n\n735\n00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we get to meet your friends.\n\n736\n00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.905\n&gt;&gt; Your friends DORA and ROSA,\nright, very lovely young ladies.\n\n737\n00:35:05.905 --> 00:35:06.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n738\n00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:10.467\nthe idea behind this is a four step\nprocess that a client will engage in\n\n739\n00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:14.515\nalong with the server, two component\nparts that make this process up.\n\n740\n00:35:14.515 --> 00:35:17.080\nWe have the server side,\nyou've seen us configuring that here.\n\n741\n00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.310\nThe client would be any machine.\n\n742\n00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.170\nAnd by the way, this does not need to be\na Microsoft Operating System based client.\n\n743\n00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.500\nWe can service non Microsoft\nclients through a DHCP server.\n\n744\n00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.314\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n745\n00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:30.480\nWe're tight on Microsoft's\nspecific DHCP infrastructure here.\n\n746\n00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.190\nBut any machine on the planet with any\nOperating System that provides basic\n\n747\n00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:40.640\nDHCP support can use a DHCP server to\ndownload and lease and gain an IP address.\n\n748\n00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.820\nThis is not a Microsoft\nspecific functionality,\n\n749\n00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.360\nby any means just to be clear.\n\n750\n00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.210\nNeither is DNS by the way, a secret most\npeople don't remember and think about.\n\n751\n00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.390\nWe'll talk about something known\nas buying when we get into DNS.\n\n752\n00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.540\nAnd the concept of non Microsoft\ncapabilities in the network stack\n\n753\n00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.390\nof bounce.\n\n754\n00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.890\nMicrosoft doesn't lay claim to any of this\nstuff, nor should they with the exception\n\n755\n00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.330\nof the use of and really tying\nthat into their infrastructure.\n\n756\n00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.880\nThat is their contribution\nto this as great or\n\n757\n00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.540\nas bad as you may think of that as being.\n\n758\n00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.450\nBut generically the idea of the NCP and\n\n759\n00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.910\nDNS exists outside of Microsoft\ninfrastructure, just to be clear.\n\n760\n00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.530\nBut the four step process, right?\n\n761\n00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:19.650\nSo let's use Dora,\nD-O-R-A is our mnemonic or\n\n762\n00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.437\nour four letter acronym that will\ndescribe for us what the four\n\n763\n00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:29.890\nstages of DHCP request, or the ability\nto be able to get a address will be.\n\n764\n00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:36.270\nD, stands for discover, O, for offer,\nR, for request, A, for acknowledge.\n\n765\n00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.030\nSo DORA, discover,offer,\nrequest, acknowledge.\n\n766\n00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.990\nWe go through and use ROSA.\n\n767\n00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.050\nAgain, four stages, same idea,\n\n768\n00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.420\nyou can stand them upside by side and\nwalk right down the list.\n\n769\n00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:53.330\nROSA, R for request, O for offer,\nS for selection, A for acknowledgment.\n\n770\n00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:57.690\nEither way, they both speak to the four\nstages just a matter whose documentation\n\n771\n00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.750\nyou read, and what they happen\nto refer of the four stages as.\n\n772\n00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.798\nBut you will put the word, or\nthe letters DHCP in front of each one.\n\n773\n00:37:03.798 --> 00:37:08.980\nSo a DHCP discover packet,\na DHCP offer, a DHCP request.\n\n774\n00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.050\nA DHCP acknowledge will be the way\nyou see it often referred to.\n\n775\n00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.780\nSo the client will go ahead initially, and\n\n776\n00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.590\nsend out a broadcast message to any and\nall systems.\n\n777\n00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.320\nBecause the client, if it's using\nthe DHCP initially, or attempting to,\n\n778\n00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.815\ndoes not have a fixed static IP address\nthat it can use to do what is called\n\n779\n00:37:26.815 --> 00:37:28.120\na unicast transmission.\n\n780\n00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.590\nEssentially a one-to-one transmission.\n\n781\n00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.110\nSo it's gonna broadcast initially.\n\n782\n00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.265\nIt's gonna send out a message\nusing the discover or the request.\n\n783\n00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:39.814\nDR, D or R, whether we're doing DORA or\nROSE, it doesn't matter,\n\n784\n00:37:39.814 --> 00:37:40.990\nit's the same thing.\n\n785\n00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.060\nThe client broadcasting says hey,\nI need to find a DHCP server.\n\n786\n00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:50.065\nAnd any DHCP server on this subnet,\nand or remotely that's available\n\n787\n00:37:50.065 --> 00:37:54.840\nthrough either a DHCP relay agent,\nor an RFC 1542 compliant router.\n\n788\n00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.250\nA router that will allow us to propagate\nthis special kind of broadcast traffic.\n\n789\n00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:04.196\nKnown as DHCP traffic or bootstrap\ntraffic, cuz that's what the BOOTP\n\n790\n00:38:04.196 --> 00:38:08.484\nprotocol is used for as well, to be able\nto send this traffic across a router.\n\n791\n00:38:08.484 --> 00:38:12.499\nRouters traditionally, are used to prevent\nbroadcasts across their interface,\n\n792\n00:38:12.499 --> 00:38:16.010\nstopping broadcast storms from\npropagating, one network to another.\n\n793\n00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.770\nVery important from a security and\nperformance standpoint to do this.\n\n794\n00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.212\nBut we allow certain kinds\nof broadcast traffic.\n\n795\n00:38:22.212 --> 00:38:24.975\nAnd DHCP traffic is one\nof those rare excetions.\n\n796\n00:38:24.975 --> 00:38:27.742\nAnd if we are RFC1542 compliant, and\n\n797\n00:38:27.742 --> 00:38:33.120\nany router made in the last seven to ten\nyears is gonna be that automatically.\n\n798\n00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.160\nWe will then allow that traffic to go\nthrough routed interface hitting a DHCP\n\n799\n00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.620\nserver somewhere on another subnet,\nallowing us to conversate, conversate?\n\n800\n00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Conversate.\nYeah, we do that.\n\n801\n00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.210\n&gt;&gt; Conversate,\nhave a conversation with that router.\n\n802\n00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.830\nAnd then lease an address.\n\n803\n00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.340\nSo that's step one,\ndid you wanna add something there?\n\n804\n00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Just a few things,\nthat's just going to be from Cisco LAN,\n\n805\n00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.910\nthey call that IP Helper.\n\n806\n00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:57.846\nAnd then you had mentioned,\nyour DHCP relay, so\n\n807\n00:38:57.846 --> 00:38:59.150\njust kinda\n&gt;&gt; Relay agent\n\n808\n00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Relay agent, yes\n\n809\n00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.070\n&gt;&gt; That's what Microsoft\n\n810\n00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.800\ncalls\n&gt;&gt; Yup\n\n811\n00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.520\n&gt;&gt; The piece of infrastructure we use\n\n812\n00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.220\nin lieu of a RC1542 compliant router.\n\n813\n00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.580\nThe relay agent is simply a machine\nthat will straddle two networks,\n\n814\n00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.090\nso essentially,\nit's a multi homed computer.\n\n815\n00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.018\nNothing special about it other than that.\n\n816\n00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:20.141\nBut it has an IP address interface\nthat sits in our local subnet.\n\n817\n00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:24.087\nWhere we're broadcasting, and can then\npropagate and take that broadcast.\n\n818\n00:39:24.087 --> 00:39:29.220\nPackage it up and proxy on behalf of\nthe client that does not have an IP.\n\n819\n00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.438\nAnd allow it to go out and request\nit across the subnet somewhere else,\n\n820\n00:39:33.438 --> 00:39:35.165\nacross a routed interface.\n\n821\n00:39:35.165 --> 00:39:38.600\nSo our router can act this way,\nanother computer can act this way.\n\n822\n00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.950\nThere's lots of different things\nthat could be relay agents.\n\n823\n00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.957\nBut whatever it is, the relay agent\nacts like an RFC 1542 compliant device.\n\n824\n00:39:45.957 --> 00:39:49.716\nEssentially relaying the broadcast\ntraffic, but it allows us to have\n\n825\n00:39:49.716 --> 00:39:53.093\nthe communication without having\nthe dedicated IP address and\n\n826\n00:39:53.093 --> 00:39:55.700\nthe subnet To reach a remote DHCP server.\n\n827\n00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.827\nSo we call that our DHCP relation.\n\n828\n00:39:57.827 --> 00:39:59.710\nDid get that right?\n\n829\n00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes and there was one more thing.\n\n830\n00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.400\n&gt;&gt; What else.\n\n831\n00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Also to just kind of add to what you\nsaid about keeping an open mind that\n\n832\n00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.000\nMicrosoft doesn't like\nclaim to any of this.\n\n833\n00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.730\nWe had a comment in the chat and\n\n834\n00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:13.110\nthey said that they run DHCP on\ntheir PF sence firewall which\n\n835\n00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.320\nbecause this is a Microsoft certification\nseries, that's what we're covering here.\n\n836\n00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.770\nBut just, yes,\nyou are able to run DHCP on other devices.\n\n837\n00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:25.380\nIt's just not limited to this capacity but\nthat's what we're doing right now.\n\n838\n00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I mean, most of you,\nif you just think about the logic, and\n\n839\n00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.590\nI think I spoke about this in other\nepisodes where you get your cable modem or\n\n840\n00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:37.260\nyour DSL box, whatever you get from your\ncable provider, and you set that thing up.\n\n841\n00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.190\nYou're running DHCP as a service on\nthere to lease your addresses internally\n\n842\n00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.680\nbehind your NAT device which is kind\nof all in one box you're using at home.\n\n843\n00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.580\nSo you run DHCP on almost anything and\nthat's not running a Microsoft OS.\n\n844\n00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.870\nThat's just running\na little dedicated OS or\n\n845\n00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.050\nan iOS that's running inside\nof that device, right?\n\n846\n00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.150\nYou mentioned Cisco.\n\n847\n00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.860\nThere's just about any operating\nsystem on the planet realistically\n\n848\n00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.060\ncan implement this because this\nis not an OS-specific function.\n\n849\n00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.350\nThis is a network stack TCP/IP function.\n\n850\n00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.800\nSo as a result of that,\nDHCP itself, the support for\n\n851\n00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.470\nit, comes from our ability\nto use the network stack.\n\n852\n00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.740\nHow we implement it at the high levels\nof the OS, with things like management\n\n853\n00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.900\nconsoles and all the pretty bells and\nwhistles, is certainly reliant on the OS.\n\n854\n00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.990\nBut the basic underlying assumptions,\ncome to us from our networking stack.\n\n855\n00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.390\nAnd so they're vendor independent and\nnon-vendor specific as a result.\n\n856\n00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.590\nSo we definitely could run them on\nany kind of device that supports\n\n857\n00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.520\nimplementation of the service and\n\n858\n00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.100\nis able to use the protocols in order\nto drive that traffic exchange.\n\n859\n00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.100\nHaving said that, step number two, so the\nclient has broadcast out its request for\n\n860\n00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.900\na piece of the action to get\na DHCP sponsored IP address.\n\n861\n00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.020\nStep two, server or servers.\n\n862\n00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.810\nAny interface that is, and\nthere may be more than one DHCP server,\n\n863\n00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.310\nby the way,\nwithin earshot of the broadcast.\n\n864\n00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:57.970\nAll servers that hear it will respond,\nso they will now, right, step two.\n\n865\n00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:59.450\nDiscover for DORA.\n\n866\n00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.510\nOffer, right?\n\n867\n00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.380\nDHCP offer.\n\n868\n00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.170\nOr ROSA.\n\n869\n00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.790\nWe just did request, step two, offer.\n\n870\n00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.240\nIt's the same in both.\n\n871\n00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.170\nThe DHCP servers will\noffer their services, so\n\n872\n00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.490\nthey will send back a message\nthat says by the way.\n\n873\n00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.370\nWe're here,\n\n874\n00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:17.100\nwe heard you and we're available if\nyou're interested in doing business.\n\n875\n00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.090\nThey have not offered\nan IP address in step two.\n\n876\n00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.890\nThey've offered their services\nto give an IP address\n\n877\n00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:26.440\nin a future conversation which is gonna\nbe coming up in the next two steps.\n\n878\n00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.940\nSo step two is about the server\nresponding to the clients broadcast and\n\n879\n00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.890\nsaying I'm available open for business.\n\n880\n00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:33.840\nHappy to meet you.\n\n881\n00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.190\nWhat can I do for you?\n\n882\n00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.580\nNow if we get more than one offer,\n\n883\n00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.340\nas the client we have an embarrassment\nof riches at that point, right,\n\n884\n00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.290\nwe have more than one inbound request,\nwe have to now do the right thing.\n\n885\n00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.990\nWe have to thank you to everybody and\nto one of the say, thank you and\n\n886\n00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.790\nyes I'd like to do business with you.\n\n887\n00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.030\nAnd to the others, thank you but\nno thank you, right?\n\n888\n00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.580\nBecause it's impolite to say,\nI need help, and then not respond and\n\n889\n00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.160\nthank everybody who offers, right?\n\n890\n00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:56.910\nSo we have to do that.\n\n891\n00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.265\nWe're a very polite networking.\n\n892\n00:42:58.265 --> 00:42:59.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Functionality here.\n\n893\n00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.550\nSo we have to follow the civil\nrules of networking order.\n\n894\n00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.710\nSo we're gonna say thank you to everybody\nbut we're gonna choose the first server\n\n895\n00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.490\nthat responds back and\ndo business with that one.\n\n896\n00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:12.580\nSo first pass to post wins, everybody\nelse gets a thank you, but no thank you.\n\n897\n00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.570\nStep three, the server,\nwhat we're going to do now in step three,\n\n898\n00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:22.110\ndiscover author requests that\nare Fedora request offer selection.\n\n899\n00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.470\nThe S in rows it's the same thing.\n\n900\n00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.390\nREquest or selection,\nthat's the client sending back those\n\n901\n00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.290\nmessages saying thank you,\nI'd like to do business with you.\n\n902\n00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.600\nOr thank you but no thank you right?\n\n903\n00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.590\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n904\n00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.280\nThat's step three.\n\n905\n00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.540\nStep four, acknowledgement right?\n\n906\n00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.780\nSame in either model.\n\n907\n00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.210\nDora A, Rosa A, same at the bottom.\n\n908\n00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.910\nThe server that we said thank you to,\nI'd like to do business with you,\n\n909\n00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:49.560\nplease give me an address sends back\nour IP address in the last message,\n\n910\n00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.300\nassigns it to us from the scope,\nyou saw that up here in my address pool.\n\n911\n00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.680\nI specified my pool.\n\n912\n00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.730\nYou saw the minute I went in,\n\n913\n00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.480\nI already had one lease there\nthat had already taken place.\n\n914\n00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.450\nSo we are assigning that\naddress in step four.\n\n915\n00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.240\nIt's not until step four of the exchange\nthat the client gets an IP address.\n\n916\n00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.770\nUntil then everything's going back and\nforth from the client based on broadcasts.\n\n917\n00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.890\nThe server's using an unicast\ntransmission, a dedicated transmission\n\n918\n00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.590\nto a fixed endpoint right because it\nhas an IP address it's sending but\n\n919\n00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.090\nit's sending it to the client.\n\n920\n00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.950\nBut we don't have a fixed ip right so\nwe have to broadcast?\n\n921\n00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.800\nIn order to be able to send this traffic.\n\n922\n00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.390\nBut once the client gets the IP\nat the end of step four,\n\n923\n00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:31.150\nit starts being able to send transmissions\nnormally using its TCP/IP address for\n\n924\n00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:35.390\nthat amount of time, whatever it is\nthat the PTL on the lease allows for.\n\n925\n00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.880\nSo this is the four-step process\ninvolved with actually getting that IP\n\n926\n00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.694\naddress to the client.\n\n927\n00:44:39.694 --> 00:44:40.480\n&gt;&gt; Super important to know and understand.\n\n928\n00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Super important to know.\n\n929\n00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.815\n&gt;&gt; And even how the unicast and broadcast\ntransmissions work, because moving forward\n\n930\n00:44:45.815 --> 00:44:49.793\nin time, we don't even have broadcast\ntransmissions without IPB 6, so\n\n931\n00:44:49.793 --> 00:44:52.402\nwe'll have to think about [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You do not.\n\n932\n00:44:52.402 --> 00:44:53.762\nYou have something else\n&gt;&gt; We'll have a different method.\n\n933\n00:44:53.762 --> 00:44:54.956\n&gt;&gt; We do.\nWe'll talk about that in\n\n934\n00:44:54.956 --> 00:44:55.593\nupcoming episodes.\n\n935\n00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:56.412\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great!\n\n936\n00:44:56.412 --> 00:44:59.710\n&gt;&gt; The non-broadcast [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Adam.\n\n937\n00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:00.830\nThank you for joining us

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.002\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nWith Windows Server 2016 Series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.038\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:21.214\nIn this episode,\nwe'll continue talking about DHCP.\n\n7\n00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd back in studios with us,\nwith us today, we have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.400\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970\n&gt;&gt; I wanna talk about PCHD,\nthat's DHCP backwards.\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's say everything backwards and\n\n11\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.240\nsee if you guys can [INAUDIBLE].\n\n12\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.110\nActually, I'm gonna turn around and\ntalk this way,\n\n13\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.350\nso you actually have to pay attention.\n\n14\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040\nI'm only kidding.\nWe're gonna continue talking about DHCP,\n\n15\n00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.580\nas Cherokee suggested.\n\n16\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.230\nBut what we are gonna do is just jump back\nin before I show you, and I am gonna show\n\n17\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.498\nyou momentarily how to set up that DHCP\nrelay agent we alluded to in Episode 1.\n\n18\n00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:50.655\nWe'll gonna go through and\n\n19\n00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.985\ntake look how to configure that through\nthe RAS management consul interface.\n\n20\n00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.879\nSo l wanted to remind you,\nwhen we talk Power Shell in other areas,\n\n21\n00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.878\nwe talked about it here, I'll show\nyou some of the steps involved and\n\n22\n00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:02.330\nthings that I was doing behind\nthe scenes to set this up.\n\n23\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.635\nBut let's just take a look,\nwe have a whole set of commandlets,\n\n24\n00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:11.099\nassociated with DHCP, add the server\nin DC as you can see here, and\n\n25\n00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.820\nto add and rund the server so\nthat is a Go in, you set up configure.\n\n26\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.130\nSo you want to take a look\nat Power Shell commands.\n\n27\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.960\nYou can go through here and we can go in,\nwe can see this one allows us\n\n28\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.610\nto set up the http and do all\nthe configuration associated with it and\n\n29\n00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.140\nto have all of that\ninformation that is necessary.\n\n30\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.220\nSo always want to refer to this\nthings when and where we can.\n\n31\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.170\nGive you some information\nabout Power Shell and\n\n32\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.500\nhow it could be used to your benefit.\n\n33\n00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.220\nAlways helpful for you to know about\nthose things in case you're stuck\n\n34\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.130\non a desert island with nothing but\na command shell and\n\n35\n00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.443\nyou have to work your way out\nto configure network services.\n\n36\n00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:47.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Boy are you gonna be happy\n\n37\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.860\nthat I made you pay\nattention to power shell.\n\n38\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.580\nAll right so having said that,\nlet's take at power shell here.\n\n39\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.440\nAnd specifically let me just show you\nwhat I was doing here in this interface.\n\n40\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.770\nSo I am as you could see,\nI'm just scrolling down so\n\n41\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.730\nyou could see where I am.\n\n42\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.170\nI'm a machine inside a machine,\ninside a machine, in this particular demo.\n\n43\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.100\nI'm on a Server 16\nmachine that's running as\n\n44\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.780\na VM that I joined to my\nexisting domain infrastructure.\n\n45\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.460\nI've configured and setup the routing and\nremote access services.\n\n46\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.930\nSo you can see I'm in my RAS console\nthere, remoting and routing, remote,\n\n47\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.900\nlet me try that again, RAS [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; Routing remote-\n\n48\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Routing and Remote Access.\n\n49\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.964\n&gt;&gt; There you go [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:28.736\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n51\n00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:31.620\nRouting and Remote Access console my MMC.\n\n52\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.370\nAnd I've got my server configured here.\n\n53\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.430\nI've gone ahead and\njust configured it to do LAN routing only.\n\n54\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.690\nSo I haven't done any of the fancy stuff,\n\n55\n00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.390\nwe'll talk about in future episodes\nwith VPNs, with direct access.\n\n56\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.110\nI mean that stuff right now,\nit's very simple, very basic.\n\n57\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.880\nSo we've set that up, we've configured it,\nwe've restarted the system,\n\n58\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.670\nrestarted the service so\nthat way everything is running, and\n\n59\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.170\nI've opened up the system,\nopened up the console, gone to IPv4.\n\n60\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.940\nCome down here to general, and\n\n61\n00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.630\nyou can see that when I right click, I can\ncome in here and do new routing protocol.\n\n62\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.440\nAnd when I do this,\nI'm just going to move this up here,\n\n63\n00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.260\nwe can really see what is there.\n\n64\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.740\nYou'll see one of the items\nI have is the DHCP relay.\n\n65\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.380\nAs you wanna walk through and\ntalk about how to configure this relay.\n\n66\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.600\nBut before we do that,\nI wanna make sure we think about\n\n67\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.940\nthe logic of what we talked about in DHCP\nor around the DHCP in our first step.\n\n68\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.140\nSo I wanna revisit something about\nthe DHCP options and how they get applied.\n\n69\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.650\nRemember we talked about\nthe scope options.\n\n70\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.030\nWe talked about being able\nto set the default gateway,\n\n71\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.300\nbeing able to set the DNS Server and\nthe DNS name for the domain.\n\n72\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.000\nWe talked about being able to set winds,\nand\n\n73\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.450\na bunch of other stuff I gave you\na list of options that are available\n\n74\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.740\nof a Word Document that Cherokee is going\nto make sure get in the show notes for\n\n75\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.022\nyou right just to remind you to do that\n&gt;&gt; Sounds Good [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:46.494\n&gt;&gt; Reminding you in two episodes now so\n\n77\n00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.504\nits gotta be there because\nI talked about it twice\n\n78\n00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:49.191\n&gt;&gt; For DHCP options\n\n79\n00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:49.878\n&gt;&gt; Our DHCP Options\n\n80\n00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:50.760\nDocument\n&gt;&gt; Got it\n\n81\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.430\n&gt;&gt; So we have all that.\n\n82\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.560\nSo we went through all that with you.\n\n83\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.600\nWe're gonna make sure you have that.\n\n84\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.980\nJust wanna talk about this interesting\nway which these options are gonna apply\n\n85\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.500\nbecause its, you know it sounds on\nthe surface pretty straightforward.\n\n86\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.180\nHey, let's just create those options,\nsend them out there.\n\n87\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.320\nThey'll be part of a lease, the system\ngets it, boom, we're done, right?\n\n88\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.860\nBut there is a little\nmore to it than that.\n\n89\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.970\nThe DHCP client service\napplies these options But\n\n90\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.530\nin the order of precedence\nat four distinct levels.\n\n91\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.540\nAnd so let's go ahead and\ntalk through with that is.\n\n92\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.960\nFrom least specific to most specific,\nthey are.\n\n93\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.945\nSo in other words,\nthe order that I'm gonna give them to you.\n\n94\n00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:22.160\nLeast specific to most specific.\n\n95\n00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.210\nServer level, scope level,\nclass level, reserve client level.\n\n96\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.100\nWhat I mean by that is on the DHCP server.\n\n97\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.680\nWe have different sets of options we\ncould set up at different areas or\n\n98\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.240\ndifferent levels in the interface.\n\n99\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.160\nWe only showed you the scope options,\nright?\n\n100\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.020\nSo we showed you essentially item number\ntwo on the list, but we didn't go in and\n\n101\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.240\nshow you what we could do\nat the server level, right?\n\n102\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.000\nSo we could set options\nat the server level.\n\n103\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.270\nCould set them at the scope level,\nwe went through and took a look at those.\n\n104\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.790\nWe also have class level and\n\n105\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.090\nreserve client level options\nfrom least to most specific.\n\n106\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.370\nMeaning, the reserve client level options\nare going to be the most specific and\n\n107\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.600\nare applied as we go through the list,\n\n108\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.230\nfrom server to scope to class to\nreserve client level, in that order.\n\n109\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.630\nWe go through and\napply them in order of precedence.\n\n110\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.770\nAnd if we apply settings at each level and\nwe see a conflict, and\n\n111\n00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.070\nwe may get a conflict, one level\nmay say router receptive 1.2.3.4.\n\n112\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.800\nAnother one may say no router set\nto 2.4.6.8 or something like that.\n\n113\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.670\nDCP scope option 003 by the way, right,\nfor your default gateway error router.\n\n114\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.900\nSo if we do that, the option applied last.\n\n115\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.290\nIs the one that takes precedence.\n\n116\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.480\nSo we step through the four levels,\n\n117\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.310\ngoing from server to scope to class\nlevel to reserve client level, and\n\n118\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.590\nthe one that applies last is the one that\nultimately gets applied to the client.\n\n119\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.780\nSo if we have four conflicting settings,\nthree of them ultimately get ignored and\n\n120\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.910\nthe last one applied is\nthe one that we go with.\n\n121\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.900\nSo we want to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n122\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.770\nServer level, scope level,\nclass level, reserve client level.\n\n123\n00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.860\nIn that order,\nfrom least to most prevalent and\n\n124\n00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.850\nwe apply the reserve client level last.\n\n125\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.700\nThat's the ultimate one that we go\nwith if we are gonna have a conflict.\n\n126\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.270\nJust want to make sure we're aware\nof that and we think about that.\n\n127\n00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.150\nThat is important.\n\n128\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.580\nNow we can take a look real quick.\n\n129\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.950\nHere, just go back here.\n\n130\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.240\nBefore we go into our real age and\nset that up.\n\n131\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.720\nIt's running on another machine.\n\n132\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.450\nWe talk about these, for\ninstance we can go here, and\n\n133\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.620\nyou can see we have our DHCP Server.\n\n134\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.130\nAnd this is our server right here.\n\n135\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.940\nCan go, and\nyou'll see we have just our data base\n\n136\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.720\ninformation all that kind of stuff.\n\n137\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.930\nNow remember, this is our management\nconsole right up here at the very top.\n\n138\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.020\nWe can add servers.\n\n139\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.420\nWe can authorize them, things like that.\n\n140\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.620\nWe talked about our scope.\n\n141\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.870\nHere, we've all ready created out scope.\n\n142\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.120\nAnd we have our scope options,\nour scope level options.\n\n143\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.500\nItem number two on our list.\n\n144\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.480\nAre the ones we took a look at and\ntalked about here, right?\n\n145\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.650\nBut in addition we come down here,\n\n146\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.790\nour server options are listed right\nhere in the folder, we could see this.\n\n147\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.860\nSo if we go in our server level options,\nconfigure options, we can specify,\n\n148\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.910\nyou'll notice the same set of options but\nwe could set them at the server level.\n\n149\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.750\nWhen we set at the server level, we are\nsetting them at the lowest level possible.\n\n150\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.740\nThey broadly apply to\neverything on the server.\n\n151\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.770\nWe'll start there, but if we have scope\noptions that are specific to the scope of\n\n152\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.200\nIP addresses they will override the server\nlevel option, becoming more targeted,\n\n153\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.940\nmore specific as we go down.\n\n154\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.570\nThen we have class level and\nthen ultimately reserve client level.\n\n155\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.110\nAnd by the time we get to reserve client\nlevel, we're talking about options\n\n156\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.130\nspecific to a reserved client IP that\nare being given just to that client.\n\n157\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.900\nAnd that's gonna override everything else.\n\n158\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.890\nSo, we have differing degrees here, or\n\n159\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.000\ndiffering areas here that we can assign,\nand create our options in.\n\n160\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.450\nWanna make sure you're aware of those,\n\n161\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.840\nand you're just thinking about\nthat in the order of precedence.\n\n162\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.000\nWe do have all that for you in the notes,\njust to give you some reinforcement there.\n\n163\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.700\nImportant for\nyou to be aware of those things.\n\n164\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.300\nAnd to be thinking about that.\n\n165\n00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.170\nLot of information in the thought process\naround DHCP and how we do those things.\n\n166\n00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.080\nPeople don't always stop and\nthink about that and\n\n167\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.010\nthey're not always aware of that, but it\nis important to just consider our options.\n\n168\n00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.220\nNo pun intended by the way.\n\n169\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.959\nAll right, so DHCP relay agent here, let's\ntake a look at how to set this thing up.\n\n170\n00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:56.874\nSo we have our DHCP relay agent, we're\ngoing to select Here we're gonna click OK.\n\n171\n00:07:56.874 --> 00:07:58.652\nIt's gonna give us our\nnew interface down here.\n\n172\n00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:00.688\nWe can see it right down\nhere as we do that.\n\n173\n00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:04.347\nAnd then what we have to do,\nis we have to go in and\n\n174\n00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:08.827\nyou could see that we could go in,\nand we can actually go and\n\n175\n00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:14.206\nwe can go to Properties,\nJust come up right here.\n\n176\n00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:20.987\nAnd when we do this, you'll see that\nwe can put in the relay agent sends\n\n177\n00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:23.758\nmessages to the server\naddress listed below.\n\n178\n00:08:23.758 --> 00:08:26.865\nThis is where the relay agent\nis gonna send our information.\n\n179\n00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:30.542\nWhere we'll talk about the fact that relay\nagent straddles two networks, right?\n\n180\n00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:34.330\nIt's gonna have an interface in the LAN,\nand an interface somewhere else\n\n181\n00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.310\nthat goes to the remote DHCP server,\nwherever that it is.\n\n182\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.210\nWe have to specify what\nthe target address for\n\n183\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.730\nthe DHCP server is that we wanna\nactually be able to send information to.\n\n184\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.600\nThat's one of the things\nthat we'll specify here.\n\n185\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.660\nSo we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n186\n00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.485\nBut what we're gonna do first is,\nwe're gonna make sure and\n\n187\n00:08:49.485 --> 00:08:53.097\nlet me actually just do one\nmore thing here real quickly.\n\n188\n00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:56.820\nSorry, did not mean to do that.\n\n189\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.305\nThat was not what I wanted to do.\n\n190\n00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.495\n[LAUGH] All right,\nlet me click the new interface.\n\n191\n00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:02.170\nThat's what I was trying to do,\nis to get back here.\n\n192\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.200\nBefore we actually specify our target\nserver, I wanna specify the interface.\n\n193\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.570\nWhat are we gonna use, or what are we\ngonna bind the DHCP relay agent to?\n\n194\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.830\nAnd you'll see we have\ndifferent interfaces here.\n\n195\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.070\nAnd we have Ethernet,\nEthernet II internal.\n\n196\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.110\nEthernet and Ethernet II are our two\nobviously network card based interfaces\n\n197\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.310\njust based on labeling.\n\n198\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.030\nInternal is gonna be for\ninternal Ethernet.\n\n199\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.408\nIn this case, that program the Ethernet\ninterfaces to be able to go external.\n\n200\n00:09:25.408 --> 00:09:27.405\nSo we are gonna go ahead and\nwe are gonna choose one of the two.\n\n201\n00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:28.730\nWe will choose Ethernet here.\n\n202\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.667\nWe'll click that.\n\n203\n00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:33.048\nWe will then get our DHCP related\nproperties Ethernet properties.\n\n204\n00:09:33.048 --> 00:09:36.480\nAre we gonna allow the relaying of\nDHCP packets checked off by default?\n\n205\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.850\nSo we are enabling that.\n\n206\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.100\nYou'll see that there.\n\n207\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.910\nHop count threshold,\nboot threshold, right?\n\n208\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.236\nSo our hop count is how many\nhops are we gonna go to relay.\n\n209\n00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:46.640\nWe'll go up to four\nhops on this interface.\n\n210\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.080\nAnd we've talked about hop count and\nthe idea behind that in our\n\n211\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.960\nprior discussions in the setting\nup IPV for networks.\n\n212\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.480\nRemember, hop count is the number\nof interfaces we'll pass through\n\n213\n00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.480\nas we propagate a packet remotely\nout beyond our default gateway.\n\n214\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.560\nHow many routers or\nremote interfaces will we touch?\n\n215\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.586\nAnd we're gonna be going through,\nin this case, up to four.\n\n216\n00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:05.775\nCan we modify that?\n\n217\n00:10:05.775 --> 00:10:06.555\nWe could.\n\n218\n00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:09.625\nWould there be a reason to modify\nthe hop count there by default?\n\n219\n00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:14.715\nYeah, if we know that the DHCP server that\nwe are trying to reach is further away,\n\n220\n00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:16.525\nand they require more hops to get to.\n\n221\n00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:18.455\nWe could modify that if necessary.\n\n222\n00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:22.610\nWe could specify that we need to do\nmaybe an innate hop count or something.\n\n223\n00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.693\nSo we'll click OK,\nwe'll put that in there.\n\n224\n00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:27.230\nWe could choose another interface, right?\n\n225\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.010\nSo we can go in,\n\n226\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.871\nadd another interface, we'll add our\nEthernet II interface here as well.\n\n227\n00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:33.957\nLet's move this up, so you can see that.\n\n228\n00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:35.080\nGrab that one.\n\n229\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.150\nSame idea there as you can see.\n\n230\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.650\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will specify that, and\n\n231\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.560\nwe'll just leave again the same\nhop count available there.\n\n232\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.562\nBut we are binding two interfaces here,\nright?\n\n233\n00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:47.434\nIt's gonna allow us to have two separate\ninterfaces, to be able to send and\n\n234\n00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:49.529\nreceive DHCP related traffic through.\n\n235\n00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:53.486\nWhat we are gonna do now is go\nback here as I talked about,\n\n236\n00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:58.070\ngo here and what we are gonna\ndo is go to our server address.\n\n237\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.730\nSo let's go to properties.\n\n238\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.288\nWe have our server address here.\n\n239\n00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:05.601\nLet me just put this in, 192.168.0.4.\n\n240\n00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.827\nThat's the DHCP server of record\nthat we're gonna use in this little\n\n241\n00:11:08.827 --> 00:11:09.678\ndemonstration.\n\n242\n00:11:09.678 --> 00:11:13.060\nSo we're gonna add that in there,\nclick Add.\n\n243\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.896\nObviously in the real world, you'd put\nin whatever the addresses of the remote\n\n244\n00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.834\nserver you want to target, right, whatever\nthat may be, so you'll put that in.\n\n245\n00:11:18.834 --> 00:11:20.290\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll do that.\n\n246\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.133\nAre you the kind of person that\ndoes the applied and then the okay,\n\n247\n00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:24.436\nor do you just click the okay?\n\n248\n00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:25.270\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm definitely an applier.\n\n249\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.613\nBecause back in the days, sometimes\nyou would have to hit that, and so\n\n250\n00:11:28.613 --> 00:11:31.230\nI'm kind of just maybe I'm\na paranoid person, Adam.\n\n251\n00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.938\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe,\n\n252\n00:11:33.938 --> 00:11:35.155\nyou give me an option on that one.\n\n253\n00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:37.640\nWell, that's very instructive and\nillustrative of you.\n\n254\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.550\nI'm just gonna go with perhaps you are,\nbut perhaps not.\n\n255\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.471\nSo these days, your people often have\nthis running debate about this Daniel and\n\n256\n00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:47.525\nI talked about this sometimes\n[CROSSTALK] on occasion as well.\n\n257\n00:11:47.525 --> 00:11:48.189\n&gt;&gt; What is Daniel?\n\n258\n00:11:48.189 --> 00:11:52.305\n&gt;&gt; Daniel is the, I'm just gonna click OK,\nand get it over with kind of person.\n\n259\n00:11:52.305 --> 00:11:53.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I get that and\n\n260\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.180\nI also am more of the let me\nclick OK just to be done with it.\n\n261\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.090\nBecause all apply really does is,\nset the setting in the interface but\n\n262\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.060\nthen when you click OK, it finalizes.\n\n263\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.130\nIf you click Ok,\nit does both steps in one.\n\n264\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.438\nWe go on about this just\nbecause of bad UI design.\n\n265\n00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:10.122\nLike you could just literally have\none button that says, do this now and\n\n266\n00:12:10.122 --> 00:12:11.967\nthen finish, and\nthen click and it will be done.\n\n267\n00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:15.920\n&gt;&gt; How did you feel when\nautosave feature was introduced?\n\n268\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.180\nWas that just kind of really creepy or\nwhat?\n\n269\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.697\n&gt;&gt; Like behind the scenes for\nwork and stuff like that?\n\n270\n00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm, exactly.\n\n271\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.084\n&gt;&gt; I don't have a problem with it.\n\n272\n00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:23.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I like the fact\n\n273\n00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.643\nthat if I lose the document,\nsomething goes wrong,\n\n274\n00:12:25.643 --> 00:12:28.632\nI've got a back-up in theory\ngoing on behind that scenes.\n\n275\n00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:30.220\nSo that's not a bad thing.\n\n276\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.864\nBut it doesn't bother me, I don't-\n&gt;&gt; You don't mind losing that control\n\n277\n00:12:33.864 --> 00:12:34.373\nthere?\n\n278\n00:12:34.373 --> 00:12:35.165\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n279\n00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:38.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't have issues of that nature.\n\n280\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n281\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get to my age and\nyou're just like, if it works, I'm happy.\n\n282\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.280\nThat's all you need to worry about.\n\n283\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.641\nSo, it works and I'm happy.\n\n284\n00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.180\nI don't have to worry about that stuff.\n\n285\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.880\n&gt;&gt; And now we know.\n\n286\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.500\n&gt;&gt; And now we know.\n\n287\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.000\nSo we do have our DHCP\nrelay agent specified here,\n\n288\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.760\nas you can see we've set that up.\n\n289\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.710\n&gt;&gt; And now once we've done that, all we\nwould have to do is be able to use a DHCP\n\n290\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.588\ncapable client that needs to get\ninformation to and from the DHCP server.\n\n291\n00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:08.812\nAnd have it target the relay agents, so\nthat way it's actually able to go in and\n\n292\n00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:13.100\nto configure or to use this relay agent,\nI should say that has been configured so\n\n293\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.730\nthat it can actually send and receive.\n\n294\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.840\n&gt;&gt; And so when we go on to a client,\nwe can go in and we can go,\n\n295\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.695\nlet's say a Windows 8 machine, and\nwe can specify that it used DHCP.\n\n296\n00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:30.890\nIt will find,\na relay agent sitting in its network and\n\n297\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.840\nwe'll use it to propagate or send that\nbroadcast traffic across the divide for\n\n298\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.090\nus if we need it to as\nwe were talking about.\n\n299\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.100\nAnd we'll be able to lease the IP\naddress that leads from the DHCP server.\n\n300\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.650\nSo setting up the DHCP relay agent can\nbe a beneficial thought process for us.\n\n301\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.660\nBut there's a lot of backend work that has\nto happen because, we need a routing and\n\n302\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.400\nremote access configuration, a stack\nessentially running on a server dedicated\n\n303\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.258\nto this functionality for\nus to be able to use this.\n\n304\n00:13:57.258 --> 00:14:00.000\nAnd you could see once we have this\nset up, the relay mode is enabled.\n\n305\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.580\nWe're not sending any traffic through it\nright now but just configuring it for use.\n\n306\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.290\nBut we'd have to set up or\nstand up a server that has\n\n307\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.980\nthe relay agent capability available on\nit for us to be able to leverage this.\n\n308\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:15.000\nSo keep in mind that the relay\nagent is typically a computer.\n\n309\n00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.250\nSo it's usually something like this.\n\n310\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.122\nWe can use routers as I talked\nabout in the last episode.\n\n311\n00:14:19.122 --> 00:14:23.070\nRFC 1542 compliant routers\nthat will enable us to\n\n312\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.580\npropagate that broadcast traffic so\nit sends it across the divide for\n\n313\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.820\nthe DHCP broadcasting sent from clients.\n\n314\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.459\nEither way it works, but\nwe relay it out to different subnets.\n\n315\n00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:32.954\nSo that's gonna be important.\n\n316\n00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:35.289\nWe do put in the IP address at the server.\n\n317\n00:14:35.289 --> 00:14:37.320\nYou saw me specify that her.\n\n318\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.100\nAnd we can obviously do this,\neither with as I said,\n\n319\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.500\nthis setup does not to be\na server 16 server, by the way.\n\n320\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.610\nWe had this capability going back, I think\nall the way to NT4, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n321\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.660\nIf I remember correctly,\n\n322\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.985\nwe certainly be able to set up\nsince Windows 2000 in the minimum.\n\n323\n00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:54.835\nRelay agents using the RAS interface.\n\n324\n00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:58.295\nSo, it's been around for\nmultiple generations on the server side.\n\n325\n00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:03.480\nAnd I said, RFC 1542 compliant routers\nprobably seven to ten years at least,\n\n326\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.380\nIf not longer.\n\n327\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.073\nAny router made in the last seven to\nten years probably has that capability.\n\n328\n00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:09.691\nIf it's not automatically enabled,\n\n329\n00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:13.025\ncertainly something you could turn on\npretty easily depending on the router,\n\n330\n00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:15.060\nthe vendor and\nthe specificity how you do that.\n\n331\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.410\nBut, it wouldn't be very\ndifficult to enable that feature,\n\n332\n00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.530\nlet's put it that way.\n\n333\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.210\nI'm not gonna put you on the spot\nby asking, how you do it on a Cisco\n\n334\n00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.120\nrouter but, I'm pretty sure you would\nknow how to do it if you went and looked.\n\n335\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Just via the command\nline interface and-\n\n336\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.550\n&gt;&gt; That's the right answer cuz via\n\n337\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.430\nthe command line interface,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n338\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.560\nRight, you just enabled the other,\nor maybe your command for\n\n339\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.460\ndepending on the version\nthe iOS you are running.\n\n340\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.150\nIt may vary slightly,\nbut you have essentially\n\n341\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.610\nturned it on there via the command line\ninterface, as Cherokee pointed out.\n\n342\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.320\nAll right, so\nwe do have the capability to do this.\n\n343\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.052\nLet's switch back over to our DHCP server.\n\n344\n00:15:45.052 --> 00:15:46.570\nLet me just quickly extend the timer here,\n\n345\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.861\njust to make sure we don't run\nout of time while we're working.\n\n346\n00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.700\nLet me just go back over to\nour DHCP server right here.\n\n347\n00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.327\nThere's a lot of different things that we\ncan do with regards to troubleshooting\n\n348\n00:15:56.327 --> 00:16:00.886\nmaintaining on the DHCP server side that\nwill be important for us to consider and\n\n349\n00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:01.851\nto think about.\n\n350\n00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:05.857\nWe do have our ability here as you\ncan see to be able to unauthorize and\n\n351\n00:16:05.857 --> 00:16:08.616\ntalk about this as we\nauthorize necessarily.\n\n352\n00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:11.955\nBacking up and\nrestoring very important for us,\n\n353\n00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:16.630\nwe'll talk a bit more about that\ncoming up in just a few minutes.\n\n354\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.950\nWe do have stopping, pausing,\nrestarting so we can stop and\n\n355\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.960\nrestart essentially\nthe DHCP server service.\n\n356\n00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.000\nWe do have properties,\nreally not much going on here as I said,\n\n357\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.373\njust our database path and\nour backup path.\n\n358\n00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:29.985\nSo we could see the events properties and\n\n359\n00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:32.115\nunderstand where things\nare going to be happening.\n\n360\n00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:36.065\nIt would probably be a good idea to have\na sense of the default pass here, the c\n\n361\n00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:41.159\nWindows system 32 DHCPD directory, this\nis where our database path is by default.\n\n362\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.610\nThen I go ahead and just say, yes.\n\n363\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.880\nWe're not really gonna change it,\njust browsing.\n\n364\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.230\nSo that you could see that we can go ahead\nand change the path if we choose to.\n\n365\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.230\nBut as it told us there,\nif you go to change it,\n\n366\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.500\nyou may result in the loss of data may\nresult, if you go to change the pass.\n\n367\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.820\nYou've got to be aware of that.\n\n368\n00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.900\nNow if you decide you wanna change it,\nyou should back it up clearly and\n\n369\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.820\nhave a complete referenceable copy of\nthe database, before we do anything.\n\n370\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.096\nBut the backup pass,\nC &gt; Windows &gt; System32 &gt; DHCP &gt; Backup,\n\n371\n00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.160\nas you can see there.\n\n372\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.280\nAnd if we go, right, and we take a look\nin here and we go to our C drive.\n\n373\n00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:22.799\nAnd we go into Windows, and\nwe go into system 32 here.\n\n374\n00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:30.645\nScroll down real quick while\nwe're talking, and go into DHCP.\n\n375\n00:17:30.645 --> 00:17:32.180\nSo we will just scroll down here.\n\n376\n00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:37.973\nWent a little too far.\n\n377\n00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:42.058\nThere we go, right above DH, or DCIM.\n\n378\n00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:45.155\nSo you'll see here we do\nhave standard files, and\n\n379\n00:17:45.155 --> 00:17:48.785\neven you would have been used\nto seeing for years for DHCP.\n\n380\n00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:50.280\nHere, we have our temp EDB.\n\n381\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.410\nWe have our various files here,\nour JRS files.\n\n382\n00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.450\nWe've got our checkpoint file.\n\n383\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.600\nWe've got our DHCP MBB, so\nour database file here.\n\n384\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.700\nAnd then we've got our backup directory.\n\n385\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.930\nThere's our config, right?\n\n386\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.400\nAnd there's our backup information from\nthe last time the backup was run on\n\n387\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.300\nthe server.\n\n388\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.280\nSo we have the general structure\nthat we would expect to see here.\n\n389\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.090\nAnd we certainly can go in and work\nwith this if necessary, and do a backup.\n\n390\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.180\nSo we have those capabilities, right?\n\n391\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:25.470\nAs we move down here,\nyou'll see that w e can go in and,\n\n392\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.920\nno, I was in the right place there.\n\n393\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.596\nThere we go.\nI can look at general statistics on\n\n394\n00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:32.052\nIPv4 and, or IPv6.\n\n395\n00:18:32.052 --> 00:18:38.470\nSo I could just see general information on\nconnectivity, leases, things like that.\n\n396\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.830\nAnd I can, let me see if I can\nextend this out just a little bit.\n\n397\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.070\nThere we go.\n\n398\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.841\nSo I can see new information in here\nabout what's going on, start time,\n\n399\n00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:52.832\nhow long it's been up and\nrunning; discovers, offers, so\n\n400\n00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:56.372\nwe can see the process of\nleasing going through here.\n\n401\n00:18:56.372 --> 00:19:00.920\nDeclines, releases, total scope,\nin use, available things like that.\n\n402\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.544\nSo we see general information\nabout the IPv4 and, or\n\n403\n00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:06.889\nIPv6 stack as we go through here.\n\n404\n00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:10.496\nIn addition creates scopes,super scopes,\nmulti-case scopes, so\n\n405\n00:19:10.496 --> 00:19:11.600\nwe could do all that.\n\n406\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.292\nWe could set up failover, so we could\nset up highly available DHCP servers.\n\n407\n00:19:15.292 --> 00:19:18.659\nWe'll be talking about this some of\nthe stuff in some upcoming episodes,\n\n408\n00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:20.850\njust giving you a sense of what is there.\n\n409\n00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.530\nWe can define,\nremember we talked about the classes,\n\n410\n00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.690\nor rather the options that are available\nfor us, and we talked about classes.\n\n411\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.460\nWe could set up our uses classes and our\nvendor classes here, and then link options\n\n412\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.440\nto them as we set them up for the scope ID\nand scope options, server options, etc.\n\n413\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.930\nWe can set predefined options.\n\n414\n00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.836\nThat's one of the things\nwe were just talking about.\n\n415\n00:19:40.836 --> 00:19:45.800\nAnd if we go in here, I'm gonna go\nto properties on IPv4 and or IPv6.\n\n416\n00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.325\nWe'll see the ability to be able to enable\nlogging, and it is turned on by default,\n\n417\n00:19:50.325 --> 00:19:51.827\nand logging is important.\n\n418\n00:19:51.827 --> 00:19:55.496\nTalk about where logs would be when we\ntalk about doing some troubleshooting\n\n419\n00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:59.162\non the IPv4 episodes, one of the last\nepisodes, I think the very last one we\n\n420\n00:19:59.162 --> 00:20:02.681\ndid, went through and talked about\ndifferent troubleshooting tools.\n\n421\n00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:04.468\n[INAUDIBLE] or Event Viewer\nwould be a great tool to use for\n\n422\n00:20:04.468 --> 00:20:06.192\nbasic troubleshooting just\nto see what's going on.\n\n423\n00:20:06.192 --> 00:20:09.515\nAnd we do have logging going on,\nand we do a DHCP audit logging,\n\n424\n00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:12.360\nso this provides a historical\nview of activity.\n\n425\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.080\nLet's us see who's getting IP addresses,\n\n426\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.250\nwhether they were supposed to get them or\nnot.\n\n427\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.980\nSo we'd have general information, so good\nfor us to know that this is happening.\n\n428\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.820\nWe do actually have this\nenabled by default, so\n\n429\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.080\nwe can obviously think\nabout the logic of that.\n\n430\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.700\nHopefully leave that turned on.\n\n431\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.910\nWe can update our statistics that I just\nshowed you every so many minutes and\n\n432\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.300\ndo a refresh here.\n\n433\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.820\nSo you'll notice that we have an option\nto specify how we want that done.\n\n434\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.170\nYou'll notice under DNS, we could specify\nhere that we are linking DHCP and DNS, so\n\n435\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.980\nthat way these things\nregister in the DNS database,\n\n436\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.160\nwe can have information updating, right?\n\n437\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.377\nSo we can say,\nhey we release IP addresses from DHCP,\n\n438\n00:20:46.377 --> 00:20:50.038\nwe can register them in DNS and\ncreate host records, right?\n\n439\n00:20:50.038 --> 00:20:51.454\nThat kind of stuff, so we can do that.\n\n440\n00:20:51.454 --> 00:20:57.170\nWe update DNS records as well, if we\nchange or modify DHCP address, right?\n\n441\n00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.320\nSo we can go ahead and discard and\n\n442\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.920\nclean up ourselves to little\nhouse keeping on the DNS side.\n\n443\n00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.548\nA records, host record, PTR pointer\nrecords, reverse lookup zone records.\n\n444\n00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:10.890\nWe can delete those after we get rid\nof addresses, after the lease is up.\n\n445\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.528\nSo we could specify how we want\nthese things to be handled.\n\n446\n00:21:13.528 --> 00:21:15.469\nSo we can do all of that here.\n\n447\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.100\nWe have the ability to do what's\ncalled name protection, and\n\n448\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.090\nwe could configure that,\nwe'll again talk about this.\n\n449\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.680\nIf we wanna go in and configure it,\n\n450\n00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.110\nyou could see here I could just go in and\nclick configure while we're talking.\n\n451\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.830\nIf I enable it showing nothing more\nthan this, so we'll just do this and\n\n452\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.280\nkinda move this over so you can see here.\n\n453\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.700\nBut this allow us or\nprovides us the interesting capacity or\n\n454\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.880\ncapabilities that we now have.\n\n455\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.052\nKind of interesting how we protect DHCP,\nextending the logic of what we're all\n\n456\n00:21:41.052 --> 00:21:45.285\nready doing in DNS with things like DNS\nsec, where we secure the sign zone records\n\n457\n00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:48.586\nto further validate their\nauthenticity to prevent spoofing,\n\n458\n00:21:48.586 --> 00:21:50.479\nmasquerading, things like that.\n\n459\n00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:53.564\nHow we do some of this stuff we have\nMAC security MAC address security,\n\n460\n00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:55.356\na lot of different things we can enable.\n\n461\n00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:59.960\nSo name protection is good, because what\nthis does is you'll see here DHCP server\n\n462\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.105\nwill register A and PTR records, host\nrecord, pointer records, very important.\n\n463\n00:22:05.105 --> 00:22:08.565\nRegister them on behalf of the client,\nhowever if there's a different client\n\n464\n00:22:08.565 --> 00:22:11.740\nalready registered with that name,\nthe DHCP update will fail.\n\n465\n00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.120\nIn other words,\nthis prevents duplication and or\n\n466\n00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.140\nspoofing that are being potentially taken\non by a hacker trying to infect and\n\n467\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.130\nultimately corrupt our DHCP and\nDNS infrastructure.\n\n468\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.996\nSo enabling name protection will\nprevent that from happening.\n\n469\n00:22:24.996 --> 00:22:28.459\nIt also prevents us from making a mistake\nand having multiple hosts with the same\n\n470\n00:22:28.459 --> 00:22:31.208\nname coming up, and\nregistry that would cause the confusion.\n\n471\n00:22:31.208 --> 00:22:34.100\nSo we may be preventing\na self inflicted wound here.\n\n472\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.010\nIt may not be a hacker, but part of\nthe logic is to prevent masquerading,\n\n473\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.315\nspoofing, attacks because\nthey won't necessarily,\n\n474\n00:22:41.315 --> 00:22:45.147\nwell I should say we won't necessarily\nprevent masquerading text or equity.\n\n475\n00:22:45.147 --> 00:22:48.270\nWhat we'll prevent is poisoning\nattacks that will try to modify,\n\n476\n00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.009\nmanipulate registration entries.\n\n477\n00:22:50.009 --> 00:22:52.901\nBut by extension we then would\nbe able to prevent spoofing and\n\n478\n00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:54.555\nmasquerading as a result of that.\n\n479\n00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:58.158\nSo it is important for\nus to know that and we will secure or\n\n480\n00:22:58.158 --> 00:23:00.390\nset up secure dynamic updates.\n\n481\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.360\nThose have to be enabled for\nthis to work and\n\n482\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.180\nit will provide secure communication and\ndo updates from DHCP and\n\n483\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.810\nDNS, but we're gonna secure that\ntraffic and ensure it's authorized.\n\n484\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.920\nSo this does add some depth and\ncapabilities here.\n\n485\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.430\nAnd it's nice, because you'll\nsee we enforce in protection\n\n486\n00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.240\nresults in the following\nbehavioral changes.\n\n487\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.410\nRight, we honor a request for all these\nrecords from or for Windows DHCP clients.\n\n488\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.970\nDHCP service dynamically\nupdate those records, and\n\n489\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.190\nthey will discard those records when\nthe lease is deleted once we set this up.\n\n490\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.340\nSo it automates the housekeeping\nprocess for us and keeps track of it.\n\n491\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.710\nSo enabling that is gonna be nice and\n\n492\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.810\nit's one of the additional things\nwe can do here for name protection.\n\n493\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:37.640\nSo there's a nice new feature.\n\n494\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.530\nSo we have that capability here.\n\n495\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.090\nWe have the ability to be able to filter.\n\n496\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.340\nThis is Mac address filtering,\n\n497\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.510\nI just mentioned the idea of\nMac security a moment ago.\n\n498\n00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.830\nSo you'll see here, enable allow\nthe DHCP service to provide it\n\n499\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.680\nto any Mac addresses in the list,\nand enable deny list.\n\n500\n00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.978\nDHCP services are denied.\n\n501\n00:23:54.978 --> 00:23:57.066\nSo we can do this based\non Mac address filtering.\n\n502\n00:23:57.066 --> 00:24:01.224\nThink about the logic of this, why would\nwe need to filter Mac addresses for\n\n503\n00:24:01.224 --> 00:24:02.153\nDHCP services?\n\n504\n00:24:02.153 --> 00:24:06.037\nHow do we communicate initially before\nwe get a DHCP sponsored address?\n\n505\n00:24:06.037 --> 00:24:09.788\nWe're broadcasting one thing to\nidentify is your Mac address, right?\n\n506\n00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:13.267\nSo for filtering Mac addresses here,\nwe can either ensure to enable\n\n507\n00:24:13.267 --> 00:24:16.770\nthat certain Mac addresses\nare definitely get services.\n\n508\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.430\nOr if we know for\nfact whether not be talking to strangers,\n\n509\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.330\nwe can block out certain Mac addresses\nthat we don't wanna to be talking to.\n\n510\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.040\nSo we can actually filter at the lowest\nlevel the common denominators to begin to\n\n511\n00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.210\nhave the conversation.\n\n512\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.220\nThat's another feature\nthat we can enable here.\n\n513\n00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.469\nSo that's kind of nice, so\nwe could see that, and go to advance here.\n\n514\n00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:37.633\nAnd we have our advance filter properties,\nand we actually can\n\n515\n00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:41.490\nlist all the hardware types,\nas you can see exempted from filtering.\n\n516\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.320\nThis allows us to go in and specify\nwhich network types and hardware types,\n\n517\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.170\nwhether it will not be allowed\nto be able connect and\n\n518\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.670\nbe filtered based on selection we make for\nsecurity.\n\n519\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.970\nYou'll notice by default, that we have\nalmost everything selected here, right?\n\n520\n00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.110\nThere's a whole bunch of unassigned\ncategories, meaning we can go in.\n\n521\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.690\nThat we can program in\nour own if we want to.\n\n522\n00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.308\nAnd these are older types.\n\n523\n00:25:02.308 --> 00:25:06.210\nWe have the Arcnet,\n\n524\n00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.930\nwe have lan star, right, we have\na whole bunch of different stuff here.\n\n525\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.380\nBut we maybe able to go in and program in\ncertain specific kinds of hardware, or\n\n526\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.020\nconfigurations that we wanna allow or\ndeny based on the filtering.\n\n527\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.470\nSo we could add this in.\n\n528\n00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.500\nYou don't simply get into\nthe advanced features very often,\n\n529\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.750\nprobably not something you normally do.\n\n530\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.690\nBut you may be able to go in and\ntake advantage of that if we need to.\n\n531\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.340\nWe do have the ability\nto set up fail over.\n\n532\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.160\nWe can delete, edit, or view the status\nof the fail over relationship.\n\n533\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.760\nNow, I haven't set fail over up yet.\n\n534\n00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.420\nWe'll be talking about how to do\nthis in upcoming conversation.\n\n535\n00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.443\nBut I can enable DHCPs, so\nthat is essentially going to\n\n536\n00:25:38.443 --> 00:25:41.877\nhave a highly available thought\nprocess associated with it.\n\n537\n00:25:41.877 --> 00:25:47.763\nSometimes in prior iterations\nof DHCP back in Server 2000,\n\n538\n00:25:47.763 --> 00:25:52.660\nMT4 2003 days,\nwe wanna talk about DHCP fill.\n\n539\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.050\nWe wanna talk about scope sharing,\nor an 80-20 rule,\n\n540\n00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.850\nyou would have heard\nreferred to different ways.\n\n541\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:02.730\nThe idea of co-hosting a scope, where\nessentially we would provide coverage for\n\n542\n00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.130\na scope across two servers.\n\n543\n00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.450\nSo if one went down,\n\n544\n00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.240\nwe'd have a percentage of those IP\naddresses available on the other server.\n\n545\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.770\nHopefully being able to service\nthe needs for renewal and\n\n546\n00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.510\nnew leases in the interim until\nwe could fix that, right?\n\n547\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.320\nBecause we didn't have a full failover,\nalmost like\n\n548\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.630\na highly available clustering thought\nprocess capability associated with DHCP.\n\n549\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.120\nIn later, more recent versions of the OS,\nwe've had this capability.\n\n550\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.340\nSo we can actually setup a failover\nrelationship, where we could specify\n\n551\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.240\nDHCP servers plural, that would be\nable to failover to each other.\n\n552\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.285\nIf one were to fail, the other one\nwould be able to take over and\n\n553\n00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:40.803\nmanage the entire scope and\nto continue on moving, or manipulating and\n\n554\n00:26:40.803 --> 00:26:42.820\nleasing IP addresses as a result.\n\n555\n00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.620\nSo we could set this up,\nand you'll see here.\n\n556\n00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.070\nLet's call a partner server,\n\n557\n00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.410\nthis is the other server in\nthe field of our relationship.\n\n558\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.574\nAnd we can specify whether\nit's a primary or secondary.\n\n559\n00:26:52.574 --> 00:26:56.133\nAnd then there's the result, if one stops,\nthe other one continuous working.\n\n560\n00:26:56.133 --> 00:27:00.184\nSo, we could set this up to have\na new feature and nice capability.\n\n561\n00:27:00.184 --> 00:27:04.000\nNot new new, but is newer,\nI should say and available to us for.\n\n562\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.940\nAnd you'll see this is for IPV4, right.\n\n563\n00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.870\nWe have capabilities aligned with\nthis in some respects for IPv6,\n\n564\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.200\nso we're doing this now just\nbased on the IPv4 stack.\n\n565\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.671\nJust looking at all of these properties.\n\n566\n00:27:13.671 --> 00:27:16.187\nAnd we have advanced here,\nand we can go in and\n\n567\n00:27:16.187 --> 00:27:18.315\nspecify where audit log path will be.\n\n568\n00:27:18.315 --> 00:27:21.495\nSo where we gonna put the audit log files,\nwe're going to take a look at that.\n\n569\n00:27:21.495 --> 00:27:23.475\nIf we wanna change binding sear and or\n\n570\n00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:27.305\ndo dynamic update, registration\ncredential manipulation, change those.\n\n571\n00:27:27.305 --> 00:27:29.410\nWe have the ability to go in and\ndo this as well.\n\n572\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.858\nSo we have all of these features,\n\n573\n00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:33.927\nall of these additional items that\nare available right here, right?\n\n574\n00:27:33.927 --> 00:27:36.864\nAnd if you saw,\nif I wanna configure fail over,\n\n575\n00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:39.860\nI could configure fail\nover right from here.\n\n576\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.160\nAnd I can replicate the fail over scope,\nso I can send the scopes across and\n\n577\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.850\nmake sure that they are available, right?\n\n578\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Lots of fun.\n\n579\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.018\n&gt;&gt; I know, it is lots of fun.\n\n580\n00:27:47.018 --> 00:27:49.829\nI mean there is just so\nmuch that you can do with DHCP.\n\n581\n00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:52.520\nAt first, when I was first learning it,\nI thought, great, I got it.\n\n582\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.654\nAnd then there's all these little,\nthe tangents that you could go off on.\n\n583\n00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:57.954\nAll those different options,\n\n584\n00:27:57.954 --> 00:28:01.004\nI wasn't even aware of all the different\noptions until reading the RFC.\n\n585\n00:28:01.004 --> 00:28:02.970\nI'm like, holy cow, that's insane.\n\n586\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.530\nWe have our normal ones that you\nspoke of that we normally stick to.\n\n587\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:08.530\nBut you have so many options.\n\n588\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.220\nAnd then even introducing like,\nyou had referenced, bind.\n\n589\n00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.250\nLike, hosting with Don on those shows.\n\n590\n00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.540\nThat was just an eye opener, so.\n\n591\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Setting up a non.\n\n592\n00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Non-DOS.\n\n593\n00:28:17.075 --> 00:28:17.829\n&gt;&gt; Non.\nWindows.\n\n594\n00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:19.484\n&gt;&gt; Non-Microsoft based DNS.\n\n595\n00:28:19.484 --> 00:28:21.604\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so, working the Internet,\n\n596\n00:28:21.604 --> 00:28:24.180\nnaming, daemon or bind,\nwhich is non-Microsoft.\n\n597\n00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.090\nFor soft DNS and the ability to be\nable to link to execute of that.\n\n598\n00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.290\nSounds we have a certain minimum\nbuild on the buy-in type, right?\n\n599\n00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.930\nVersion 2 point something or\nwhatever it is now.\n\n600\n00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.770\n&gt;&gt; And then they have flavors and\nvariants of that so [LAUGH].\n\n601\n00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nabsolutely you could do all of that.\n\n602\n00:28:37.095 --> 00:28:40.067\nNow just quickly since we're talking\nabout you know different options.\n\n603\n00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:44.000\nIPv6 doesn't have all the bells and\nwhistles that I just showed you for IPv4.\n\n604\n00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.340\nBut you could see here,\nwe do have DHCP audit logging.\n\n605\n00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.450\nThat is good.\n\n606\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.810\nWe do have name protection.\n\n607\n00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.070\nThat is available for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n608\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.680\nSo, that capability exists on both.\n\n609\n00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.080\nWe can do dynamic updates, and\n\n610\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.820\ndiscarding of dynamic updated\nrecords automatically in DNS.\n\n611\n00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.628\nSo we do have that capability.\n\n612\n00:29:00.628 --> 00:29:03.750\nUnder Advanced, you'll notice we do have\nthe ability to change the connection\n\n613\n00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.040\nbindings, the dynamic update\nregistration credentials.\n\n614\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.150\nBut notice that a lot of the other stuff\nwe were just talking about is not there.\n\n615\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.400\nThe fail over relationship in other words,\nright?\n\n616\n00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.790\nIs there for IPv4, not for IPv6 right now.\n\n617\n00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.392\nSo, if some of those things\nare limited based on what we're doing.\n\n618\n00:29:18.392 --> 00:29:25.295\nBut we do have the capabilities to be\nable to set up a great deal of features.\n\n619\n00:29:25.295 --> 00:29:29.570\nNew advanced items, and, or\nold stuff that's just been updated and\n\n620\n00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.400\nrefreshed for Server 16 to make sure\nthat our DHCP servers are backed up.\n\n621\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.130\nThat they're highly available,\nthat they are scalable, and\n\n622\n00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.220\nthat if something goes wrong,\nwe can recover them.\n\n623\n00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.230\nSo, we do have a lot of these features.\n\n624\n00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.760\nLet's just take a look here real quick.\n\n625\n00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.500\nAt the following, actually no,\nyou know what I want to do?\n\n626\n00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.370\nI want to do this, right up here.\n\n627\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.510\nLet's go here, and\n\n628\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:54.460\nlet's just do a quick backup, speaking\nof making sure things are good, right?\n\n629\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.160\nSo you'll see in System 32 DHCP backup,\nright?\n\n630\n00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.150\nThat's where we have our folder, right?\n\n631\n00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.650\nSo, you can go in there.\n\n632\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.350\nAnd when we do that, DHCP goes up\nto the strings and backs up for\n\n633\n00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.870\nus in other words.\n\n634\n00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.160\nWe don't have to worry about a complicated\nwizard with all sort of steps, bells and\n\n635\n00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.690\nwhistles, and crazy stuffs.\n\n636\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.751\nAnd it just goes off and\ndoes it's back up for us, right?\n\n637\n00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:19.511\nRemember this is the folder\nthat we were in.\n\n638\n00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:25.196\nAnd so it is gonna create for\nus in the backup folder a new backup.\n\n639\n00:30:25.196 --> 00:30:27.366\nIt will do that over time it will\nset itself up a schedule, and\n\n640\n00:30:27.366 --> 00:30:28.998\nthen it will just run in\nthe next few minutes.\n\n641\n00:30:28.998 --> 00:30:30.084\nAnd we will get a backup there.\n\n642\n00:30:30.084 --> 00:30:33.591\nSo it is gonna specify that we can run or\nthat we have that backup created over\n\n643\n00:30:33.591 --> 00:30:36.260\ntime, so we told it where to go,\nand what to do.\n\n644\n00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:42.350\nAnd if we had a problem And\nwe had to restore, right?\n\n645\n00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.290\nLet's say something went wrong, right?\n\n646\n00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.170\nWe could specify where the back up was,\ngo grab the back up file, and restore it.\n\n647\n00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.780\nNow, we may wanna export that back up,\ngrab it, take it off the System for\n\n648\n00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.330\nmigration purposes, some other things\nthat we may wanna do with that over time.\n\n649\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.559\nSo we may wanna have a backup that we\ncan make portable and take somewhere and\n\n650\n00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.901\nthen restore somewhere else.\n\n651\n00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:01.563\nAnd we can certainly talk about and\n\n652\n00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:04.965\nwe'll talk about how to do a DHCP\nmigration in upcoming episode.\n\n653\n00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:07.995\nBut we may actually wanna take it\nback up and have an externals, so\n\n654\n00:31:07.995 --> 00:31:09.035\nthat way we have options.\n\n655\n00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:11.665\nCuz if we wanna, we talked about\nthis decommissioning, right,\n\n656\n00:31:11.665 --> 00:31:12.705\nversus the authorizing.\n\n657\n00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:14.885\nIf we're ultimately gonna\ndecommission the server,\n\n658\n00:31:14.885 --> 00:31:18.042\nwe may have to take the server down,\nbacking it up before we do that.\n\n659\n00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:20.583\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n&gt;&gt; And do a restoration somewhere else,\n\n660\n00:31:20.583 --> 00:31:23.072\neither because of a BCDR\nevent of some kind.\n\n661\n00:31:23.072 --> 00:31:27.112\nA business continuity disaster recovery\nissue, and, or just because we're\n\n662\n00:31:27.112 --> 00:31:29.622\nswitching over infrastructure,\nwho knows what we're doing.\n\n663\n00:31:29.622 --> 00:31:30.860\n&gt;&gt; Unsupported paths.\n\n664\n00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.510\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of stuff.\n\n665\n00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.393\n&gt;&gt; Buy you're down grading all, yeah.\n\n666\n00:31:32.393 --> 00:31:36.365\n&gt;&gt; So we may just have to restore that\ninformation on a separate interface into\n\n667\n00:31:36.365 --> 00:31:37.810\na separate instance.\n\n668\n00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.880\nAnd we wanna have a backup\nthat would allow us to that.\n\n669\n00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.380\nSo it's important for\nus to think about that.\n\n670\n00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.830\nSince we're here just\nby way of wrapping up,\n\n671\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.600\nwe were talking about the ability to\ncreate options, and we had user classes.\n\n672\n00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.070\nSo we're gonna talk about user classes,\nwe can assign and\n\n673\n00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.680\ndefine user class information.\n\n674\n00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.349\nI showed you this option here,\nI'm just gonna come back here real quick.\n\n675\n00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:59.601\nAnd you'll see here define user classes,\nand vendor classes.\n\n676\n00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:02.728\nSo the idea with the user\nclass here You'll see for\n\n677\n00:32:02.728 --> 00:32:07.170\ninstance we have a couple of them\nright routing remote access boot p.\n\n678\n00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.056\nLet's just add one here.\n\n679\n00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:15.683\nWe can go in and create a class specific\nfor either the user and or for a vendor.\n\n680\n00:32:15.683 --> 00:32:20.350\nAnd the idea would be that When we\ndo this the vendor is typically\n\n681\n00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.490\neither we'll create them but normally\nvendor that are supported into have their\n\n682\n00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.690\nfunctionality that are being\ninserted will be added.\n\n683\n00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:31.287\nAnd we can use this to define ultimately\nwhat our information will be and\n\n684\n00:32:31.287 --> 00:32:33.670\nwhat is provided through the class.\n\n685\n00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.701\nSo for instance in just look\nat the one that's here, right?\n\n686\n00:32:40.265 --> 00:32:43.090\nActually it's right,\nthese are hard coded, I can't edit these.\n\n687\n00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.300\nSo let's actually do this really quick,\n\n688\n00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.220\nforgot the two that are built\nin we can't actually edit.\n\n689\n00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:53.959\nBut we can go in and\nwe can do the following.\n\n690\n00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:58.290\nSo if I just look at these while I'm\nadding, can I get, just go over there.\n\n691\n00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.160\nThere we go, right.\n\n692\n00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.779\nSo you'll see we have things like Windows\n2000, Windows 98, vendor specific options,\n\n693\n00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:04.816\nMicrosoft options.\n\n694\n00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.600\nThese are only from Microsoft initially.\n\n695\n00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.179\nBut these are specific options that\nthe vendor provides that are supported\n\n696\n00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:12.235\ntypically for backwards compatibility.\n\n697\n00:33:12.235 --> 00:33:15.657\nSo for Windows 98 or 2000 based clients.\n\n698\n00:33:15.657 --> 00:33:19.554\nThese are older clients that would have\ncertain features that would have to remain\n\n699\n00:33:19.554 --> 00:33:22.945\nenabled or be turned back on because\nmaybe they're no longer offered or\n\n700\n00:33:22.945 --> 00:33:24.060\nwho knows what.\n\n701\n00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.600\nBut we would then be able to provide\nthose and provide that information.\n\n702\n00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.802\nAnd so that's what these classes\nrepresent or the ability to add in\n\n703\n00:33:30.802 --> 00:33:34.135\nthese references and/or have this\nfunctionality available to us.\n\n704\n00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:37.413\nSo that as we go in, if you remember and\ntalked about different options,\n\n705\n00:33:37.413 --> 00:33:40.450\nwe have the ability to be able to\ndo more narrowly defined options.\n\n706\n00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.350\nSo if we start with the server,\ngo to the scope,\n\n707\n00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.380\nthen ultimately the user-defined\nclasses and the machine classes.\n\n708\n00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.140\nWe could be very specific about how\na certain machine with the reserve client\n\n709\n00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.550\nwill get that particular set of options,\nassignments.\n\n710\n00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.250\nSo our classes are gonna be helpful for us\nto do that and they let us work with their\n\n711\n00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.302\noptions to narrowly define how we're gonna\nconfigure a client and give them certain,\n\n712\n00:33:59.302 --> 00:34:03.902\n[COUGH] Preset information,\nthings like as I said, default gateway,\n\n713\n00:34:03.902 --> 00:34:07.956\nvendor specific setting that maybe\nthe vendor has to support and provide,\n\n714\n00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:12.225\nthat will configure that client a certain\nway but is not used by other clients.\n\n715\n00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:15.311\nSo it'd be a reserved client IP or\nreserved client lease that we would\n\n716\n00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:18.680\nprovide that particular option through and\nmake it unique to that client.\n\n717\n00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.720\nSo we have the capability of doing this.\n\n718\n00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.485\nWe define user classes only for\nIPv4 notice you could see there, right?\n\n719\n00:34:25.485 --> 00:34:29.000\nThey're not at the scope level for\nspecific by the IPv4 node.\n\n720\n00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.360\nAnd then we do not have user classes for\nIPv6 by the way.\n\n721\n00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.520\nIt's not currently we may in\nthe future we don't have them now.\n\n722\n00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.195\nAlthough we do have them at support for\nIPv4 so just so you know.\n\n723\n00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:41.710\nBut we could do this with\nan ipconfig command as well.\n\n724\n00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.430\nWe could do it from here but we can do\nwith an ipconfig command would you may or\n\n725\n00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.890\nmay not be aware of,\nI know I showed this to you at some point.\n\n726\n00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.690\nBut lets just open up a command\nprompt here one more time\n\n727\n00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.730\njust to remind you of this.\n\n728\n00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.550\nLet me just make this a little bit\nbigger so you guys can see this.\n\n729\n00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:01.022\nJust before we do anything,\nthere we go let's do send to console.\n\n730\n00:35:01.022 --> 00:35:03.078\nAll right, that's probably\na little bit easier to see.\n\n731\n00:35:03.078 --> 00:35:06.340\nAnd so if we do ipconfig, all right,\n\n732\n00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:12.150\nyou'll see that we do have the ability\nto set our class ID in here.\n\n733\n00:35:17.128 --> 00:35:22.931\nAnd you can see here we can go in and\ndo a set class ID and, [COUGH]\n\n734\n00:35:26.692 --> 00:35:30.410\nWe can specify that using IP config.\n\n735\n00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.775\nSo we do a class id.\n\n736\n00:35:31.775 --> 00:35:32.862\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n737\n00:35:32.862 --> 00:35:34.370\n&gt;&gt; And, or class id for\nversion six from IP config.\n\n738\n00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.710\nSo we can set these up, and\nwe could specify whether or\n\n739\n00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.760\nnot We enter them and set them up.\n\n740\n00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.100\nWe can do them from the console or\nwe can also go ahead and set them up, but\n\n741\n00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.810\nthis has to be from an elevated\ncommand prompt right?\n\n742\n00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.880\nRemember, we always have to\nrun this as an administrator.\n\n743\n00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.960\nWe could set them up here using\nipconfig as well if we choose to.\n\n744\n00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.451\nSo, that's up to us to\ndecide how we do it.\n\n745\n00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n746\n00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.915\nI didn't know that now I know.\n\n747\n00:35:55.915 --> 00:35:57.288\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Learning stuff.\n\n748\n00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.308\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember,\nnormally we can almost anything we do.\n\n749\n00:35:59.308 --> 00:36:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Like, I said DHCP has so much that.\n\n750\n00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.470\n&gt;&gt; It does, but we can normally do\nalmost probably anything we do plus\n\n751\n00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.790\nmore is the usual thought process.\n\n752\n00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.380\nEverything we do in the graphical\ninterface from the command line\n\n753\n00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.280\ntraditionally.\n\n754\n00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.660\nBut we usually have certain features,\nat least in most cases,\n\n755\n00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.800\nthere's certain things that can\nonly be done from a command line.\n\n756\n00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.565\nMaybe not always but sometimes.\n\n757\n00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:18.676\nBut everything we do in\nthe command line and\n\n758\n00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:22.544\nthe graphical interface typically is a lot\nof time is gonna be the same right but\n\n759\n00:36:22.544 --> 00:36:26.665\nthe command line may give us some\nadditional options, more often than not.\n\n760\n00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:30.320\nBut in this case we could do them from\neither place can set those options up,\n\n761\n00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.300\nspecify those class IDs or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n762\n00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.590\nAnd we can do either one, or\nuse either one I should say,\n\n763\n00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.840\nto be able to set them up.\n\n764\n00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.580\n&gt;&gt; Now I do know we have additional\ninformation to cover, but for\n\n765\n00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.150\nthis show we are gonna go ahead and\ncall it quits because we're out of time.\n\n766\n00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n767\n00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.354\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee

00:00:08.381\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:11.980\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.075\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Networking with\nWindows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:18.105\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:21.287\nIn this episode we're gonna\ncontinue taking a look at DHCP.\n\n8\n00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.209\nWe've actually made it to a part three.\n\n9\n00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:26.116\nAnd back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:27.962\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\ninviting me back for part three.\n\n12\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.300\nYou make it sound sometimes like you’re\nalmost amazed we made it to part three,\n\n13\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.597\nlike it was such a struggle to\nget through parts one and two.\n\n14\n00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:38.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully it wasn’t for you, and\n\n15\n00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:40.515\nhopefully you’re gonna enjoy\ncontinuing the DHCP journey with us.\n\n16\n00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.554\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We’re gonna continue on.\n\n17\n00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:47.330\nWe’ve got some additional features and\nbells and whistles we want to examine.\n\n18\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.820\nWe hinted at some of these already.\n\n19\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.816\nWe took a quick look at policies.\n\n20\n00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.364\nWe're gonna investigate\nthat a little bit more,\n\n21\n00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:56.943\ntalk about how we can use policy based\nassignment to give out different\n\n22\n00:00:56.943 --> 00:01:00.536\nscope options to different systems\nbased on a variety of conditions.\n\n23\n00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:03.190\nWe'll take a look at those\nscopes a little more detailed.\n\n24\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.964\nWe're gonna drill down,\ntake a look at superscopes.\n\n25\n00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.934\nTake a look at multicast scopes.\n\n26\n00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:10.661\nWe'll configure those, well not a mystery\nthere just really combining scopes\n\n27\n00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.400\ntogether that already exist into a larger\nblock for administrative purposes.\n\n28\n00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.120\nBut we'll go through that\njust to make sure you're\n\n29\n00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.470\ncomfortable with how that works.\n\n30\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.860\nAnd then, we're gonna talk about how to\nrevisit this idea that we talked about\n\n31\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.733\nin the last episode of failover.\n\n32\n00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.326\nAnd we're actually gonna go\nthrough configured DHCP failover.\n\n33\n00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:28.430\nGot two DHCP servers set up.\n\n34\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.122\nWe'll configure our failover solution,\ndelete the scope from one, set it up, and\n\n35\n00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:33.582\nthen replicate the scopes back.\n\n36\n00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:34.969\nShow you how all that works.\n\n37\n00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.800\nAnd then based on that, we should have\njust about completed our discussions\n\n38\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.299\naround DHCP at this level, for IPv4.\n\n39\n00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.787\nWe've been drilling in, really talking\nabout all the IPv4-based support.\n\n40\n00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:47.660\nAnd we're gonna do another episode.\n\n41\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.924\nYou'll come back and join us for\nthat hopefully, as well, around DHCPv6 and\n\n42\n00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:52.415\nhow to stand up and configure that.\n\n43\n00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:55.270\nSo gonna give that complete coverage.\n\n44\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.514\nAnd then of course based on\nthat we'll go through and\n\n45\n00:01:57.514 --> 00:01:59.250\nhave a lot of other things to talk about.\n\n46\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.740\nGot a lot of features in the Windows\nServer 16 stack with regards to networking\n\n47\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.095\nstill to come, things like IPv6, DNS.\n\n48\n00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:08.731\nCertainly we'll take a look at and\ntalk about IPAM and\n\n49\n00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.896\na bunch of other stuff including VPNs and\nadvanced networking,\n\n50\n00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:15.276\nthings like Hyper-V Networking\nwhich should be kind of cool.\n\n51\n00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:18.530\nBut you're gonna have to come back for all\nthat cus right now we're gonna talk about\n\n52\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.480\nDHCP and how we setup and\nwork with scopes.\n\n53\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.149\nSo you can join me here, and\n\n54\n00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.715\nyou'll see we're in our\nvirtual machine console again.\n\n55\n00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:31.689\nSame machine we used, same setup\nwe had in our prior conversation.\n\n56\n00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.330\nWe just modified this a little bit.\n\n57\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.124\nHave two scopes already created out,\nyou'll see them sitting there.\n\n58\n00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:40.021\nAnd what we're gonna do is first\njust talk a bit about policies.\n\n59\n00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.144\nI've got that highlighted right\ndown here in the console.\n\n60\n00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:44.670\nI just mentioned the idea behind policies.\n\n61\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.710\nIt's really the idea of giving or\nspecifying our ability through a set of\n\n62\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.832\nconditions that will stack up here,\neither ands and ors.\n\n63\n00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:54.160\nI wanna do this and this, have this or\n\n64\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.870\nthat, kind of a very simple\nthought process for us to match.\n\n65\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.260\nAnd then use that logic to drive our\nability to be able to go ahead and\n\n66\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.760\nspecify different IP devices that will\nreceive different options from our pool.\n\n67\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.890\nAnd so we're gonna go in and almost like\nat a firewall, set up a set of rules.\n\n68\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.212\nHere we call them policies, but\nessentially condition based solutions\n\n69\n00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.370\nwe'll match against to drive our\nability to be able to then manage and\n\n70\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.757\nmanipulate addressing and give out\naddresses and things of that nature.\n\n71\n00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:27.422\nSo I'm gonna right-click here on Policies\n&gt; New Policy, go ahead and create one.\n\n72\n00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:30.171\nAgain, we're in the IPv4 area here.\n\n73\n00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:33.219\nJust move this up so\nwe can see what's going on there, and\n\n74\n00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.740\nhave a understanding of what\nthe console wizard looks like.\n\n75\n00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.210\nWe'll give this a name,\nlike all good policies, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.840\nSo let's say that we call this,\nWindows Server\n\n77\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.198\n2008 R2 Policy or something like that.\n\n78\n00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:55.690\nSo maybe we're gonna target devices that\nare based around Windows Server 2008 R2.\n\n79\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.960\nOr maybe you're gonna create a policy for\nServer 12 R2 systems,\n\n80\n00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.760\nor print devices that you\nwanna be able to give\n\n81\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.110\nIP addresses out to based on\nsome sort of MAC address match.\n\n82\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.280\nKeep in mind, remember, and you'll see\nthis in a minute when we go through, but\n\n83\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.970\nwe're gonna have a lot of\nconditions that we can work with.\n\n84\n00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.226\nWe're gonna get those from our vendor and\nuser classes,\n\n85\n00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:15.684\nwe'd spoke about those yesterday.\n\n86\n00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:19.071\nOr rather, I should say in your time,\njust the prior episode, for\n\n87\n00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:20.440\nus it was yesterday.\n\n88\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.110\nBut just in a prior episode.\n\n89\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.120\nBut the idea being there if you\nremember the class conversation\n\n90\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.110\nthat vendors will often provide classes.\n\n91\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.020\nMicrosoft has some built in for Server\n2008, for Windows 98 things like that.\n\n92\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.220\nAnd the generic one's kind of a catch\nall for general class based options.\n\n93\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.087\nUser classes can be defined.\n\n94\n00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:42.906\nWe could go in and set up our own classes,\ndeclare are own variables and\n\n95\n00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:45.706\nthings that we want to use and\nassign through them.\n\n96\n00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:48.518\nAnd then we can use that\nto be able to go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:51.705\nto drive here,\nwhich is where we really link these.\n\n98\n00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:55.989\nAnd one of the key reasons why we may\ncreate class based solutions is to drive\n\n99\n00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:58.174\nthem Into our policy conversations.\n\n100\n00:04:58.174 --> 00:04:59.774\nSo we're gonna click Next here.\n\n101\n00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:02.640\nAnd we're gonna go in,\nconfigure our conditions for the policy.\n\n102\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.982\nNow just a quick word about what's here,\njust so you have a sense of this.\n\n103\n00:05:05.982 --> 00:05:07.915\nSo the idea here it says\npolicy creation or,\n\n104\n00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:10.697\nexcuse me, policy consists rather\nof one or more conditions.\n\n105\n00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:11.710\nWe talked about that.\n\n106\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.775\nAnd a set of configuration settings,\noptions, IP addresses,\n\n107\n00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:17.516\nwe talked about that,\nthat are distributed to a client.\n\n108\n00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:18.464\nWe know all that.\n\n109\n00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:22.011\nThe DHCP server delivers these\nspecific settings to clients if, or\n\n110\n00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.387\nthat match these conditions,\nif they match or that will match.\n\n111\n00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:26.644\nAnd so we'll set all that up.\n\n112\n00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:30.776\nBut the thing I wanted to point out to\nyou here, a little information item,\n\n113\n00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:34.779\npolicy with conditions based on\nfully qualified domain names, right,\n\n114\n00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.459\ncan have configuration settings for DNS,\nbut not for options or IP address ranges.\n\n115\n00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:42.101\nSo we have to think about how\nwe're gonna set this up and\n\n116\n00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:45.732\nwhat options we're gonna choose based\non the outcome we're looking for.\n\n117\n00:05:45.732 --> 00:05:49.792\nAnd we'll get into this and/or thing\ndown here in just a second, but\n\n118\n00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.525\nlet's start by adding\na policy condition in.\n\n119\n00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:56.111\nSo let's just grab this,\nlet's bring this up over here so\n\n120\n00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.098\nwe can see what we're going on.\n\n121\n00:05:58.098 --> 00:06:01.204\nWhat we're doing rather I should say,\nwe have our criteria,\n\n122\n00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:04.548\nI mentioned we could do this based\non vendor class, or user class,\n\n123\n00:06:04.548 --> 00:06:06.956\nwe also have MAC address,\nclient identifier.\n\n124\n00:06:06.956 --> 00:06:10.406\nThis is where that information item\nwe just took a look at comes in.\n\n125\n00:06:10.406 --> 00:06:15.783\nFQDN, or domain name could be a driver\nhere, as can a relay agent, right?\n\n126\n00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:19.194\nWe talked about how to setup DHCP\nrelay agents in our prior episode.\n\n127\n00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:22.168\nIf you haven't seen that,\nI encourage you to go back, take a look.\n\n128\n00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:24.975\nWe discussed and walked through\nthe logic of how to set one up.\n\n129\n00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:28.915\nWe used the routing of the mode access\nconsole to configure our DHCP relay\n\n130\n00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:29.633\ninterface.\n\n131\n00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:31.916\nWe bound two ethernet adapters to it.\n\n132\n00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.242\nOne on the LAN, one on the WAN,\n\n133\n00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:35.846\nand just kind of showed you\nthe logic of how to set all that up.\n\n134\n00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:38.280\nSo important for\nyou to go back and take a look.\n\n135\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.884\nBut we can do this with\nany one of these items.\n\n136\n00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:44.170\nWe have a total of six different\nitems here that we can choose from.\n\n137\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.360\nSo if we did, for instance, vendor class,\nwhich is our default as you'll see here.\n\n138\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.450\nWe have an operator, is it equal to or\nnot equal to, pretty straight forward.\n\n139\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.730\nYes no binary kind of match almost\nlike a firewall as I suggested.\n\n140\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.890\nIt's very simplistic but very effective\nway of driving the rule set here, or\n\n141\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.687\nthe conditions for the rule set.\n\n142\n00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:06.784\nValue, Microsoft 2000 based options,\nWindows 98 options,\n\n143\n00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:08.557\nand/or Microsoft options.\n\n144\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:12.728\nRemember, these are the default build in\nvendor, built-in vendor class options.\n\n145\n00:07:12.728 --> 00:07:14.226\nWe examined these yesterday.\n\n146\n00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.448\nI keep saying yesterday.\n\n147\n00:07:15.448 --> 00:07:17.637\nWe examined these in a prior episode.\n\n148\n00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.944\nBut we did take a look at the idea\nthat with the vendor class,\n\n149\n00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:23.732\nwe have these three default\nsolutions prebuilt.\n\n150\n00:07:23.732 --> 00:07:25.643\nWe could add our own in obviously but\n\n151\n00:07:25.643 --> 00:07:28.391\nthese are the ones that\nship with the DHCP product.\n\n152\n00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:30.594\nThey have been the same for some time now.\n\n153\n00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:35.399\nIf we choose Microsoft Options,\nwe could do a add here and\n\n154\n00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:40.116\njust specify that we have\nthose options pre-bundled.\n\n155\n00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:43.860\nYou'll see we can choose\nWindows 98 options.\n\n156\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.133\nWe can remove one.\n\n157\n00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:49.291\nLet's just say hypothetically,\nif we don't want to stack up multiples,\n\n158\n00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.150\nwe could do something\nlike a prefix wildcard.\n\n159\n00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.792\nWe could do append wildcards.\n\n160\n00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.800\nThese are mutually exclusive,\nas you can see.\n\n161\n00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.871\nSo we can work with these different\nsolutions, and if we say equals Windows 98\n\n162\n00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:04.247\noptions, Whatever the options are that are\ndeclared in the vendor class we would have\n\n163\n00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:07.620\nto be equal to those in order for\nthis condition to be applied.\n\n164\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.710\nSo we're creating a match that will allow\nus to specify, and so we'll click OK.\n\n165\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.390\nJust put that in.\n\n166\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.725\nVendor class equals Windows 98 options.\n\n167\n00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:17.855\nThis would be older platform support.\n\n168\n00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:20.705\nWindows 98, remember,\ngoes back to one of the original or\n\n169\n00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:24.085\nsome of the very first client\ndesktop support options.\n\n170\n00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:27.695\nBut we can decided that, you know what,\nhey I want to change that.\n\n171\n00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:30.045\nMaybe I wanna make that\nsomething different.\n\n172\n00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:33.045\nNo big deal.\nClick Edit, remove that, and maybe I just\n\n173\n00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:37.465\nwant to make that more generic and\nsay Windows Microsoft Windows options.\n\n174\n00:08:37.465 --> 00:08:40.840\nYou're broad but really not specific\nto a certain platform or category.\n\n175\n00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.010\nSo we can do that.\n\n176\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.060\nWe'll grab that, click OK.\n\n177\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.910\nPut that in there.\n\n178\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.780\nWe've changed that out and ended it.\n\n179\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.541\nNow, we can specify that if we have\nmore than one we could say add and\n\n180\n00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:53.252\nwe can add another one.\n\n181\n00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:56.080\nAnd we could say, you know what,\nnot just vendor class but\n\n182\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.500\nmaybe to renew vendor class, and\nwe're gonna do user class, right.\n\n183\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.829\nAnd we're gonna say,\nwe're gonna stack up a couple of these.\n\n184\n00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:06.610\nAnd we'll have to match all of these\nconditions will have to be stacked up and\n\n185\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.210\nmatched for us to them use this policy and\napply, right.\n\n186\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.090\nSo the idea is that we're gonna be able to\nset up the exact logic we're looking for.\n\n187\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.050\nSo let's just say,\nuser class equals and you'll see here\n\n188\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.620\neither the default boot p or\nthe default routing remote access class.\n\n189\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.860\nAgain the ones that are shipped or built\nin by default will just specify that.\n\n190\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.035\nWe'll click OK.\n\n191\n00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:30.472\nSo we're going to have to match\nboth of these or if we specify,\n\n192\n00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:32.400\nor it could be either one, right.\n\n193\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.660\nSo it's a question of just how we\nchoose to stack up our conditions or\n\n194\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.450\nconfiguring conditions that will have\nto be specified here as matching for\n\n195\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.300\nthe policy to be applicable.\n\n196\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.460\nThe idea behind it would be,\nif we have multiple systems coming in\n\n197\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.810\nwith different configurations,\nwe would do an or.\n\n198\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.470\nWe know that all of the conditions have to\nbe met for us to grant under this policy,\n\n199\n00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.480\nwe'd want to do an and and\nstack up our conditions as associated.\n\n200\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.990\nSo we'll specify those but\nnotice no particular order here.\n\n201\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.940\nWe don't care what order we process in,\n\n202\n00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.950\nwe just care about matching either one or\nall.\n\n203\n00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.276\nBut doesn't matter what order we\ngo through and do the comparison.\n\n204\n00:10:06.276 --> 00:10:09.133\nAnd you know how in some interfaces\nwe'll have that move up,\n\n205\n00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.486\nmove down opportunity right\nwhere we have to say,\n\n206\n00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:12.445\nhey we're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] priority.\n\n207\n00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.705\n&gt;&gt; Priority exactly and prioritize.\n\n208\n00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:18.125\nAnd we have to have this one at the top\ncuz it's always got to be this or\n\n209\n00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.195\nit's a first pass to the opposed match.\n\n210\n00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:23.405\nAnd so we want the most likely one at\nthe top because we want that order of\n\n211\n00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:25.830\nprecedence, doesn't apply or\nnot really important.\n\n212\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.190\nSo, just depends on the interface.\n\n213\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.580\nBut we're gonna go ahead and just leave\nthose in place, we'll click Next.\n\n214\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.488\nThen, this is where we, as we've\nalready done when we created our scope,\n\n215\n00:10:35.488 --> 00:10:37.733\nget into the idea of\nbeing able to specify.\n\n216\n00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:41.448\nOkay, now that we have our conditions and\nthe theory we're gonna match those,\n\n217\n00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:45.170\nlet's assume we show up and we do match\nthose, what are we gonna get as a result?\n\n218\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.420\nWhat's the prize?\n\n219\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.560\nFor us what's the give back, those are\nthe options that we're gonna specify that\n\n220\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.640\na machine or device that matches the set\nof conditions, winds up then getting.\n\n221\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.990\nAnd so we've been through the options\nas you remember in the last episode.\n\n222\n00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.103\nWe talked about not just options,\ntalked about and\n\n223\n00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:04.190\nshowed you a list of all the potential\noptions that are available.\n\n224\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.456\nKurt should go back and\ntake a look at that.\n\n225\n00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:08.440\nMaybe important for\nyou to have a note on that.\n\n226\n00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.580\nNo pun intended there, but\n\n227\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.710\nI know Cherokee has made those\navailable in the show notes.\n\n228\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.440\nBut we would go in and\nwe'd specify whatever options we want, and\n\n229\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.300\nas I scroll through here, you can see\nthat have a bunch of different options,\n\n230\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.990\nI would check off whichever one or\nwhichever group of options,\n\n231\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.790\ndoesn't really matter if\nyou do more than one.\n\n232\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.740\nWhichever one I wanna do I can\nadd classless static routes here,\n\n233\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.520\nI can, as you'll see, specify.\n\n234\n00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.430\nThere's an oldie.\n\n235\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.948\nSpecify a Finger server.\n\n236\n00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:39.170\nYou know what Finger was used for?\n\n237\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.670\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea actually.\n\n238\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.787\nThat's crazy.\nI was like did he just say Finger?\n\n239\n00:11:41.787 --> 00:11:42.603\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n240\n00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:45.990\nSo Fingers are a very\nold networking service.\n\n241\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.980\nThat is still around and\nthen it's still there, it's just buried,\n\n242\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.130\nnobody really thinks about it any more.\n\n243\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.390\nBut it runs on routers,\nit actually was a lookup service.\n\n244\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.990\nTo allow you to go out and get information\nabout certain systems back, or early,\n\n245\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.260\nearly on.\n\n246\n00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.600\nIt's not really used\ntraditionally much any more.\n\n247\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.180\nI mean, it is there, but It's just not\nsomething most people think about.\n\n248\n00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.730\nBut we have all these different options,\nright.\n\n249\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.320\nAnd so we can go in and\nwe get to specify a bunch of stuff.\n\n250\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.700\nThere's the worldwide server option for\na web server.\n\n251\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.920\nSee we'd specify in whatever you want.\n\n252\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.250\nHere's pop3 if we have a mail server.\n\n253\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.000\nAnd NTP for network news transport.\n\n254\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.650\nI don't have everyone of these options,\n\n255\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.090\nby the way, on that Word document list\nI gave you of the common options.\n\n256\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.240\nThat list was just a very short\nlist of commonly assigned ones.\n\n257\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.350\nThere are many, many, many more that\nare not on that list, that we just don't\n\n258\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.890\ntrip across very often cuz we just don't\nhappen to use them on a regular basis.\n\n259\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.750\nBut you get the general idea here, right.\n\n260\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.040\nWe would specify these.\n\n261\n00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.665\nAnd so let's just select one,\ncuz we're not gonna put all of these in.\n\n262\n00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:48.035\nBut let's just go ahead and\nwe'll choose one.\n\n263\n00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:52.635\nSo let's say NTP, network time\nprotocol server, for instance.\n\n264\n00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:55.925\nSo we can assign an NTP server,\nvery important.\n\n265\n00:12:55.925 --> 00:13:00.704\nBut we can go in,\nspecify a server name Call this NTP.,\n\n266\n00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:05.230\nlet's say practicelabs., whoops, .com.\n\n267\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.170\nAnd you see we can either resolve and\nor put in an IP address.\n\n268\n00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.900\nAnd we would have to go out and\nfind servers that are actually on\n\n269\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.500\nthe system there, right,\nso we can put all that in.\n\n270\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.330\nWhen we're done, right, and\nwe set that up, and I'll actually put in,\n\n271\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.220\nactually let me do the time offset,\ncuz that's not gonna be a problem.\n\n272\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.830\nThat way I don't have to worry about\nhaving an actual server set up for\n\n273\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.470\nit cuz we're not really running at NTP\nservice right now in the demo environment.\n\n274\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.470\nBut I'll just specify something easy like\na time offset, so we'll specify that but\n\n275\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.610\nyou get the general idea.\n\n276\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.260\nOnce I've done that,\nI'll have my settings down here.\n\n277\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.060\nAnd really,\nit's nothing more involved than just that.\n\n278\n00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.910\nI'm just gonna stack up my policies,\nright.\n\n279\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.120\nAnd then obviously, I'll have multiple\npolicies, so I can create a new one, and\n\n280\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.910\ngo in and set them up.\n\n281\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.760\nAnd I can deactivate a policy if I\nchoose to do that, leaving it in tact.\n\n282\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.350\nI can disable the policy and\nremove it if I choose to.\n\n283\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.170\nSo I have a few different options here.\n\n284\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.000\nBut this is how I setup policies.\n\n285\n00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.490\nNow if you're interested, I got\na little web [COUGH] reference here for\n\n286\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.530\nyou on policy setting,\n\n287\n00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.280\nspecifically different TTL values on lease\ndurations for different device types.\n\n288\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.985\nMaybe valuable for you to take a look.\n\n289\n00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:19.190\nGives you a little more detail about how\nyou may apply the use of policies in\n\n290\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.980\ncertain specific situations or\nscenarios that may be of interest to you.\n\n291\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.980\nAnd if you notice by the way\nthis is from a few years ago.\n\n292\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.670\nPolicies are not brand,\nbrand, brand, brand new.\n\n293\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.180\nThe concept's been around for a bit.\n\n294\n00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.744\nSo it's not something that\nnecessarily is debuting in 2016.\n\n295\n00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:39.463\nBut the idea is something that may be\nof value to you as you evaluate your\n\n296\n00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:40.670\nopportunities.\n\n297\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.990\nAnd your abilities to manage or\ndrill down on managing DHCP.\n\n298\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.790\nSo may be of interest to you,\nwe have that in the show notes for you.\n\n299\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.520\nIt's always important for you to go out\nand take a look there, see whether or\n\n300\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.140\nnot that may make sense to you.\n\n301\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.080\nAll right, so\nwe do have our IPv4 solution here.\n\n302\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.460\nWe set up our policies or\ncan enable them as you can see.\n\n303\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.890\nWhat we're gonna do, is go in and\n\n304\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.550\ntake a look at how to do some super scope,\nmulti scope, multi cast scope rather.\n\n305\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.920\nSo again on IPv4 we've got\nour two scopes set up here.\n\n306\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.860\nAnd what we're gonna do is right click.\n\n307\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.160\nAnd you'll see we can do a new\nsuper scope grouping, two or\n\n308\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.900\nmore of those individual scopes\ntogether so we can manage them broadly.\n\n309\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.930\nWe've got two scopes here.\n\n310\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.410\nAnd you'll see I've got my 1.0 and\n0.0 scopes for my different networks.\n\n311\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.340\nI'm gonna group them\ntogether into a Super Scope.\n\n312\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.177\nSo I'm just gonna right click here,\nas I was about to do.\n\n313\n00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.870\nGo to Super Scope here\nrun our little wizard.\n\n314\n00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.325\nAnd, again, the Super Scope concept\nhas been around for a long, long time.\n\n315\n00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:37.820\nThis is not new to DXUP in 2016.\n\n316\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.603\nSuper Scopes have been around probably,\nI'm guessing,\n\n317\n00:15:40.603 --> 00:15:43.970\nat least as far back as probably\nServer 2000, maybe in 2004.\n\n318\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.470\nThey've been around for some time.\n\n319\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.777\nIt's just an administrative concept of\ngrouping multiple scopes together to allow\n\n320\n00:15:49.777 --> 00:15:51.288\nus-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] them there?\n\n321\n00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:54.206\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, essentially expanding the number\nof IP addresses that are available.\n\n322\n00:15:54.206 --> 00:15:57.865\nAnd the scopes, we can manage them\na little more effectively so we can have\n\n323\n00:15:57.865 --> 00:16:01.348\ndistinct Scopes that are grouped\ntogether under a single name just for\n\n324\n00:16:01.348 --> 00:16:02.780\nadministrative purposes.\n\n325\n00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.668\nIt's really nothing more than that,\nit's just an administrative container,\n\n326\n00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:07.240\nit's like a sleight of hand thing.\n\n327\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.210\nBut it just makes it easier for\nus to manage when we have.\n\n328\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.640\nIf you imagine in the environment, in\nan enterprise that's got hundreds, perhaps\n\n329\n00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.122\nthousands of end points and multiple\nsubnets, as many large organizations will.\n\n330\n00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:21.090\nYou're gonna have a lot of scopes,\nif you think about the logic of that.\n\n331\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.582\nAnd as a result, especially you got\ndifferent geographical sites spread out.\n\n332\n00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:25.882\n[CROSSTALK] Different offices and\nthings like that.\n\n333\n00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:30.040\nYou're probably gonna have a scope per\nremote office, or per remote location.\n\n334\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.779\nAnd so you're gonna see tens, hundreds of\nscopes, since you log in potentially and\n\n335\n00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:37.516\nlook at DHCP management\nacross the enterprise,\n\n336\n00:16:37.516 --> 00:16:40.877\nif you're bringing up a whole\nbunch of different servers.\n\n337\n00:16:40.877 --> 00:16:44.717\nIf you think about the logic of the fact\nthat many of your domain controllers will\n\n338\n00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:46.310\nmost likely run DHCP.\n\n339\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.970\nBecause that way they're centralized\nin those AD sites from a replication\n\n340\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.960\nperspective, they're gonna have access to,\nand understanding of the topology.\n\n341\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.604\nYou're gonna be able to then path\nusers in those active directory sites,\n\n342\n00:16:57.604 --> 00:16:59.795\nwhich are essentially subnet boundaries.\n\n343\n00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:02.083\nMore often than not over\nto those DHCP servers,\n\n344\n00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:04.207\nwell you manage those subnet based scopes.\n\n345\n00:17:04.207 --> 00:17:07.831\nIt makes a lot of sense for you to\nsee scopes that are aligned with your\n\n346\n00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:10.256\ngeography, and with your site boundaries.\n\n347\n00:17:10.256 --> 00:17:11.680\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n348\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.027\na lot of other things as we expand\na conversation here back out into some of\n\n349\n00:17:16.027 --> 00:17:20.610\nthe infrastructure platform products\nlike System Center Config Manager.\n\n350\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.790\nWhere we will use AD site boundaries to be\nable to set up and manage our collections.\n\n351\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.720\nAnd our ability to be able to set up our\nsite servers, do all sorts of stuff.\n\n352\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.380\nThose things become important, so\n\n353\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.690\nwe see that we may potentially\nhave a lot of subnets.\n\n354\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.330\nAnd as a result, super scopes may just add\n\n355\n00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.550\na layer of ease to our management burden\nbecause they may simplify things.\n\n356\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.550\nThat's usually traditionally\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n357\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.220\nSo when we create this,\nwe would call this-\n\n358\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.420\n&gt;&gt; I like simple.\n\n359\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.250\n&gt;&gt; You like simple.\n\n360\n00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:47.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n361\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.357\n&gt;&gt; So then as long as you're happy,\n\n363\n00:17:49.357 --> 00:17:50.221\nCherokee.\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n\n364\n00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:51.973\n&gt;&gt; That's our main goal here is we wanna\n\n365\n00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:54.350\nkeep you happy.\nSo let me create the scope, so\n\n366\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.700\nwe can see how it works.\n\n367\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.740\nVery, very easy.\n\n368\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.390\nWhat do you want to call our super scope?\n\n369\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.040\n&gt;&gt; Let's call it-\n&gt;&gt; Want to call it simple scope?\n\n370\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.430\nSure.\n&gt;&gt; Simple scope.\n\n371\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.050\nSo simple scope.\n\n372\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.290\nAll right, so go ahead and\nname it simple scope.\n\n373\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.100\nOf course, spelling simple scope\ncorrectly would probably be good.\n\n374\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.180\nBut that's close enough.\n\n375\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.200\nYou'll see that we do have our\navailable scopes here, right?\n\n376\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.260\nAnd so you'll see I'm just\ncontrol clicking to select.\n\n377\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.290\nAs I said, literally you can create\na super scope with one scope.\n\n378\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.390\nBut why would you do that?\n\n379\n00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.326\nI mean essentially,\n\n380\n00:18:23.326 --> 00:18:26.580\nyou're just managing the same scope\nwith another layer of attractions.\n\n381\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.720\nSo you typically wanna have\nat least two scopes there.\n\n382\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.340\nSo we do have two scopes pre created.\n\n383\n00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.190\nWe're gonna add those in, but\nkeep in mind you could have a lot scopes.\n\n384\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.718\nI only created two but\nwe could have a lot more.\n\n385\n00:18:35.718 --> 00:18:38.054\nWe would add those in here, as well, okay?\n\n386\n00:18:38.054 --> 00:18:41.916\nSo we're gonna do that, and click Next.\n\n387\n00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:44.460\nAnd then we're just gonna go ahead and\nclick Finish.\n\n388\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.080\nAnd once we've done that, we know\nhave our super scope simple sciope,\n\n389\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.018\ncuz I spelt it with an i there.\n\n390\n00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:54.537\nBut you could see that once we've done\nthat, let me just move this over so\n\n391\n00:18:54.537 --> 00:18:55.178\nyou can see.\n\n392\n00:18:55.178 --> 00:18:58.391\nWe've now just taken our two\nscopes that before were sitting\n\n393\n00:18:58.391 --> 00:19:00.940\nout here essentially as individual scopes.\n\n394\n00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.470\nAnd just bundled them\nup under this object,\n\n395\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.310\nit's just another folder in the interface\nthat allows us to see them all, and\n\n396\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.260\nto manage them as\na administrative container.\n\n397\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.670\nReally no greater mystery than that.\n\n398\n00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.070\nNothing additional to it.\n\n399\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.200\nIt's just a simple form of\nhousekeeping and uncluttering,\n\n400\n00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.660\nor to Cherokee's point,\nsimple and easy, right?\n\n401\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.831\nAll right, so\nwe do have our super scope there,\n\n402\n00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:24.801\nyou could see our super scope components.\n\n403\n00:19:24.801 --> 00:19:27.370\nWe could look at statistics of the scope.\n\n404\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.590\nSo we can go in, and we can see on the\nsuperscope, how many scopes make it up,\n\n405\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.200\nhow many addresses are bundled\nbetween the multiple scopes.\n\n406\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.500\nI kept them very small,\nabout 20 addresses each.\n\n407\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.620\nThey're not real big.\n\n408\n00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.390\nHow many are in use,\nhow many are available?\n\n409\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.096\nSo we're aggregating the data for\n\n410\n00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:44.940\nall the individual scopes that\nare components of the super scope.\n\n411\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.430\nWhen we look at statistics here, we could\ndrill in and look at statistics on each\n\n412\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.610\nindividual subscope in theory,\nif you wanted to do that.\n\n413\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.517\nReferring each scope member of the super\nscope is the subscope, just so\n\n414\n00:19:54.517 --> 00:19:55.930\nyou know what I was talking about.\n\n415\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.315\nSo we could drill down,\nwe could see that there.\n\n416\n00:19:59.315 --> 00:20:02.890\nWe can create new scopes within the super\nscope container the same way we would\n\n417\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.480\njust, by coming up here and\ncreating a brand new scope.\n\n418\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.512\nThe only difference is,\nif we do it up in the IPv4 level,\n\n419\n00:20:08.512 --> 00:20:12.306\nthe scope will sit up under IPv4\noutside of the super scope container,\n\n420\n00:20:12.306 --> 00:20:14.360\nuntil we decide to integrate it.\n\n421\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.040\nWe do it in the super scope container.\n\n422\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120\nWe're just putting it into\nunderneath the IPv4 object, but\n\n423\n00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.590\nit's gonna be specifically tied\nto the super scope container.\n\n424\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.270\nIt's just a matter of\nwhere we put the scope.\n\n425\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.400\nSo just so you know.\n\n426\n00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.850\nBut we have that, and you'll see we can\nconfigure fail over both at the IPv4\n\n427\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.490\nlevel for any scopes that are outside\nall scopes in other words.\n\n428\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.960\nAnd specific to just a super scope\nobject with it's own scopes, and\n\n429\n00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.140\nhave that fail over so\nwe can have that running.\n\n430\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.800\nWe'll get into fail over and\ntalk about that in just a little bit.\n\n431\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.160\nSo we have all of those options here.\n\n432\n00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.466\nWe can deactivate the scope,\n\n433\n00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:51.035\nthe super scope containers\nlike we do individual scopes.\n\n434\n00:20:51.035 --> 00:20:54.370\nAnd when we look at properties,\nwe really don't see anything at\n\n435\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.420\nall with the exception of just\nthe name of the super scope.\n\n436\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.880\nAnd if I wanted to fix that spelling, I\ncould go in and do that, it'd be up to me.\n\n437\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.710\nBut, remember all it is is a container,\nall the options, all the settings,\n\n438\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.410\nall the things associated with scopes are\nlinked to the individual scope components\n\n439\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.180\nthat are members of the super scope.\n\n440\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.070\nThe super scope itself doesn't really do\nanything, other than provide a container\n\n441\n00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.000\nthat aggregates the scopes to make\nCDs here for us to manage them.\n\n442\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.980\nSo, just so you see what that is and\nyou're familiar with that.\n\n443\n00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.720\nWe do have one other kind of scope we just\nwanted to take a look at really quickly\n\n444\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.870\nhere, which would be our multicast scope.\n\n445\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.470\nNow we talked about multicasting.\n\n446\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.070\nJust need to bring this\nup while we're talking.\n\n447\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.410\nWe talked about multicasting\nas one of the potential things\n\n448\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.860\nthat exists or that we do and\nwe use class D IP addresses for.\n\n449\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.490\nAnd we did our IPv4\noverview in prior episodes.\n\n450\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.650\nWe spoke about the different IP classes.\n\n451\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.140\nA, B, C, D and E.\n\n452\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.780\nWe said that Class D is used\ntraditionally for the multicasting\n\n453\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.740\nof system information, streaming media,\ndesktop imaging, things of that nature.\n\n454\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.670\nSo we could set up a multicasting\nscope if we choose to.\n\n455\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.805\nJust click Next here,\nand give this a name.\n\n456\n00:21:57.805 --> 00:22:03.298\nLet's just do, Whoops, there we go,\n\n457\n00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:08.620\nmulticast scope 1 or\nwhatever we wanna call it.\n\n458\n00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.030\nClick Next, have to put in our starting\naddress and our ending address.\n\n459\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.200\nRemember, the multicast range is\nthe 224 range through 239 range,\n\n460\n00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.530\nvalued for the first octet, right?\n\n461\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.650\nSo we have that noted here,\n224 through 239.\n\n462\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.956\nSo we can put in 224.0 .1.1.\n\n463\n00:22:27.956 --> 00:22:31.831\nAnd then let's see,\n\n464\n00:22:31.831 --> 00:22:38.940\nwe go 224.0.1.25, right?\n\n465\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.145\nSomething like that, whatever it may be.\n\n466\n00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:44.255\nSmall scope, we don't need a lot, but\nyou get the idea just to show you.\n\n467\n00:22:44.255 --> 00:22:47.448\nWe do have a TTL here that will\nspecify the number of routers that\n\n468\n00:22:47.448 --> 00:22:50.610\nthe multicast traffic passes\nthrough on your network.\n\n469\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:55.110\nSo our TTL will specify the amount of\ntime that those packets can exist.\n\n470\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.891\nAll right, so we'll do that.\n\n471\n00:22:57.891 --> 00:22:59.190\nAre we gonna add exclusions?\n\n472\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.060\nWe've talked about that.\n\n473\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.320\nWe've specified exclusions in our\nother scopes at least looked at them.\n\n474\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.610\nWe're not gonna exclude any addresses.\n\n475\n00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.920\nBut if we had a reason to, we could.\n\n476\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.750\nlisteration you know that.\n\n477\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.430\nYou'll see here by the way that\nlisteration is different by default,\n\n478\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.060\nthat it is for a normal scope option.\n\n479\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.040\nOur normal scope when we set it up is\nusually eight days by default in Windows.\n\n480\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.750\nYou'll see here for\na multicast scope it is 30 days.\n\n481\n00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.100\nMaybe an important distinction for you to\nknow certainly in the real world, it could\n\n482\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.920\nalso be a testable item that may come up\nat some point, so maybe good to know that.\n\n483\n00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.750\nThat the lease duration is gonna be 30\ndays on a multicast scope by default.\n\n484\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.160\nWe can modify that of course,\nbut just keep that in mind.\n\n485\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.240\nNext, and then are we gonna activate that,\nyes or no?\n\n486\n00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.500\nChoose to activate\nthe scope if we choose to.\n\n487\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.960\nSo we'll just go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n488\n00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.087\nClick Finish.\n\n489\n00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:49.640\nLet's get our scope out there,\ntake just a second.\n\n490\n00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.640\nSo there is our multicast scope up there.\n\n491\n00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.787\nLet me just get that out of the way.\n\n492\n00:23:52.787 --> 00:23:55.571\nThere's our multicast\nscope right up there.\n\n493\n00:23:55.571 --> 00:23:57.036\nYou can see it.\n\n494\n00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:59.870\nWe look at our address pool, right?\n\n495\n00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.496\nAnd we have any address leases.\n\n496\n00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:05.510\nYou'll see right now we don't have any,\nbut you'll see they're there.\n\n497\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.970\nSo we have all that set up, ready to go.\n\n498\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.480\nAnd if we wanted to,\nyou'll see I can deactivate.\n\n499\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.620\nI haven't really deactivated before but\nsince we did this,\n\n500\n00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.780\nwe'll just show you quickly.\n\n501\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.280\nI can go and deactivate,\nwant to deactivate a scope here.\n\n502\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:19.830\nClick on it.\n\n503\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.060\nScope is currently active.\n\n504\n00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.420\nDeactivating or disabling prevents\nclients from obtaining IP's.\n\n505\n00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.870\nYes, I want to do that.\n\n506\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.330\nGreat.\nSo that's been done, you know?\n\n507\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.200\nIt's kind of hard to see.\n\n508\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.340\nBut there's a little circle right at\nthe edge of the folder there on the right,\n\n509\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.760\na little red kind of line point down.\n\n510\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.340\nThat, I'm kind of pointing to and\nhovering right over it, right there.\n\n511\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.060\nThat means it's.\n&gt;&gt; Your eyesight is better than mine.\n\n512\n00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that's just because\nI know it's there, right?\n\n513\n00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.800\nSo you can see, it's kind of a little\nbit better when you go full screen.\n\n514\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.420\nBut it's sitting right there,\nI'm just pointing to it.\n\n515\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.490\nIt's very very small.\n\n516\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.720\nThat indicates that it\nhas been deactivated.\n\n517\n00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.430\nBut remember, deactivation does\nnot mean hey let's delete that,\n\n518\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.680\nit simply means that we're not\nactively using it right now.\n\n519\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.150\nSo you can see that we've\nkind of pulled that out.\n\n520\n00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.000\nIt's available,\nwe can reactivate it if necessary.\n\n521\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.650\nJust right click on it,\nbring it back up, no big deal.\n\n522\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.580\nAnd we would be able to do that if we\nwanted to as you can see here, just go and\n\n523\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.420\nchoose activate, we would be able to\nbring that back online with no trouble.\n\n524\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.440\nSo, if we had to take the server down for\na period of time, maybe because we're\n\n525\n00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.570\ndoing maintenance or something,\nwe may just decide to leave the system.\n\n526\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.100\nUp and running in the sense that\nall the scopes are available,\n\n527\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.410\neven though we may restart it.\n\n528\n00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.920\nWe may deactivate it for a period of time,\n\n529\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.630\nbecause maybe we're going to\ndo work in that subnet, and\n\n530\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.160\nwe don't want to be giving out addresses\nuntil we figure out what's going on.\n\n531\n00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.540\nSo there are reasons why we\nmay choose to deactivate it.\n\n532\n00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.980\nIt would be up to us to decide.\n\n533\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.680\nWhat we wanna do.\n\n534\n00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.630\nAll right so we've talked about\nscopes,we've talked about policies,\n\n535\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:42.740\nwe do have to talk about fail over and how\nto set up high availability whether we use\n\n536\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.660\nDHCP clustering,\nwhether we use split scopes, whether we do\n\n537\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.580\nDHCP fail over, we do have some options,\nbut the one thing we don't have is enough\n\n538\n00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.930\ntime to cover that topic in depth before\nwe have to break for another episode.\n\n539\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, I saw what you did right there.\n\n540\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.860\n&gt;&gt; You liked that?\n\n541\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.210\nThat was pretty cool.\n\n542\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.470\nSo we're gonna step away for\njust a couple minutes.\n\n543\n00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.430\nWe're gonna come back with yet\nanother episode.\n\n544\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.859\nCherokee's gonna be super excited\nthat we live to see part four.\n\n545\n00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:09.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna come back, do that, and\n\n546\n00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.000\nwe're gonna talk specifically about\nhow we deal with high availability.\n\n547\n00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.840\nAnd we'll show you how to\nenable fail over for DHCP.\n\n548\n00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.770\nSo please do come on back and join us.\n\n549\n00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.440\n&gt;&gt; But I guess I really don't have\nanything else to say, Adam said it all.\n\n550\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.510\nSo you heard the man, so, join us.\n\n551\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Come on, make up something cool.\n\n552\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.410\nSay something interesting.\n\n553\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Something interesting.\n\n554\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.185\n&gt;&gt; There, you see.\nYou had something to say.\n\n555\n00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.070\n[LAUGH].\nThere you go.\n\n556\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.760\n&gt;&gt; Alright, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n557\n00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.270\nJoin us next episode.\n\n558\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.150\nPart four.\n\n559\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.360\nBut for this show we are going\nto go ahead and sign out.\n\n560\n00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.730\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Booths.\n\n561\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Burton.\n\n562\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.610\n&gt;&gt; See you next time at ITProTV.\n\n563\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.685\n&gt;&gt; You wanna be Rosa or Dora?\n\n564\n00:26:39.685 --> 00:26:41.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Dora.\n\n565\n00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.393\n&gt;&gt; Dora?\nOkay, I'm gonna be Rosa, okay.\n\n566\n00:26:44.393 --> 00:26:50.411\n[MUSIC]\n\n567\n00:26:50.411 --> 00:26:52.340\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.173\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:11.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.222\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:17.560\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.970\nIn this episode we will\ncontinue talking about DHCP and\n\n8\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.580\nspecifically we'll begin looking at\nhigh availability options for DHCP.\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.940\nBack in studio with us today is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.700\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.280\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.650\nHopefully your doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.260\nGlad that you could be with us.\n\n14\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.460\nAnd to continue our conversations\naround DHCP specifically\n\n15\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.490\nas Cherokee indicators of\nhigh availability options.\n\n16\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.650\nYou know we have options,\nthat's the good news.\n\n17\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.985\nWe can make choices about how we secure\nand protect our DHCP infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:50.735\nWe can setup a DHCP cluster, traditional\nclustering on Windows can be used to\n\n19\n00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:56.110\nbackend our DHCP services and maintain\nviability and high availability for them.\n\n20\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.630\nWe could set up a two\nmember fail over cluster.\n\n21\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.500\nYou're limited to two\nmembers in the cluster.\n\n22\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.700\nBut we could set that up.\n\n23\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.520\nWe'd have to have that DHCP\nserver installed on both,\n\n24\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.470\nwith identical scopes, and then the DHCP\nconfiguration is stored on shared storage,\n\n25\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.240\nso that either member of the cluster\ncan access it during a fail over.\n\n26\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.860\nThe other cluster essentially just detects\nor the other member of the cluster rather\n\n27\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.450\ndetects the failure event and\nthen primary server goes down let's say.\n\n28\n00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.180\nOur standby server detects the failure\nevent, activates the DHCP service.\n\n29\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.780\nReads the config information,\nbrings up the other instance, there's\n\n30\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.020\na small delay while we fill over but,\npretty traditional thought process there.\n\n31\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.430\nWe certainly can set that up,\nwe can use what are called split scopes we\n\n32\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.540\ntalked about this on one\nof our prior episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.030\nYears ago we use to refer to this as\neither a split scope, the 80-20 rule where\n\n34\n00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.101\nyou would essentially split up your scope\nin some form not necessarily 80-20.\n\n35\n00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:51.560\nBut however and you would then allow for\n\n36\n00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.170\neach server to control a portion of\nthe overall scope so that way if one\n\n37\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.920\nside of the equation was to go offline we\nwould still have the ability to lease and\n\n38\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.700\nmanage at least partial scope\ninformation would be available.\n\n39\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.670\nPartial addresses from\nthe scope lock would be there.\n\n40\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.640\nSo we have an entire range of IP\naddresses assigned to each server.\n\n41\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.840\nThey're both active on the network and\non the system in real time.\n\n42\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.460\nWhich one is the primary one is\na manner of how we designate that.\n\n43\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.210\nWe set the delay configuration attribute\n\n44\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.810\non the advanced tab of the scope\nproperties and the secondary server.\n\n45\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.620\nI showed you that delay attribute at\nsome point when we were talking and\n\n46\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.940\ngoing through the options, we would set\nthat up and say specify a certain amount\n\n47\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.930\nof delay that would indicate that,\nthat would be the secondary.\n\n48\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.880\nSo, we'll do that on the secondary server.\n\n49\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.570\nThat delay indicates that it\nwon't respond immediately.\n\n50\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.410\nThe primary one would have no delay or\na smaller delay factor.\n\n51\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.260\nThat will be the primary server\nif we set it up that way.\n\n52\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.730\nAnd then as a result, if the primary fails\nor stops responding for some reason,\n\n53\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.540\nthe secondary server will respond.\n\n54\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.790\nBut takes a little bit longer, but the\nidea is that it will still get there and\n\n55\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.180\nthe clients will be able to interact for\nthat period of time.\n\n56\n00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.030\nHopefully until we can fix the problem\nand, excuse me, bring it back on line.\n\n57\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.940\nWe can also set up which we're gonna\ndo and we've been talking about,\n\n58\n00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.390\nDHCP failover, gonna show you\nhow to do that in just a moment.\n\n59\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.390\nThe idea here and this is new to 2016,\nthe DHCP failover concepts,\n\n60\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.750\nso these other two options we just talked\nabout have been around for some time.\n\n61\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.590\nRight, setting up\na Windows based cluster for\n\n62\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.690\nDHCP using this idea of having two\nservers in the central splitting scope.\n\n63\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.650\nThese options have been around for,\nin many cases, years,\n\n64\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.925\nbut the concept to fill over is new.\n\n65\n00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:32.630\nAnd so specifically managing\nthis through the DHCP console,\n\n66\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.440\nconfiguring fail over, is gonna be\na little bit of a new thought process.\n\n67\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.120\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna establish the relationship.\n\n68\n00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.910\nIt's like a cluster in the sense\nthat we can only use two servers\n\n69\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.410\nto establish the relationship.\n\n70\n00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.910\nSo a fail over service\nrelationship involves two servers.\n\n71\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.592\nWe will sync them up,\nwe will replicate our scopes, and\n\n72\n00:03:49.592 --> 00:03:52.320\nensure that they're\navailable on both sides.\n\n73\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.420\nWe give the replication relationship\na unique name, whatever we call it,\n\n74\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.840\nwe'll take a look at that when we\nconfigure it here in just a minute.\n\n75\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.530\nAnd once we do that, we will have our\nability to then specify that if the server\n\n76\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.220\nwere to go down, the other server that's\non the other end of that relationship can\n\n77\n00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.650\nprovide these services or provide\nthe scope related support necessary for\n\n78\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.190\nclients to continue operating.\n\n79\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.600\nAnd a single sever can have multiple\nfail over relationships by the way.\n\n80\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.470\nWe can have a one-to-one relationship\nwith another partner but\n\n81\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.930\nwe'll get a multiple\none-to-one relationships.\n\n82\n00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.850\nSo I could be a member of multiple fail\nover relationships with different servers\n\n83\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.410\nproviding support for different\nscopes across my enterprise based on\n\n84\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.450\nthe geography, thought process we\nshared with you in the last episode.\n\n85\n00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.240\nYou know maybe remote offices,\nindividual DHCP servers by subnet or\n\n86\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.770\nby geography or region.\n\n87\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.260\nAnd I could specify that I have\n\n88\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.830\na relationship with several of\nthem from a central server.\n\n89\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.090\nThat would be the fail back server,\nright, if something were to go wrong and\n\n90\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.750\nI would then be able to use that\nserver in a pinch to be able to\n\n91\n00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.030\nprovide scope support until\nwe fix the local server.\n\n92\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.250\nSo we could think of it that\nway if wanna go down that road.\n\n93\n00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.435\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's just take a look at how we do this.\n\n94\n00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.495\nLet's go in there, let me just switch over\nthere so I can quickly throw an eye on my\n\n95\n00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.565\nnotes and get a couple pieces of\ninformation that I need along the way.\n\n96\n00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:13.125\nAll right, so we're in our console here,\nnotice I'm on plab DC02.\n\n97\n00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.555\nThis is the machine we've been demoing\non some other episodes for you,\n\n98\n00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:17.825\nwe're gonna continue using it.\n\n99\n00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:19.315\nWe do still have our super scope there,\n\n100\n00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:21.785\nyou may recognize that\nfrom our prior episode.\n\n101\n00:05:21.785 --> 00:05:25.564\nWe're gonna configure this to connect\nout to this other machine right here\n\n102\n00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:26.440\nPlab DC01.\n\n103\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.510\nThis will be our other machine that\nwe're going to create the fail over\n\n104\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.730\nrelationship with.\n\n105\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.780\nNotice here, currently no scope.\n\n106\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.020\nNo scopes set up.\n\n107\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.650\nNo super scopes certainly but\nwe are going to set this up and\n\n108\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.130\nreplicate assuming that\neverything is successful.\n\n109\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.400\nSo we're going to come back\nto that in just a moment.\n\n110\n00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.510\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's configure this.\n\n111\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.370\nWe're gonna right click\nup here on the IPv4 node.\n\n112\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.050\nWe're gonna come in,\nyou'll see we can configure failover and\n\n113\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.210\nwe'll do that first.\n\n114\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.000\nWe'll talk about replicating our\nfailover scopes once we've got\n\n115\n00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.370\nthe configuration up and running.\n\n116\n00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.800\nSo kind of a two step\nthought process here, right?\n\n117\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.410\nSo we'll configure failover.\n\n118\n00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.110\nJust go ahead we'll get\nthe wizard started here.\n\n119\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.740\nIt'll take just moment.\n\n120\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.190\nOnce we get that up and\nwe will then be able to click Next,\n\n121\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.060\nwe'll provide the name, in this case,\nPlab DC1 machine as our target, so\n\n122\n00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.980\nwe'll provide the Plab DC1 name\nthat we will target, there we go.\n\n123\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.676\nAll right, so let's just move this\nup over here for just a second so\n\n124\n00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:19.880\nwe kinda see that.\n\n125\n00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.200\nAll right, so we've got, and\nlet's scroll down here so\n\n126\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.920\nyou can see what's going on,\nintroduction to our DHCP failover wizard.\n\n127\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.970\nSo we just have the beginning step here.\n\n128\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.800\nHigh availability for\n\n129\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.030\nthe services by synchronizing IP address\nlease information, good to know.\n\n130\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.889\nKinda walks us through the setup here,\nselect from the following list of scopes\n\n131\n00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.885\nwhich are available to be configured for\nhigh availability,\n\n132\n00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:44.300\nscopes already configured for\nhigh availability are not displayed.\n\n133\n00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.590\nSo we do have two scopes that\nare available to us in our super scope,\n\n134\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.730\nthe two scopes we worked with earlier,\nthe 0001.\n\n135\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.410\nYou'll notice they are available there,\nnotice select all.\n\n136\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.860\nIf I wanted to unselect,\nbecause perhaps I had multiple scopes, and\n\n137\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.120\nI only wanted, let's see, out of five or\nsix, only wanted two or three,\n\n138\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.370\nI would simply highlight and select here.\n\n139\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.290\nBut, you know, by default, all scopes\navailable are listed and their chosen.\n\n140\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.810\nSo we assume that you\nwant to replicate out and\n\n141\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.590\ncreate high availability\naround all those scopes.\n\n142\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.460\nSo we'll leave that intact and\njust choose there.\n\n143\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.650\nWe'll click Next.\n\n144\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.270\nWe then have to specify\nour partner server.\n\n145\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.300\nSo you'll see nothing there.\n\n146\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.910\nWe're gonna program that in.\n\n147\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.850\nWe'll add this here.\n\n148\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:28.010\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll type in plabdc01 practiselabs.com.\n\n149\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.825\nSo we're typing in the FQDN\nof our target machine.\n\n150\n00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:35.915\nNow notice and I do point this out\nwhen we get to it in certain wizards.\n\n151\n00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:38.575\nBut logic is everything\nmaking sure you're prepared\n\n152\n00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:40.805\nto be successful is gonna be important,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:45.270\nSo we have that,\nwanna click add server here right?\n\n154\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.540\nAnd so you'll see select the server\nyou wanna add to your console.\n\n155\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.440\nThe authorized DHCP servers\nyou'll see we have two.\n\n156\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.575\nNow if we don't wanna type it in,\nwe could just come here and\n\n157\n00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.600\nwe can select which one we wanna grab.\n\n158\n00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.180\nSo remember all of our\nservers should be authorized.\n\n159\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.805\nThey should already be listed in\nthe Active Directory, in other words.\n\n160\n00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:05.965\nAnd as a result, they would show up here,\nand we can just go grab one right from\n\n161\n00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:09.750\nhere, click OK, highlight that,\nso we'll just give that a second.\n\n162\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.295\nAnd assuming, that we choose\nthe server that's up and running,\n\n163\n00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:17.145\nit's available that we connect to, etc.\n\n164\n00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:21.235\nThen, we can go ahead and it will\nautomatically just put it in there for us.\n\n165\n00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.255\nAnd it just truncates it\ndown to the host name.\n\n166\n00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.260\nBut we can do this either way.\n\n167\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.680\nYou can type it in, or\nyou can use the button.\n\n168\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.940\nIt's up to you to decide.\n\n169\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.900\nThe way that I just did it,\nit went out and found the server,\n\n170\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.430\nvalidated that we can communicate with it,\nand understands what it is.\n\n171\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.903\nIf I just typed it in here myself,\n\n172\n00:08:35.903 --> 00:08:39.340\nthen it would have to do that as part of\nthe process of moving between screens.\n\n173\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.330\nIt's a question of how you\nchoose to do it, it's up to you.\n\n174\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.690\nSo we have we'll click Next here.\n\n175\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.760\nSo I just went ahead and said,\nyeah, basically I found it.\n\n176\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.850\nIt was that little blue circle\nthat popped up for half a second.\n\n177\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.120\nI create a new fail over relationship\nwith Partner Plaid VC01,\n\n178\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.980\nmachine on the other\nside we're gonna send to.\n\n179\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.440\nWhat's the name of the relationship?\n\n180\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.250\nYou have to give it a unique name, right?\n\n181\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:05.800\nSo, something like,\nwe'll just call this itprotv fail over.\n\n182\n00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.050\nTest, write something like that.\n\n183\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.370\nIn the real world, they'd probably label\nthis, north central remote office or\n\n184\n00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.900\nsomething, right?\n\n185\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.070\nWhatever the name of that relationship\nwill be that signifies the geography for\n\n186\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.945\nwhat I'm trying to match.\n\n187\n00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:19.605\nWould be up to me to decide.\n\n188\n00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:22.799\nMaximum client lead time,\nwhat we call the MCLT.\n\n189\n00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:25.761\nValue, you'll see here by default,\none hour, right?\n\n190\n00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:30.315\nWe have mode, or reload balancing,\nor are we doing hot standby.\n\n191\n00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:33.857\nLoad balancing, the idea would be all\nsystems are online and available.\n\n192\n00:09:33.857 --> 00:09:37.897\nWe're essentially round robinning back and\nforth between them, evenly.\n\n193\n00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:40.657\nHot standby, one is on, right, primary.\n\n194\n00:09:40.657 --> 00:09:43.054\nThe other one is available but\nnot actively being used,\n\n195\n00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:44.380\nunless we fail over to it.\n\n196\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.178\nWe would specify our choose.\n\n197\n00:09:46.178 --> 00:09:49.190\nHow we wanna set this up here,\nwould be up to us to decide.\n\n198\n00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.790\nWe would choose whatever we think\nmakes the most sense, all right.\n\n199\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.010\nSo, we can go in.\n\n200\n00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.950\nWe'll leave a load balance to you just for\npurposes of our discussion, but\n\n201\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.290\nwe can set it up either way\non load balance percentage.\n\n202\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.910\nLocal server,\nparent server roughly 50, 50.\n\n203\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.400\nWe're roughly approximately saying,\nequal load on both.\n\n204\n00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.887\nSo, we'll be using both, right,\nessentially, as equal partners.\n\n205\n00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:15.320\nYou'll see here, just scroll down here,\njust so you can see right there.\n\n206\n00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.950\nEnable Message Authentication\nShared Secret.\n\n207\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.570\nJust while I'm typing this in,\n\n208\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.500\nlet me just quickly tell\neverybody what a shared secret is.\n\n209\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.150\nI know you wanna ask something,\nor add a little comment here.\n\n210\n00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.061\nSo shared secret is nothing\nmore than a password, right?\n\n211\n00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:29.206\nWe just give it a fancy name,\nwe're gonna provide a password here.\n\n212\n00:10:29.206 --> 00:10:31.987\nSo that way, we're gonna be able\nto secure this connection and\n\n213\n00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:35.570\nmake sure that we're just not randomly\nusing it unless we can provide this.\n\n214\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.680\nSo that we know that we are using\nit with the proper authority.\n\n215\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.084\nSo just before I click Next, Cherokee\nwanted to throw something out there.\n\n216\n00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:44.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I just wanted to\nask you about those modes.\n\n217\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.760\nSo I know other vendors they may use\nthe terminology, like active, active or\n\n218\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760\nactive, passive.\n\n219\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.890\nDo you think Microsoft categorizes\nthose modes in that way\n\n220\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.700\nwith the high availability\nversus the load balancing there?\n\n221\n00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, the way they classify them\nis load balancing at hot standby.\n\n222\n00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.010\nBut what they mean is\nwhen we do hot standby,\n\n223\n00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.760\nwe're doing an active passive assumption,\nright.\n\n224\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.951\nYou think about the logic of\nwhat you were suggesting.\n\n225\n00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:09.379\nLoad balance would be\nthe equivalent of an active,\n\n226\n00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:11.645\nactive in the sense of both nodes or\nboth parts.\n\n227\n00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:14.052\nBoth partners in relationship are on and\n\n228\n00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:16.896\nservicing requests with\nsome sort of waiting.\n\n229\n00:11:16.896 --> 00:11:18.948\nSo that way we're perhaps either equally,\n\n230\n00:11:18.948 --> 00:11:22.394\nin our case we're roughly saying\n50 50 will be approximately equal.\n\n231\n00:11:22.394 --> 00:11:25.879\nAnd, or you know maybe slightly\nweighted in favor of one or the other\n\n232\n00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:30.370\nbased on latency, network conditions,\nwho knows what, whatever it would be.\n\n233\n00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.030\nBut we would do it that way.\n\n234\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.572\nAnd we would then route slightly more\nrequests to one perhaps in favor of\n\n235\n00:11:35.572 --> 00:11:38.460\nthe other depending on\nthe balancing percentages.\n\n236\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.530\nBut if we think about it from\nthe traditional perspective of a cluster,\n\n237\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.177\nwhich is where get the active, active,\nreactive, passive thought process from.\n\n238\n00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:48.744\nWe could say load balance would\nbe like everything being active.\n\n239\n00:11:48.744 --> 00:11:50.764\nWhereas, excuse me, hot standby,\n\n240\n00:11:50.764 --> 00:11:55.100\nwould be the equivalent of more of\nan active passive relationship.\n\n241\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.790\nIf that's the idea that\nyou're thinking about.\n\n242\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.560\nAnd it kinda makes sense on one\nlevel to think of it that way.\n\n243\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.180\nBut we don't, Microsoft doesn't\nclassify them using that language.\n\n244\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; The language we use,\n\n245\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.290\nthe descriptors we use for the modes\nare load balance and hot standby.\n\n246\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.009\nThose are the names.\n\n247\n00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:11.062\nThe reason I'm being precise about that,\n\n248\n00:12:11.062 --> 00:12:14.030\nis if you were asked in theory\nat some point in the future.\n\n249\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.850\nHey, when we're configuring this,\nwhat are your two options for\n\n250\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.450\nmodes, you'd wanna know\nthat the proper names and\n\n251\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.840\ntheir for right answers,\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n252\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.590\n&gt;&gt; Would be load balanced and hot standby.\n\n253\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.440\nThose would be the right choices.\n\n254\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.030\nIf you were making them at some point\nin a room with perhaps a clock ticking,\n\n255\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.550\nscreen in front of you.\n\n256\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.430\nNo pressure at all, nothing like that.\n\n257\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.880\nJust you know people throwing questions at\nyou randomly for a certain period of time,\n\n258\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.850\nand you have to answer them or\nelse, right or something like that.\n\n259\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, I think we're picking\nup what you're putting down Adam.\n\n260\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.390\n&gt;&gt; We could make a game show, right, it\ncould be like you know certify or die or\n\n261\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.165\nsomething like that.\n\n262\n00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:46.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right we're gonna go ahead,\n\n263\n00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:49.090\nwe're gonna choose here to put this in.\n\n264\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.540\n&gt;&gt; No running the end kind of style.\n\n265\n00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.320\n&gt;&gt; No, no pressure at all, right?\n\n266\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.580\nAnd then you'll see we\nhave our two scopes here.\n\n267\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.870\nWe do have just starting information.\n\n268\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.680\nNow I will tell you, and\n\n269\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.130\nI've mentioned this in another\nepisode around other things.\n\n270\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.220\nI'm a big advocate of making a tree of\ngreat documentation, for a lot of reasons.\n\n271\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.698\nI do a lot of auto work,\nas I've shared with you in other episodes.\n\n272\n00:13:06.698 --> 00:13:09.341\nI do a lot of work for customers, and for\n\n273\n00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:14.565\npeople that I spend time helping to figure\nout how to do the right things with.\n\n274\n00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:16.744\nAnd make sure their instruction\nworks the right way.\n\n275\n00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:20.840\nNothing better than start you day off,\nknowing you got good documentation, right?\n\n276\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.590\nThat puts a big smile on the face of\na person that's responsible for stuff.\n\n277\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.900\nGreat opportunity for\nyou here to do a quick screen capture,\n\n278\n00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.480\ncapture that documentation item,\ndrop it in your run book, or\n\n279\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.558\nyour build book or into your CMDB,\nyour configuration management database.\n\n280\n00:13:35.558 --> 00:13:39.080\nThis is essentially your CI,\nyour configuration item entry for\n\n281\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.770\nhow you're configuring\nthe server with this service.\n\n282\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.070\nAll you need to do is reproduce this,\n\n283\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.890\nand you've got everything\nyou need right there.\n\n284\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.660\nJust take a screen capture of it,\nand then you're off to the races.\n\n285\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.230\nSo just make sure you're aware\nof the fact you can do that.\n\n286\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.630\nClick Finish,\nyou'll see that we go through here.\n\n287\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.830\nIt sets up and adds our scope.\n\n288\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.580\nAnd you could quickly see what we did,\nit's all automated, of course, right?\n\n289\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.330\nBut add scopes on partner server,\nsuccessful.\n\n290\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.150\nWe'll go take a look at\nthat in just a minute.\n\n291\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.560\nDisable scopes on partner server,\nsuccessful.\n\n292\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.790\nMeaning we've added them in, but\nthey're disabled out of the box.\n\n293\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.185\nCreation of fail over\nconfiguration successful,\n\n294\n00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:17.080\ncreation of fail over configuration\non both partner and host successful.\n\n295\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.000\nActivate scopes on partner, successful,\nconfigure fail over, successful.\n\n296\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.610\nSo in theory, we should be able\nto right now go over here.\n\n297\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:32.086\nWe should be able to come over here and\nbe able to do this.\n\n298\n00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.685\nAnd you'll see that it just\nneeds a refresh, nothing more.\n\n299\n00:14:36.685 --> 00:14:39.340\nRight, remember most consoles\nrequire refresh if they're actively\n\n300\n00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.985\nopen while you're doing something.\n\n301\n00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:43.275\nThey don't necessarily\nrefresh on their own.\n\n302\n00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:45.110\nBut you can see that I did refresh.\n\n303\n00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.500\nYou will see now that my super scopes\nare here, and it is spelled the same\n\n304\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.420\nincorrectly as it was on the other one,\nso you know it is accurate.\n\n305\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.990\nI left it there that way on purpose.\n\n306\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.740\nBut you can see that we have\nreplicated over through our failover or\n\n307\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.720\nour configuration failover.\n\n308\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.915\nThe scopes, you could see that they're\nactually sitting there as part of\n\n309\n00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:04.853\nthe configuration.\n\n310\n00:15:04.853 --> 00:15:07.034\nWe've essentially gone through and\n\n311\n00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:10.770\nconfigured our failover\nrelationship up through the Wizard.\n\n312\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.466\nAnd those success items do indicate that\nindeed it would be on the other side and\n\n313\n00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:15.481\nwe can see that it is.\n\n314\n00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.790\nWe'll click Close here,\nthat's been set up.\n\n315\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.670\nWe'll just go ahead, we'll just\nrefresh here for good measure as well.\n\n316\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.440\nNot because we need to, but just to make\nsure that we see that everything is there.\n\n317\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.156\nSo we do have that all configured,\nsetup, ready to go.\n\n318\n00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:30.010\nFailover really doesn't\nrequire much more than that.\n\n319\n00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.600\nOnce it's set up, assuming everything\nis good, we're all set, and\n\n320\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.400\nwe are ready to go as they say.\n\n321\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.790\nNow, we did talk about a second step where\nwe would replicate out our failover scope.\n\n322\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.270\nSo let's just look at that, so we would\ncome in here, let's just highlight here.\n\n323\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.490\nRemember we said the other part of\nthat is replicate failover scopes.\n\n324\n00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.660\nTake a look here real quick.\n\n325\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.410\nJust bring this up, so\nyou can see this before we do anything.\n\n326\n00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.860\nThis action will replicate the config\nof all failover scopes on this server\n\n327\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.870\nto a respective partner server or\nservers, right.\n\n328\n00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.239\nThis operation may take some time.\n\n329\n00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:04.440\nClick OK to continue or\nCancel to abort, right.\n\n330\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.842\nSo all we're saying is you know,\n\n331\n00:16:05.842 --> 00:16:09.411\nif you've made changes at some point To\nthe scope after the initial configuration.\n\n332\n00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:11.925\nBecause you could see clearly\nthat the scope was replicated\n\n333\n00:16:11.925 --> 00:16:13.190\nas part of the initial set up.\n\n334\n00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.818\nBut that doesn't mean we\nwon't change that over time.\n\n335\n00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:19.890\nWe may wanna go in manually and\nforce a replication event so\n\n336\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.110\nthat we can update those changes.\n\n337\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.540\nSo we would click OK\nto be able to do that.\n\n338\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.490\nNo big deal, we'll just click OK,\n\n339\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.970\nlet that do its thing here just\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n340\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.949\nYou'll see here, starting replication\nof queued failover partner, blah,\n\n341\n00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.219\nblah, blah, and it's doing one for\neach scope, 00, 01.\n\n342\n00:16:35.219 --> 00:16:39.998\nSo you can see that it is, if we had 10\nscopes we'd have 10 paragraphs, one for\n\n343\n00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:43.460\neach scope listed here and\ntelling us that it started.\n\n344\n00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.020\nNow we're not gonna get\nan indication here.\n\n345\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.490\nWe're just going to essentially say hey,\nthis is what we're doing.\n\n346\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.930\nGreat, okay, we're doing that and\n\n347\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.130\neventually it will show\nup on the other side.\n\n348\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.950\nSo we do just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n349\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:57.020\nBecause this is how we would manage that\ninformation, if we had to do updates for\n\n350\n00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.180\nsome reason or for\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n351\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.483\nI know Cherokee wants to\nadd something in here.\n\n352\n00:17:01.483 --> 00:17:03.590\nJust before she does, one other thing.\n\n353\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.851\nYou'll notice here for IPv6,\n\n354\n00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:09.711\nwe do not have the ability\nto set up failover for IPv6.\n\n355\n00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:13.310\nI think I talked about this in\na couple of other episodes.\n\n356\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.039\nWe have less options for IPv6.\n\n357\n00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:18.336\nCurrently we do not set up policies\neither, you'll notice, for IPv6.\n\n358\n00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:22.065\nWe'll talk about those in one\nof our prior episodes as well.\n\n359\n00:17:22.065 --> 00:17:24.165\nSo those are not available to us here but\n\n360\n00:17:24.165 --> 00:17:27.077\njust keep in mind that we\ndo have an IPv6 option.\n\n361\n00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:30.325\nWe can manage scopes here,\nas you can see, for IPv6,\n\n362\n00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:34.440\nbut we don't have the option to make\nthem highly available through failover.\n\n363\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.070\nWe don't have policy driven\nmanagement the way we do for IPv4,\n\n364\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.370\nat least not right now in Server 16.\n\n365\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.480\nMay that come at some point in the future?\n\n366\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.870\nHard to say, who knows?\n\n367\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.270\nAlways a possibility.\n\n368\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.870\nAlways an opportunity for\nus to think through the logic of that.\n\n369\n00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.658\nBut it's hard to say for\nsure what we will see in the future.\n\n370\n00:17:49.658 --> 00:17:53.212\nWe just wanna know that currently\nthat is not supported, okay, just so\n\n371\n00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:54.406\nyou're aware of that.\n\n372\n00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:57.110\nSo Cherokee,\nI know you wanted to mention something.\n\n373\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.630\n&gt;&gt; I just had a question about\nthe notification that we saw.\n\n374\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.320\nAfter that original replication,\n\n375\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.490\nany subsequent replications, would it\njust be like a differential change?\n\n376\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:12.197\nSo we probably wouldn't see that delay,\nokay.\n\n377\n00:18:12.197 --> 00:18:14.032\n[LAUGH] I see.\n\n378\n00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:15.890\n&gt;&gt; It's amazing how that works.\n\n379\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.660\n&gt;&gt; You know what, yeah.\n\n380\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.300\nAdam is sharing the answer\nto my question right here.\n\n381\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.645\nI swear that was not planned.\n\n382\n00:18:20.645 --> 00:18:22.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was, but\n\n383\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.730\nyou just asked a question without\nknowing I already had it set up.\n\n384\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.020\nBut yes, to answer not only Cherokee's\nquestion, which is a great one,\n\n385\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.268\nvery important, but a lot of other\nsubtle questions you may have.\n\n386\n00:18:31.268 --> 00:18:34.490\nBecause you wanna understand what's going\non under the hood with this stuff, right?\n\n387\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.682\nAnd you're gonna want to see the settings,\nunderstand,\n\n388\n00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.640\ncuz here in the quick run through where\nwe say, hey, look, this does this.\n\n389\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.720\nBoom, boom, boom, two or\nthree minutes, and we're done.\n\n390\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.900\nYou don't really get the depth and\nthe ability to play with it and\n\n391\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.440\nreally internalize it.\n\n392\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.400\nSo I always wanna give you the option\nto do a little followup here.\n\n393\n00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.770\nDHCP failover settings, what are all\nof the settings we have there?\n\n394\n00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.540\nHow are they gonna work?\n\n395\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.650\nWhat are they used for?\n\n396\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.280\nThe load balance percentages\nwe talked about.\n\n397\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.620\nThe server roles, the reserve percentages,\n\n398\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.070\nthe maximum client lead time,\nright, that kind of thing.\n\n399\n00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.950\nAll these settings,\nimportant to know what they are.\n\n400\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.300\nSo any and all of these,\nyou're gonna have these here.\n\n401\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.351\nIt's gonna go through and\nkinda drill down on each one,\n\n402\n00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:11.328\ngive us a little better\nexplanation of what they are.\n\n403\n00:19:11.328 --> 00:19:15.410\nWe're gonna be able to see how all\nof these things come together.\n\n404\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.676\nBy the way,\nwe are doing delta replication,\n\n405\n00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:17.955\njust to answer your question specifically.\n\n406\n00:19:17.955 --> 00:19:19.350\nI apologize.\n\n407\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.980\nI had meant to do that\nas we were starting.\n\n408\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.110\nBut we do delta replication on\ncode after the initial sync.\n\n409\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.870\nFor any of these kind of things, we're\nnot gonna do a full replication event\n\n410\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.690\nbecause it just increases\na lot of the traffic load.\n\n411\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.630\nSo once we do an initial sync we'll be\ndoing delta replication block changes,\n\n412\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.550\nchange of configuration blocks.\n\n413\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.630\nWe call them different things.\n\n414\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.960\nBut the idea here is that you can see\nthat we have all the settings here.\n\n415\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.980\nIt talks about what they are and\ngives you a little bit more information.\n\n416\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.270\nWe do see some information on state.\n\n417\n00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.820\nSo we can go in and\nsee what's going on here\n\n418\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.190\nif we take a look at the different\nstates that a server can be in.\n\n419\n00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.301\nBased on failover conditions, normal,\ncommunication interrupted, partner down,\n\n420\n00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:59.421\npartner conflict, resolution interrupted,\nthings like that.\n\n421\n00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:01.698\nThere's nine states that are defined.\n\n422\n00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:05.870\nSo you'd wanna go through and probably\nhave a little bit of a vision into there.\n\n423\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.110\nAnd we do have some additional\nlinks here to some other things.\n\n424\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.726\nWe did walk you through\nhow to set up failover.\n\n425\n00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:16.363\nThey have some nice failover examples,\nsome events and performance information,\n\n426\n00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:19.800\ncommunication, the different modes,\nthe relationships.\n\n427\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.470\nJust all the detailed information\nthat will be valuable for\n\n428\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.360\nyou if you're gonna wanna go through and\n\n429\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.800\nemploy this new feature in 2016,\ncertainly in the real world.\n\n430\n00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.370\nWorth it for\nyou to read up on it just a little bit.\n\n431\n00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.460\nAlso important for\nyou for exam preparation.\n\n432\n00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.620\nHave a good idea of\nwhat's going on with it.\n\n433\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.800\nNever bad to read up a little bit and\n\n434\n00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.340\nhave a little bit more sense\nof what's happening there.\n\n435\n00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.470\nSo we did talk about load\nsharing versus hot standby,\n\n436\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.690\nthe difference between those two modes,\nexplained the logic there.\n\n437\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.813\nRemember, load sharing or load balancing,\nas it's called, is the default mode.\n\n438\n00:20:52.813 --> 00:20:57.320\nRight, you saw that as the default choice,\njust keep that in mind.\n\n439\n00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.930\nAlso firewall considerations here,\nright, important to know.\n\n440\n00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.160\nNow again, just keep in mind, if we're\ndoing this internal on a LAN between two\n\n441\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.870\nDHCP servers that are in the same\nsubnet with no firewall between them,\n\n442\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.250\nwe're not worried about whatever\nports may or may not be used,\n\n443\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.890\ncuz we're probably not blocking them.\n\n444\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.962\nBut in our examples that we talked about,\nwe may be setting this up where we\n\n445\n00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:20.984\nare doing this across multiple\nsubnets through remote communication.\n\n446\n00:21:20.984 --> 00:21:24.475\nThere may be one or more gateways and\nfirewalls involved.\n\n447\n00:21:24.475 --> 00:21:25.475\nSo we do need to take note of that.\n\n448\n00:21:25.475 --> 00:21:33.022\nWe listen on port 647, TCP port 647\nspecifically, for failover traffic.\n\n449\n00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:33.932\nSo you do wanna note that.\n\n450\n00:21:33.932 --> 00:21:37.395\nYou may have to configure that in the\nfirewall just to make sure you're gonna be\n\n451\n00:21:37.395 --> 00:21:38.782\npassing that traffic.\n\n452\n00:21:38.782 --> 00:21:42.312\nAnd when we do set this up and\nwe configure this,\n\n453\n00:21:42.312 --> 00:21:46.034\nnice thing is we set this up and\nmodify the firewalls automatically.\n\n454\n00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:48.551\nSo you don't have to worry about\nthe firewalls on the local\n\n455\n00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:50.641\nhost where DHCP is running.\n\n456\n00:21:50.641 --> 00:21:53.041\nHowever, that's not the firewall\nI would be most concerned about.\n\n457\n00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:56.131\nI'd be concerned about the corporate\nfirewall that's probably between\n\n458\n00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.571\nthose two remote sites.\n\n459\n00:21:57.571 --> 00:21:59.641\nThat's not gonna get\nconfigured automatically,\n\n460\n00:21:59.641 --> 00:22:01.991\nso you're gonna have to\nset up some rules there.\n\n461\n00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:05.874\nRemember, we're gonna need inbound and\noutbound for traffic, TCP Port 647.\n\n462\n00:22:05.874 --> 00:22:08.451\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n463\n00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:12.890\nWe do take care of the local host\nspecific to the DHCP configuration\n\n464\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.510\nas part of the failover settings.\n\n465\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.280\nWe don't say that in the wizard but\nthat is part of the configuration, but\n\n466\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.217\nit's not gonna happen on\nthe corporate firewall.\n\n467\n00:22:19.217 --> 00:22:23.752\nYour Cisco firewalls, whoever owns those\nfirewalls, whatever they are, Checkpoint,\n\n468\n00:22:23.752 --> 00:22:27.988\nwhatever it may be, you're gonna have to\ngo in, work with your firewall admin, and\n\n469\n00:22:27.988 --> 00:22:29.330\nprobably get that set up.\n\n470\n00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.389\nSo this is just something for\nyou to be aware of and think about.\n\n471\n00:22:31.389 --> 00:22:34.630\nSo just wanted to point that out to you,\njust make sure that you're aware of that.\n\n472\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.180\nThat's one of those little gotchas,\nbut important to note.\n\n473\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.250\nI did wanna just remind us of\na couple of things that we\n\n474\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.240\ntook a look at in some prior episodes.\n\n475\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.190\nWe did talk about the structure\nof the DHCP server,\n\n476\n00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.270\ntalked about where things are,\nwhat we see there.\n\n477\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.950\nJust gonna go in here to see\nWindows over to System 32,\n\n478\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.630\nand we're just down to System 32,\nI should say.\n\n479\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:03.510\nAnd go into our DHCP server folder.\n\n480\n00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.256\nBring that up right here.\n\n481\n00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:09.137\nWhere am I?\n\n482\n00:23:11.602 --> 00:23:12.184\nWhat am I missing?\n\n483\n00:23:12.184 --> 00:23:16.756\nCome on, yeah,\nI do have my machine set up right.\n\n484\n00:23:16.756 --> 00:23:17.490\nAm I on the right console?\n\n485\n00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:19.940\nSometimes I click on the wrong one.\n\n486\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.750\nI wind up on my local host machine.\n\n487\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.999\nJust make sure I'm in the right\nconsole here for just one second.\n\n488\n00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:26.339\n&gt;&gt; I told you my horror story about that.\n\n489\n00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:27.000\n&gt;&gt; That's what I did.\n\n490\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.570\nNo, no, no, I did.\nI mean, that's where I was.\n\n491\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.280\nI was in the console of the host.\n\n492\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.300\nI'm running a VM, and\n\n493\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.560\nI was in the console of the VM host,\nnot the DHCP server itself.\n\n494\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.670\nThat's what I wanted to double check.\n\n495\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:42.862\nSo that was why I can't find it, cuz it's\nnot installed on the VM host on Hyper-V.\n\n496\n00:23:42.862 --> 00:23:45.456\nIt is installed in the VM.\n\n497\n00:23:45.456 --> 00:23:48.650\nSo let me just go there for a second\nwhile we're doing this the right way now.\n\n498\n00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.730\nSo I just want to show you\nthe structure of those files.\n\n499\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.600\nMake sure you remember what's there,\nthe data bases, the logs.\n\n500\n00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.050\nJust remind you about it,\nit's important to know it's there.\n\n501\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.298\nYou always get a question or\ntwo about that kind of stuff.\n\n502\n00:23:59.298 --> 00:24:02.600\nSo you were going to share a horror story\nwith us, just while I was finding this?\n\n503\n00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.561\n&gt;&gt; Just being in a-\n&gt;&gt; I always\n\n504\n00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.084\nlove laughing at somebody else's expense.\n\n505\n00:24:05.084 --> 00:24:09.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know this story, so I was\njust in the wrong console versus like when\n\n506\n00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:13.018\nyou're dealing with multiple machines,\nand virtual machines,\n\n507\n00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:15.200\nit can get a little Confusing at times.\n\n508\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.770\n&gt;&gt; It can, so there we go.\n\n509\n00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.090\nYou see, we've got the DH I have,\nthe DHCP folder there now.\n\n510\n00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.271\nI just wanted to point out,\nwe do a bunch of files in here.\n\n511\n00:24:22.271 --> 00:24:25.560\nWe kinda hit them and\nhighlighted at one of the prior episodes.\n\n512\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.684\nBut there's wanna go back calm,\nadd a little more formally.\n\n513\n00:24:27.684 --> 00:24:31.790\nWe do have the DHCPMBD file\nthat will be right here.\n\n514\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.420\nThat is actually our database file,\nwe talked about the HCP database.\n\n515\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.640\nThat's our file right here.\n\n516\n00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.160\nWe have our temp and\nour EDB sitting down here at the bottom,\n\n517\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.500\nthat's just our scratch file\nthat's used for swap, essentially.\n\n518\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.340\nWe're actively transacting in and\nout of the database,\n\n519\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.590\nwe're using the temp edb to hold stuff,\nessentially as an extended partition for\n\n520\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.040\ncaching, and then moving things in and\nout as we write.\n\n521\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.230\nGo through that whole acid process\nto standardize our transactions,\n\n522\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.620\nensure normalization.\n\n523\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.400\nEverything is good, so\nwe're using the temp EDB for that.\n\n524\n00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.205\nWe have our J50.log and J50 res,\n0001, 0002, etc., JRS files.\n\n525\n00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:09.815\nYou'll see them here.\n\n526\n00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:12.905\nThese are just gonna be our logs\nof all the database transactions.\n\n527\n00:25:12.905 --> 00:25:15.805\nWe use these to replay transactions and\nrestructure, and\n\n528\n00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:18.095\nreproduce the database\nif there's a problem.\n\n529\n00:25:18.095 --> 00:25:20.440\nWe use these for\nrecovery in other words traditionally.\n\n530\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.401\nAnd we have our checkpoint file,\nour J50.chk file.\n\n531\n00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:25.400\nThat's our checkpoint file.\n\n532\n00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.870\nThat's essentially like a bookmarker,\nright.\n\n533\n00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.040\nIt just kinda walks down, or\na placeholder, and shows us what the last\n\n534\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.840\ncommitted transaction was as\nwe move through the system.\n\n535\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.040\nSo we know from a recovery\nstandpoint where we are and\n\n536\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.450\npotentially where we need to be.\n\n537\n00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.060\nJust wanna keep that in mind.\n\n538\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.250\nWe've talked about backing up and\n\n539\n00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.240\nrestoring the DHCP database in the prior\nepisodes, just keep that in mind.\n\n540\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.930\nWhat I need to mention specifically\nwas what does get backed up.\n\n541\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.891\nWe showed you how to do it,\nright-click back up,\n\n542\n00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:50.490\nshowed you where the back up folder was.\n\n543\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.490\nYou see it right up there,\n\n544\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.450\nshowed you that we create the back up,\ntalked about the value of it.\n\n545\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.142\nBut we wanna make sure we\nknow what is backed up.\n\n546\n00:25:57.142 --> 00:26:01.380\nAll the scopes, all the reservation\ninformation, all the leases.\n\n547\n00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.233\nAll the options including server,\nscope, reservation, and class options.\n\n548\n00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:08.050\nSo, everything we've declared\nin there will be backed up.\n\n549\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.280\nAnd all registry keys and\n\n550\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.700\nany other configuration settings around\nthe DHCP server itself are backed up.\n\n551\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.030\nIn other words, essentially,\neverything we need to reproduce DHCP in\n\n552\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.820\na nice tidy package is part of that\nbackup, which is what we would expect.\n\n553\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.560\nAnd what we wanna make sure, right?\n\n554\n00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.070\nWould be there.\n\n555\n00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.276\nSo how do we reconcile that,\nhow do we restore if needed?\n\n556\n00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:30.301\nWell, we showed you,\nyou could right click and choose restore,\n\n557\n00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:33.670\npoint to the database backup and\nbring that back on another server.\n\n558\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:37.220\nSo we can reproduce that if needed,\njust keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.627\nWe can reconcile the DHCP database,\nthis does a consistency check.\n\n560\n00:26:41.627 --> 00:26:45.697\nReconciliation, recovery are not the same\nthing people sometimes use those terms\n\n561\n00:26:45.697 --> 00:26:49.140\ninterchangeably, wrong to do so,\nbut they do without realizing it.\n\n562\n00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.140\nI'm sure reconciliation is\nthe process of integrity checking and\n\n563\n00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.430\nvalidating the data itself.\n\n564\n00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.413\nRecovery is the process of\nrestoring a database, and\n\n565\n00:26:58.413 --> 00:27:02.137\nthe associated settings because\nsomething went horribly wrong.\n\n566\n00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:04.971\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n567\n00:27:04.971 --> 00:27:08.905\nthat we do understand that we can\ndo a reconciliation on scopes.\n\n568\n00:27:08.905 --> 00:27:13.560\nA reconciliation on the database\nthat's just gonna check consistency.\n\n569\n00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.880\nRecovery will be done in case we\nblow something up during the BCVR or\n\n570\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.620\nfull blown BCVR [INAUDIBLE], most likely.\n\n571\n00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.100\nWhat about moving the DHCP database?\n\n572\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.250\nWe're gonna actually let Cherokee tell\nus one of her horror stories here\n\n573\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.470\nabout migrating and moving.\n\n574\n00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:30.200\nBut Cherokee I had been involved in\na kind of a show and tell I guess, right?\n\n575\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Little process of how you go\n\n576\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.970\nthrough and set this up, and had a lot of\nfun doing it, so she wants to share that.\n\n577\n00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:35.920\n&gt;&gt; The process isn't bad.\n\n578\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.270\n&gt;&gt; No it's not.\n&gt;&gt; It's just getting confused\n\n579\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.200\nabout which machine you're in.\n\n580\n00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.464\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] With an audience, yeah.\n\n581\n00:27:40.464 --> 00:27:43.929\n&gt;&gt; Right, so essentially, if we're\ngonna move, right, a DHCP database,\n\n582\n00:27:43.929 --> 00:27:46.240\nthe high-level steps\nreally not too difficult.\n\n583\n00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.800\nKeeping them straight in your mind,\nyeah, can be a little confusing, but\n\n584\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.940\nas you said, not hard.\n\n585\n00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.891\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Just sometimes confusing if you're not\n\n586\n00:27:52.891 --> 00:27:53.789\ntracking everything.\n\n587\n00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:57.186\nThis is, by the way where naming\nconventions become so critical, right?\n\n588\n00:27:57.186 --> 00:28:00.475\nAnd being able to ensure that you\nare not doing 25 things at once,\n\n589\n00:28:00.475 --> 00:28:02.970\ngetting distracted, becomes critical.\n\n590\n00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.980\nBecause we get around about\nsome of these stuff sometimes.\n\n591\n00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.330\nWe are demoing things for you.\n\n592\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.620\nGot 10 different machines and\nwindows opened up.\n\n593\n00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.270\nIt could be a little confusing.\n\n594\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.510\nBut, in the real world it is a little bit\nharder to recover from mistake, right?\n\n595\n00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.431\nHere, we could take a break,\nthrow up a quick screen, edit it,\n\n596\n00:28:16.431 --> 00:28:19.093\nmake it look like nothing happened and\nit really was good.\n\n597\n00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:22.180\nBut the realities in the real world,\nit doesn't work that way, right?\n\n598\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.232\nAnd so\nyou do have to really pay attention.\n\n599\n00:28:24.232 --> 00:28:27.880\nYou wanna learn from others issues and\nconcerns and pain,\n\n600\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.440\nbecause you don't wanna reproduce\nthose mistakes if you can avoid them.\n\n601\n00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.682\nIt is really important\nto think about that.\n\n602\n00:28:31.682 --> 00:28:36.710\nSo, making sure you back up the old DHC,\nwhat we'll call the old DHC server.\n\n603\n00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.520\nThe origination server that we're\ngoing to move off of, right?\n\n604\n00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.740\nSo our source\n&gt;&gt; Source, yep.\n\n605\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.550\n&gt;&gt; For the move, right?\n\n606\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.985\nJust to be clear use normal language.\n\n607\n00:28:43.985 --> 00:28:45.347\nWe're gonna back that up and\n\n608\n00:28:45.347 --> 00:28:48.249\nwhile I'm talking I'm just\ngonna extend my lab timer here.\n\n609\n00:28:48.249 --> 00:28:51.042\nI don't wanna lose all the machines\nwe just spent three hours\n\n610\n00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:52.000\nconfiguring and-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n611\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.300\n&gt;&gt; Setting up for a 20 minute demo.\n\n612\n00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.950\nSo wanna make sure we back up the source,\nthe DHCP server.\n\n613\n00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.860\nWe've talked about what would be in that\nbackup, all the settings, everything.\n\n614\n00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.810\nSo we'd run that back up.\n\n615\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.810\nWe would have essentially a folder\nlike this when we're done.\n\n616\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.110\nStop the old DHCP server service.\n\n617\n00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.060\nSo on the source,\nstop that server service.\n\n618\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.080\nCopy the DHCP database\nover to the new server.\n\n619\n00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.460\nThat would be the target.\n\n620\n00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.750\nAnd obviously install the server\nrole there, if needed.\n\n621\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.165\nNow, people don't realize, you don't just\ngo grab this backup and take it out.\n\n622\n00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:23.340\nYou gotta stop the service\nin order to work with it.\n\n623\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.349\nSo you would have to take DHCP down for\na small period of time.\n\n624\n00:29:26.349 --> 00:29:29.493\nNow that's not really very disruptive,\nbecause normally you're gonna do that for\n\n625\n00:29:29.493 --> 00:29:30.254\nonly a few minutes.\n\n626\n00:29:30.254 --> 00:29:33.009\nAnd you're probably not gonna have\na lot of clients trying to lease,\n\n627\n00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:33.920\nat any one given time.\n\n628\n00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.950\nAnd even if they do,\nif you're smart about it,\n\n629\n00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.440\nyou have an alternate DHCP\nservice set up somewhere.\n\n630\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.270\nThey'll probably get an address with\nno trouble, and it won't be a problem.\n\n631\n00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.021\nSo, just understand that.\n\n632\n00:29:42.021 --> 00:29:43.944\nMaybe you'll target\na maintenance window or\n\n633\n00:29:43.944 --> 00:29:47.895\na service window where there's minimal\ndisruption or opportunity for disruption.\n\n634\n00:29:47.895 --> 00:29:50.315\nLate at night or first thing in\nthe morning, whatever it may be.\n\n635\n00:29:50.315 --> 00:29:53.805\nYou'll restore the database\nfrom the source onto the target\n\n636\n00:29:53.805 --> 00:29:55.235\nnew system you're standing up.\n\n637\n00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:57.495\nStart the DHCP service up over there.\n\n638\n00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.165\nAnd you've moved it with no trouble.\n\n639\n00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:01.442\nNow moving and migrating, right?\n\n640\n00:30:01.442 --> 00:30:04.430\nWe talk about this,\nwe can also use command linetilities,\n\n641\n00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.926\nutilities I should say,\nmeaning PowerShell for instance, right?\n\n642\n00:30:07.926 --> 00:30:12.150\nIt could be used to export that data\nfrom one import to the other, so\n\n643\n00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.915\nwe can do it there if we need to.\n\n644\n00:30:13.915 --> 00:30:16.965\nAnd if we wanna do that we can go\nahead and just use power PowerShow.\n\n645\n00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:20.490\nWe've talked about DHCP commandlets,\nand you could certainly go through that\n\n646\n00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.237\nthought process, but export DHCP server\nwould be the commandlet that we use there.\n\n647\n00:30:24.237 --> 00:30:28.332\nObviously targeting a computer name,\nspecify the leases parameter.\n\n648\n00:30:28.332 --> 00:30:29.406\nSo we get the leases.\n\n649\n00:30:29.406 --> 00:30:32.470\nIf we specify a file where\nwe wanna store all that.\n\n650\n00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.838\nAn XML file because it will be an XML\nformat that would allow us to export\n\n651\n00:30:35.838 --> 00:30:36.992\neverything.\n\n652\n00:30:36.992 --> 00:30:41.851\nAnd then we can also do this with Net SH,\nand we could do it through Net SH as well.\n\n653\n00:30:41.851 --> 00:30:43.871\nJust looking at my notes,\nwe could do it either way.\n\n654\n00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:46.537\nSo remember we do have PowerShell,\nand we do have and\n\n655\n00:30:46.537 --> 00:30:50.973\nobviously PowerShell the alternate side of\nthat would be import DHCP server, right?\n\n656\n00:30:50.973 --> 00:30:53.771\nFor the cmdlet on the other side,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n657\n00:30:53.771 --> 00:30:58.011\nBut we could use Net SH or PowerShell to\ndo our migration and or export and import.\n\n658\n00:30:58.011 --> 00:31:01.140\nSo it is important just to think\nabout the fact we do have options.\n\n659\n00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.190\nWe try to stress to you, and we have\nstressed to you in many of these shows,\n\n660\n00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.870\nthat certainly the console\nmakes a lot of sense.\n\n661\n00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.290\nAnd it's where we're all comfortable.\n\n662\n00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.350\nIt's good to know we can do things there.\n\n663\n00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.550\nBut you know, there is a brave new world\nexhibiting and coming out more and\n\n664\n00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.520\nmore in these command lines.\n\n665\n00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.460\nAnd it's important for\nyou to be aware of the tools and\n\n666\n00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.150\nthe options that we can use there\nbecause you never know, all right?\n\n667\n00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.610\nYou might actually be stuck without\nthe ability to manage your console.\n\n668\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:26.138\nWe talked about things like server core\nnano being used to host some of these\n\n669\n00:31:26.138 --> 00:31:28.391\nservices and\nhere is no console there, right?\n\n670\n00:31:28.391 --> 00:31:31.200\nI mean, all you have is the shell\nof one kind or another.\n\n671\n00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.090\nYou could in theory install GUI\nenvironment on core manage through it and\n\n672\n00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.910\nthen take it down again.\n\n673\n00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.522\nThere are options to do these things,\nbut it's a lot of time and trouble.\n\n674\n00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:41.215\nWhy not just use a remote Shell and\nbe able to do them.\n\n675\n00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:44.390\nPowerShell will connect remotely to\nthese instances with no trouble,\n\n676\n00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.200\nyou just have to know how to\nconfig remotely in PowerShell.\n\n677\n00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.350\nIt's not very difficult to do.\n\n678\n00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.640\nAnd then you're able to use PowerShell to\nmanage those instances if you want to.\n\n679\n00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.850\nSo keep in mind, use of alternate tool\nsets will be a very important skill set\n\n680\n00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.570\nfor you as an IT administrator.\n\n681\n00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.770\n&gt;&gt; All different types of migrations,\nTechnet has really great documentation.\n\n682\n00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.690\n&gt;&gt; They do?\n&gt;&gt; I mean, at the time when I was demoing\n\n683\n00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.560\nthe DHCP migration, some of\nthe syntax wasn't available for 2016,\n\n684\n00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.660\nbut I'm sure it is now,\nif you go out there.\n\n685\n00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would think now, I mean,\nthe products been out long enough.\n\n686\n00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.980\nI'm sure all that stuff's\nupdated with no trouble.\n\n687\n00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.547\nAll right, very good.\n\n688\n00:32:19.547 --> 00:32:21.644\nSo, there we go.\n\n689\n00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:23.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n690\n00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:25.710\nwe are done with this particular episode.\n\n691\n00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.630\nBut remember, there's one more\nthing we haven't done yet.\n\n692\n00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.340\nWe're gonna come back and\n\n693\n00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.190\nshow you on how to deviate CPv6,\ncuz v4 wasn't good enough.\n\n694\n00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n695\n00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.123\nThank you for joining us and\nthank you for joining us as well.\n\n696\n00:32:37.123 --> 00:32:39.190\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n697\n00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.060\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n698\n00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:41.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n699\n00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.814\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n700\n00:32:44.814 -->

00:00:06.197\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:08.089\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.624\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.650\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.450\nSo we've been talking about DHCP, but\nin this episode, we're really going to be\n\n9\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.100\ntaking a look at how to implement\nDHCP version six server site.\n\n10\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.890\nWith us today, we have Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.740\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.560\nAlways a pleasure to be back and talking\nabout topics of interest for all of you.\n\n14\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.840\nWe're going to drill in and do a little,\n\n15\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.690\njust a quick discussion on how to\nimplement an IPV6 scope in DHCP.\n\n16\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.030\nI'll call this DHCP V6 cuz that's\njust how it's referred to in\n\n17\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.840\nthe service site documentation.\n\n18\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.290\nBut really no different than what we've\nbefore in terms of managing DHCP.\n\n19\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.790\nWe do have, if you take a look\non screen we'll see this.\n\n20\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.310\nWe do have just our standard console,\nand you could see it there.\n\n21\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.580\nSame machine we've been interacting\nwith and demoing in and out of, but\n\n22\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.510\nwe're just gonna use the IPv6 area now.\n\n23\n00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.640\nWe're gonna open this up.\n\n24\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.630\nAs you can see here, not a lot going\non except for server options initially.\n\n25\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.700\nWe're gonna go ahead and create ourselves\na scope, so we're gonna right click here.\n\n26\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.360\nWe'll go ahead, New Scope.\n\n27\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.580\nOur New Scope Wizard is gonna look similar\nto our IPv4 scope, we're gonna be asked\n\n28\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.380\nfor different information in the sense\nthat the format of our IP addressing for\n\n29\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.150\nthe scope range, for the address pool,\nwill now be different.\n\n30\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.920\nWe'll be entering IPv6 addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.610\n128 bit as opposed to 32 bit addresses.\n\n32\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.310\nSo we're gonna be entering\nthose in our four block or\n\n33\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.710\nfour item, four individual items\nletters numbers our alphanumeric items.\n\n34\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.864\nWhat am I talking about, not items.\n\n35\n00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:44.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Struggling with the word here.\n\n36\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.920\nFour individual entries we're gonna put\nper block is what I'm trying to say.\n\n37\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.148\nFour characters for\ninstance was the word I was looking for.\n\n38\n00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:52.470\nThings like FDA8 for\n\n39\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.035\ninstance would be one block separated by\na semicolon as opposed to an individual\n\n40\n00:01:57.035 --> 00:02:01.138\ndot-expo notation with only numbers\nwhich is how we would see IPv4.\n\n41\n00:02:01.138 --> 00:02:04.980\nSo alphanumeric and\nseparated by colons extended out for\n\n42\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.005\n128 bits as opposed to 32 bits and-\n&gt;&gt; Hexadecimal.\n\n43\n00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.168\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe'll see that in that format absolutely.\n\n44\n00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:11.457\n&gt;&gt; 16-based numbering system.\n\n45\n00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:13.870\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna give that a name.\n\n46\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.290\nCall this to start IPv6 scope for\n\n47\n00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.190\npurposes of our discussion here we can\nname it anything we'd like of course.\n\n48\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.220\nAnd we start with the prefix here and this\nis where we get into our IPv6 information.\n\n49\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.196\nLet me enter in the prefix\nthat we're gonna use,\n\n50\n00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:35.080\nFDA8: we'll do 6c 53,\n\n51\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.890\nAB 09 and DE 63, and\n\n52\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.250\nthen we'll put two\ncolons there at the end.\n\n53\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180\nNotice we do have our slash\n64 at the end of that,\n\n54\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.860\nit's gonna indicate the first half of our\naddress string is gonna be our prefix.\n\n55\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.000\nThe other half, whatever will come later\nthat we'll add in here in a minute,\n\n56\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.510\nwill be what we're gonna use for\nthe rest of our information.\n\n57\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.090\nWe're not gonna bother with our\npreference value right now.\n\n58\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.680\nWe're gonna leave that unset.\n\n59\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.540\nBut we are gonna enter in our prefix so\n\n60\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.060\nwe'll put that in there and\nthen we have to put our starting and\n\n61\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.017\nend IP address in and notice it's\nalready populated the prefix for us.\n\n62\n00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:18.810\nFirst half of the address block in other\nwords as been put in based on what we put\n\n63\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.560\nin our prior screen, so\nwe're gonna have that available to us so\n\n64\n00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.350\nlet's go ahead we'll throw in our\nblock here for our exclusions.\n\n65\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.020\nThis is gonna be any set of address\nthat we're gonna want to exclude out for\n\n66\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.680\nthe given scopes, so\nwe're going to go ahead and put these in.\n\n67\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.670\nWe don't normally at least in\nthe IPv4 walk-throughs we did.\n\n68\n00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.630\nWe didn't both with excluded addresses but\n\n69\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.250\nwe'll exclude some here just to show you\nwhat we're doing and how we would do that.\n\n70\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.411\nSo let me type this in.\nWe're going to need three blocks of all\n\n71\n00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.204\n0's.\n\n72\n00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:48.475\n1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n73\n00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.330\nOne, two, three, four,\ngood thing I can count.\n\n74\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.340\nAnd then zero, zero, one, zero will be our\nstarting, we're just gonna cheat a little\n\n75\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.500\nbit here, cuz I'm not gonna re-type\nall of that, we're gonna copy that.\n\n76\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.060\nAnd we're gonna put that there and\nwe're just gonna change that to 00ff.\n\n77\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.980\nAll right.\n\n78\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.310\nSo we're gonna do that and\n\n79\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.630\nthen we're gonna click add to make sure\nwe add the exclusion range in there.\n\n80\n00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.670\nOtherwise it doesn't get programmed in.\n\n81\n00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.850\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n82\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.020\nAnd then once we have that,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll click next.\n\n83\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.430\nWe have our scope lease, how long to\nwe want this to be available for,\n\n84\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.060\nwe've got our eight days,\nit's kinda hard to see there, but\n\n85\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.950\nour eight days on our preferred\nlifetime right there.\n\n86\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.600\nFor non-temporary, and then our valid,\nlifetime 12 days total.\n\n87\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.430\nSo we have those, click next here.\n\n88\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.890\nAre we gonna activate the scope now?\n\n89\n00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.600\nYes or no?\nYou'll see we get basically the same\n\n90\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.620\nkinds of items that we have to provide for\nhere.\n\n91\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.740\nWe're gonna activate the scope.\n\n92\n00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.520\nWe're gonna exclude addresses or providing\na generic time value for our leases,\n\n93\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.430\nabsolutely.\n\n94\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.920\nBut notice no scope option options here.\n\n95\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.780\nEven the most basic options\nwill be dealt with outside.\n\n96\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.820\nAnd you'll see that we have\nour server options there and\n\n97\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.340\nthe scope will options will come up.\n\n98\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.080\nSo we're gonna do those\noutside of the wizard.\n\n99\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.550\nSo slightly different approach\nbased on what we see on IPv4.\n\n100\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.680\nClick finish here.\n\n101\n00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.990\nLet's get that stood up.\n\n102\n00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.080\nYou'll see then we do have our scope.\n\n103\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.870\nWe do have any leases that maybe given out\n\n104\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.210\nto do of our exclusions\nif we're gonna do that.\n\n105\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.180\nThey do have the ability to do\nreservations, just like we did in IPv4.\n\n106\n00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.320\nWe do have scope options,\nand we can set those up, but\n\n107\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.470\nwe set them up outside of\nthe wizard of post to integrate it\n\n108\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.470\nas being part of the wizard, so it's just\na slightly different approach from IPv4.\n\n109\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.370\nSo we can right click here,\nconfigure options.\n\n110\n00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.150\nWe do have our scope options here.\n\n111\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.160\nBut they are going to be specific to IPv6,\n\n112\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.330\nso the list would look different\nthan the list for IPv4.\n\n113\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.050\nYou'll notice we have things like\nour SIP server domain name list,\n\n114\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.560\nSIP server specific to IPv6.\n\n115\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.090\nWe have our recursive name server for\nIPv6.\n\n116\n00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.290\nOur domain search list.\n\n117\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.460\nThere's different options here but\n\n118\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.150\neverything is gonna be linked to\ntypically an IPv6 infrastructure.\n\n119\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:05.670\nNotice things like our DNS server,\nour default gateway which is our router.\n\n120\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.560\nThings like that traditionally wins.\n\n121\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.040\nWe're not seeing those for IPv6 here.\n\n122\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.500\nWe're seeing IPv6 specific scope options.\n\n123\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.180\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n124\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.310\nWe do have our NIST domain list for\nnetwork information service here.\n\n125\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.520\nWe have information refresh time.\n\n126\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.480\nWe do have our DNS recursive name server,\nit's not that we can't use DNS but\n\n127\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.750\nwe're using it as a separate option with\na different name in order to find it here.\n\n128\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.810\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n129\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.910\nBut we do have them here, and\nwe would program in whichever one we want\n\n130\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.570\ndepending on what we choose, we would then\nbe able to add those in if necessary.\n\n131\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.770\nObviously remember you have to make\na check selection there to activate\n\n132\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.870\nthe scope option, whatever it may be.\n\n133\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.870\nOnce we are done we will\nprogram those in and\n\n134\n00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.100\nthey will become part\nof our scope options.\n\n135\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.460\nRemember we do have\nserver options as well.\n\n136\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.648\nThe difference here, which we talked about\nthis in the IPv4 scope conversations about\n\n137\n00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:58.230\ndifferent options on how they get applied.\n\n138\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.400\nRemember we have scope options\nthat are specific to the scope,\n\n139\n00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.700\nwe have server options that operate for\nall scopes on the server.\n\n140\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.090\nThey're kind of a broad\numbrella that cover everything.\n\n141\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.210\nAnd we have those same options here for\nboth server options and scope options.\n\n142\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.680\nSo we could set up server options\nthat would incorporate themselves\n\n143\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.475\nat the IPv4 six level for the server and\nthen any scope that comes underneath that\n\n144\n00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:24.055\nwould have those options applied as\nthe starting point for the server and\n\n145\n00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:27.145\nthen the scope options go on top and\nthe order for us is going down.\n\n146\n00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:30.520\nRemember the last set of options applied\nall the way through the chain to the list\n\n147\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.620\nare the ones that ultimately\nget applied to the client.\n\n148\n00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.640\nSo if we set server options and\nscope options and the conflict,\n\n149\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.350\nthe scope option would take precedence\nbecause it gets applied second in order,\n\n150\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.410\nand it would override\nessentially the server option.\n\n151\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.610\nSo same idea that we see with IPv4 in\nthat respect, no difference there.\n\n152\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.470\nThey work the same ways\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n153\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.940\nAll right, so that's how we\nwould stand up an IPv6 scope.\n\n154\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.850\nWe would obviously use\nthis to then provide\n\n155\n00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.400\nIP addresses out to a client using IPv6.\n\n156\n00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.840\nSame rules would apply on the other side.\n\n157\n00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.210\nClient would be a DHCP client.\n\n158\n00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.980\nIt would pull an IPv port and or\nan IPv6 address Through DHCP just based on\n\n159\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.630\nhow it's configured, set up, and\nwhat our scope options are, or\n\n160\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.810\nrather our scopes are, and\nassuming that we have a scope set up, and\n\n161\n00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.030\nit needs IPv6 and could then pull an\naddress if needed, and we would then see,\n\n162\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.650\nof course, information on that\nby coming here and looking at\n\n163\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.050\nthe address leases that have actually been\ntaken or removed from the pool overall.\n\n164\n00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.220\nSo we're able to see all\nthose here once we're done.\n\n165\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.200\n&gt;&gt; Well not too bad, Adam.\n\n166\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.950\nJust a simple little walk through.\n\n167\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.150\nI appreciate you joining us for\nthat, and I appreciate you for\n\n168\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.670\njoining us as well but for this show\nwe're going to go ahead and sign out.\n\n169\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.180\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n170\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n171\n00:08:37.820 -->

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.120\nBack to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.110\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.280\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.240\nwe're coming back at you with more of\nthat networking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.070\nAnd we're going to be\nlooking at a service that is\n\n10\n00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.380\nreally important when it comes\nto connecting to networks.\n\n11\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.980\nJust about any network you can think of.\n\n12\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.280\nAnd joining us in the studios for\n\n13\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.520\nthis very topic is none other than Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n14\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.410\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n15\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.960\nGlad to be here.\n\n17\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.560\nAnd yeah, we're getting DHCP today or-\nDynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.620\nIt's another one of those big-time\nservices that we use in our enterprise\n\n19\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.350\nenvironments and our Windows environments.\n\n20\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.770\nAnd we've already gone through DNS,\n\n21\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.750\nwhich is a very important service that\nallows just about everything to work.\n\n22\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.840\nDHCP is another one that we rely on\nin most enterprises, at least for\n\n23\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.870\ncertain nodes, right?\n\n24\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.800\nSo let's talk about what it is.\n\n25\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.170\nAnd at this point we really should\nbe familiar with what it is.\n\n26\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.690\nSo we'll do a quick rundown.\n\n27\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.910\nBut then we're going to get into how\nwe get it installed in Server 2016 and\n\n28\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910\nstart looking at some\nof the configuration.\n\n29\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.490\nAnd then as we progress through DHCP,\n\n30\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.510\nwe'll take a look at some of the advanced\nconfiguration That we can do.\n\n31\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.270\nThey now have policies\nthat we can put in place.\n\n32\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640\nWe can do redundancy.\n\n33\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.360\nWe can provide some sort of,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n34\n00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.240\nFull tolerance with our DHCP servers\nwithout building clusters and\n\n35\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.900\nall of that stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.410\nSo really fantastic what\nthey've done to DHCP.\n\n37\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.910\nIt's been around forever and a day.\n\n38\n00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.020\nYou know, I was actually reading\na really cool article the other day\n\n39\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.080\ntalking about migrating.\n\n40\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.460\nAnd some of the pitfalls that\nyou run into in the real world.\n\n41\n00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.340\nAnd it was interesting.\n\n42\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.480\nBecause he was saying that the reason\nwe run into some of these pitfalls\n\n43\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.230\nis because you go to these enterprises.\n\n44\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.890\nAnd their DHCP servers\nare still running Server 2003.\n\n45\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.380\nOr maybe even Server 2000 because\nDHCP has just been pretty stable.\n\n46\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.330\nAnd it runs, you set it and\nforget it and stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.720\nWhen they finally decide that machine\nis just no longer able to keep up.\n\n48\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.225\nNow, they've got to worry about migrating\nfrom 2000 to 2016 which is a challenge.\n\n49\n00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:12.015\nSo pretty interesting.\n\n50\n00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:14.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't want to have to be\na part of any bridge head migration\n\n51\n00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.385\nlike that when you're like five editions\nbehind in your operating systems.\n\n52\n00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:19.265\nNow Mike, I know that.\n\n53\n00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.607\nBut time to get to server administration.\n\n54\n00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:26.097\nThey should probably have a good running\nunderstanding of what DHCP really is.\n\n55\n00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:29.237\nBut did you want to maybe just talk\nabout real briefly what it does?\n\n56\n00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:30.357\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n57\n00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:34.367\nThe idea is that when our\nnodes are devices that connect\n\n58\n00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.360\nto our ethernet based networks,\nour TCP/IP networks.\n\n59\n00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.070\nThey need certain TCP/IP configuration,\nright?\n\n60\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.760\nWe have to have an IP address.\n\n61\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.950\nThe IP address has to be unique, [COUGH].\n\n62\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.680\nHas to be valid on that network\nthat we're trying to talk to.\n\n63\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.050\nWhich means we need a subnet masks that we\ncan divide that IP address up into node\n\n64\n00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.430\nand a network portion.\n\n65\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.240\nWe'd also love a default gateway,\nif we want to get outside of our subnet.\n\n66\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.730\nWe need the IP address of a DNS server,\nso we can resolve names.\n\n67\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.190\nSo all this is considered\nour TCP/IP configuration.\n\n68\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.520\nIn order to communicate\non a TCP/IP network,\n\n69\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.900\nwe need that configuration information.\n\n70\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.470\nI've got two ways I can really get this\ninformation to the nodes on my network.\n\n71\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.360\nI can And either do as,\nwhat are one of the two methods there?\n\n72\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.116\nI know you know.\n\n73\n00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:18.480\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say\nmaybe dynamically and\n\n74\n00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.350\nthe other one would be, well,\none that I shouldn't be doing.\n\n75\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.480\nAnd that's manually entering it.\n\n76\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.490\nWe call static assignment, right?\n\n77\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n78\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.060\nYou get your static mapping.\n\n79\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.461\nWhich means I'm going to go into the\nTCP/IP properties of the network adaptor,\n\n80\n00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.570\nand I'm going to tell it.\n\n81\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.090\nThis is the IP address I want you to use.\n\n82\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.310\nThis is the Subnet mask.\n\n83\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.270\nAnd whether other whatever other\ninformation I want to configure\n\n84\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.100\non that device.\n\n85\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.330\nBut it's static, meaning I've typed it in.\n\n86\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.560\nI click OK on that dialog box.\n\n87\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.940\nThat's what the client's going to use.\n\n88\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.810\nIt's not going to change unless somebody\nelse goes behind me and changes it, right?\n\n89\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.260\nIt's there for good.\n\n90\n00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.120\nDynamic means we're\ngoing to run a service,\n\n91\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.898\nthat provides this information\nautomatically to the nodes.\n\n92\n00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:56.790\nThey're going to holler\nout on the network, hello,\n\n93\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.640\nI'm looking for a DHCP server.\n\n94\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.870\nThat DHCP server, if there is one,\nis going to respond.\n\n95\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.786\nIt's going to offer up the information.\n\n96\n00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.790\nThe client's going to\naccept that information and\n\n97\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.700\nthen begin using that information.\n\n98\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.540\nAnd the cool thing about that is,\nI didn't have to run around and\n\n99\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.480\ntouch every machine.\n\n100\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.150\nRight?\n\n101\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.090\nI might have thousands\nof nodes on my network.\n\n102\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.600\nThey might be scattered from\nfloor one to floor ten or\n\n103\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.360\nin my office here,\ndown in Tampa or in Los Angeles.\n\n104\n00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.380\nAnd I don't have to go around and\ntouch each one of those machines.\n\n105\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.460\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I got a question now.\n\n106\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.110\nIf we can automatically\nassign IP addresses,\n\n107\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.530\nI know Microsoft likes to\nmention things in their exams.\n\n108\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.110\nLike the least amount of administrative\neffort as being the right answer.\n\n109\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.030\nSo if I've got dynamic assignment.\n\n110\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.330\nAnd I don't have to do anything other\nthan What you're gonna show us, you know\n\n111\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.390\ngetting DHCP involves, does static really\nhave it's place inside static assignment?\n\n112\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.930\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n113\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.370\nAnd usually what you'll see is your\nservers that are offering services\n\n114\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.020\nthat nodes depend on.\n\n115\n00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.580\nWe want to statically map them\nbecause when we do dynamic mapping.\n\n116\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.970\nWhen we use DHCP usually for\nour clients and our mobile devices.\n\n117\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.560\nThe IP addresses can change.\n\n118\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.210\nThe IP address that, that node has\ntoday might be different tomorrow.\n\n119\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.730\nAnd in the end,\n\n120\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.580\nI don't care as long as user a's\ncomputer is connected to the network.\n\n121\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.790\nAnd it can communicate and it's got\na unique address everything's good.\n\n122\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.810\nIf it changes tomorrow, who cares?\n\n123\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.510\nI never connect to that\nmachine via IP address.\n\n124\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.290\nBut my servers that are offering services\nlike file servers Print servers,\n\n125\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.070\nDomain Controllers, DNS servers.\n\n126\n00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.720\nI don't want their IP address\nchanging because things get cached,\n\n127\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.980\nwe have mapped drives that\npoint to IP addresses.\n\n128\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.740\nAnd if we start changing IP\naddresses around on those guys,\n\n129\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.450\nthey might become difficult to locate.\n\n130\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.670\nAnd then it causes delays or outages.\n\n131\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.590\nPrinters are another one that\nwe can map in different ways.\n\n132\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.540\nAnd if a user or a bunch of users have\nthis printer mapped by IP address.\n\n133\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.160\nAnd then that IP address changes, well now\nnobody's going to be able to connect to\n\n134\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.580\nthat printer until we can go back and\nmanually update all those mappings.\n\n135\n00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.550\nIts not going to be a fun time.\n\n136\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.620\nSo there's definitely still uses for\nstatically mapped machines.\n\n137\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.630\nSo, you've shown us in other episodes\nhow we get this server up and running.\n\n138\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.650\nSo, I'm sitting down at this\nWindows Server 2016 box.\n\n139\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.170\nI've got the operating system installed.\n\n140\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.340\nI've got some basic configurations and\nnow I need the DHCP service.\n\n141\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.810\nMike, show us what we're\ngoing to see here.\n\n142\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.440\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nLet's get this guy installed.\n\n143\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.010\nSo, what I'm going to do,\n\n144\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.389\njust like any other role, I'm going to\nopen up Server Manager on my server.\n\n145\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.440\nAnd then wait patiently, because Server\nManager's not the fastest thing to load.\n\n146\n00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.560\nBut not its fault, right?\n\n147\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.570\nI always give Server Manager a hard\ntime and, look, that's pretty quick.\n\n148\n00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.950\nIt is pulling a lot of information from a\nlot of different places to provide us this\n\n149\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.360\ndashboard view.\n\n150\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.050\nSo it takes a minute to pull all that\ninformation in and summarize it.\n\n151\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.430\nSo we'll be patient while the little\nblue line runs across the top.\n\n152\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.270\nOnce that finishes everything is\nloaded up, we should be good to go.\n\n153\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.810\nWe'll click add roles and\nfeatures just like any other role.\n\n154\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.380\nWe'll click next three times.\n\n155\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.400\nAnd then we're going to\nchoose dhcp server and\n\n156\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.450\nwe'll also choose to include\nall of my administrative tools.\n\n157\n00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.255\nAnd then we're just basically\ngoing to click next.\n\n158\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:07.580\nNext&gt;Next&gt;Next&gt;Install.\n\n159\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.440\nAnd when you guys are studying and\nyou're going through practice labs,\n\n160\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.600\ntake the time to read some\nof those dialog boxes.\n\n161\n00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.460\nThey're informational.\n\n162\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.240\nThey're just telling you a little\nbit about the DHCP servers.\n\n163\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.380\nAlways a good idea to at least read\nthat information a couple of times.\n\n164\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.480\nYou get to the point like Wes and\nI where we've seen it 1000 times.\n\n165\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.050\nWe tend to go by it just\na little bit quick.\n\n166\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.990\nAll right, now we'll wait for\nthis to finish.\n\n167\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.300\nAnd DHCP,\nlike most of the services nowadays,\n\n168\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.380\nis not going to require a reboot on\nmy server once it gets installed.\n\n169\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.980\nSo we'll get this installed.\n\n170\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.725\nAnd then we can go and\nwe'll see how we can configure DHCP.\n\n171\n00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:44.930\nBecause again,\n\n172\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.610\nlike most services, installing them\nis one step in the process, right?\n\n173\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.010\nWe're unpacking all the binaries,\nwe're getting all the services out there.\n\n174\n00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.160\nBut then we still have to go and\nconfigure the service.\n\n175\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.840\nIn case, we're going to be doing\nthings like making scopes.\n\n176\n00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.429\nBut most of these you\ninstall them as one step.\n\n177\n00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:06.237\nBut then they're not going to do\nanything until you go back and\n\n178\n00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:08.239\nFinish the configuration of that service.\n\n179\n00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:10.841\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like if someone\nbrings electricity in to my house,\n\n180\n00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:13.820\nthat doesn't really say that they're\ngoing to do anything more than that.\n\n181\n00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.480\nIt's still up to me to either,\nnot do it myself,\n\n182\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.310\nyou don't want that to\nhappen that's a nightmare,\n\n183\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.875\nbut I got to hire a electrician and then\nthey have to run it through my house to\n\n184\n00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:24.885\ncomplete what I would essentially just\nwant to do by flipping on a light switch.\n\n185\n00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:26.525\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n186\n00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:28.165\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n187\n00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:30.149\nBeta says 63 open finish, look at that.\n\n188\n00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:31.387\nGood timing.\n\n189\n00:08:31.387 --> 00:08:35.792\nOkay, so once this finishes,\nyou'll notice right here\n\n190\n00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:40.590\nin the middle it says complete\nDHCP configuration all right.\n\n191\n00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.600\nI can click it there or\nI can close this wizard and\n\n192\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.390\nI'll notice that I have this little\nwarning or exclamation point up here.\n\n193\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.880\nIf I click on that it's gonna\ntell me that hey, it finished but\n\n194\n00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.070\nI need to configure it.\n\n195\n00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.920\nI'm not done yet.\n\n196\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.860\nSo let's go ahead and click it.\n\n197\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.479\nYou can click it at either place and\nit will work.\n\n198\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.910\nIt's gonna open up my post\ninstall configuration wizard.\n\n199\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.897\nAnd you'll see what this is gonna do, it's\ngonna create the DHCP administrators and\n\n200\n00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:08.224\nthe DHCP users group.\n\n201\n00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:13.798\nAnd it's gonna authorize the DHCP server\non the target computer if domain joint,\n\n202\n00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:14.615\nall right.\n\n203\n00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:18.031\nWe're gonna talk about that here in just\na second, we're gonna click next and\n\n204\n00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.500\nthen who's gonna authorize it?\n\n205\n00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.330\nI need to be a member of\nthe domain admins at least\n\n206\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.780\nin order to authorize this\nserver in active directory.\n\n207\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.050\nMy credentials are there,\nI'm gonna skip it, understand that you\n\n208\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.980\ncould do it right here and\nmost likely you should do it right here.\n\n209\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.800\nBut you might have reasons\nyou don't want to,\n\n210\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.796\nyou want to configure some other things\nfirst before you get this guy ready.\n\n211\n00:09:37.796 --> 00:09:42.228\nAnd I also want to show you the other\nplaces I can go to actually authorize this\n\n212\n00:09:42.228 --> 00:09:43.320\nserver.\n\n213\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.490\nBut let's go ahead and\ntalk about authorizing it and\n\n214\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.570\nyou'll see it's gonna go ahead and\ncreate the groups.\n\n215\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.960\nAnd it's gonna restart the DHTP service\nfor the groups to be effected, so\n\n216\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960\nwe'll click Close there.\n\n217\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.590\nSo, authorization right?\n\n218\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.450\nOne of the things that we have to be\ncareful with is something known as rogue\n\n219\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.910\nDHCP servers.\n\n220\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.460\nBecause I can start doing a denial\nof service on your network and\n\n221\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.090\nI've actually been in networks\nwhere this has happened.\n\n222\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.430\nIt was unintentional but\nunintentional or malicious, same result.\n\n223\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.270\nWe had a lot of machines\nthat lost connectivity.\n\n224\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.351\nAnd the reason was there was\nan unauthorized DHTP server.\n\n225\n00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.415\nThere was a DHTP server\nthat was set up and\n\n226\n00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:25.090\nit was passing out IP addresses to clients\non the network when they asked for one.\n\n227\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.160\nThe problem was it was passing\nout IP addresses that didn't work\n\n228\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.080\non our network, right?\n\n229\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.662\nWe had, I think at the time,\nwe were using maybe a class B subnet,\n\n230\n00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:34.432\nit was using some other subnet.\n\n231\n00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:36.800\nIt was giving them\na different default gateway.\n\n232\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.310\nSo while they got the configuration,\nit was the wrong configuration.\n\n233\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.760\nIt wasn't valid for the network,\nso they all lost connectivity.\n\n234\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.260\nThat's a rogue DHCP server,\none that shouldn't be there, and\n\n235\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.990\nit's not configured properly.\n\n236\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.930\nAnd as a bad guy, if I can get into\nyour network somehow and run a little\n\n237\n00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:59.060\nmachine that's providing DHCP,\nthere's not a lot of security with DHCP.\n\n238\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.920\nIt's done all by broadcast traffic because\n\n239\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.490\nthe node itself that needs the IP\naddress doesn't have an IP address yet.\n\n240\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.610\nSo it can't send unicast traffic it's\njust hollering out on the network.\n\n241\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:16.140\nAnd any DACP server that hears that\nreturns with a broadcast answer.\n\n242\n00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.570\nAnd so the rogue one as\nwell as the authorized one.\n\n243\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.460\nCan respond to that.\n\n244\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.890\nSo it's a challenge\nsometimes to control that.\n\n245\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.160\n&gt;&gt; In context, I gotta question.\n\n246\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.760\nYou say it's domain joined.\n\n247\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.480\nSo let's just say for\n\n248\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.650\nconversation purposes, we have\nanother server that is domain joined.\n\n249\n00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.954\nAnd let's say, I didn't talk with you.\n\n250\n00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:37.920\nMaybe I stole your password, right?\n\n251\n00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.540\nAnd I get in there ,and I bring\nup another member server.\n\n252\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.507\nI install this service.\n\n253\n00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:44.800\nAnd what will it do if it's a DHCP server?\n\n254\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.183\n&gt;&gt; If it's a DHCP server and\nit's not authorized it won't start.\n\n255\n00:11:48.183 --> 00:11:52.939\nThe machine started up, but\nDHCP the service will log an error and\n\n256\n00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:55.110\nwill not respond to clients.\n\n257\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.520\nIt won't do it's job.\n\n258\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.290\nThe first thing a DHCP server does,\na Windows based DHCP server does,\n\n259\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.770\nis when it starts up and it starts\nthe service If it's a part of a domain\n\n260\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.150\nit checks with the active directory to see\nif it's on the list of authorized servers.\n\n261\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.280\nIf it's not, it won't respond to clients.\n\n262\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.080\nIf it is,\nit will begin responding to clients.\n\n263\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:21.705\nSo, that step of authorizing it is a way\nthat I can say, this server is authorized.\n\n264\n00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:25.511\nAnd it's a good thing but\nit's not the end all when it comes to\n\n265\n00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.890\npreventing rogue DHCP servers\ncuz here's the downside.\n\n266\n00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.490\nOnly Windows based DHCP servers\n\n267\n00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.740\nknow to check in with Active Directory\njust to see if they're authorized.\n\n268\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.820\nIf Wes spins up a Linux box and\n\n269\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.190\nruns DHCP on it I don't have\nany way of controlling that.\n\n270\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.160\nOur wireless access points, almost all of\nthem have a DHCP engine built into it.\n\n271\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.138\nMost of your virtualization solutions,\nlike VirtualBox,\n\n272\n00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.794\ncan actually be configured to run DHDP.\n\n273\n00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:58.361\nIntending to provide the virtual machines\nIP addresses but if configured incorrectly\n\n274\n00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.364\nor correctly if you're malicious it\ncould list it on the physical adapter of\n\n275\n00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:07.125\nthe machine that virtual box is running on\nand provide IP addresses to the network.\n\n276\n00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:11.195\nAgain, which would be unauthorized and\nmost likely not the correct configuration.\n\n277\n00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:15.419\nAnd I have no way or really well, there\nare some ways but not with in Windows,\n\n278\n00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:19.230\nthat's done at the router level,\nCisco, things like that.\n\n279\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.278\nSo understand that authorizing\na server is required.\n\n280\n00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:26.690\nMy Windows based DHTP servers\nwon't function if they're not, but\n\n281\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.880\nit's not the end all in\nsecurity because other brands\n\n282\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.590\nare not gonna care if\nthey're authorized or not.\n\n283\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.770\nSo let's see how we can do it.\n\n284\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.250\nWe could have done it through the wizard.\n\n285\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.040\nInstead, we chose not to.\n\n286\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.470\nSo I'm now gonna launch\nup my DHCP console.\n\n287\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.980\nAnd if we expand this guy out, we'll see\nred downward pointing arrows over here.\n\n288\n00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.510\nNothing's going on, so\n\n289\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:52.540\nI'm gonna right click on my server,\nand I'm gonna choose authorize.\n\n290\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.240\nAll right, then we give it just a second,\nwe refresh, and as I have\n\n291\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.890\ngreen check marks, well technically\nwhite check marks on a green circle, but\n\n292\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.860\nI have check marks now instead\nof downward pointing arrows.\n\n293\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.610\n&gt;&gt; So at this point,\nthis dhcp server is ready to go,\n\n294\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.160\nwe're handing out IP addresses.\n\n295\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.094\n&gt;&gt; Not quite.\n\n296\n00:14:11.094 --> 00:14:14.555\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately it doesn't know\nwhat IP addresses to pass out yet.\n\n297\n00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:16.930\nWe have to create something called scopes.\n\n298\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.380\nLet me tell you one more place,\nthe other thing you can do.\n\n299\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.160\nSo if I right click on my server\nagain you see I could unauthorize it,\n\n300\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.380\nif I was tearing this guy down for\nsome reason.\n\n301\n00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.090\nI can also select dhcp at the very top.\n\n302\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.970\nAnd choose Manage Authorized Servers.\n\n303\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.950\nThis pulls up a list of all\nauthorized DHCP servers.\n\n304\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.620\nI might have five or\n\n305\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.570\nsix on my network supporting\ndifferent subnets or what have you.\n\n306\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.324\nWhere as when you right\nclick on your server,\n\n307\n00:14:41.324 --> 00:14:42.856\nyou're dealing with that one server.\n\n308\n00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:46.262\nIf you right click on DHCP,\nyou can manage the list itself,\n\n309\n00:14:46.262 --> 00:14:50.349\nand I can see server one is in the list or\nI can see that somebody wasn't in\n\n310\n00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:55.000\nthe list and I can add and remove\nthe DHCP servers from right over here.\n\n311\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.910\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nbecause you mentioned active directory,\n\n312\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.450\nI don't see an active\ndirectory console open here.\n\n313\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.280\nThat list, would that also update\nyour active directory database?\n\n314\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.414\nSo like other DCs and\nstuff would be aware of that [CROSSTALK].\n\n315\n00:15:05.414 --> 00:15:08.907\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that list is actually\nin the active directory database.\n\n316\n00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:09.941\nSo when I right click and\n\n317\n00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:13.740\nchoose that it's pulling that\ninformation from active directory.\n\n318\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.230\nAll right, so we've got DHCP step up,\nwe have authorized it, but\n\n319\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.310\nas we pointed out a second ago,\nits really not doing me any good,\n\n320\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.590\nbecause it doesn't have any\nIP address to pass out.\n\n321\n00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.486\nSo it's sitting here and listening,\nwaiting for people to ask for\n\n322\n00:15:28.486 --> 00:15:32.140\nan IP address, but if it hears something,\nit not gonna be able to respond.\n\n323\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.120\nSo the first thing we have to do\nis create what we call a scope.\n\n324\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.930\nA scope is simply a pool of addresses\nthat I'm telling DHCP that it's\n\n325\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:46.030\nallowed to pass out when asked for\nan IP address, all right?\n\n326\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.090\nAnd a few other configurations.\n\n327\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.350\nThere's actually a lot of configuration\ngoes on with it, but in its simplest form,\n\n328\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.953\na scope is a pool of IP address and\nthen the associated properties with.\n\n329\n00:15:54.953 --> 00:16:00.080\nSo when I expand out IPv4 I don't\nhave any scopes under this.\n\n330\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.713\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna right\nclick on IPv4 and choose New Scope.\n\n331\n00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:09.501\nAll right, that's gonna open\nup my New Scope Wizard, and\n\n332\n00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.910\nI'm gonna click Next on the Wizard.\n\n333\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.380\nAnd we'll zoom in a little bit, and\nI've gotta give the scope a name.\n\n334\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.190\nAnd this is really just administrative.\n\n335\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.310\nIt's gonna show up in the console, helps\nme remember why or what the purpose was.\n\n336\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:28.913\nWhy I created it, or\nwhat the purpose was of this scope.\n\n337\n00:16:28.913 --> 00:16:33.230\nI'm just gonna call it Subnet1, because\nI'm not all that creative on a Friday.\n\n338\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:40.150\nAnd I'll click Next, and\nthen I have the Start and End IP address.\n\n339\n00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.485\nSo let's put in my start address,\n\n340\n00:16:43.485 --> 00:16:48.545\nit's gonna be 10.0., we'll do 10, oops,\n\n341\n00:16:48.545 --> 00:16:54.548\nI'm sorry 100.10 and then 10.0.100.99.\n\n342\n00:16:54.548 --> 00:16:58.790\nSo, I'm saying between 10, and\nactually, I'll go all the way up to,\n\n343\n00:17:00.205 --> 00:17:03.415\nI guess some server's at 100,\nyeah, we better stick with 99.\n\n344\n00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:05.835\nSo we'll set our range, start and end.\n\n345\n00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:08.785\nAnd then down below,\nyou've got your subnet mask.\n\n346\n00:17:08.785 --> 00:17:13.974\nAnd you can configure this either way,\nI can use the spinners, and\n\n347\n00:17:13.974 --> 00:17:18.989\nyou'll see the subnet mask changing,\nor I can use the numbers.\n\n348\n00:17:18.989 --> 00:17:20.530\nAnd you'll see the spinner change.\n\n349\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.240\nSo either way you wanna go.\n\n350\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.480\n&gt;&gt; Right here, Mike,\nin this little piece of the wizard here,\n\n351\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.650\ngot a question about this.\n\n352\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.250\nNow, would you have to have\ngood network documentation?\n\n353\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.070\nBecause you talked about\nthe purpose of static IP addresses.\n\n354\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.610\nAnd let's just say,\nI didn't do documentation, and\n\n355\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.440\nI've got a statically mapped IP address.\n\n356\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.400\nIt's not gonna check in\nwith this database, right?\n\n357\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.280\nNow, the machine won't.\n\n358\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.990\nSo, documentation.\n\n359\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.220\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, in fact, you know what,\nyou bring up a good point.\n\n360\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.600\nI'm gonna go ahead and make this guy go to\n199, so we can kind of, pull that back up.\n\n361\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.000\nWe'll kind of curb that thought.\n\n362\n00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.760\nBut absolutely, as far as this goes.\n\n363\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.196\nYou have to understand that if I make\na pool that goes form 10 to 199,\n\n364\n00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:03.252\nand let's say I've got\nsome printers out there,\n\n365\n00:18:03.252 --> 00:18:06.998\nthat one of those printer\nhas an IP address of 100.50.\n\n366\n00:18:06.998 --> 00:18:08.780\nWell, I'm gonna run into a problem,\nbecause now,\n\n367\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.890\nI've got the potential\nof duplicate addresses.\n\n368\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.790\nDHCP is gonna say 10., or\n100.50 is part of my addresses.\n\n369\n00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.580\nI can pass that out to a client.\n\n370\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.530\nNow all of a sudden, that client and\nthe printer have a duplicate.\n\n371\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.600\nSo that can definitely cause a problem.\n\n372\n00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.100\nSo, you do have to think about it,\nand there's ways that I can help\n\n373\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.100\nwork with that very situation that\nI'll show you in just a little bit.\n\n374\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.280\nAll right,\nI'm gonna click Next on my wizard.\n\n375\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.140\nThen this is how we can help\nwith that very situation.\n\n376\n00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.630\nI told you I'd talk about it\nin a minute and there we go.\n\n377\n00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.060\nThese are my exclusions and delays.\n\n378\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.540\nExclusions allow me to set that\npool on the previous page.\n\n379\n00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.732\nBut then blank out certain\nparts of that pool, right?\n\n380\n00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:55.240\nBecause I know that I wanna use this\nwhole range, 10 through 199, but\n\n381\n00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.108\nsomebody's, a long time ago,\nused addresses like 101, 102, 103,\n\n382\n00:19:00.108 --> 00:19:03.130\nand I don't want DHCP passing those out.\n\n383\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.086\nSo what I can do is I'm\ngonna add an exclusion.\n\n384\n00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:12.535\n10.0.100.100 through 10.0.100.,\n\n385\n00:19:12.535 --> 00:19:19.697\nI didn't go past 110, so\nwe should be good to go there.\n\n386\n00:19:19.697 --> 00:19:24.130\nAll right, so those addresses, even though\nthey're defined as part of the scope.\n\n387\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.890\nWell, DHCP will not pass those out, right?\n\n388\n00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.240\nYou can also do single addresses.\n\n389\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.193\nLet's say that years ago,\nsomebody set a printer's IP address, and\n\n390\n00:19:31.193 --> 00:19:34.761\nyou can't use that address, and it's right\nin the middle of the pool you wanna use.\n\n391\n00:19:34.761 --> 00:19:39.054\nWell okay, 10.0.100.200.\n\n392\n00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.380\nSo don't put an end address, click Add.\n\n393\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.350\nAnd you can do, it does have to be in\nyour range, otherwise DHCP doesn't care.\n\n394\n00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.470\nLet's say 199 and add,\nand then there we go.\n\n395\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.390\nAll right, so there's a couple\ndifferent schools of thoughts.\n\n396\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.080\nYou could try to make your pool\n\n397\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.760\nto where it didn't include\naddresses that were already used.\n\n398\n00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.866\nI could have stopped this at 99,\nlike I was gonna do originally.\n\n399\n00:20:03.866 --> 00:20:06.530\nThen I wouldn't have had to make\nthe exceptions for 100, 101, 102, 103, and\n\n400\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.930\nthose guys.\n\n401\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.450\nOr you might set this from 1 to 254,\nif it's a class C, or what have you.\n\n402\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.740\nAnd then go back and make exclusions for\neverything you need to block out.\n\n403\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.980\nSo, couple different schools of thought,\nreally doesn't matter which way you do it,\n\n404\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.650\nas long as you document what you're doing,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.970\nClick Next, so I've got my exclusions.\n\n406\n00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.050\nAnd we'll click Next, and\n\n407\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.550\nthen for my Lease Duration,\nthis is how long the lease is good for.\n\n408\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.130\nWhen we get an IP address from a DHCP\nserver, it's not a permanent assignment.\n\n409\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:43.192\nIt's leased to client or\nto the DHCP client, which means when I\n\n410\n00:20:43.192 --> 00:20:49.225\nneed to either renew it before the lease\nexpires, or I'm gonna give it up.\n\n411\n00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:54.451\nOnce the lease is expired, I won't use it,\nand the node will not use it anymore.\n\n412\n00:20:54.451 --> 00:20:59.480\nAnd basically,\nhe'll go back to APIPA most likely.\n\n413\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.560\nSo how long is the lease good for?\n\n414\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.950\nI'm gonna leave it at\nthe default eight days.\n\n415\n00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:04.750\nWe'll click Next.\n\n416\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.280\nAnd then, I can also configure some of\nthe options here, or I could wait and\n\n417\n00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.490\nconfigure them on my\nconsole after the fact.\n\n418\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.090\nI'll go ahead and say, yes,\nI wanna configure these options now.\n\n419\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.400\nIt doesn't go through all the options,\njust the most important ones, or\n\n420\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.340\nthe most commonly used ones.\n\n421\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.490\nSo I'll click Next.\n\n422\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.320\nAnd the first one is Router or\nDefault Gateway.\n\n423\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:30.237\nAnd I wanna do 0.100., oops,\nall right, that's not right, 0.1.\n\n424\n00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:34.703\nRight, yeah, I had to think about,\nwait, what's my default gateway?\n\n425\n00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:39.010\nYeah, 10.0.0.1 is my default gateway,\nall right?\n\n426\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.220\nAnd you do have to make sure you\nclick Add, you see what I did there?\n\n427\n00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.670\nWhen you type it in,\nvery easy to go and click Next.\n\n428\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.230\nIf you don't click add,\nit won't remember when you click Next.\n\n429\n00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.870\nIt'll wipe it out.\n\n430\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.460\nSo you have to click Add to\ndrop it down into the list, and\n\n431\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.210\nthen you're gonna click Next.\n\n432\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.610\nAnd then, this is already filled out, it\ndetects the domain that's it's a part of,\n\n433\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.840\nso it's got that.\n\n434\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.120\nIt found my DNS server, so it says hey,\n\n435\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.670\ndo you want me to pass this out, as the IP\naddress for the DNS server, absolutely.\n\n436\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.870\nIf I had others that I wanted to add,\nI could definitely do that.\n\n437\n00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.260\nIf I didn't know the IP address,\nI could type in a name,\n\n438\n00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.310\nand then resolve it to an IP address, and\nthen click Add to drop it down in there.\n\n439\n00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.740\nWe'll click Next.\n\n440\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.960\nWINS, I'm not using on this network,\nso we'll skip it and I'll click Next.\n\n441\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.850\nAnd then do I wanna activate the scope or\nnot?\n\n442\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.450\nI'm gonna choose No, so that I can show\nyou how to do it in the console, and\n\n443\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.650\nI'm gonna click Next.\n\n444\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.110\nBut scopes have to be activated.\n\n445\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.980\nWhen you look at this scope now,\nyou'll see that it's sitting there, but\n\n446\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.530\nit has a little red\ndownward pointing arrow.\n\n447\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.370\nAnd my IPv4 node has\na little exclamation on it.\n\n448\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.896\nAnd that's letting me know that hey,\n\n449\n00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:46.700\nthere's a scope in there\nthat's not activated.\n\n450\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.390\nNow, I do that a lot of times\nwhen I'm setting things up.\n\n451\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.000\nI'm not ready for it to start\npassing out IP addresses just yet.\n\n452\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.680\nI haven't configured all the options,\nso I won't activate it,\n\n453\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.040\nthat way I'm not giving\nout partial information.\n\n454\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.650\nOr I might be testing something,\nI wanna turn a scope off temporarily.\n\n455\n00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.250\nI can just come in here and activate it.\n\n456\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.876\nBut when I'm ready for\nit to start passing out addresses,\n\n457\n00:23:07.876 --> 00:23:10.610\nI am gonna need to activate it and\nthat simply right click.\n\n458\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.412\nOops, right click and activate.\n\n459\n00:23:14.412 --> 00:23:18.353\nAnd the red little arrow goes away,\nand now we're good to go, and\n\n460\n00:23:18.353 --> 00:23:20.815\nI see a green check mark on my IPV4 node.\n\n461\n00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:23.090\nAll right, now, we got that scope created.\n\n462\n00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.950\nI've got my address pool, and\nyou can see my range of addresses,\n\n463\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.420\n10 through 199 and my exclusions.\n\n464\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.160\nDon't pass out 100 through 110 and\ndon't pass out 199.\n\n465\n00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.460\nAll right, my exclusions there.\n\n466\n00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.990\nLeases, we don't have any yet.\n\n467\n00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.880\nWe'll see those in a minute\nonce we start using this.\n\n468\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.990\nWe'll come back and talk about\nreservations here in just a minute.\n\n469\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.990\nScope options, those are the ones that\nwe set in our installation wizard.\n\n470\n00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:57.515\nSo there's that default gateway, my DNS\nserver, my DNS domain name, all there.\n\n471\n00:23:57.515 --> 00:24:01.094\nAnd then policies, we're also gonna\ntalk about in a minute as well.\n\n472\n00:24:01.094 --> 00:24:04.310\nNow, when you're configuring these,\nlet's wait on the options.\n\n473\n00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.176\nLet's see what I've got.\nI don't wanna miss anything here,\n\n474\n00:24:07.176 --> 00:24:09.952\nlet's actually use the scope, right?\n\n475\n00:24:09.952 --> 00:24:11.646\nWe created it, let's see it in action.\n\n476\n00:24:11.646 --> 00:24:14.730\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nflip over to one of my clients.\n\n477\n00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.540\nClient one is gonna be our guinea pig,\nright?\n\n478\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.824\nAnd I'm gonna open up\nhis TCP/IP properties.\n\n479\n00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:28.979\nRight click Properties.\n\n480\n00:24:30.393 --> 00:24:34.550\nAnd I'm gonna go down to IPv4 and\npull up those properties.\n\n481\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.320\nAnd I can see this one is statically\nmapped to use this address.\n\n482\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.180\nOkay, well I'm gonna change that to\nobtain an IP address automatically.\n\n483\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.780\nObtain a DNS server address automatically.\n\n484\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.910\nI'm gonna click OK and I'm gonna click OK.\n\n485\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.390\nNotice when I clicked OK it\nkinda hung there for a minute.\n\n486\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.340\nIt still hasn't gone away.\n\n487\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.610\nThat's cuz it's applying those\nchanges in the background and\n\n488\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.550\nit's trying to contact the DHCP server\nto see if it can get an address.\n\n489\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.830\nIt got a different address\nthan it had before,\n\n490\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.160\nwhich means I lost my\nconnection to that machine.\n\n491\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.470\nSo we'll have to go a different route.\n\n492\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:13.440\nSo let me flip back over to my host and\nwe'll connect back to client one.\n\n493\n00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:17.510\nAll right?\n\n494\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:22.030\nSo same machine, I'm just gonna reconnect\nto it, as a domain user, not a local user.\n\n495\n00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:30.576\nAnd if we'd look at the Properties we'll\ngo right back where I was IPv4, and\n\n496\n00:25:30.576 --> 00:25:32.950\nyou see those changes were applied.\n\n497\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.970\nAll right.\n\n498\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.980\nNow, let's see what we've got.\n\n499\n00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.290\nI'm gonna open up PowerShell.\n\n500\n00:25:41.662 --> 00:25:44.000\nWait for it, and we'll type ipconfig.\n\n501\n00:25:45.602 --> 00:25:49.560\nAnd look there, I got 10.0.100.10.\n\n502\n00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.040\nThere's my default gateway.\n\n503\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:59.210\nIf I did an IP config all, I should see\nthat my DNS server is set to 100.200.\n\n504\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.940\nAnd I can also see DHCP enabled, yes.\n\n505\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.750\nThat's how I know I'm getting this\nIP address from a DHCP server\n\n506\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.080\nand I'm not sure what's going\nwith my connection there.\n\n507\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.630\nOur network is going up and down.\n\n508\n00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.210\nI can also see this information.\n\n509\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.480\nAnother indicator that I'm getting\nthis IP address from DHCP.\n\n510\n00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.510\nIt's not static because I can see when\nI got the lease, which is right now,\n\n511\n00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.180\nwhen I just asked for the IP address.\n\n512\n00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.990\nAnd look, it's good for eight days.\n\n513\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.390\nFrom the 18th to the 26\nlike we said in our wizard.\n\n514\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.500\n&gt;&gt; Mike you know I noticed something\nwhen you did change that from a static\n\n515\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.070\nassignment and\nyou change the DHCP something\n\n516\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.530\nthat you are relying on this case\non your remote desktop connection.\n\n517\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.310\nIt failed.\n\n518\n00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.470\nNow you saw at the beginning of\nthe episode that you've got to be careful.\n\n519\n00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.840\nYou wouldn't want your servers\nto change their IP addresses,\n\n520\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.960\nemail server if you're\ntrying to find it right.\n\n521\n00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.580\nWould this be a classic example\nof even on a simplistic level\n\n522\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.830\nit might cause a problem with\nanother server or application.\n\n523\n00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely right because if I'm\nremoted in and in my case I did.\n\n524\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.730\nIf I was to show you my remote\ndesktop connection window,\n\n525\n00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.490\nI connect to these guys by IP address.\n\n526\n00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.310\nCuz I statically map them all\nwhen I set up my labs, so\n\n527\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.620\nthat I know which machine is which.\n\n528\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.460\nI've only got five, I can remember them.\n\n529\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.150\nAnd in my remote desktop console,\nI've got their IP addresses listed,\n\n530\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.060\nnot their names.\n\n531\n00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.200\nSo when I change when that IP address\nchanged, I dropped my connection.\n\n532\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.450\nIf I was to go back to that and\n\n533\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.080\ntry to double click on it again,\nit wouldn't be able to connect.\n\n534\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.280\nBecause it's no longer\nthe same IP address.\n\n535\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.240\nAnd that's a very good example, or a real\nexample of how DHCP could affect you.\n\n536\n00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.850\n&gt;&gt; And it just shows you\nthere that static assignment.\n\n537\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.340\nIt does have its place here\ninside of our networks as\n\n538\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.430\nwell as dynamic making it a little\nbit easier if you've got 500 clients.\n\n539\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.310\nWell, I guess if you\nwere getting paid hourly,\n\n540\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.520\nI wouldn't mind statically mapping them.\n\n541\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.940\nBut you guys have seen the way I type, and\nyou know that wouldn't go over too well.\n\n542\n00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.420\nMike, I know that we have just scratched\nthe surface when it comes to DHCP, and\n\n543\n00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.280\nI know we got a lot more\ninformation to come.\n\n544\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.750\nDo you want to save that for\na part two, or\n\n545\n00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.280\nyou got anything else\nyou'd like to throw in?\n\n546\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.370\n&gt;&gt; I do, but there is one more\nthing I want to show you guys,\n\n547\n00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:09.040\nlet's go back over to my DHCP server and\njust see what happened over here.\n\n548\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.760\nIf I go down to address leases and\nI refresh,\n\n549\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.790\nthere we can see the client 01\npulled an IP address from DHCP.\n\n550\n00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.450\nSo what DHCP did was, client 01 said hey,\nI need an IP address.\n\n551\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:27.200\nDHCP here, server one, looked through this\npool, took the first available one out of\n\n552\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.380\nthe pool and said, here you go,\nwhy don't you use this one?\n\n553\n00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.700\nThe client said sure,\nthank you very much, I'll use that one.\n\n554\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.040\nThe DHCP server then writes down\nwho he gave that address to.\n\n555\n00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.590\nAnd that one is no longer available In the\npool, he can't give the same IP address to\n\n556\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.620\ntwo different clients otherwise we have a\nconflict, so he's gonna keep track of that\n\n557\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.270\nlease information and\nthat's what we're seeing here.\n\n558\n00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.400\nAnd that is all we'll do for now,\nwhen we come back we do have more, we'll\n\n559\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.030\nstart talking about some of the different\noptions that we have to configure cause\n\n560\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.450\nwe've really just scratched\nthe surface there.\n\n561\n00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.530\nWe also wanna take a look at\nsomething known as reservations and\n\n562\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.130\npolicies as well.\n\n563\n00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a lot of great information\nMike and I guess we're gonna go ahead and\n\n564\n00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.290\nwe'll wrap it up here.\n\n565\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.170\nIt's been a great episode,\nthank you for watching.\n\n566\n00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.120\nSigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n567\n00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n568\n00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.749\n&gt;&gt; Stick around cuz we got a lot more DHCP\nand networking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n569\n00:29:22.568 --> 00:29:26.778\n[MUSIC]\n\n570\n00:29:26.778 -->

00:00:06.166\n&gt;&gt; Coming at you live from San Francisco,\n\n4\n00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.320\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.673\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:12.328\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:14.989\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.679\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.827\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n10\n00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:21.493\nwe're continuing along our journey in\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n11\n00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:24.275\nAnd we've been talking about a very,\nvery important service.\n\n12\n00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.345\nI'm glad to be here,\nexcited to be a part of it.\n\n13\n00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:28.935\nJoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:29.955\nMike, how are you doing, sir?\n\n15\n00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:31.065\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:35.345\nAnd yeah, we're continuing on\nin the wonderful world of DHCP.\n\n17\n00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:37.624\nSo let's just jump right back into it.\n\n18\n00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:41.420\nWe had finished the previous episode,\nwe created a scope.\n\n19\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.410\nWe set a couple of\nthe basic options in there.\n\n20\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.750\nThen we took one of our clients and we\nturned it into a DHCP client by choosing\n\n21\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.930\nobtain an IP address and\na DNS server address automatically.\n\n22\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.060\nAnd we saw that it was\nable to pull that back.\n\n23\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.128\nThey don't really call it out\nin the objectives anymore, but\n\n24\n00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:01.790\nI do wanna mention that process just\nin case they ask you on the exam.\n\n25\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.980\nIt's also really good when\nyou're troubleshooting.\n\n26\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.770\nThat process the client goes through\nwhen you turn it to a DHCP client.\n\n27\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.894\nSo any DHCP client, when they start up or\nwhen they need an IP address.\n\n28\n00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:16.514\nThere's a four-step process they go\nthrough to obtain that configuration\n\n29\n00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:20.951\ninformation from a DHCP server,\nand it's known as DORA, D-O-R-A.\n\n30\n00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:27.000\nIt's discover, offer, request,\nacknowledge, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.930\nSo the client sends out a broadcast and\nsays, hey, I'm looking for a DHCP server.\n\n32\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.260\nAnybody out there?\n\n33\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.440\nThat's the discover, I need to discover\nthe DHCP servers on the network.\n\n34\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.040\nAll DHCP servers that hear that broadcast,\nthey're programmed to respond to it.\n\n35\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.250\nThat's their job in life,\nis to listen for that discover packet and\n\n36\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.230\nrespond to it with what we call an offer.\n\n37\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.760\nLet me take one of the addresses out of my\npool, wrap it up in a nice little bow, and\n\n38\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.450\nsay, here you go,\nhere's an IP address that you could use.\n\n39\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.140\nThe client might get more than one offer.\n\n40\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250\nIf there's more than one server on\nthe network that's supplying addresses,\n\n41\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.670\nit could get more than one offer.\n\n42\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.810\nSo he's got all these offers coming in.\n\n43\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.770\nThe client doesn't look at him and go,\nooh, this one's odd, this one's even.\n\n44\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.062\nI like odd numbers better,\nI'll take this IP address.\n\n45\n00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:18.580\nThe first offer that gets to him\nis the one he's going to take.\n\n46\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.633\nSo whichever server was faster, usually\nwe're talking about physical proximity,\n\n47\n00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:23.430\nwire distance.\n\n48\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.890\nSo that's the offer.\n\n49\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.410\nThe client takes that first offer and\nrequests, it says, hey, I got your offer.\n\n50\n00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.420\nI would like to use this if I can,\nI want this address.\n\n51\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.980\nIt's still not the client's yet, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.120\nIt's still in the pending stage.\n\n53\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600\nHe says, I got your offer and I wanna\nrequest it, I wanna start using it.\n\n54\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.940\nThat's the R in DORA, the request.\n\n55\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.170\nSo he sends that request back\nto the offering DHCP services.\n\n56\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.870\nI got it, I wanna use it.\n\n57\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.420\nThe server says, all right,\nI'm gonna mark you down.\n\n58\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.320\nIt's yours, you can now start using it.\n\n59\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.340\nThat's the acknowledgement.\n\n60\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060\nSo D-O-R-A, DORA, four-step process.\n\n61\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.650\nIf you wanna see it,\nit's actually very easy to see.\n\n62\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.567\nIn your little practice labs, fire up\nyour DHCP server, fire up your client,\n\n63\n00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:07.584\nfire up Wireshark, all right.\n\n64\n00:03:07.584 --> 00:03:12.370\nOn your DHCP server or the other end,\nit doesn't really matter which end.\n\n65\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.310\nAnd start capturing packets, and\n\n66\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.950\nthen do an ipconfig release\nrenew to start that process up.\n\n67\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.150\nAnd you'll see those four packets\nin that order, the discover,\n\n68\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.880\nthe offer, the request,\nthe acknowledgement.\n\n69\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.650\nIt's really cool to see.\n\n70\n00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.490\nAll right, so anyway,\nwe got that basics out of there.\n\n71\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.413\nNow the next thing I wanna talk about,\nso we've given it an IP address,\n\n72\n00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.976\neverything's working good there.\n\n73\n00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:34.620\nI wanna talk a little\nbit more about scopes.\n\n74\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.740\nAnd we're gonna talk about superscopes and\nmulticast scopes.\n\n75\n00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.186\nWe'll come back around and talk about some\nof these options here in just a second.\n\n76\n00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:49.268\nBut our scope, in our case has a pool of,\nI forgot how many we set up, 189, 188.\n\n77\n00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:53.299\n188 addresses, somewhere around there.\n\n78\n00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.950\nWe can do something called a superscope.\n\n79\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.992\nAnd a superscope is nothing more\nthan a combination of scopes,\n\n80\n00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:02.440\nmore than one scope\nkinda plugged together.\n\n81\n00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.008\nYou don't see these that often,\nbut they're still there and\n\n82\n00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.110\nwe should know what they are.\n\n83\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.290\nAnd again, it's a combination of scopes.\n\n84\n00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.750\nAnd you see this in places where they're\ngoing through some growing pains.\n\n85\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.760\nThey started out with\na class C network address.\n\n86\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.775\nSo you got 254 possible hosts minus\nany exclusions that you made and\n\n87\n00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:21.873\nthings like that.\n\n88\n00:04:21.873 --> 00:04:25.990\nAnd yeah, we've only got 50 hosts,\nthat'll last us forever.\n\n89\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.070\nUntil you start figuring out that\neverybody brings in their laptop,\n\n90\n00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.940\nand their tablet, and their phone, and\ntheir watch, and their tennis shoes.\n\n91\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.000\nAnd they all wanna connect to the [LAUGH]\nwireless access to your network.\n\n92\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.920\nSo they're just eating up your addresses\nfaster than you can dish them out.\n\n93\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.220\nAnd pretty soon you're like,\nno, I'm out of addresses.\n\n94\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510\nAnd if you lease all those addresses out,\nand then somebody else says, hey,\n\n95\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.490\nI need an IP address,\nyour DHCP server can't do anything.\n\n96\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.830\nHe just says, sorry, I'm out of addresses.\n\n97\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.720\nIf somebody gives one up,\nI'll give you that one, but until then,\n\n98\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.136\nyou're kinda up the creek without\nthe paddle, if you know what I mean.\n\n99\n00:04:59.136 --> 00:05:03.280\nSo maybe where we're going\nthrough those growing pains,\n\n100\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.440\nwhat I can do is I can create\nanother class C scope, okay.\n\n101\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.930\nAnd then I can merge the, not really\nmerge the two, but I can join the two and\n\n102\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.510\ntreat them as a unit.\n\n103\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.350\nAnd I can basically double up or\ngain more IP addresses.\n\n104\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.086\nFor example, let me go ahead and\ncreate a couple just test scopes so\n\n105\n00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:23.634\nI don't goof up our scope.\n\n106\n00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:27.475\nI'm gonna create a new scope,\nand I'm gonna do this real quick.\n\n107\n00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:30.187\nI'm just gonna call this test1.\n\n108\n00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:34.499\nAnd I'll say, we're gonna give\n\n109\n00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.431\nout 192.168.1.1 through\n\n110\n00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:44.650\n192.168.1.254.\n\n111\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.606\nAnd that's not 254, Mike, there we go.\n\n112\n00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:50.130\nAnd I'll click Next, no exclusions.\n\n113\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.370\nNext, Next, Next, just again,\nall the defaults.\n\n114\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.560\nI'm not even gonna configure the options,\nand Finish.\n\n115\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.921\nAnd then I'm gonna make another one\nreal quick and do Scope &gt; Next,\n\n116\n00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:04.448\ncall this one, you'll never guess,\noops, evidently it won't go-\n\n117\n00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:05.108\n&gt;&gt; No, they won't.\n\n118\n00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:06.333\n&gt;&gt; I'll call it ET, yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Test2, we'll go Next, and\n\n120\n00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:16.106\nthis one's gonna be 192.168.2.1\n\n121\n00:06:16.106 --> 00:06:20.940\nthrough 192.168.2.254.\n\n122\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.380\nSame thing, Next, no exclusions, nothing,\nconfigure those later, Next &gt; Finish.\n\n123\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.950\nSo now I've got these two scopes.\n\n124\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.390\nAnd that's an important thing to note,\n\n125\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.170\nthat I made the two scopes\nbefore I made the superscope.\n\n126\n00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.240\nCuz what you're gonna see is when I\ngo through the superscope wizard,\n\n127\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.720\nthere is no create scope option.\n\n128\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.240\nYou're gonna pick from existing scopes.\n\n129\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.320\nSo the scopes have to\nbe made ahead of time,\n\n130\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.270\nthen you can combine\nthem into a superscope.\n\n131\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.950\nI'm gonna right-click, New Superscope.\n\n132\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.900\nI just like saying that, superscope.\n\n133\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.550\nIt's the new and improved mouthwash!\n\n134\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.700\nI'll click Next, and I'm gonna give\nthe scope name of a Supertest,\n\n135\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.740\nand we'll click Next.\n\n136\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.450\nAnd here you can see my list of available\nsubnets, I'll choose the two that I want.\n\n137\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.540\nI'll click Next &gt; Finish, and that's it.\n\n138\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.100\nNotice they're gone individually,\nthey're now hidden underneath superscope.\n\n139\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.670\nThey're still there, they're just\nunderneath my superscope, all right.\n\n140\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.530\nAnd that's how you can increase.\n\n141\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.650\nSo if you're planning on growing the\nnetwork, but you're not ready to redo your\n\n142\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.080\nentire structure, you could just make\nanother subnet or another scope.\n\n143\n00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.220\nKinda join it with a different scope and\n\n144\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.680\nbasically add addresses\nto your possible pool.\n\n145\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.394\nDo keep in mind, though, that technically,\nif I get an address from this network and\n\n146\n00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:45.012\nanother guy gets an address\nfrom this network,\n\n147\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:47.384\nthey're not on the same network, right?\n\n148\n00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:53.391\nThat was a class C, that's a 255,\nit's a 192.168.1.network and a 2.network.\n\n149\n00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:55.490\nSo you are gonna have to\ndeal with routing and\n\n150\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.121\nmaking sure that everything\nis configured properly.\n\n151\n00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.504\nTo support both of those ranges.\n\n152\n00:08:00.504 --> 00:08:03.353\nCuz if Wes' client,\nif he reboots his machine,\n\n153\n00:08:03.353 --> 00:08:07.250\nhe gets an IP address\nfrom 192.168.1 today.\n\n154\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.042\nNext week when his lease expires,\nhe might get one from 192.168.2.0.\n\n155\n00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:13.019\nWhich means he needs a different gateway.\n\n156\n00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:15.360\nAnd there has be to routing setup for\nthat.\n\n157\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.010\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n158\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.352\nThat's a superscope.\n\n159\n00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:21.740\nYou can also create\na multicast scope in DNS.\n\n160\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.998\nI can right, DNS, DHCP.\n\n161\n00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:27.667\nI can right-click New multicast Scope.\n\n162\n00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.800\nAnd it's gonna run me through a wizard,\nas well.\n\n163\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.260\nMulticast, hopefully, again,\nif you've been through your Network+,\n\n164\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.195\nyou've familiar with\nthe concept of a multicast.\n\n165\n00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:38.260\nWe got different types of casts.\n\n166\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.080\nWe got sidearm casts,\nwe got the overhead, no.\n\n167\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.005\nYou got one-to-one,\none-to-all, and one-to-many.\n\n168\n00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:52.360\nOne-to-one, unicast, one-to-all,\nbroadcast, one-to-many is your multicast.\n\n169\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.800\nNot everybody, but more than one, usually.\n\n170\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.360\nYou do that for like video conferences\na lot of times, what we're doing here.\n\n171\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.650\nThis is a one, Wes and\nI are the one, to many.\n\n172\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.370\nI have many viewers out\nthere watching this.\n\n173\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.570\nSo I got one stream going out, but\n\n174\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.720\nit's actually being delivered\nto many destinations.\n\n175\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.764\nKind of in a way, that would\nrepresent a multicast, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:14.764 --> 00:09:15.552\nNow technically,\n\n177\n00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:19.130\nI understand that that's not really\nthe way it's working in the background.\n\n178\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.480\nBut the concept is the same, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.990\nYou give it a name.\n\n180\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:30.940\nI can just call this MultiTest, all right.\n\n181\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:36.188\nAnd remember, your multicast range, 224\nthrough 239, anything, anything, anything.\n\n182\n00:09:36.188 --> 00:09:40.974\nSo say 224.1.1.1 through\n\n183\n00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:47.998\n224.1.1.254, and we'll click Next.\n\n184\n00:09:47.998 --> 00:09:49.700\nNo exclusions.\n\n185\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.010\nWe'll give it a 30-day lease, Next,\nand I'm not gonna activate it.\n\n186\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.370\nI don't want it getting in our way\nwhile we're doing the rest of our labs.\n\n187\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.330\nAnd Finish.\n\n188\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.902\nAnd now, when those clients get their IP\naddress, they can also pick up a multicast\n\n189\n00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:05.908\naddress they can use to join in on\nmulticast conversations, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:12.260\nSo to understand for the exam, DHCP\nsupports superscopes and multicast scopes.\n\n191\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.260\n&gt;&gt; Now you showed us, when you first\nstarted installing the DHCP role, that\n\n192\n00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.180\nwe did have some additional parameters\nthat we can hand out to our clients.\n\n193\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.210\nLike one you showed us was the router.\n\n194\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.070\nAnd I believe the other\none was the DNS server.\n\n195\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.940\nNow is that the only thing that we're\nlimited to, or do we got some choices?\n\n196\n00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.038\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple of choices,\n1 or 2, or 25, or 50.\n\n197\n00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:34.596\nI mean, then there's quite a few options.\n\n198\n00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:36.149\nLet's talk about those options.\n\n199\n00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:40.840\nLet's see,\nwhat's a good way to start with this?\n\n200\n00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.730\nThere are two different places that\ncan configure the options, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.800\nThat's gonna be the first place.\n\n202\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.050\nThat's where I wanna start.\n\n203\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.780\nYou'll see right here\nI have Server Options.\n\n204\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.370\nBut if I expand out my Scope,\nI also have scope-level options.\n\n205\n00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.870\nSo the first thing you have to think\nabout when you're configuring options is\n\n206\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.290\nwho do I want this option to go to,\nall right?\n\n207\n00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.160\nLet's say I'm configuring a default\ngateway option, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.160\nIs this for every single machine\nthat connects to the server?\n\n209\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.030\nOr is this only for\nthis particular scope, all right?\n\n210\n00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.840\nWhen we configure it, because a DHCP\nserver can host more than one scope.\n\n211\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.250\nAs you see I've already\ngot four scopes on here.\n\n212\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.150\nI might have another subnet,\n10.1.0.0, that I need to support.\n\n213\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.240\nSo I can add multiple scopes.\n\n214\n00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.270\nAnd when I configure an option,\nis this option for all the machines that\n\n215\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.420\nare getting an IP address from this server\nno matter what scope they're a part of?\n\n216\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.630\nOr is the option only for\n\n217\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.850\nthe machines that are getting an IP\naddress from that particular scope?\n\n218\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.280\nAnd it really depends\non what the option is.\n\n219\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.155\nThe example I always use is DNS and\ndefault gateways.\n\n220\n00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:48.667\nDNS servers,\nas we've seen in previous episodes,\n\n221\n00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.070\ncan handle a tremendous amount of work.\n\n222\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.570\nAnd if I've got my network divided\ninto five different subnets,\n\n223\n00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.560\nI don't need a DNS server\non every single subnet.\n\n224\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.830\nTwo DNS servers on my domain controllers,\nand that's plenty for most networks.\n\n225\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.520\nSo that means,\nno matter what subnet you're coming from,\n\n226\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.820\nyou're gonna get the same IP address for\nDNS.\n\n227\n00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.980\nSo I might be in subnet A,\nWes is in subnet B,\n\n228\n00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.530\nwe're both gonna be using\nthe same DNS server.\n\n229\n00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.763\nSo when I pass out the DNS server option,\nwhen I create that option,\n\n230\n00:12:18.763 --> 00:12:20.880\nI'm gonna do it as a server-level option.\n\n231\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.880\nCuz I can do it once, and it's good for\nall the scopes on that server.\n\n232\n00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.920\nDefault gateways, on the other hand,\nare specific to your subnet.\n\n233\n00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.250\nThe default gateway on my\nsubnet has to be on my subnet.\n\n234\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.430\nSo if I'm on the 192.168.1.0 network,\n\n235\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.850\nthen my default gateway has\nto be 192.168.1.something.\n\n236\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.690\nIf Wes is on the 192.168.2.0 network,\n\n237\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.630\nthen his default gateway has\nto be 192.168.2.something.\n\n238\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.790\nSo in other words,\nwe're not using the same default gateways.\n\n239\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.310\nSo I don't want to set that\nas a server-level option.\n\n240\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.380\nBecause depending on what scope\nyou're getting your address from\n\n241\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.780\nis going to change what default\ngateway address I wanna give you.\n\n242\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.550\nSo that would be a better use\nof the scope-level options.\n\n243\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.140\nMake sense?\n\n244\n00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.780\nAll right, so let's take a look at\nthe options that we can configure.\n\n245\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.980\nI'll do it at the scope level just for\nconvenience here.\n\n246\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.720\nI'm going to right-click and\nchoose Configure Options.\n\n247\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.240\nAnd then this is the list\nof available options.\n\n248\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.435\nAnd I know I went through that really\nquick, but it doesn't really matter.\n\n249\n00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.506\nThere's a lot of them, all right?\n\n250\n00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:28.001\nThe most common ones that we use\nare gonna be your default gateway.\n\n251\n00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:30.521\nWhich is option number 003 Router.\n\n252\n00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:34.195\nYour Name Servers, all right, oops.\n\n253\n00:13:34.195 --> 00:13:36.224\nZoom in, the scroll goes a little quick.\n\n254\n00:13:36.224 --> 00:13:40.633\nName Servers, DNS Servers,\nwhat's another one we might use?\n\n255\n00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:41.338\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if I can try one, here.\n\n256\n00:13:41.338 --> 00:13:43.761\nI don't remember, though,\nbut how about 015?\n\n257\n00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:47.090\n&gt;&gt; 015 DNS Domain Name, very good.\n\n258\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.280\nDefinitely one we wanna configure.\n\n259\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.690\nI'm trying to think if there's any more.\n\n260\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.560\nNot really, that I can think\nof off the top of my head.\n\n261\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.090\nUsed to set some Wins options and\nthings like that.\n\n262\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.140\nBut as you can see, there's a lot.\n\n263\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.390\nSo DHCP is capable of passing out\na lot more than just an IP address.\n\n264\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.494\nDefault gateways, subnet masks,\nDNS servers, Win servers,\n\n265\n00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:13.150\nNetBIOS node types,\nI mean all kinds of good stuff.\n\n266\n00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Mike, it's really starting to make\nsense why they call this not only dynamic.\n\n267\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.110\nBut they call it a host\nconfiguration protocol,\n\n268\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.350\nif you really break down that acronym.\n\n269\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.420\nLooking at all these options, you aren't\nkidding when you say host configuration.\n\n270\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.550\nYou got plenty that you\ncan configure on the host.\n\n271\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.498\n&gt;&gt; And there's even more.\n\n272\n00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:29.088\nWe're on the general tab now.\n\n273\n00:14:29.088 --> 00:14:34.134\nIf I flip over to this advanced tab, I'll\nsee that there's even more that we can do.\n\n274\n00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:41.142\nAll right, we got vendor class options,\nwhich are based on a particular vendor.\n\n275\n00:14:41.142 --> 00:14:42.740\nThere's class-level options.\n\n276\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.742\nThere's user class and vendor class.\n\n277\n00:14:44.742 --> 00:14:47.160\nThere's all kinds of things\nthat we can do with DHB.\n\n278\n00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.990\nFor this exam,\nthe most important thing to understand is\n\n279\n00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.170\nthe difference between server-level\noptions and scope-level options.\n\n280\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.068\nAnd those big three that we almost\nalways said, Router, DNS Server, and\n\n281\n00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:01.052\nDNS Domain Name, all right?\n\n282\n00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:04.020\nCuz those are what my clients\nneed to function properly.\n\n283\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.115\nThe other stuff is beneficial\nif I'm using it on my network.\n\n284\n00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.760\nThese, you have to have a default gateway\nif you wanna get off your subnet.\n\n285\n00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.052\nYou have to have a DNS server\naddress if you wanna log in.\n\n286\n00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:18.740\nYou have to have a DNS domain name that\nyou can use in your search suffix.\n\n287\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.810\nSo these are the three that you're\nalmost always going to set.\n\n288\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.330\nAll right,\nnext thing we wanna talk about here, Wes,\n\n289\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.720\nis something known as reservations.\n\n290\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.440\nAnd reservations are a way that I can\n\n291\n00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.750\nmake sure that a node gets\nthe same IP address every time.\n\n292\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.278\nAnd you might think to yourself,\nwell, Mike,\n\n293\n00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:47.286\nwhy don't I just statically map that guy,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:51.148\nYou told us in the previous episode\nthat I can either statically map it, or\n\n295\n00:15:51.148 --> 00:15:53.097\nI could do it dynamically with DHCP.\n\n296\n00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:57.930\nAnd with DHCP, It might change week to\nweek, or however long my leases are for,\n\n297\n00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.760\neight days to eight days.\n\n298\n00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.240\nThose addresses might change,\n\n299\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.700\nand you said you didn't care on most\nof your machines if it changed or not.\n\n300\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.210\nNow you're telling me\nyou wanna Use DHCP but\n\n301\n00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.325\nmake sure it get the same\nIP address every time.\n\n302\n00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:12.345\nWhat's up with that?\n\n303\n00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:15.755\n&gt;&gt; This sounds like dynamically\nmanaging static addresses, and\n\n304\n00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:16.635\nboy that's confusing.\n\n305\n00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:18.065\nYou can help us out here with that one.\n\n306\n00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd the reason I would do this Is because\n\n307\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.080\nyes, I want the IP address\nto be the same every time.\n\n308\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.385\nBut the other stuff might change and\nI'm okay with that changing dynamically,\n\n309\n00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:31.525\nI don't want to have to go do it.\n\n310\n00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:36.990\nWe've talked about you setting up\nour servers with static addresses.\n\n311\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.270\nAnother way that I can do that would be to\ncreate a reservation to that server and\n\n312\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.800\nsay look ,every time this\nparticular server calls up DHCP\n\n313\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800\ngiving the same address.\n\n314\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.960\nBut that way he'll always\nhave the same address, but\n\n315\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.830\nwhat if the default gateway changes?\n\n316\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.890\nI fix it in DHCP and\n\n317\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.480\neven though they got a reservation\nthey're getting the same IP address back.\n\n318\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.150\nThey'll get the new and\nupdated default gateway.\n\n319\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.710\nSo you think about all those\noptions that we've got.\n\n320\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:08.410\nThe rest of it's still dynamic, it's just\nthe IP address that'll remain the same.\n\n321\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.520\nCuz if I didn't do it that way, let's say\nI have 15 servers that were statically\n\n322\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.390\nmapped, or\nthousands in a large environment.\n\n323\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.780\nAnd everybody was statically mapped and\nwe updated the default gateway address.\n\n324\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:25.830\nWell now I've gotta go to every single\none of those servers one at a time and\n\n325\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.020\nopen up those TCP/IP properties, or\n\n326\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.210\nwrite some kind of script to\nupdate that default gateway.\n\n327\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.965\nIf they were DHCP clients, with a\nreservation, I could update DHCP once and\n\n328\n00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:39.312\nthey'd all get the new\ndefault gateway eventually,\n\n329\n00:17:39.312 --> 00:17:41.562\nas soon as they got their new lease.\n\n330\n00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:45.400\nSo that's the reason we\ncan still use a DHCP or\n\n331\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.030\nwhy we have the reservation\noption within DHCP.\n\n332\n00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:57.350\nAnd again, honestly,\nI will say that servers or static.\n\n333\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:02.750\nServers typically are statically mapped\nanyway, but like kiosks are one.\n\n334\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.980\nI've got a kiosk out in the lobby and\n\n335\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.460\nI need to be able to remote\ninto it now and again.\n\n336\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.340\nAnd I wanna know what\nits IP address is and\n\n337\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.310\nI don't want that IP address to change.\n\n338\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.400\nBut I don't wanna have to go\nmanually configure that every time\n\n339\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.790\nthere is a change in the other\noptions on my network.\n\n340\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.210\nSo I'll probably use a reservation for\nthat kiosk.\n\n341\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.550\nThose machines in the conference room,\n\n342\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.310\nI want those guys to always\nget the same IP address.\n\n343\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.830\nSo if I need to, even if DNS is down,\nI can remote into them by name, and\n\n344\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.270\nfix things, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.530\n&gt;&gt; And those IP addresses, because I'm so\n\n346\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.110\nbad at documentation I\ncan't document anything.\n\n347\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.810\nI couldn't even find my way\nout of a wet paper bag.\n\n348\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.840\nI mean if you look at\nthe database in the DHCP console.\n\n349\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.180\nIt's almost like that would be\nupdated documentation because you've\n\n350\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.750\ngot reservations.\n\n351\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.400\nIt's statically mapped to you,\nyou can read it.\n\n352\n00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.270\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, right?\n\n353\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.210\nIt's documented right there.\n\n354\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.280\nThat's one less thing\nI've gotta write down.\n\n355\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.240\nAll right, so how do you do a reservation?\n\n356\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.840\nWell, if we're gonna do a reservation,\nand remember about the process.\n\n357\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.470\nI said that a node is gonna boot up and\nit's gonna call up DHCP and\n\n358\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.760\nat this point it doesn't\nhave an IP address.\n\n359\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.330\nSo it can't do Unicast traffic.\n\n360\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.980\nSo it's gonna holler out and\nsay, hello I need an IP address.\n\n361\n00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.260\nDHCP then is gonna respond and\n\n362\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.150\nwe want it to respond with\nthe reservation that we set for it.\n\n363\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.950\nSo how can I uniquely identify that node?\n\n364\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.780\nIt doesn't have an IP address yet.\n\n365\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.920\nIts name could change.\n\n366\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.010\nI need to make sure that it\nalways gets the same IP address.\n\n367\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.090\nWes, is there a number on\nthat machine that I can,\n\n368\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.090\nis there something I can use to\nuniquely identify that machine?\n\n369\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.420\n&gt;&gt; The Mac address, I would say.\n\n370\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.140\n&gt;&gt; The Mac address it is, right?\n\n371\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.740\nWe know that that's\ntechnically not gonna change.\n\n372\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.180\nIt's really identifying the network\nadapter, not the machine.\n\n373\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.790\nBut it's not too often that the network\nadapter jumps from one machine\n\n374\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.650\nto the other.\n\n375\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.080\nSo it does in a way,\n\n376\n00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.920\nit serves it's purpose in this\ncase to identify the machine.\n\n377\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.740\nSo yes,\nthe MAC address is what we're gonna do or\n\n378\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.010\nuse to create these reservations,\nso that's what I need.\n\n379\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.060\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\na look at this lease, because I know if I\n\n380\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:03.000\npull up this lease,\nI should be able to find his MAC address.\n\n381\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.050\nI don't think that's it, looks like\nan odd MAC address, but maybe it is.\n\n382\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.690\nOne, two, three, four, five, six,\nthat must be his MAC address.\n\n383\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.560\nWe could always remote into it I guess and\ndouble check that, right?\n\n384\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.680\nLet's go back over to\nclient one who is no longer\n\n385\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.910\non this screen because we changed his\nIP address, so here's client one.\n\n386\n00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.190\nWes, how can I find his MAC address?\n\n387\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.370\n&gt;&gt; Well I would say ipconfig /all, and\n\n388\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.510\nyou can always use the old,\nkind of forgotten getmac.\n\n389\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:42.170\n&gt;&gt; Getmac, ooh, I like that one, let's try\nthat, getmac Boo yeah, there's a new one.\n\n390\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.450\nYou taught me something,\nI didn't even know that existed.\n\n391\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.792\nAll right, so that is the MAC address,\n\n392\n00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:51.730\n0.0.155 DOA something something\nsomething something something.\n\n393\n00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.090\nAnd let's, oops, where did I go,\nback to my DHCP server.\n\n394\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.620\nServe01.\n\n395\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.630\nAnd it is that number right there.\n\n396\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.960\nSo that is the MAC address.\n\n397\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.550\nSee if I can cut and paste from here.\n\n398\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.070\nDoo doot doot doo.\n\n399\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.740\nI can say add a reservation for\nright there.\n\n400\n00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.680\nThat's a cool new option, but\n\n401\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.930\nthat's not what we want to do,\nI want you guys to see this process.\n\n402\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.620\nSo I want to make a new reservation.\n\n403\n00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.700\nSo I do need his MAC address,\nso let's go ahead,\n\n404\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.270\nI'm gonna right click on reservations,\nso it won't let me do that.\n\n405\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.540\nWes can you write that one down for me?\n\n406\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.061\n&gt;&gt; I will do.\n\n407\n00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:31.605\n&gt;&gt; 00155D0AD206.\n\n408\n00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:33.033\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Muchos gracias.\n\n409\n00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:33.927\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir.\n\n410\n00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:37.539\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to reservations and\nwe're simply going to right click and\n\n411\n00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:41.853\nchoose new reservation All right, and I'll\ngive the reservation name and typically,\n\n412\n00:21:41.853 --> 00:21:45.130\nit's the machine you're\ncreating the reservation for.\n\n413\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.170\nI guess you could technically\ncall it anything you want,\n\n414\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.680\nbut that makes sense to me, and\nthe IP address that I wanna give it.\n\n415\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.180\nWhat IP address am I reserving for\nthis guy?\n\n416\n00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.450\nLet's do something different, but it does\nhave to be from within the scope and\n\n417\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.336\nnot one of my excluded addresses.\n\n418\n00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:03.864\nSo let's do 10.0.100.47.\n\n419\n00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.640\nThat'll be an odd one we'll know\nthat the reservation worked and\n\n420\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.858\nthen the MAC address, Wes?\n\n421\n00:22:07.858 --> 00:22:11.950\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be 00155D0AD206.\n\n422\n00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.760\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n423\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.320\nAnd I'll skip the description and I'll\ngo ahead and click Add and then Close.\n\n424\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.880\nNow if I go to look at reservations,\nthere's my reservation.\n\n425\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.020\nNotice it's picking up all the scope level\noptions because it is still part of this\n\n426\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.440\nscope, right.\n\n427\n00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.260\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n428\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.729\nWe're going to switch\nback over to the client.\n\n429\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.340\nSo back to vmhost where I've\ngot my remote desktop for\n\n430\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.260\nthat client, I should say my\nvirtual machine connection,\n\n431\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.280\nthat way I do not have to worry\nabout IP addresses changing.\n\n432\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.690\nI am on the vmhost right now\n\n433\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.740\nconnected to this guy Which makes\nit a little more convenient.\n\n434\n00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.230\nSo Wes how do I give up?\n\n435\n00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.930\nI've got a lease currently\nI want to throw it away?\n\n436\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.830\n&gt;&gt; Man I tell you,\nyou're rally challenging me today.\n\n437\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want to say this one is forward\n\n438\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.800\nip config since you're\ngonna give me half of it.\n\n439\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.290\nSpace forward slash release.\n\n440\n00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Release all right, oops and\nyou do have to spell it right don't you?\n\n441\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.965\n&gt;&gt; You've been looking at my type.\n\n442\n00:23:13.965 --> 00:23:18.368\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There,\nthat looks more like release.\n\n443\n00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:19.281\nAll right.\n\n444\n00:23:19.281 --> 00:23:21.380\n[LAUGH] I just felt the first one.\n\n445\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.414\nLet me just start all over,\nipconfig/release.\n\n446\n00:23:25.414 --> 00:23:27.310\nAll right.\n\n447\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.960\nAnd then of course I forgot to\nrun an administrative prompt.\n\n448\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.920\nSo let's do that.\n\n449\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.850\nLet's right click,\nrun as an administrator.\n\n450\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:42.038\nYes to the UAC,\nthird time is always the charm\n\n451\n00:23:42.038 --> 00:23:47.505\nIP config switch release and there we go.\n\n452\n00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:50.904\nNotice I've got no IP\naddresses down here for\n\n453\n00:23:50.904 --> 00:23:53.863\nethernet adapter and then I can do the.\n\n454\n00:23:55.223 --> 00:23:58.560\nI forget the word I'm looking for, but-\n&gt;&gt; Give it back.\n\n455\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.672\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanna get the IP address back.\n\n456\n00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:00.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Renew.\n\n457\n00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:03.090\n&gt;&gt; The command that goes along with it,\nnot the symbiotic partner.\n\n458\n00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.970\nI was trying to get the term I wanted to\nuse there, but my brain has failed me.\n\n459\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.250\nIpconfig renew says hey,\ngo get a new lease.\n\n460\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.990\nRelease says,\nthrow away your current lease.\n\n461\n00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.738\nRenew says, go get a new lease.\n\n462\n00:24:14.738 --> 00:24:15.530\nSo we'll try it out.\n\n463\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.540\nEthernet two is unplugged,\nthat's why it says that for that guy.\n\n464\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.720\nWe'll wait for it.\n\n465\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.730\n&gt;&gt; And while we're waiting,\nI've also seen, it's kinda interesting.\n\n466\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.038\nCuz Bluetooth doesn't do that,\nit doesn't do the whole DORA process.\n\n467\n00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:31.200\nBut if you've got Bluetooth\nnetwork adaptors it says,\n\n468\n00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.170\nthis can't be performed\non the Bluetooth adapter.\n\n469\n00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:34.990\nWell, thank you anyway.\n\n470\n00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.147\n&gt;&gt; Cuz they're too good for it.\n\n471\n00:24:36.147 --> 00:24:37.964\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there we go,\n\n472\n00:24:37.964 --> 00:24:41.670\nI got my IP address back and\nlook what IP address I got.\n\n473\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.290\nAnd if I release and renew it 100 times,\nI would always get that same IP address.\n\n474\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.920\nThe other information might change.\n\n475\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.910\nI might go into my options and\nchange the DNS suffix, or\n\n476\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.200\nthe default gateway, or I might decide\nto start passing out a WINS address.\n\n477\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.770\nI don't have to do\nanything to this client.\n\n478\n00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:02.436\nThe next time it renews its lease,\nit'll pick up that new information\n\n479\n00:25:02.436 --> 00:25:07.119\nautomatically, yet still get the same\nIP address every single time.\n\n480\n00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:11.120\nSo reservations are great,\na little manual on the set-up, but\n\n481\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.920\nonce you get that set up,\nyou don't have to do anything else, right?\n\n482\n00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.061\nSo we just create that reservation for\nthat client.\n\n483\n00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:22.150\nAnd of course I can create as\nmany reservations as I want.\n\n484\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.321\nAll right, last thing I wanna talk\nabout in this particular episode.\n\n485\n00:25:25.321 --> 00:25:26.559\nWe talked about the options.\n\n486\n00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:30.723\nThere are scope-level options,\nthere are server-level options, and\n\n487\n00:25:30.723 --> 00:25:32.600\nwe can change them at anytime.\n\n488\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.800\nI mean, I can go back into the options and\nI could pull up this particular one and\n\n489\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.190\nremove that, or I could add another one.\n\n490\n00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.270\nLet me add that back.\n\n491\n00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.765\nAnd I can say,\nI also wanna pass out 10.0.100.201.\n\n492\n00:25:47.765 --> 00:25:51.151\nThat's another one of my DNS servers,\ncuz we wanna pass out more than one.\n\n493\n00:25:51.151 --> 00:25:55.450\nThat way if one's not responding,\nthe other one can help the client out.\n\n494\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.770\nSo I can go back and\nmodify these options at any time.\n\n495\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.830\nAnd it's gonna try to validate that\nthere's not really a DNS server there.\n\n496\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.810\nIt's trying to validate it.\n\n497\n00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.560\nI'm gonna say yes, add it anyway.\n\n498\n00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.100\nTrying to protect me from myself.\n\n499\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.102\nThank you Windows, but\nthis is just a demonstration.\n\n500\n00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:11.683\nGo ahead.\n\n501\n00:26:11.683 --> 00:26:12.926\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask,\n\n502\n00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.190\ndo you have to restart the DHCP service?\n\n503\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.640\nOr is it smart enough to know that hey,\nI'll do this in the background for\n\n504\n00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.000\nyou when you add that additional option?\n\n505\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.980\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it'll just take care of it.\n\n506\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.297\nYou don't have to restart anything.\n\n507\n00:26:24.758 --> 00:26:26.429\nAnd what else was I gonna say?\n\n508\n00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:28.022\nAnd then the subnet itself, right?\n\n509\n00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:29.293\nI can go over here to the subnet.\n\n510\n00:26:29.293 --> 00:26:35.642\nWhat if I wanted to change my pool or\nmy exclusions?\n\n511\n00:26:35.642 --> 00:26:39.767\nI just realized that Wes statically mapped\na printer that was in the middle of\n\n512\n00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:40.289\nmy pool.\n\n513\n00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:45.380\n10.0.100.14 is actually one\nof our network printers.\n\n514\n00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.076\nWell, I can simply come back\nover here to this scope, and\n\n515\n00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:51.698\nI can go to the properties of this scope.\n\n516\n00:26:51.698 --> 00:26:55.194\nAnd I'm sorry,\nnot the properties of the scope, silly me.\n\n517\n00:26:55.194 --> 00:26:59.127\nI can go to my exclusions over here,\nAddress Pool, and\n\n518\n00:26:59.127 --> 00:27:01.640\nNew Exclusion Range, right?\n\n519\n00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.690\nAnd I could add that address in there.\n\n520\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.090\nBut there is one thing, and\nthis is really the point of all this.\n\n521\n00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:15.140\nYou can change everything about the scope,\nexcept for one very important thing.\n\n522\n00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.320\nI'm gonna right-click on this scope again,\nand I'm gonna choose Properties.\n\n523\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.090\nAnd there was a change\nthe name of the scope.\n\n524\n00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.180\nI could change the start and\nend IP address.\n\n525\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.390\nI can change the lease duration.\n\n526\n00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.050\nI can change how DNS is\nplaying along with DHCP,\n\n527\n00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.080\nwhich we're gonna talk\nabout in another episode.\n\n528\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.090\nI've got some advanced\noptions that I can change.\n\n529\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.050\nThere's one thing on this tab though,\nWes, that I cannot change.\n\n530\n00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.670\nCan you spot it?\n\n531\n00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.160\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you're gonna be set\nwith the same subnet mask length.\n\n532\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.530\n&gt;&gt; Notice how that is greyed out?\n\n533\n00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.051\nYou cannot change it.\n\n534\n00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:51.150\nAnd this would make a very\ngood test question.\n\n535\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.150\nYou have created,\nyour co-workers created a scope,\n\n536\n00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.720\nbut they ended up using\nthe wrong subnet mask.\n\n537\n00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.020\nYou need to change it.\n\n538\n00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.350\nHow do you go about updating\nthe subnet mask on an existing scope?\n\n539\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.940\nWhat's the answer, Wes?\n\n540\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.490\n&gt;&gt; My guess is you're gonna have\nto delete it and recreate it.\n\n541\n00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.200\n&gt;&gt; And you would be correct,\ngold star for you today.\n\n542\n00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.420\nThat's the only way to fix that.\n\n543\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.230\nThe only thing you can't change, or\n\n544\n00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.660\nthe biggest thing you can't change,\nis the subnet mask.\n\n545\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.240\nThe only way to change it?\n\n546\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.790\nThere's no magic PowerShell command,\nnothing.\n\n547\n00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:22.145\nYou delete the scope, and you recreate\nthe scope with the correct subnet mask,\n\n548\n00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:23.090\nall right?\n\n549\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.780\nSo just a little gotcha,\nthat in the real world, can throw you off,\n\n550\n00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.930\nhow come I can't change this?\n\n551\n00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.080\nWhat's going on?\n\n552\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.800\nOn the exam it'd be a really easy one to\nmiss, or if you didn't know what it was,\n\n553\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.800\nyou're like,\nI don't understand the question.\n\n554\n00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.218\nSo do understand, and of course\nthey won't ask you that question.\n\n555\n00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:41.010\nI can't talk about\nthe actual questions anyway.\n\n556\n00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.979\nAnd if I said one of the questions,\nyou would never get that one.\n\n557\n00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:48.306\nThat's just the way Murphy's law works,\nright?\n\n558\n00:28:48.306 --> 00:28:51.640\nBut yeah, just keep in mind,\nyou can't change that subnet mask anyway.\n\n559\n00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.462\nWay back in the day when I first\nstarted studying, it drove me crazy.\n\n560\n00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:56.820\nI was like wait, what's wrong,\nwhy is this grayed out?\n\n561\n00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.397\nI typed in the wrong address or\nthe wrong subnet mask, and\n\n562\n00:28:59.397 --> 00:29:00.802\nit wouldn't let me change it.\n\n563\n00:29:00.802 --> 00:29:01.963\nYou can't, so, [LAUGH].\n\n564\n00:29:01.963 --> 00:29:04.629\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a lot of\ngreat information on DHCP.\n\n565\n00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:08.150\nAnd this again, is such a complex topic\nand a lot of great information, Mike.\n\n566\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.290\nNow I know we're coming to\nthe end of another episode.\n\n567\n00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.310\nDo you got any, in this one, any advice\nyou would like to maybe give about DNS\n\n568\n00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.470\noptions or the reservations that you\nmight want somebody to keep in mind?\n\n569\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.447\n&gt;&gt; Just think about the scope and\nthe server-level options,\n\n570\n00:29:22.447 --> 00:29:23.822\ndo pay attention to those.\n\n571\n00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:27.109\nAgain, server-level options are passed out\nto everybody that talks to that server,\n\n572\n00:29:27.109 --> 00:29:29.350\nno matter what scope you're coming from.\n\n573\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.507\nOne more thing that I didn't mention.\n\n574\n00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:33.740\nThank you for letting me do this, cuz it\nprompted me to think of something else.\n\n575\n00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.590\nWhat if there's a server-level option and\n\n576\n00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.570\na scope-level option that\nare configuring the same thing, right?\n\n577\n00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.181\nBecause I can set a server-level option,\nfor say,\n\n578\n00:29:41.181 --> 00:29:43.448\nthe DNS server address\nthat I wanna pass out.\n\n579\n00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:47.450\nBut I can also go to the scope and I could\nset a scope-level option that passes out\n\n580\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.970\na DNS server address, and\nit might be a different DNS server.\n\n581\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.640\nWhat happens then, right?\n\n582\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.150\nIt actually applies them from\nleast specific to most specific.\n\n583\n00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.390\nSo your server-level\noption gets applied first.\n\n584\n00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.330\nBut then your scope-level option\ncan override any server-level\n\n585\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.940\noptions that it conflicts with.\n\n586\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.630\nSo you might have 20 scopes,\nand you wanna set all 20,\n\n587\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.080\nall 19 of them, to the same DNS server.\n\n588\n00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.322\nOne of them needs a different DNS server,\nthe one that the executives use.\n\n589\n00:30:16.322 --> 00:30:19.778\nAnd you wanna make sure they get good\nperformance, cuz they sign your paychecks.\n\n590\n00:30:19.778 --> 00:30:22.730\nSo what you'd do is you'd set\na server-level option for\n\n591\n00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.770\nthe common DNS server\nthat us common folk use.\n\n592\n00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.590\nAnd that would actually\napply to all 20 scopes.\n\n593\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.630\nBut then you'd go to that one scope and\n\n594\n00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:35.140\nset the DNS server option there at\nthe scope-level for the executive scope.\n\n595\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.639\nThat would override the sever-level\noption, but just for that one scope.\n\n596\n00:30:38.639 --> 00:30:40.596\nThey'd have their own\nprivate DNS server and\n\n597\n00:30:40.596 --> 00:30:43.082\nwouldn't have to deal with\ntraffic from us common folk.\n\n598\n00:30:43.082 --> 00:30:47.850\nSo understand that scope-level options\nwill override server-level options.\n\n599\n00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.443\nIf we were to talk about,\nthey don't call it out anymore, but\n\n600\n00:30:50.443 --> 00:30:54.660\nvendor class and user class options\nare actually more specific than scope.\n\n601\n00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.730\nSo those would override\nscope-level options.\n\n602\n00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.040\nYou can also do reservation-level options.\n\n603\n00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.280\nYou can do an option at\nthe reservation level.\n\n604\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.650\nIt's not used very often, that's why they\ndon't talk about it much anymore I guess,\n\n605\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.180\nbecause it's really an option for one.\n\n606\n00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.000\nIt's not very efficient, all right?\n\n607\n00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.757\nIt's not too often that I have\nan option for just one machine.\n\n608\n00:31:13.757 --> 00:31:16.687\nBut understand you can set\nan option at the reservation level,\n\n609\n00:31:16.687 --> 00:31:18.021\nwhich is the most specific.\n\n610\n00:31:18.021 --> 00:31:22.750\nSo that would override user and\nvendor class options, scope options and\n\n611\n00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.730\nserver options.\n\n612\n00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.100\nAnd that's what I'll leave you with.\n\n613\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's\na great place to sign off here.\n\n614\n00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.260\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n615\n00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:04.334\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:08.508\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.822\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:14.238\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:15.710\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.544\nAnd in today's episode we're continuing\nalong our networking with Windows Server\n\n9\n00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:20.086\n2016.\n\n10\n00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.814\nAnd we've spending a couple of episodes,\na few episodes now in DHCP.\n\n11\n00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:26.199\nCuz this is a very important service and\n\n12\n00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.680\nit's very important that you\nunderstand it on the exam.\n\n13\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.550\nSo joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n14\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.130\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n15\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.763\n&gt;&gt; Doing fantastic.\n\n16\n00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:34.457\nThanks for having me back.\n\n17\n00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:40.402\nAnd yeah, continuing on with good old\nDHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n18\n00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:44.986\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna focus in on of the new\n\n19\n00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:50.327\ncapabilities of the DHCP, and\nthat's gonna be policies.\n\n20\n00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:55.829\nWe've seen already how to get it\ninstalled, how to configure these options.\n\n21\n00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.427\nAnd while DHCP itself is\nvery dynamic in other words,\n\n22\n00:00:58.427 --> 00:01:01.903\nit can pass this information from\nthe client's perspective, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.903 --> 00:01:02.519\nIt's dynamic.\n\n24\n00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.072\nBecause I don't have to\nstatically map the client.\n\n25\n00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:08.888\nThey get an IP address automatically,\nthat can change.\n\n26\n00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:13.690\nBut the options that we've configured\nare relatively static, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.871\nI say relatively,\nthey pretty much are static.\n\n28\n00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:20.638\nThey apply to either everybody on\nthe server or everybody in that scope.\n\n29\n00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:24.340\nWe do have the ability to do it at\nthe reservation level for individual node.\n\n30\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.542\nBut what if I wanna set some\noptions with some different ways\n\n31\n00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.720\nof defining who gets those options?\n\n32\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.463\nLike mobile devices versus\nlaptops versus desktops, or\n\n33\n00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:40.724\nwhether they're running\nXP versus Windows 10.\n\n34\n00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:43.792\nHopefully, they're not still running XP,\nthose kind of things.\n\n35\n00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:50.154\nI was trying to think of something\nelse really, the limit is up to you.\n\n36\n00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:53.208\nI'll show you the things that we can\npick from when we go to identify.\n\n37\n00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.430\nName, we could do it by name, for example.\n\n38\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.182\nMaybe all the computer's in the lab\nthat I've set up for my employees.\n\n39\n00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:03.792\nAll their computer names start with\nLab Client 01 or Lab Client 02.\n\n40\n00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:08.557\nAnd so I could actually say here's\nan option that only applies if your\n\n41\n00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:10.702\nname starts with Lab, right?\n\n42\n00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:13.390\nSo some really cool things we\ncan do with these options.\n\n43\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.350\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\nwe'll figure out how we can set these up.\n\n44\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.290\nAll right, so on my screen here.\n\n45\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.909\nWe can see I've got the DHCP\nserver console opened up,\n\n46\n00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.202\nand I've expanded out our scope.\n\n47\n00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:28.022\nAnd the policies are going to\nbe similar to options, and\n\n48\n00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.990\nthe fact that we can do\nthem at the server level.\n\n49\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.290\nWe can also do them on the scope level.\n\n50\n00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.020\nI don't have any policies by default,\nso we're gonna create some.\n\n51\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.390\nSo all you do to create a policy\nis right-click on Policies and\n\n52\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.840\nchoose New Policy, right?\n\n53\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.448\nAnd again, I'm gonna be doing\na Scope level policy here.\n\n54\n00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:50.848\nAnd let's do this,\nwhat are wanna trying to do is set up, so\n\n55\n00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.902\nthat we're gonna take our\nscope in kind of divided up.\n\n56\n00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:58.824\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nwell I'll show you guys when we go.\n\n57\n00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:01.090\nWe'll figure this out together.\n\n58\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.342\nSo Policy Based IP Address and\nOption Assignment.\n\n59\n00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:12.665\nFor my Policy Name, I'm gonna call this\nI don't know, we'll call it Lowerhalf.\n\n60\n00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:18.730\nI know that sounds weird, but it will make\nsense in a minute, then I'll click Next.\n\n61\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.140\nAnd then configure the conditions for\nthe policy.\n\n62\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.935\nAnd you see there's no conditions listed,\nso I'm going to click Add.\n\n63\n00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:31.427\nAnd my choices up here for Criteria\nare Vendor Class, User Class, MAC Address,\n\n64\n00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:35.275\nClient Identifier, Fully Qualified\nDomain Name, or Relay Agent.\n\n65\n00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:38.228\nSo how do I wanna identify the node or\n\n66\n00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:42.767\nnodes that I want to apply\nthis particular setting to?\n\n67\n00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:49.220\nAnd I'm gonna use MAC Address for\nthis one, I can do Equals or Not Equals.\n\n68\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.774\nAnd then I'm gonna put\nthe Value down here.\n\n69\n00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:52.676\nBut before I do that,\n\n70\n00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.496\nbefore I do the actual one we're\ngonna use in this demonstration.\n\n71\n00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:58.009\nI'm gonna just goof around\nwith some of the other ones,\n\n72\n00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.586\ncuz I wanna show you some cool\nthings that you can do here.\n\n73\n00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:05.615\nFor example, you could do something\nlike Fully Qualified Domain Name,\n\n74\n00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:08.428\nEquals or Not Equals, Is Single Label.\n\n75\n00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:10.170\nMaybe it's a work group and\nnot a domain member.\n\n76\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.820\nHow about that?\n\n77\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.970\nHow cool is that?\n\n78\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.439\nThe ability to pass out an option based\non whether it's part of the domain or\n\n79\n00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.910\nnot just by looking at.\n\n80\n00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.200\nWhether it's name is client01 or\nclient01.lab.itpro.tv,\n\n81\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.216\neasy breezy, or is not a single label.\n\n82\n00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:31.040\nWe'll say Equals, and then I'll do for\nthe Value, I'll say Lab.\n\n83\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.909\nRemember earlier, I was saying that I've\ngot certain machines in my network that\n\n84\n00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.892\nare lab machines and\nthey all have lab in their name somewhere.\n\n85\n00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:41.353\nSo I can put Lab here, but this would\nonly match, if I did it like that,\n\n86\n00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:43.900\nit would only match if their\nname was actually Lab.\n\n87\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.566\nBut we can use wild cards, those have\ngot Prefix and Append wildcards.\n\n88\n00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:52.957\nSo I'm gonna say Prefix wildcard,\nbut I wanna do both,\n\n89\n00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.570\nit could be anything Lab anything.\n\n90\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.856\nSo I'm gonna also choose Append.\n\n91\n00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:02.132\nPrefix, Append,\nwell it's one or the other.\n\n92\n00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:06.820\nIn my humble opinion, I won't call\nyou out on this one Microsoft.\n\n93\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.511\nBut the etiquette is typically, or\n\n94\n00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:14.722\nthe accepted norm is if it's one or\nthe other, it's radio buttons.\n\n95\n00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:18.540\nIf you can choose more than one, it's\ncheckboxes, that is typical etiquettes.\n\n96\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.500\nSo I don't know who did this Microsoft,\nbut you should have a talk with them.\n\n97\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.460\nAnyway, I can't choose more than one,\nit's a little misleading there.\n\n98\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.070\nSo can I do both?\n\n99\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.314\nAbsolutely, not at the same time though.\n\n100\n00:05:29.314 --> 00:05:33.334\nSo let's Prefix with a wildcard,\nand I'll click Add, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:37.715\nAnd then I'm gonna just type in here Lab,\n\n102\n00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:42.660\nAppend wildcard, and I'll click Add.\n\n103\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.220\nSo you see that I accomplish the same\nthing, what I just have to is two separate\n\n104\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.530\nsteps there,\nwhich should give me the same results.\n\n105\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.634\nI guess if it's in the middle though,\nthat is gonna cause a problem.\n\n106\n00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:01.280\nYeah, so it's something that we have to\nplay around with, try those options there.\n\n107\n00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.020\nBut although that was cool that we can\nuse wildcards, you can either append or\n\n108\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.840\nprepend those values.\n\n109\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.490\nI'm gonna remove those for ours,\nand let's go back to MAC Address.\n\n110\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.219\nAnother way you could do this,\nnow I'll just cancel that for a second,\n\n111\n00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:18.158\nis you get your ANDs and ORs, right?\n\n112\n00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:21.348\nSo I can do anything lab, or lab anything.\n\n113\n00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:24.987\nSo there's different ways\nyou can accomplish it,\n\n114\n00:06:24.987 --> 00:06:27.532\nyou just have to kinda play around.\n\n115\n00:06:27.532 --> 00:06:29.583\nBut I'm gonna go back, and\nwe're gonna do MAC Address and mess,\n\n116\n00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:30.828\nyou're gonna have to help me out here.\n\n117\n00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.004\nDo you remember that MAC Address for\nNode01?\n\n118\n00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:37.733\n&gt;&gt; I sure do, that's going to be\n\n119\n00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:42.425\n00155 delta 0 delta.\n\n120\n00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:46.254\nExcuse me, take that back that's 0 alpha,\nsorry about that.\n\n121\n00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:49.486\nDelta 206.\n\n122\n00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:56.770\n&gt;&gt; Alright 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11, 12, that looks right.\n\n123\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.802\nAnd I'll click Add, [COUGH] And\nI'll click OK, all right.\n\n124\n00:07:01.802 --> 00:07:03.480\nAnd that's the only\ncondition I'm gonna use.\n\n125\n00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.582\nIn this demonstration, I'm actually\nsetting this up to identify a single node.\n\n126\n00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:11.064\nWhich is typically not how\nyou're gonna use these policies.\n\n127\n00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:17.506\nYou're going to use wildcard, you're gonna\nwanna affect more than one DHCP client.\n\n128\n00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.234\nBut for this example,\nI'm just doing only one the one.\n\n129\n00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:23.660\n&gt;&gt; This might be something where I'm not\nsure maybe you can grab like an art table\n\n130\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.602\nthat has those MAC Addresses\nall ready populated.\n\n131\n00:07:26.602 --> 00:07:28.575\nAnd I'll use that as my chicheat,\nthen you gonna affect more than one.\n\n132\n00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:29.631\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely or\n\n133\n00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:33.153\nif all of your machines are kind of\nstandardized like all the machines we\n\n134\n00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:36.448\nuse in the sales department,\nall have the same network adapters.\n\n135\n00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:38.640\nThey probably all have the same\nsix digit prefix, right?\n\n136\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.888\nOn that MAC Address cuz\nthat's have vendor portion.\n\n137\n00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:46.040\nSo I can do the first six asterisk, right?\n\n138\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.880\nBut that would only work if\nnone of the other machines on\n\n139\n00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.604\nmy network were using that particular\nnetwork adapter model, right?\n\n140\n00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:53.640\nSo maybe that wouldn't work.\n\n141\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.352\nAgain, it's something that you got to\nplay around with in your environment.\n\n142\n00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:03.616\nI'll click Next, so that's how we're\ngonna identify, that's our condition.\n\n143\n00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:07.708\nAnd then the setting or\npolicy that I want to apply,\n\n144\n00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:10.668\nconfigure settings for the policy.\n\n145\n00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:16.376\nAnd it shows me here, the current\nscope range is 100.10 through 100.199.\n\n146\n00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:23.130\nSo what I'm going to do, Do I want to\nconfigure an IP range for the policy?\n\n147\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.350\nYes, in other words,\nif that condition is true,\n\n148\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.780\nI wanna give you one of these addresses.\n\n149\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.579\nEven though the pool is this big,\n\n150\n00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:34.386\nI'm gonna give you just an address\nout of this little slice over here.\n\n151\n00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.464\nOkay, this is just an example\nthat's easy to demonstrate.\n\n152\n00:08:36.464 --> 00:08:43.558\n10.0.100.10 thru 10.0.100.49,\n\n153\n00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:51.740\nnow you see why I called it lower half,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n154\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.100\nAnd then what is it that\nI want to set to them?\n\n155\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.550\nOther than like right now, I'm setting\nthe IP address, based on that MAC address.\n\n156\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.702\nI could've said no,\n\n157\n00:08:59.702 --> 00:09:03.290\nI don't want to change,\nthey can have any address out of the pool.\n\n158\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.890\nCould've said no here, and\nthen when I get to this screen,\n\n159\n00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.858\nchanged maybe what router I'm giving them,\nor what DNS server I'm giving them,\n\n160\n00:09:11.858 --> 00:09:14.090\nor what DNS suffix I'm giving them.\n\n161\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.200\nSo you can really use\nany of these options.\n\n162\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.994\nI'm gonna stick with just the IP address.\n\n163\n00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:20.892\nI'll click Next, and so here's my summary.\n\n164\n00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:23.717\nIf the MAC address equals this,\n\n165\n00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:28.746\nthen give them an IP address\nfrom this subrange, right?\n\n166\n00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:33.520\nFrom the entire range, and\nI'll click Finish, all right.\n\n167\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.950\nThen we're gonna need the MAC\naddress of the other client.\n\n168\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.112\nSo let's see,\nI do not have him as a client.\n\n169\n00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:40.773\nAnd we need to get rid\nof this reservation,\n\n170\n00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.540\nbecause that will\ninterfere with my policy.\n\n171\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.255\nI have a little bit of a conflict,\n\n172\n00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:46.902\nis he gonna get this IP\naddress in the reservation?\n\n173\n00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:48.054\nOr is he going to get the IP address?\n\n174\n00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:51.422\nActually the reservation is within\nthe range, so it might work,\n\n175\n00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:53.332\nbut it wouldn't be what we wanna do.\n\n176\n00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:55.680\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna delete that reservation.\n\n177\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.100\nNext, I'm gonna go get the MAC\naddress of the second client.\n\n178\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:08.376\nSo let me flip over to client two, and\n\n179\n00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:15.466\nlet's figure what it's Mac address is.\n\n180\n00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:18.701\nAnd Wes, if you would be so\n\n181\n00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:23.115\nkind as to take this one down for me,\n\n182\n00:10:23.115 --> 00:10:28.282\n00155 delta 0 alpha delta 211.\n\n183\n00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:31.430\nAll right, so we got his MAC address and\nI'm gonna disconnect that.\n\n184\n00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.459\nBecause we are gonna be\nchanging his IP address, so\n\n185\n00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:36.510\nit's gonna drop in just a minute.\n\n186\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:42.525\nAnd let's go back over to our policies,\nand let's make another policy.\n\n187\n00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:46.258\nRight-click New Policy,\n\n188\n00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:50.970\nI call this one Upperhalf, Next.\n\n189\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.464\nAnd the condition, I'm gonna Add,\nand we'll do the same thing.\n\n190\n00:10:55.464 --> 00:11:01.110\nIf the MAC address equals 000-\n&gt;&gt; 15.\n\n191\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.102\n&gt;&gt; 15.\n\n192\n00:11:02.102 --> 00:11:08.022\n&gt;&gt; 5 delta 0 alpha delta 211.\n\n193\n00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:11.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, and I'll add that one.\n\n194\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.728\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n195\n00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:14.670\nAnd then we'll click Next.\n\n196\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.233\nAnd I do wanna change the IP address\nthat I'm giving them if that MAC\n\n197\n00:11:19.233 --> 00:11:20.091\naddress is true.\n\n198\n00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:25.497\nSo I'm gonna say, 10.0.100.50\n\n199\n00:11:25.497 --> 00:11:32.902\nthrough 10.0.100.199, and I'll click Next.\n\n200\n00:11:32.902 --> 00:11:38.986\nAnd we'll skip any of these other options,\nand we'll click Next and Finish.\n\n201\n00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:43.154\nAnd so now I have my two\npolicies in place, right?\n\n202\n00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:46.780\nAnd again, we're targeting\na single node with these policies.\n\n203\n00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.170\nThese policies are really meant\nto target multiple nodes.\n\n204\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.488\nBut as you can see, you might have need,\nlike that kiosk out front.\n\n205\n00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:55.298\nMaybe you've got an option that\nyou'd wanna give to that, and\n\n206\n00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.688\nyou wanna use a policy to do it.\n\n207\n00:11:56.688 --> 00:12:01.070\nAll right, so we've got our policies\nin place, let's see if they work.\n\n208\n00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.938\nSo I'm going to switch over to VMHost,\n\n209\n00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:09.402\nso I can get directly in\nto these little guys.\n\n210\n00:12:09.402 --> 00:12:17.020\nWe'll go to Client one, and\nit still has that reserved IP address.\n\n211\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.572\nI'm gonna do that same thing we\ndid earlier, ipconfig /release,\n\n212\n00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:22.268\nto throw away my current lease.\n\n213\n00:12:22.268 --> 00:12:27.160\nAnd then ipconfig/renew,\nlet's see what IP address\n\n214\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.800\nwe get now when we talk\nto that DHCP server.\n\n215\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.068\nAnd notice I got back 47, but\nthat is within that lower half,\n\n216\n00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:39.570\n0 or 1 through 49, I think is what I set.\n\n217\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.924\nSo it said, hey, I'll give you that\none back, it's still within the range.\n\n218\n00:12:41.924 --> 00:12:46.530\nBut client two should definitely\nget one that's in 50 through 199.\n\n219\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.878\nSo let's see,\nwe'll switch over to client two.\n\n220\n00:12:48.878 --> 00:12:54.250\nIf I can connect to it there,\nwe'll blow that up.\n\n221\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.370\nAnd we'll open up an administrative\nPowerShell, as I remember this time.\n\n222\n00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:05.387\nAnd let's see what IP address is\ncurrently, ipconfig, it's 100.12,\n\n223\n00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:06.492\nstatically mapped.\n\n224\n00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:10.275\nSo let's unmap that,\ncuz you cannot release and\n\n225\n00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:13.052\nredo a statically mapped address.\n\n226\n00:13:13.052 --> 00:13:17.600\nSo we'll change them over to DHCP,\nand see what he gets.\n\n227\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.970\nObtain an IP address and\nDNS server address automatically.\n\n228\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.470\nWe'll wait for that to go away.\n\n229\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.535\nAnd then we'll do a little ipconfig,\nand look it there.\n\n230\n00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:36.806\n10.0.100.50, first address\navailable in the upperhalf.\n\n231\n00:13:36.806 --> 00:13:43.540\nSo you can see our policies are being\napplied when that client reached to DHCP.\n\n232\n00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.064\nHe said, I need an IP address.\n\n233\n00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:49.880\nThe DHCP server said wait I got\na policy that matches this request.\n\n234\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.246\nI see you're MAC address in that packet.\n\n235\n00:13:52.246 --> 00:13:55.098\nThe policy says,\nif they have this MAC address,\n\n236\n00:13:55.098 --> 00:13:58.640\nI should give you an IP address\nfrom this range, right?\n\n237\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.869\nAnd again in this policy, we were really\ntargeting individual machines just for\n\n238\n00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:04.312\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n239\n00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:08.000\nI don't have 200 nodes running\nvirtually in my little lab.\n\n240\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.350\nBut in the real world, we'd probably be\ndoing something a little less specific.\n\n241\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.528\nWe'd wanna capture,\nwe divide up our notes however we want it.\n\n242\n00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:20.242\nLike I say, mobile devices\nversus desktops or printers.\n\n243\n00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:25.426\nAnd you can take advantage of those vendor\nclasses, for example, an HP vendor class.\n\n244\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:28.955\nSo I can have a pool that\ngoes from 1 to 254, but\n\n245\n00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:33.510\nif the client reports in that hey,\nby the way I'm an HP printer.\n\n246\n00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.842\nI can say, I got a policy that says you\nshould have an IP address that's above\n\n247\n00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:37.578\n199, right?\n\n248\n00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:41.549\nOr you get a different default\ngateway,or you get don't get a default\n\n249\n00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:42.498\ngateway at all.\n\n250\n00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:46.545\nThat's the thing that we can do with\nthis policies is we can identify groups\n\n251\n00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:50.013\nof nodes that we wanna apply\nan option to without having to create\n\n252\n00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:53.180\nseparate scopes and\ntrying to figure out how to identify.\n\n253\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.630\nWe've got policies now in DHCP\nthat we can use to identify\n\n254\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.360\nclients based on their IP address,\nor their MAC address, or\n\n255\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.182\ntheir names, their FQDN or\nclient identifier.\n\n256\n00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:08.801\nSo really cool things that they've added,\n\n257\n00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:13.200\ngiving us a little more flexibility and\ncontrol within our DHCP surface.\n\n258\n00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.090\n&gt;&gt; And that's really cool, Mike.\n\n259\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.524\nCuz like you've mentioned that DHCP,\nif I got a client on the network and\n\n260\n00:15:19.524 --> 00:15:23.380\nit just calls out, I mean DHCP is\nconfigured, hey, here's the address.\n\n261\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.509\nAnd now being able to add\na condition like and or or, and\n\n262\n00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.766\nthen an operator equal to or less than.\n\n263\n00:15:28.766 --> 00:15:32.022\nAnd here's what I'm really impressed\nabout is the fact that you didn't change\n\n264\n00:15:32.022 --> 00:15:33.292\nthe underlying DHCP service.\n\n265\n00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:35.046\nYou didn't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n266\n00:15:35.046 --> 00:15:37.524\nNow it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n267\n00:15:37.524 --> 00:15:40.831\nBut before we do, Mike, do you got any\nadditional maybe words of wisdom for\n\n268\n00:15:40.831 --> 00:15:41.364\npolicies?\n\n269\n00:15:41.364 --> 00:15:43.622\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of any\noff the top of my head.\n\n270\n00:15:43.622 --> 00:15:45.350\nPlay around with them, do test them.\n\n271\n00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.690\nMake sure that you're getting\nthe results that you expect.\n\n272\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.415\nMake sure that it's identifying\nthose nodes correctly.\n\n273\n00:15:51.415 --> 00:15:53.543\nLike you saw with the wild cards there,\n\n274\n00:15:53.543 --> 00:15:56.200\nit's not as straight forward\nas I like to see it.\n\n275\n00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.940\nI can't do asterisk lab asterisk, I got\nto do asterisk lab and then lab asterisk.\n\n276\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.876\nAnd that might not work if lab\nis in the middle of the name so.\n\n277\n00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:08.508\nBut maybe you can figure something else\nthat all machines start with this.\n\n278\n00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:12.395\nSo again it just comes down to kind of\nexploring your options there with those\n\n279\n00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:13.660\npolices.\n\n280\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.856\n&gt;&gt; Mike, a lot of great information.\n\n281\n00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:17.656\nIt looks like that's a great\nplace to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n282\n00:16:17.656 --> 00:16:19.592\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n283\n00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:20.728\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n284\n00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.552\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.331\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:11.478\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great up,\nso right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.357\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:21.771\nAnd today we're taking look at Networking,\nwith Windows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:26.856\nWe're specifically diving back into a part\nfour, on installing and configuring DHCP.\n\n9\n00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:30.490\nAnd here to help us out, is our kung\nfu master himself Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.795\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.258\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie,\n\n12\n00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:33.920\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.005\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n&gt;&gt; And you're right,\n\n14\n00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:38.263\ncontinuing on with good old DHCP,\nwe got some cool things we wanna look at.\n\n15\n00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:41.919\nSomething to take you to that\nnext level with good old DHCP.\n\n16\n00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.441\nWe saw some of the basics,\nin the previous episode.\n\n17\n00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.709\nWe got it installed,\n\n18\n00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:49.940\nwe created some scopes, talked\na little bit about that process there.\n\n19\n00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.426\nAnd the first thing we're\ngonna look at today,\n\n20\n00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:54.830\nis something known as a relay agent.\n\n21\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Mike,\nin terms of this idea of the relay agent.\n\n22\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.420\nI understand something,\n\n23\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680\nthat when we actually set up a DHCP\nserver, I need to have a DHCP server.\n\n24\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820\nBut there's a way for me,\nto actually have a single DHCP server.\n\n25\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.310\nBut they can actually even\nserve out IP addresses,\n\n26\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.350\nfor multiple subnets as well, right?\n\n27\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nwe're gonna be able to manage or\n\n28\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.230\nprovide IP addresses with a single server,\nto multiple subnets.\n\n29\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.210\nNow, one of the things we have to\nthink about is that DHCP process.\n\n30\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.664\nWe didn't really go into\nthe details of DORA,\n\n31\n00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:30.660\nD-O-R-A, Discover Offer\nRequest Acknowledge.\n\n32\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.637\nBut, when we talk about DHCP,\nwhat we have to remember,\n\n33\n00:01:33.637 --> 00:01:36.181\nis that all of those that\ninitial conversation,\n\n34\n00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:40.170\nthat conversation between the client,\nthat's looking for an IP address.\n\n35\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.512\nAnd the DHCP server that's\nproviding the IP address,\n\n36\n00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:46.710\nall of that is done using broadcast.\n\n37\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.460\nWhen we talk about unicast, versus\nmulticast versus broadcast, and Ronnie,\n\n38\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.870\nyou're our Cisco guy.\n\n39\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.430\nBy default, if I don't configure it,\n\n40\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.550\nwhat do routers typically\ndo with broadcast traffic?\n\n41\n00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.800\n&gt;&gt; When you start taking\na look at the idea of routers,\n\n42\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.360\nrouters normally by default do\nnot allow broadcast traffic,\n\n43\n00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.930\nto pass from one interface\nto another interface.\n\n44\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.520\nSo it effectively blocks it.\n\n45\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.490\nNow we can actually make it change and\ndo some other things with it, but\n\n46\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.750\noverall though, by its default,\nit actually stops it.\n\n47\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.620\nSo the reason why that's\nimportant Mike for\n\n48\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.670\nDHCP, is that that means if I have\nanother IP address that I need to hand\n\n49\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.700\nout in a different subnet, I can't get it\nthrough, so how is this gonna work, Mike?\n\n50\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's what Relay Agent,\nis gonna do for us.\n\n51\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.618\nIt's gonna help us out in this scenario.\n\n52\n00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:32.092\nSo let's take a look, and\nI have got it set up.\n\n53\n00:02:32.092 --> 00:02:33.515\nWe're gonna start off very simple.\n\n54\n00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:36.340\nI've got my domain controller,\nthat we're using the other day.\n\n55\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.438\nIf I open up the DHCP console.\n\n56\n00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:44.297\nWe have our DHCP server still\nconfigured and if we take a look,\n\n57\n00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.720\nI've got a couple of\nscopes that I created.\n\n58\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.990\nWe got the 1000 subnet here.\n\n59\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.000\nAnd let's take a look at what we've got.\n\n60\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.170\nLet's flip over to the client.\n\n61\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.620\nI'm doing all of this via Virtual Machine\nconnection, rather than remote desktop.\n\n62\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.770\nCuz we're gonna be changing IP addresses,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.550\nit makes it very difficult\nto remote into the guy.\n\n64\n00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.340\nSo bear with me as I switch back and\nforth, between these machines.\n\n65\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.920\nWe flip over to my client, and\nwe open up little PowerShell,\n\n66\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.920\nand we do a little ipconfig, switch all.\n\n67\n00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.300\nI can see that I've got an address,\nbut that is statically mapped.\n\n68\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.110\nDHCP enabled, no.\n\n69\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.500\nSo let's change that.\n\n70\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.470\nLet's get our client,\nto get an IP Address from the DHCP server.\n\n71\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.369\nSo I'm gonna pull up my\nNetwork Adapter settings.\n\n72\n00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:35.593\nAnd we'll go in and\nwe'll change that to a DHCP client,\n\n73\n00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:38.872\nby pulling up the Properties\non my Network Adapter.\n\n74\n00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:42.193\nDiving into IPv4 and\ntelling it to obtain an IP address, and\n\n75\n00:03:42.193 --> 00:03:44.870\na DNS server address automatically.\n\n76\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.520\nI'll click OK a couple of times,\nwe'll let that kick in And hopefully,\n\n77\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.520\nas I closed these windows I'll leave them\nopen, we might need them in a minute.\n\n78\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.252\nFlip back over here,\ndo a little ipconfig again.\n\n79\n00:03:57.252 --> 00:04:02.017\nAnd now, I can see I've got\na different IP address, 10.0.100.11.\n\n80\n00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:06.596\nDHCP is enabled,\nI can see who my DHCP server is,\n\n81\n00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:10.410\nI can see how long that lease is good for.\n\n82\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.394\nSo I'm getting this IP address, from DHCP.\n\n83\n00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:20.362\nAnd if we flip over to the DHCP server,\nwe'll switch back to DC1 and I refresh.\n\n84\n00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:25.660\nWe should see, there it is, client 01,\nis picking up that IP address from DHCP.\n\n85\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.760\nNow the reason this is working, Ronnie,\n\n86\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.260\nis if we look at the way\nthe network is structured.\n\n87\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.570\nThis is pretty much what we've got.\n\n88\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.710\nWe have our DHCP server.\n\n89\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.800\nWhich is by demand control,\nor DC01 that's running DHCP.\n\n90\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.020\nThere's a switch,\nthat these nodes are connected to,\n\n91\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.200\nand my client is connected to this switch.\n\n92\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.430\nAnd so switches, they allow broadcast\ntraffic, they don't try to block anything.\n\n93\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.280\nThey're not making that contention domain.\n\n94\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.190\nAnd so the client's hollering out,\nI need an IP address,\n\n95\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.820\nthe server's hearing that,\nresponding with that offer.\n\n96\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.650\nThe client is then requesting, and\nthe server is acknowledging, and\n\n97\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.560\nit can begin using the IP address.\n\n98\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.976\nSo everything's working great.\n\n99\n00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:10.624\nBut now let's imagine,\nwe've got another subnet over here.\n\n100\n00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:13.508\nThere's another switch and\nI've got a router,\n\n101\n00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:15.840\nsitting in between these two subnets.\n\n102\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.870\nSo we can route traffic, back and forth.\n\n103\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.230\nAnd this is a Windows Server 2016 box,\nthat's running, routing and remote access.\n\n104\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.360\nSo, what would happen if,\nwe take this client and move it.\n\n105\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.080\nWe'll pretend, that we've got him\non the other subnet over here.\n\n106\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.210\n&gt;&gt; So, let me kinda review and make sure,\nI have this right in my head, Mike.\n\n107\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.880\nSo the reason why DHCP worked\neffectively the first time,\n\n108\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.210\nis because the DHCP server and\nthe client itself, are on the same subnet.\n\n109\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.560\nBut what you're now saying though,\n\n110\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.990\ninstead, is that DHCP client itself is\non some unknown subnet at this point.\n\n111\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.310\nBut my DHCP server's actually\non a different network.\n\n112\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.640\nAnd what we've now done,\nis put a router in between.\n\n113\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.000\nSo now that I have a router in between,\nit's gonna block all broadcast.\n\n114\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n115\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.240\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, how's this gonna work.\n\n116\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.642\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what happens here.\n\n117\n00:06:03.642 --> 00:06:06.336\nLet's go ahead and on our client.\n\n118\n00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:12.940\nLet's see if what we're talking about,\nrings true.\n\n119\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.860\nSo let's clear this up.\n\n120\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.480\nAnd I'll do an ipconfig/release\nto throw away,\n\n121\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.520\nwell if I elevate my prompt I'll do that.\n\n122\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.785\nSo let's get an administrative PowerShell.\n\n123\n00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:29.631\nYes to the good old UAC.\n\n124\n00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:35.380\nAnd we'll do an ipconfig /release, to\nthrow away my current release information.\n\n125\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.780\nNo big deal.\n\n126\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.240\nAnd let's move the client.\n\n127\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.930\nI forgot to move him.\n\n128\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.380\nLet's actually move him.\n\n129\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.900\nI moved him in the drawing, but\nnot in the virtual realm here.\n\n130\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.510\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm simply\ngonna do just like in my drawing,\n\n131\n00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.980\nI happen to be doing it through the\nHyper-V settings for this Virtual Machine.\n\n132\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.890\nIs I'm gonna change the network\nthat it's connected to.\n\n133\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.200\nI'm gonna connect him to that\nother subnet, internal two.\n\n134\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.210\nI'm gonna click OK, to apply that change.\n\n135\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.248\nSo it'd be just like moving a cable in\nyour closet, from one switch to another.\n\n136\n00:07:07.248 --> 00:07:14.237\nAnd let me do an ipconfig/renew and\nsee what happens.\n\n137\n00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:16.707\nAnd we give it a minute,\nbut as Ronnie pointed out,\n\n138\n00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.960\nwe're pretty sure we know\nwhat's gonna happen, right?\n\n139\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAt this point,\n\n140\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.000\nwhen we start seeing this, what Mike\nhas issued here, of course, with that\n\n141\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.700\nidea of the renew ,is that he's manually\nforcing that door process to begin.\n\n142\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.610\nSo what should happen from this client,\n\n143\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.230\nis that it should begin to broadcast out\nits discover message and it's gonna hit\n\n144\n00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.950\nevery device on that network,\nthat's listening for this broadcast.\n\n145\n00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.580\nAnd it's gonna hit that router interface.\n\n146\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.010\nSo Mike, you said that with that router\nin place we can still do this, but\n\n147\n00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.090\nit doesn't look like it's working.\n\n148\n00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.750\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't, right?\n\n149\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.426\nIt is not giving me an IP address.\n\n150\n00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:55.259\nIt's eventually gonna time out and\nwe should know from Network+,\n\n151\n00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.091\nwe'll end up with an APIPA\naddress of 169254.\n\n152\n00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.204\nSomething, something.\n\n153\n00:08:00.204 --> 00:08:03.124\n169.254.something.something.\n\n154\n00:08:03.124 --> 00:08:07.540\nBecause he's trying to get an IP address,\nbut he can't find the DHCP server.\n\n155\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.150\nNobody on his subnet is\nproviding that information.\n\n156\n00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.590\nSo then the question is,\nhow can we do this?\n\n157\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.090\nWe could set up a DHCP server\non every single subnet.\n\n158\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.940\nI mean, that's a possibility, right?\n\n159\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.779\nBut that would mean extra servers and the\nDHCP is not a big consumer of resources,\n\n160\n00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:27.626\nso we're really gonna\nend up wasting resources\n\n161\n00:08:27.626 --> 00:08:30.496\nif we try to set up DHCP\nservers on every subnet.\n\n162\n00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:33.698\nEspecially when we can\nconfigure it to where one DHCP\n\n163\n00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:36.430\nserver can support multiple subnets.\n\n164\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.650\nSo let's see how we can do that.\n\n165\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.930\nThe first thing we're gonna do is\nmake sure that on our DHCP server,\n\n166\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.920\nwe have an appropriate scope.\n\n167\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.620\nSo here's the scope for that other subnet\nthat I just connected the client to.\n\n168\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.170\nYou can see it's a 192.168 address, so\nwe'll be able to tell the difference.\n\n169\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.690\nAnd I've got a pool of\naddresses available.\n\n170\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.126\nAll right, so everything is looking there.\n\n171\n00:08:59.126 --> 00:09:01.920\nDHCP itself is set up.\n\n172\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.240\nThe server's waiting and he's saying, hey,\n\n173\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.040\nif anybody needs an IP address\nfrom this particular subnet,\n\n174\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.130\nI've got a pool of addresses and\nI'd be more than glad to give you one.\n\n175\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.940\nThe problem is that the client is never\nable to reach the DHCP server to ask for\n\n176\n00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.670\nthat IP address.\n\n177\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.970\nThat's what's being blocked by the router.\n\n178\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.230\nSo we're gonna go over to our router.\n\n179\n00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.800\nServer one and I've all ready done\nthis what we're gonna need to\n\n180\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.630\ninstall routing and remote access, right?\n\n181\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.894\nThat's gonna give us the ability to\ncreate what we call a DHCP relay agent,\n\n182\n00:09:34.894 --> 00:09:35.738\nall right?\n\n183\n00:09:35.738 --> 00:09:40.103\nAnd it's just like the name implies,\nhe's gonna relay information.\n\n184\n00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:45.040\nYou can imagine a subnet over here on\nthe right, a subnet over here on the left.\n\n185\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.250\nAnd then this routing [INAUDIBLE]\naccess server sitting in the middle.\n\n186\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.630\nAnd he's got connections to both sides,\nright?\n\n187\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.230\nSo he's gonna hear that client over here\nhollering out, I need an IP address.\n\n188\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.030\nAnd nobody's every gonna answer him.\n\n189\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.490\nBut the router also has\na connection to the other side, and\n\n190\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.377\nhe knows where the DHCP server is.\n\n191\n00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:05.910\nSo all he's gonna do is just simply take\nthat information, that client's request,\n\n192\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.600\nand since the client can't get\nthere he'll wrap it up and\n\n193\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.340\nsend it over to the DHCP server\non behalf of the client.\n\n194\n00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.530\nHe's relaying that request over\nto the DHCP server, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.636\nAnd then the DHCP server is gonna respond\nback to the relay agent, who is then going\n\n196\n00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:27.686\nto relay that response back to that subnet\nthat the client exists on, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:27.686 --> 00:10:30.650\nHere's a couple of keys that\nwe need to remember with this.\n\n198\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.870\nRemember, the client doesn't\nhave an IP address, so\n\n199\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.540\nhe's doing all broadcast traffic.\n\n200\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.850\nThe router is hearing that and\nhe's gonna wrap it up,\n\n201\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.570\nhe knows the IP address of the DHCP server\nso he actually sends it to the DHCP\n\n202\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.970\nserver as a unicast packet, directly to\nthe DHCP server, it's not a broadcast.\n\n203\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.975\nThe DHCP server responds back to the relay\nagent with another unicast packet.\n\n204\n00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:57.774\nThe relay agent then takes that and\nrelays it back to the client, but\n\n205\n00:10:57.774 --> 00:11:01.720\nhe can't do a unicast because\nthe client doesn't have an IP address.\n\n206\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.840\nSo there's no destination to send it to.\n\n207\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.934\nSo the relay agent is actually gonna\nbroadcast it back out to that subnet.\n\n208\n00:11:06.934 --> 00:11:09.260\nAnd the client is gonna\nhear the broadcast.\n\n209\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.260\nAnd so, the client, he has no idea\nthat the relay agent is doing this.\n\n210\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.400\nHe simply hollers out on the network,\nhey, I need an IP address.\n\n211\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.595\nAnd magically the DHCP server,\nright, responds.\n\n212\n00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:22.980\nHe gets this broadcast back with an offer.\n\n213\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.540\nAnd so he thinks everything is fine,\n\n214\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.030\nhe has no idea that the relay agent\nis doing this for him on his behalf.\n\n215\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.248\nSo to set it up, we install routing\nremote access, which I've already done.\n\n216\n00:11:32.248 --> 00:11:36.812\nAnd you don't have to configure VPN or\n\n217\n00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:41.380\ndirect access or anything like that.\n\n218\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.000\nYour gonna install routing remote access.\n\n219\n00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.870\nOnce you get that installed, you see\nI have not configured the server yet.\n\n220\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.390\nI'm gonna right click on it and\nchoose configure and\n\n221\n00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.400\nenable, routing and remote access.\n\n222\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.550\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, before we get too deep in\nthis, let's talk about that virtual\n\n223\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.590\nmachine for a moment somebody's\ntrying to set up their lab.\n\n224\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.230\nWhat they need to have on there is at\nleast two network adapters, right, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.495\n&gt;&gt; Yes, with the router?\n\n226\n00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:07.293\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and let's go back to that\n\n227\n00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:11.691\ndrawing, you can see a router by\ndefinition has to be multi homed.\n\n228\n00:12:11.691 --> 00:12:15.469\nRight, because it has to be connected to\nmore than one network if it's gonna route\n\n229\n00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:16.960\nbetween those networks.\n\n230\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.130\nSo a router really needs\nto be multi homed.\n\n231\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.320\nNow this could be, it doesn't have\nto be a Microsoft box, right.\n\n232\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.040\nI mean in the real world, Ronnie,\n\n233\n00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.105\nhow often do we see 2016\nboxes being used as routers.\n\n234\n00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:32.403\n&gt;&gt; Now, I don't know about 2016 boxes,\nI do know about 2012 and 2003.\n\n235\n00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:34.063\nNot very often.\n\n236\n00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:37.005\nMore than likely, you might end\nup seeing of course, a router,\n\n237\n00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:40.059\nan actual physical router in it's\nplace but by using this right you\n\n238\n00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:43.489\ncan set one up at home if you are doing\na home lab instead of having to go out and\n\n239\n00:12:43.489 --> 00:12:47.790\nby some expensive equipment and go, I need\na router just so I can practice this.\n\n240\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.422\nSet this up on the routing\nremote access server,\n\n241\n00:12:50.422 --> 00:12:53.410\nit's gonna actually save\nyou a lot of money.\n\n242\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.600\nBut then when you do configure it,\n\n243\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.080\nif you're doing it in that virtual\nenvironment, make sure you actually do\n\n244\n00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.515\nmake two network adaptors or\nyou're gonna find yourself frustrated.\n\n245\n00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:01.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you try and\n\n246\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.040\nconfigure this idea so.\n\n247\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.390\n&gt;&gt; To make that a little more visual\nwe could do something like this,\n\n248\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.830\nI could drag this one maybe over to here.\n\n249\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.829\nAnd drag this one maybe over to here.\n\n250\n00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:13.830\nTo really represent the fact\nthat it's a multi homed.\n\n251\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.960\nIt's got more than one network adapter and\n\n252\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.260\nit's connected to both of\nthose different networks.\n\n253\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.520\nAnd honestly, like Ronnie was saying,\n\n254\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.225\nyou don't see server being used as a\nrouter all that often because I'm gonna go\n\n255\n00:13:24.225 --> 00:13:27.055\nbuy a piece of hardware\nthat's dedicated to this.\n\n256\n00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:29.645\nThat it's processor does nothing but\nroute packets.\n\n257\n00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:32.785\nIt spends all of its memory,\nall of its resources, on routing and\n\n258\n00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.265\nfiltering and what have you.\n\n259\n00:13:34.265 --> 00:13:37.235\nBut in a small shop,\nwhere I don't have the money to go out and\n\n260\n00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:39.205\nbuy one of those nice routers, but\n\n261\n00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:44.980\nI still want to segregate my server\ntraffic from my client traffic, right?\n\n262\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.990\nI don't want my Internet surfing\nusers interfering with the bandwidth\n\n263\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.090\nthat's going on between my servers\nthat are replicating a DNS scope or\n\n264\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.130\nactive directory.\n\n265\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.460\nSo I might have that server 2016 box\nsitting there that's doing a lot.\n\n266\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.390\nI might also add to it\nrouting remote access.\n\n267\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.670\nI've already got the server,\nso there's no extra license.\n\n268\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.790\nIt's a role I install,\nit's not costing me any money.\n\n269\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.350\nMost likely I already have two\nnetwork adapters in a physical server.\n\n270\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.540\nSo I can set up this routing remote access\nand do it without any additional cost.\n\n271\n00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.800\nBut as my company grows, I'm most likely\ngonna implement a hardware solution,\n\n272\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.150\nan actual router to do\nsomething like this.\n\n273\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.640\nBut for tests, for development,\n\n274\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.820\nhey I need to temporarily break off\na new subnet so we can test some things.\n\n275\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.430\nHey, I can set this up in a heartbeat,\n\n276\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.240\njust install routing remote access,\nand we're good to go.\n\n277\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.170\nSo let's try it out.\n\n278\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.030\nSo back over here to the server.\n\n279\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.580\nOnce you've installed the role,\nI'm gonna click next, and\n\n280\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.260\nthen I'm gonna do a custom configuration,\nand I'll click next.\n\n281\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.760\nAnd I simply need LAN routing, I don't\nneed VPN access and direct access and\n\n282\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.820\nthings like that.\n\n283\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.820\nI could, for other services, but for\n\n284\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.680\nif you're just setting up a DHCP relay,\nthe only thing you need is LAN routing.\n\n285\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.232\nI'll click Next and Finish.\n\n286\n00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:03.805\nAnd if I could actually click,\nit's thinking about it.\n\n287\n00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:05.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna go and\n\n288\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.570\nset that up in the background.\n\n289\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.470\nIt should be there, guys.\n\n290\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.070\nIt'll ask me to start the service.\n\n291\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.570\nI'll say yes.\n\n292\n00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:20.960\nGive it just a minute as it finalizes\nthe configuration and begins that service.\n\n293\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.390\nI'm always tempted to click Finish again.\n\n294\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.290\nI know that the window's\ngonna go away in a second.\n\n295\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.850\nSo I'll just be patient.\n\n296\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.030\nThere it goes.\n\n297\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.700\nAlright, so now we've got our green\nlittle up arrow on our server.\n\n298\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.199\nIf I expand this out,\nI can see that I have IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n299\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.370\nAnd we are good to go, all right?\n\n300\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.890\nSo, next step is to actually\nconfigure to be a relay agent.\n\n301\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.766\nAnd what we're gonna do, under IPv4,\n\n302\n00:15:46.766 --> 00:15:52.446\nis we're simply gonna right click on\nGeneral and choose New Routing Protocol.\n\n303\n00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:58.269\nWe've got to tell our routing remote\naccess server how to speak DHCP relay.\n\n304\n00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:03.077\nSo we'll add a new protocol, And\nthe choice will be DHCP Relay Agent,\n\n305\n00:16:03.077 --> 00:16:04.310\nwe'll click OK.\n\n306\n00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.220\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n307\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.451\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:07.804\n&gt;&gt; And then there you go,\n\n309\n00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:12.160\nunderneath IPv4 we now have this\nDHCP Relay Agent listed there.\n\n310\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.220\nWe can't stop there though,\nwe've gotta do a couple more things.\n\n311\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.650\nSo now I'm gonna go to\nthis relay agent and\n\n312\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.980\nwhat I need to do is I need to\nright-click and add a new interface.\n\n313\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.560\nHey wait, well what interface?\n\n314\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.380\nI know this is a multi-home,\nit's got two interfaces, ,all right.\n\n315\n00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.110\nIf the client is over here, and\nhe's gonna send out a broadcast,\n\n316\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.755\nwhich interface on my server is\ngonna need to be the relay agent?\n\n317\n00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.683\nWell, it's gonna be the one on the side\nof the client that's sending out\n\n318\n00:16:39.683 --> 00:16:40.790\nthe broadcast.\n\n319\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.192\nThis interface here,\nis the one that has to listen for\n\n320\n00:16:44.192 --> 00:16:49.421\nthese clients hollering out hey, I need\nan IP address and nobody's responding.\n\n321\n00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:54.170\nSo you gotta pay attention to which one\nyou're implementing the relay agent on.\n\n322\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.070\nIt'll be on the side of the client,\nso we're gonna flip back over here.\n\n323\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.686\nNew interface, and that is my Ethernet2.\n\n324\n00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:04.258\nI'll click OK and\nI've got some information here,\n\n325\n00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:07.030\nwe're not gonna get into\nthe hop count threshold.\n\n326\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.300\nThis has to do with,\nif we've got a heavily routed environment,\n\n327\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.270\nhow many routers can this go\nthrough before it drops packets.\n\n328\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.265\nThe main thing here is just to make\nsure relay DHCP packets is turned on,\n\n329\n00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:25.200\ncuz if I turn that off he's gonna say,\nI'm not listening for DHCP requests,\n\n330\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.020\nand I'm not gonna relay them.\n\n331\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.410\nSo, you've got to make\nsure it's turned on.\n\n332\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.360\nSo we've added the interface.\n\n333\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.450\nOne more thing you've got to do, and\n\n334\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.300\nit's easy one to miss,\nI see people do this all the time.\n\n335\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.190\nWhy is this not working?\n\n336\n00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.590\nBecause remember,\nwe've got this set up so far,\n\n337\n00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.630\nso this interface has that\nrelay agent listening on it.\n\n338\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.030\nBut I have to tell\nthe remote access server\n\n339\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.190\nwhere to forward the packets to, right?\n\n340\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.520\nHe's gonna hear the request\nfrom the client,\n\n341\n00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.050\nhe's gonna wrap it up as a unicast,\nand send it to a DHCP server.\n\n342\n00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.422\nWhat's the IP address of the DHCP server?\n\n343\n00:17:59.422 --> 00:18:04.000\nI gotta make sure he knows that so he can\nsuccessfully send it as a unicast packet.\n\n344\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.660\nSo that's the last step, is to right-click\non relay agent and choose properties,\n\n345\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.020\nand then add the IP address\nof the DHCP server.\n\n346\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.870\nSo you're statically mapping the IP\naddress, we'll click OK, right.\n\n347\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.500\nSo now,\nrouting remote access is installed and\n\n348\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.480\nconfigured, we have added the protocol,\nDHCP relay agent.\n\n349\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.500\nWe have told it what\ninterface to listen on,\n\n350\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.920\nand we've told it the IP\naddress of the DHCP server.\n\n351\n00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.600\nWe should be good to go, let's find out.\n\n352\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.054\nWe're gonna flip over the client.\n\n353\n00:18:42.102 --> 00:18:44.760\nAnd we'll maximize that so\nwe can pay attention.\n\n354\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.465\nWe'll clear our screen and\nwe'll go to IP config.\n\n355\n00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:56.040\nRenew, and see if we can get\nan IP address from that server.\n\n356\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.070\nSo right now, the client's hollering out,\nhey, I need an IP address.\n\n357\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.610\nThe relay agent should hear that, and\nrealize that nobody's responding and\n\n358\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.300\nsay here, I'll help you out.\n\n359\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.970\nLet me wrap that up, send it over\nto the DHCP server, DHTP says,\n\n360\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:16.348\nI got an IP address, here's my offer and\nlook at there, we are good to go.\n\n361\n00:19:16.348 --> 00:19:20.953\nNow you might think to yourself\nwell how come we got a 192.168 and\n\n362\n00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:23.039\nnot a 10 dot address, right?\n\n363\n00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:27.442\nBecause on DHCP,\non my DHCP server we have two scopes,\n\n364\n00:19:27.442 --> 00:19:32.829\nI've got one for 10 dot, and\nI've got one for 192.168.\n\n365\n00:19:32.829 --> 00:19:37.558\nHow did he know to give that client\nover here a 192.168 address, and\n\n366\n00:19:37.558 --> 00:19:41.109\ndidn't end up giving him\na 10 dot something address?\n\n367\n00:19:41.109 --> 00:19:44.200\nAnd that's because the packet\nfrom the routing and\n\n368\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.290\nremote access server shows what\ninterface that request came from, right?\n\n369\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.736\nSo the DHCP server sees that, he says,\n\n370\n00:19:52.736 --> 00:19:57.685\nthat request came from 192.168.100.0/24.\n\n371\n00:19:57.685 --> 00:20:02.320\nLet me see if I have a scope that has IP\naddresses that are valid in that range.\n\n372\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.010\nHe does, and then that's the one\nhe pulls from, if he didn't,\n\n373\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.950\nhe would not pass out an IP address.\n\n374\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.160\nHe knows that a 10 dot address\nis not gonna do anybody good\n\n375\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.160\nover here on this side,\nso he wouldn't give it.\n\n376\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.350\nSo, you gotta make sure that you set\nup your DHTP server correctly as well.\n\n377\n00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.616\nYou need a different scope for\neach one of the subnets,\n\n378\n00:20:21.616 --> 00:20:23.675\nand this is very, very scalable.\n\n379\n00:20:23.675 --> 00:20:25.734\nI mean and we could take,\n\n380\n00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:30.746\nlet's say we added another subnet,\nall right, over here.\n\n381\n00:20:30.746 --> 00:20:37.126\nWe add another network adapter to\nour routing remote access server,\n\n382\n00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:42.750\nwe attach that routing remote\naccess server to this switch.\n\n383\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.504\nWe take another client,\nthat's over there on that subnet.\n\n384\n00:20:48.504 --> 00:20:54.519\nWe take another, and\nwe obviously we connect that server up,\n\n385\n00:20:54.519 --> 00:21:00.317\nor that client up to that switch,\noops, get that on there.\n\n386\n00:21:00.317 --> 00:21:05.183\nAll right, and we can simply continue to\ndo this, so if I had three or four or\n\n387\n00:21:05.183 --> 00:21:07.289\nfive or ten different subnets.\n\n388\n00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:10.741\nThe only thing I gotta worry about, this\nguy's already running as a relay agent, so\n\n389\n00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:13.450\nwe don't have any extra\nconfiguration to do there.\n\n390\n00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.550\nHe already knows the IP\naddress of the DHTP server, so\n\n391\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.500\nthere's nothing to change\nthere if we add more subnets.\n\n392\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.200\nThe only thing I need to do Is\ngo to my DHTP server itself, and\n\n393\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.124\ncreate the appropriate pool of\naddresses for this new subnet.\n\n394\n00:21:27.124 --> 00:21:30.420\nSo that he has something to offer when\nhe hears those requests and that's it.\n\n395\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.560\nSo setting up a relay agent allows me to\n\n396\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.190\ntake that single DHCP server and\nsupport multiple subnets.\n\n397\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.430\nAnd the other thing we'll throw\nin there Ronnie is, well, no,\n\n398\n00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.410\nI guess won't,\nwe should stick with Microsoft.\n\n399\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.990\nIn the end, most of our Cisco devices,\nand things like that,\n\n400\n00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.980\nhave the ability to be a relay agent.\n\n401\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.710\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we understand that\n\n402\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:02.280\nI don't have to use a Microsoft relay\nagent to accomplish this solution.\n\n403\n00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.650\nIf I have multiple subnets\nthat I need to support DHCP,\n\n404\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.600\nI can create scopes for\neach one of those subnets.\n\n405\n00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.780\nI do have to make sure that somehow those\nrequests are getting to the DHCP server\n\n406\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.540\nand that's what we use\nthat DHCP relay agent for.\n\n407\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.828\nBut if you've already got a router in\nplace, and that router supports the relay\n\n408\n00:22:20.828 --> 00:22:25.379\nagent functionality, you don't to go out\nand set up a server just for this purpose.\n\n409\n00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:26.750\nThat's what I want to\nmake sure we understand.\n\n410\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:31.422\nThis isn't the only way to do it, but\nfor the exam and for the real world it's\n\n411\n00:22:31.422 --> 00:22:36.534\nimportant we know that I can take a 2016\nbox and make a DHCP relay agent out of it.\n\n412\n00:22:36.534 --> 00:22:41.442\n&gt;&gt; Mike, the key that I get from here,\nespecially on the setup of that router,\n\n413\n00:22:41.442 --> 00:22:45.660\nis that the relay agent has to be\non the interface that is asking for\n\n414\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.580\nthe actual request that's\non the different subnet.\n\n415\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.500\nSo do not think that's actually\non the one, the original one,\n\n416\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.330\nwhere the DHCP server is.\n\n417\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.150\nBut it has to be on the other one, if not,\nthat's actually a bad configuration and\n\n418\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.670\nyou're not gonna get the result\nthat you want to as well.\n\n419\n00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.328\nSo that can be a little bit tricky,\nespecially if you're under time\n\n420\n00:23:04.328 --> 00:23:07.229\non the exam and your going,\nwhich interface is it?\n\n421\n00:23:07.229 --> 00:23:08.253\nYou gotta remember that.\n\n422\n00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:11.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's a great point\nbecause I just thought about it.\n\n423\n00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.510\nI was sitting here saying,\nyou don't have to do anything else to\n\n424\n00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.780\nthe relay agent when you add a new subnet,\nbut that's not true, right?\n\n425\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.650\nIf we go back to my screen,\nI've got another network adapter, so\n\n426\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.700\nwhat would happen if we\ntake a look at this.\n\n427\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.205\nI would need to if we added another\nsubnet, I'd have to go over to my relay\n\n428\n00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:34.048\nagent and lets do it,\nlet's add another subnet.\n\n429\n00:23:34.048 --> 00:23:38.966\nI'll right-click here and we pull up\nthe settings for this virtual machine,\n\n430\n00:23:38.966 --> 00:23:41.659\nand we'll add another network adapters.\n\n431\n00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:45.883\nSo we'll add another one,\nand we'll connect it and\n\n432\n00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:50.211\njust a second, so\nlet's do virtual switch manager.\n\n433\n00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:53.048\nLet's create another network real quick.\n\n434\n00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:58.352\nWe'll say internal, call it Internal3 Now,\nthe nice thing about what Mike\n\n435\n00:23:58.352 --> 00:24:03.410\nis doing right here, which is something\nthat we couldn't do in the past,\n\n436\n00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:09.780\nis that he's, in theory, adding in virtual\nhardware while the machine is running.\n\n437\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.960\nAnd even in older versions of\nthe virtual machines, a lot of times,\n\n438\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.700\nit would tell you, you need to actually\npower down this machine first, and\n\n439\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.330\nthen you could add then\nthat network after.\n\n440\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.120\nBut Mike, it looks like this version of\nHyper-V allows you to do it on the fly,\n\n441\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.560\nand it's pretty darn cool.\n\n442\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.610\n&gt;&gt; It is really cool.\n\n443\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.520\n[LAUGH] Love being able to do that.\n\n444\n00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.890\nSo I've added a new interface to this guy,\nand we'll need to configure that.\n\n445\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.190\nI'll go to the network settings, for\nthe routing and remote access server,\n\n446\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:41.590\nchange adapter settings, and\nlet's see, that would be number three.\n\n447\n00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.220\nWe'll go to the properties there.\n\n448\n00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.420\n&gt;&gt; That's neat.\n\n449\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.815\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe will configure him with an IP address.\n\n450\n00:24:47.815 --> 00:24:51.406\nLet's do a 17216.\n\n451\n00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:58.032\nWe haven't done one of those yet,\n172.16, let's say .0.101.\n\n452\n00:24:58.032 --> 00:25:01.083\nWe'll do a, that's fine.\n\n453\n00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:04.965\nDon't need default gateway or\nDNS, we'll just click OK on that.\n\n454\n00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:07.960\nSo, I've got a new network adapter\nthat's statically mapped, right?\n\n455\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.870\nSo we're adding a new service.\n\n456\n00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.000\nHere we are, we're a business,\nwe're growing.\n\n457\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.240\nWe've added a new subnet, or\nmy boss wants us to add a new subnet.\n\n458\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.010\nI don't want to create a new DHCP server,\nso\n\n459\n00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.670\nI want to take our DHCP server, and\nadd support for this third subnet.\n\n460\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.370\nSo we've added another network\nadapter to the server.\n\n461\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.060\nWe've connected it to that third subnet,\nso we're good to go there.\n\n462\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.310\nWe're gonna go back over to the properties\nover here, and on that relay agent.\n\n463\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.130\nI've got to click new interface,\ncuz think about that.\n\n464\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:42.510\nI now need this interface to listen for\nDHCP requests as well.\n\n465\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:48.010\nSo we'll add new interface, and we'll\ngo to oops, that's not the right one.\n\n466\n00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.500\nThat's, what did I name it?\n\n467\n00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.300\nI forgot what I named\nthat ethernet adapter.\n\n468\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.080\nI can see it right here.\n\n469\n00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.128\nWe'll go to general.\n\n470\n00:25:57.128 --> 00:26:02.392\nAnd I've got internal, isn't it two?\n\n471\n00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:03.740\nWhere is my?\n\n472\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.320\nYou know what I need?\n\n473\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.063\nI need to add it altogether.\n\n474\n00:26:06.063 --> 00:26:10.111\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Interesting,\n\n475\n00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:14.717\nit's not seeing that\nnetwork adapter just yet.\n\n476\n00:26:14.717 --> 00:26:17.410\nLet's go back in our Network Settings\nto make sure I did that correctly.\n\n477\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.550\nI got all three.\n\n478\n00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.410\nAnd it was named ethernet three.\n\n479\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.250\nSo, we are good there.\n\n480\n00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.070\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, in this instance, maybe we\nwant to try a couple of things here.\n\n481\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.890\nWe might want to try restarting\nthe entire virtual machine itself.\n\n482\n00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.350\nOr maybe even try restarting\nthe service itself instead,\n\n483\n00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.470\nand the routing mode access.\n\n484\n00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.450\n&gt;&gt; Great point Ronnie,\nthat's why we keep him around, right?\n\n485\n00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:47.900\nYeah, let's do that, let's restart\nthe routing remote access service, and\n\n486\n00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.960\nsee if we can get it to detect that hey,\n\n487\n00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.220\nyou've got a new network adapter that\nyou can use for routing remote access.\n\n488\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.360\nSo, simply restart this, or\nyou could restart the entire server.\n\n489\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.200\nIf it has other things that\npeople are depending on,\n\n490\n00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.206\nyou might not want to do that\nin during production hours.\n\n491\n00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:05.259\n&gt;&gt; Come on, Mike\n&gt;&gt; That's not going too take to\n\n492\n00:27:05.259 --> 00:27:06.710\nlong, right?\n\n493\n00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.190\nAnd let's see what happens now.\n\n494\n00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.220\nAnd there, beautiful.\n\n495\n00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.940\nEthernet three is showing up.\n\n496\n00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.130\nSo then, we'll continue on, we'll go\nback down here to DHCP relay agent,\n\n497\n00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.840\nright click, new Interface,\nand we'll say hey,\n\n498\n00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:26.120\nwe also want you to listen on\nEthernet 3 for any requests for DHCP.\n\n499\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.110\nSame options here.\n\n500\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.840\nWe're good to go.\n\n501\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.650\nI don't need to change the properties\nof the DHCP relay agent,\n\n502\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.180\ncuz it's still forwarding\nthe request to the same DHCP server.\n\n503\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.150\nSo, all I needed to do was\nadd the interface, and\n\n504\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.010\nsay by the way, listen on this one too.\n\n505\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.570\nNow, I do have to go\nto the DHCP server and\n\n506\n00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:51.550\nmake sure I have an appropriate scope\nset up for that particular subnet.\n\n507\n00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.015\n&gt;&gt; And now Mike, while you're actually\nstarting to do that for us, because I\n\n508\n00:27:55.015 --> 00:27:57.856\nknow we did it on another episode\n&gt;&gt; But as we're starting to do this,\n\n509\n00:27:57.856 --> 00:28:01.019\nMike actually just mentioned something\nthat I probably should have mentioned,\n\n510\n00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:03.498\neven though I said,\nlet's restart the actual server itself.\n\n511\n00:28:03.498 --> 00:28:07.355\nRemember what Mike said is actually very\nvalid and very important here, that you\n\n512\n00:28:07.355 --> 00:28:11.322\nwanna actually only start up what you need\nto, or restart what you need to instead,\n\n513\n00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:15.550\ncuz restarting the whole thing, other\npeople could be dependent on, upon it.\n\n514\n00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.420\nBut if we know that we're the only ones\nreally using the routing remote access\n\n515\n00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.380\nright now, restarting that\nservice should affect the least.\n\n516\n00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.600\nAnd in a production network,\nthat's gonna be very important.\n\n517\n00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.820\nSo here, Mike's just started walking\nthrough the wizard itself, and\n\n518\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.530\nnow he's gonna set up the rest of it.\n\n519\n00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:30.600\nLook, that was pretty easy, Mike.\n\n520\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.700\n&gt;&gt; That was, right?\n\n521\n00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.390\nSo, I didn't configure any\noptions on this particular scope.\n\n522\n00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.200\nWe're just doing as a test, so.\n\n523\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna right-click and\nmake sure I activate that scope.\n\n524\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.838\nSo now I've got a relay agent\nlistening in on that subnet.\n\n525\n00:28:42.838 --> 00:28:46.130\nI've got a DHP server that has\na pool of addresses that would be\n\n526\n00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.090\nvalid on that subnet.\n\n527\n00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.490\nThe only thing we're going to\nhave left to do is test it out.\n\n528\n00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.000\nLet's move the client.\n\n529\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.990\nBasically, take our client and\nmove him up to this particular switch, so\n\n530\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.450\nwe can see if the relay agent\nis working on that route.\n\n531\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:00.940\nSo, we'll go to the client machine.\n\n532\n00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.061\nOr actually,\nwe'll go to the Hyper-V manager.\n\n533\n00:29:04.657 --> 00:29:06.720\nOne of the great things\nabout doing this virtually.\n\n534\n00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.520\nWe'll go to the client.\n\n535\n00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.920\nWe'll configure his settings.\n\n536\n00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.550\nAnd we're gonna bump him one more time.\n\n537\n00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:18.200\nWe'll move him over to internal three,\nand click OK.\n\n538\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.140\nAnd then we'll go back to the client.\n\n539\n00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.970\nMaximize this, so we can keep\ntrack of which machine we're on.\n\n540\n00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.470\nWe'll do an IP config switch release.\n\n541\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.270\nAnd then we'll do an IP config.\n\n542\n00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.400\nAnd because I basically unplugged and\nplugged the cable\n\n543\n00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.230\nout of the back of the computer,\nit's in the middle of doing it itself.\n\n544\n00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.850\nIt knows that, hey,\nI might have just changed networks.\n\n545\n00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.220\nTypically, what a machine does is it\nwill try to ping the default gateway.\n\n546\n00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.570\nAnytime you disconnect and\nplug a cable back into a machine,\n\n547\n00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.100\nit tries to ping the default gateway to\nsee if it's still on the same network.\n\n548\n00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.520\nIf it can't reach the default gateway,\nthen it knows to, hey.\n\n549\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.360\nI need to go ahead and\n\n550\n00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.340\ntry to get a new lease, because my\nold lease is probably not valid.\n\n551\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.590\nI've now switched networks.\n\n552\n00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.242\nSo, let's see what we got.\n\n553\n00:30:04.242 --> 00:30:07.977\nLet's just do a real pick, ipconfig.\n\n554\n00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:09.270\nAnd we don't have one yet.\n\n555\n00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:16.344\nSo we'll do an ipconfig switch renew,\nand see if we can pick up that address.\n\n556\n00:30:16.344 --> 00:30:19.762\nMake sure that we, I have to think in my\nmind, we've been doing this on the fly, so\n\n557\n00:30:19.762 --> 00:30:21.564\nI gotta make sure we got everything setup.\n\n558\n00:30:21.564 --> 00:30:24.804\nWe've moved the client to that third one,\n\n559\n00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:25.649\nand-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n560\n00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:30.502\n&gt;&gt; There it goes, so notice its picked\nup an address out of the 17216 pool\n\n561\n00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:35.750\nof addresses, so everything is working\nas it should be, that relay agent.\n\n562\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.057\nWe added a new interface,\nwe added the protocol to the interface,\n\n563\n00:30:39.057 --> 00:30:41.713\nwe created the appropriate\nscope on the DHCP server,\n\n564\n00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:44.798\nwe moved the client over there,\nand everything works great.\n\n565\n00:30:44.798 --> 00:30:48.173\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, thank you again for\nhelping us out here and\n\n566\n00:30:48.173 --> 00:30:53.210\nunderstanding a little bit more about how\nto set up a relay agent for using DHCP.\n\n567\n00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.120\nSo remember, what you actually take and\nlook at here,\n\n568\n00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.107\nis that we've set up one DHCP server,\nbut multiple different subnets that\n\n569\n00:31:00.107 --> 00:31:03.350\nthe one DHCP server could be able\nto hand out IP addresses to.\n\n570\n00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:08.540\nAnd that was also by creating that\nrouter remote access role there for\n\n571\n00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.520\nus to be able to do that relay agent.\n\n572\n00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.300\nSo getting that all set up means that\nwe can actually reduce the number of\n\n573\n00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.490\nresources that we really need,\nmake it a little bit more efficient, but\n\n574\n00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.260\nyou can see how powerful it can be and\n\n575\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.250\nhow much we might need this\ninside of our own networks.\n\n576\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.170\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then,\n\n577\n00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.370\nand we do thank you for joining us.\n\n578\n00:31:26.370 -->

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:08.248\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:12.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.740\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.170\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.760\ntoday we're taking a look at\nnetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n8\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.610\nWe're specifically going into a part\nfive of installing and configuring DHCP.\n\n9\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.450\nWe're getting ready for that exam and\n\n10\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.420\nhere to help us with that is\ngoing to be Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.490\nMike what do we need to know for the exam?\n\n12\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Well for the exam,\nI mean it's 15 to 20%\n\n13\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.935\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] the exam so,\n\n14\n00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.305\nwe need to make sure we're\nvery familiar with it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.845\nWe've got a lot of moving pieces that\nwe have to be able to deal with.\n\n16\n00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:44.875\nWe've seen the basics of getting it\ninstalled, getting it configured,\n\n17\n00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:49.785\ngetting it operational, creating scopes\nand configuring my scope options.\n\n18\n00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:53.355\nWe looked at relay agents, making sure our\nclients could communicate with the DHCP\n\n19\n00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:58.600\nserver and retrieve those IP address or\nTCP/IP configuration information.\n\n20\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.310\nNow we want to take look at migrating\na DHCP server and importing and\n\n21\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.950\nexporting that DHCP database.\n\n22\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.460\nNow we talk about running a DHCP server.\n\n23\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.130\nWe see this a lot in enterprises where\nthe DHCP server is running 2003 or 2008\n\n24\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600\nbecause DHCP is Is once you get it set up,\nand it's running it just sits there.\n\n25\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.340\nAnd it just does it's thing, and\nyou really don't have to mess with it.\n\n26\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.730\nAnd people will tend to forget about it,\nand before long your operating system that\n\n27\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.880\nit's running on,\nis no longer being supported.\n\n28\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.860\nAnd I gotta get off of that machine,\nor the hardware is getting old,\n\n29\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.910\nwe gotta replace it.\n\n30\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.730\nSo that's why we're looking at doing\na migration from 2003, 2008, to 2016.\n\n31\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.530\nSo we've got to be able to do that,\nas well as move it, right?\n\n32\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.880\nI mean,\na lot of small enterprises will, or\n\n33\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.960\nsmall small corporations, they've got\none server that kind of does it all.\n\n34\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.930\nActive directory, DNS, DHCP.\n\n35\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.190\nAnd maybe now want to move\nthat DHCP server off.\n\n36\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.120\nLike in our previous example, we had\na server running routed remote access, and\n\n37\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.930\nwe showed how it can add multiple network\nadaptors to hit the different subnets.\n\n38\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.580\nSo that it can act as a relay agent.\n\n39\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.810\nWell what if I just move DHCP\nto that server over there,\n\n40\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.710\nthat one that was running routing and\nroute access.\n\n41\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.460\nThat's already connected\nto all the three or five or\n\n42\n00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.090\nhowever many subnets you've got.\n\n43\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.990\nThen I don't even need a relay agent\nbecause they can all talk directly or\n\n44\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.060\nyou can listen to all\nthe different subnets.\n\n45\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060\nSo sometimes you've gotta move\nthe role from one machine to another,\n\n46\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.330\nthat's gonna be an import and\nexport process.\n\n47\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.390\nSometimes you've got to migrate it from an\nolder hardware platform operating system\n\n48\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.950\nto a new one and we'll do a migration.\n\n49\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.073\nAlright Mike, now taking a look at that\nidea specifically, we talk about the idea\n\n50\n00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:40.359\nof migration or backing up and restoring\ncouple of questions come into mind, Mike.\n\n51\n00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.680\nIs there a difference between\nthe terminology that you use there?\n\n52\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.930\nAnd then secondly,\n\n53\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.690\nthe idea here of actually doing what\nyou talk about is insanely complex?\n\n54\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.810\n&gt;&gt; It can be.\n\n55\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.810\nWe'll just say that it can be,\nit really shouldn't be.\n\n56\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.310\nAs long as you follow these steps\nthat we're gonna show you here.\n\n57\n00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.520\nThere is a difference between back up and\nrestore, and import and export.\n\n58\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.020\nI sometimes get those goofed up as well,\nit's easy to do.\n\n59\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.610\nWhen you're working with\na single server you back up and\n\n60\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.580\nyou restore that data base,\nyou back it up to keep it safe,\n\n61\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.310\nif something happens to\nit you can simply copy.\n\n62\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.370\nA backup into that place,\nand restarted the service.\n\n63\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.690\nAnd it'll pick it up\nlike nothing was wrong.\n\n64\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.190\nBut if we want to move it\nfrom one to the other,\n\n65\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.360\nwe really have to go\nthrough the export process.\n\n66\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.870\nIt kind of packages everything up, gets\nit ready to export to another machine.\n\n67\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.120\nAnd then we have to import it in,\n\n68\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.910\nwe can't simply just copy that\ndatabase into that location.\n\n69\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.050\nWe do have to make sure\nwe're mindful of that,\n\n70\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.820\nthat we're thinking about a way to\n[INAUDIBLE] Staying on the same machine\n\n71\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.430\nthen I'm really going to be\nworking with back up and restore.\n\n72\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.370\nIf I'm moving from one machine\nto another migrating or\n\n73\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.740\njust moving that role, really gonna be\nusing that import and export options and\n\n74\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.345\nthere's really two ways we can do that.\n\n75\n00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:52.100\nNetSH, the old school way of\ndoing it that works just fine and\n\n76\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.830\nthen there's of course they added\nall their power shell commandlets\n\n77\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.420\nto work with this process as well.\n\n78\n00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nbefore we get into that configuration and\n\n79\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.950\ntrying to see how it works.\n\n80\n00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.860\nAnother question for us then is that,\nif we want to do this or\n\n81\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.120\nwe know that we're gonna need to do this,\nis there any other plan or\n\n82\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.650\nconfiguration I need to think about for\nthe rest of my network?\n\n83\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.310\nOr on the those machines?\n\n84\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.800\nBut I have to go here's\nthe six steps I need to follow\n\n85\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.090\nin preparation of doing\nsomething like this.\n\n86\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.630\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n87\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.720\nYeah, a lot of it can be done on a fly,\n\n88\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.400\nas far as you need to create\na destination location for your export.\n\n89\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.330\nAnd then you need to, and\nthat's a local process.\n\n90\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.170\nYou can't do it up to a network share.\n\n91\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.890\nAnd then you've got to get that\nto your new machine somehow,\n\n92\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.770\nwhether that's once you've exported it,\ncopy it up to a network share.\n\n93\n00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.280\nCopy it back down locally as\na new machine and then import it.\n\n94\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.210\nOr export it,\ncopy off the removable media, and\n\n95\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.150\ntake it physically over\nto the other machine.\n\n96\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.850\nCopy it locally.\n\n97\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.960\nBut either way,\nhowever you get it from one to the other,\n\n98\n00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.140\nthe export process is a local\nprocess to the local hard drive.\n\n99\n00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.970\nThe import process is local\nfrom the local hard drive.\n\n100\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.950\nThe other thing that you\nwanna pay attention to is,\n\n101\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.060\nnow I forgot where your\nquestion was going with that.\n\n102\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.280\nOther things we might have\nto think about to get ready,\n\n103\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.030\nwould be, are there scopes\nalready on that new machine?\n\n104\n00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.350\nIs there gonna be a conflict?\n\n105\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.870\nAre we gonna have to\noverwrite existing scopes?\n\n106\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.540\nAnd that kind of thing.\n\n107\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.200\nAnd there are some switches I can use\nin PowerShell Especially Netsh as well\n\n108\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.820\nthat can help me.\n\n109\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.440\nMaybe I'm gonna export this DHCP\nserver and it's got four scopes,\n\n110\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.390\nI only really need one of those, the other\nthree subnets have bee retired long ago.\n\n111\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.670\nI could import just that one subnet or\nwant that one scope, I should say.\n\n112\n00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.780\nDo I wanna include the lease\ninformation or are we gonna start over?\n\n113\n00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.920\nThe other thing, Ronnie, I think is\nas far as when you do it, right?\n\n114\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.560\nCan I do this in the middle of day?\n\n115\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.480\nCuz most of the time we think don't ever\ndo it in the middle of the production day.\n\n116\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.710\nWe don't want to bring any servers down.\n\n117\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.640\nNot gonna be a good result.\n\n118\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.784\nDHCP, really the only thing that's\ngonna happen is during that process,\n\n119\n00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:54.315\nDHCP will be unavailable.\n\n120\n00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:58.159\nSo any new nodes are nodes that need IP\nconfiguration would not be able to obtain\n\n121\n00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.071\nthat during this process, but\nit doesn't take very long,\n\n122\n00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.000\nso it's not the end of the world.\n\n123\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.520\nThey'll call you up, and by the time\nthey get help desk on the phone,\n\n124\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.240\nit'll probably be back up and\nrunning, and everything will be fine.\n\n125\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.200\nSo should you do it in\nthe middle of the day?\n\n126\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.942\nProbably not, but can you?\n\n127\n00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:16.910\nIt's really gonna be minimal down time\nbecause if you think bout it the notes\n\n128\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.969\nonly has the lease information right?\n\n129\n00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.784\nThe lease is good by default at least for\neight days, so\n\n130\n00:06:21.784 --> 00:06:24.845\nthey might have two days left,\nmight have seven days left,\n\n131\n00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:27.867\nthey don't care of DHCP's there or\nnot during that time.\n\n132\n00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:32.045\nThe only time they really gonna be\nconcerned is when their lease is expiring\n\n133\n00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.562\nand they need to renew it is up and\nrunning, so\n\n134\n00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:37.540\ncan you do it at the middle\nof production day?.\n\n135\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.380\nYes should you?\n\n136\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.911\nWell best practice is going to probably be\nno but if you can't and you have to do it,\n\n137\n00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:46.540\nunderstand that the impact on\nthe network is going to be minimal.\n\n138\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.132\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike I hear somebody saying\nas straight forward it should actually\n\n139\n00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:55.770\nwork exactly the way it is,\nIt normally ever isn't exactly that way.\n\n140\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.950\nMike is this a straight forward process or\nnot?\n\n141\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.565\n&gt;&gt; It's incredibly straight forward.\n\n142\n00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:01.150\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n143\n00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.470\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing to it.\n\n144\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.300\nNo, I tease,\n\n145\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.430\nthat's why I'm here to show you guys\nhow to do it, It's really not that bad.\n\n146\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.080\nThere can be a couple of\nlittle gotchas along the way.\n\n147\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.670\nI forgot to make sure that server\nwas authorized in active directory.\n\n148\n00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.330\nRight we talked about that\nin a previous episode.\n\n149\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.530\nI didn't realize there was a scope\nalready on there with the same subnet ID,\n\n150\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.660\nnow I've gotta either override it or\nI've lost all the information.\n\n151\n00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.190\nSo a couple little things like that but\nfor\n\n152\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.810\nthe most part it's a pretty\nstraightforward process.\n\n153\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.840\nBut You know that's the way computers are.\n\n154\n00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.525\nWhat should be straight forward never is\nand that's why you guys are going to get\n\n155\n00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.045\ncertified and go out there and start\nmaking the big bucks because you can take\n\n156\n00:07:39.045 --> 00:07:42.620\ncare of networks and deal with it when\nit doesn't go as smoothly as possible.\n\n157\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.242\nSo if I drink the Microsoft kool aid\nI will tell you this is a five step\n\n158\n00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:49.650\nprocess and nothing can go wrong.\n\n159\n00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.847\nIf we wanna talk real world,\nyeah, things can happen.\n\n160\n00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:57.063\nBut relatively easy to figure\nout what happened and a fix.\n\n161\n00:07:57.063 --> 00:07:58.295\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, so\n\n162\n00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:02.128\nas you show us this Is this something\nI can do completely in the GUI or\n\n163\n00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:06.510\nam I really gonna have to drop down to\nPowerShell, or something like that.\n\n164\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.158\n&gt;&gt; Or you're gonna have to, I mean-\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n\n165\n00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:08.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Pick your poison,\n\n166\n00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.090\nit's either gonna be the old school\ncommand prompt with netsh or\n\n167\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:17.990\nit's gonna be your import or export DHCP\nserver with PowerShell, one or the other.\n\n168\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.890\nBut you can't do the export\nthrough the GUI as far as I know.\n\n169\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.650\nNow they might have, it's not in there,\nbackup and restore we can do through\n\n170\n00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.320\nthe GUI, but the import export\nis done from the command line.\n\n171\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.540\nSo, let's take a look and see how we do.\n\n172\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.097\nWe've got our servers from our\nprevious episodes, we'll rehash that.\n\n173\n00:08:33.097 --> 00:08:39.000\nI've got DC01 sitting here and\nDC01 is running DHCP.\n\n174\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.315\nIt's up and active so\nwe'll just scroll down and verify.\n\n175\n00:08:42.315 --> 00:08:45.490\nWe've got our DHCP console, we'll open up.\n\n176\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.310\nAnd we can see that it is running,\nit's got green check marks,\n\n177\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.570\nmeans it's authorized.\n\n178\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.360\nI've got a couple scopes and in fact,\nI probably have a couple of leases.\n\n179\n00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.350\nSo, we're good to go there, DHCP is up and\n\n180\n00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.531\nrunning, that's the one\nwe're gonna export from.\n\n181\n00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:05.700\nThen, we're gonna go to server one,\nwho is also running DHCP,\n\n182\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.167\nfresh install, no scopes on there at all.\n\n183\n00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:11.490\nSo, that's the one we'll import to.\n\n184\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.680\nThen I also have a server running 2012,\nthat's running DHCP.\n\n185\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.055\nIt's one that will pretend it's been\naround for a while also has a scope on it.\n\n186\n00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:28.482\nAnd it's time to migrate off of 2012 and\nget this over to 2016.\n\n187\n00:09:28.482 --> 00:09:32.794\nSo, we'll do both, we'll do netsh, we'll\ndo PowerShell, we'll see importing and\n\n188\n00:09:32.794 --> 00:09:37.010\nexporting from 2016 to 2016 as well\nas migrating from 2012 to 2016.\n\n189\n00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.530\nKeeping our fingers crossed,\nhoping that it all goes well.\n\n190\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.471\nAll right so,\n\n191\n00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:47.345\nthe first step was going to be export\nour existing information from DHCP.\n\n192\n00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:52.186\nSo, I'm gonna jump over to DC1 and\nI'm gonna open up File Explorer and\n\n193\n00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:56.783\nnavigate into my C drive and\nI've a folder here called DHCPExport so\n\n194\n00:09:56.783 --> 00:10:01.154\nthat's my destination location\nagain that's a local folder.\n\n195\n00:10:01.154 --> 00:10:04.594\nSo, I'm gonna open up\nan administrative prompt,\n\n196\n00:10:04.594 --> 00:10:08.434\nwe'll call it PowerShell but\nI'm gonna be using netsh,\n\n197\n00:10:08.434 --> 00:10:13.236\nremember PowerShell allows you to\nalias most of your old cmd commands.\n\n198\n00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:20.247\nSo, we're gonna do netsh\ndhcp server export and\n\n199\n00:10:20.247 --> 00:10:24.694\nthen, c:\\DHCPExport\\ and\n\n200\n00:10:24.694 --> 00:10:30.338\nI'll call this dc01Export.mdb for\n\n201\n00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:37.190\nthe Microsoft Database,\nand I'll hit Enter.\n\n202\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.910\nAnd keeping our fingers crossed again,\neverything should go just fine.\n\n203\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.630\nSo basically,\nit's taking all of that information,\n\n204\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.440\nthe scopes, the current lease information,\nall of that, and it's putting it in here.\n\n205\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.670\nNow, there actually are some\ncommands you can do,\n\n206\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.310\nyou guys know how to get help\nfrom the command prompt, /?.\n\n207\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.200\nYou could do netsh,\ndhcp, server export /?,\n\n208\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.380\nget some help on some of the other\nswitches or parameters you could use.\n\n209\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.960\nFor example, limiting it to just\nexporting one scope of information, or\n\n210\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.370\nnot including the lease information.\n\n211\n00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.039\nI went ahead and\ndid the entire kit in Kerboodle.\n\n212\n00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:13.370\nAll right so that's good,\nwe've got all that there now,\n\n213\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.240\nwe are going to switch over to server one.\n\n214\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.820\nAnd I'm going to open up File Explorer.\n\n215\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.090\nAnd I'm gonna go grab that folder.\n\n216\n00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:30.790\nSo, DC01c$, I'm gonna take that\nentire folder, I'm gonna copy it.\n\n217\n00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:34.858\nAnd I'm gonna make sure I paste\nthat onto my local drive.\n\n218\n00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:40.271\nAnd there it is, DHCPExport and there,\n\n219\n00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:44.115\nit's just that a mdb that we\ncreated during that export process.\n\n220\n00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:50.770\nAll right now, I'm going to go ahead and\nstop DHCP on server one.\n\n221\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.105\nSo, I'm gonna go to All Tasks and Stop,\n\n222\n00:11:53.105 --> 00:11:55.730\nthat way none of the files are in use,\nright?\n\n223\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.435\nThe database and\n\n224\n00:11:56.435 --> 00:12:00.600\nthings like that are unused makes\nimport process a whole lot easier.\n\n225\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600\nSo now,\nwe're gonna open up PowerShell, and\n\n226\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.300\nI should have done administrative one just\nin case, so let's do that one more time.\n\n227\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.750\nWe'd Run as Administrator and\nYes to the UAC.\n\n228\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:19.559\nAnd the command is very similar,\nnetsh dhcp server import and\n\n229\n00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:24.652\nthen wherever I put that,\nc:\\DHCPExport and\n\n230\n00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:28.229\nI called it dc01Export.mdb.\n\n231\n00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:32.142\nSo, I'm telling it where that file is,\nI hit Enter and\n\n232\n00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:38.550\nunable to determine the DHCP version for\nthe server, may not function properly.\n\n233\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.435\nEh, may, may not.\n\n234\n00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:43.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with it, let's start it up and\n\n235\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.020\nsee what happened.\n\n236\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.970\n&gt;&gt; So, that last line that we saw there,\n\n237\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.320\nthe report is probably just indicating\nthat it came from another server version.\n\n238\n00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.942\nSo, it may not stop us, but just letting\nus know that, is that what it saying?\n\n239\n00:12:56.942 --> 00:13:00.698\n&gt;&gt; It is, basically telling me exactly\nthat because the service was stopped,\n\n240\n00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:03.650\nit couldn't create the service and\nfigure out what it was.\n\n241\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.260\nLet's try and refresh this, it should be,\nthere's my green check marks.\n\n242\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.050\nAnd my scopes did not come in,\ninteresting.\n\n243\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.310\nAll right, let's try that\nimport with it up and running.\n\n244\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.780\nIt's been a little while since I\nplayed with the netsh version of this.\n\n245\n00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.120\nIt might have allowed me to do that\nwith it running, we'll try it and see.\n\n246\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.466\nSo now the service is running and\nwe'll just try to import it one more time,\n\n247\n00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:28.754\nsee if I get that same error.\n\n248\n00:13:31.551 --> 00:13:32.851\nSo, give it just a second.\n\n249\n00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:33.694\n&gt;&gt; Hey, there we go.\n\n250\n00:13:33.694 --> 00:13:35.955\n&gt;&gt; Command completed successfully,\nso there we go.\n\n251\n00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:40.184\nSo, in this case, it really wants\nthe service to be up and running.\n\n252\n00:13:40.184 --> 00:13:45.850\nSo now, we'll come back over here, we'll\nrefresh, there are both of my scopes.\n\n253\n00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.670\n&gt;&gt; An active.\n\n254\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.340\n&gt;&gt; They are active, let's see if we've got\nsome leases going on, everything is there.\n\n255\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.860\nSo, at this point, the only thing left to\ndo would be to go back over to DC1, and\n\n256\n00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.970\nthis is the important part.\n\n257\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.440\nI can't have both of these\nmachines working that same scope.\n\n258\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.560\nSo, I need to get over to my console, and\n\n259\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.270\nat this point I can stop DHCP on DC1,\nthe original server.\n\n260\n00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.900\nIt's up and\nrunning now on the new DHCP server there.\n\n261\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.000\nOops, let's get rid of that and bring\nback server one and we're good to go.\n\n262\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.740\nWe should be, like I said, back up in\nbusiness within a matter of minutes.\n\n263\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.288\nSo, the downtime was minimal.\n\n264\n00:14:26.288 --> 00:14:31.510\nYou have to pay attention to that mistake\nthat I made there, I stopped the service\n\n265\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.210\nout of habit, I always stop services\nbefore I'm trying to import information.\n\n266\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.680\nIn this case, it really wanted that\nservice to be running cuz it couldn't talk\n\n267\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.902\nto the service, verify that it was\nthere and start that import process.\n\n268\n00:14:41.902 --> 00:14:46.040\nSo, leave DHCP running when\nyou run that netsh command.\n\n269\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.170\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike before we move on to\nthe next one here, on the export or\n\n270\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.600\nimport, I can't remember which\none I'm talking about here,\n\n271\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.350\non the import back into the new one,\nthat's actually going to be\n\n272\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.910\na different length of time depending\non how big that database is right?\n\n273\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, if you've got multiple\nscopes, if you've got hundreds or\n\n274\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.200\nthousands of leases,\nthat makes that database larger in size.\n\n275\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.910\nThis one was no bigger than a meg or\nso, I think.\n\n276\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.792\nSo, it was a pretty quick process but\neven then it's really not,\n\n277\n00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:15.484\nit's basically moving that database over.\n\n278\n00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:20.327\nSo, that'll be the longest time, it's just\ncopying that database into the default\n\n279\n00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:22.883\nlocation, SQL of Windows System32 DHCP,\n\n280\n00:15:22.883 --> 00:15:27.320\nputting that database there from\nwherever you're importing it from.\n\n281\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.530\nThat'd probably be your biggest time,\nother than that, it restarts the servers\n\n282\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.430\nin the background, it sees that new\ndatabase and it just starts going.\n\n283\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.140\n&gt;&gt; All right now,\nwe're gonna try to do 2012 and\n\n285\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.770\nwe're gonna try to use PowerShell\nto do basically the same process.\n\n286\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.537\nSo, here's my 2012 server.\n\n287\n00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.378\nAnd I've got a scope on here for\nthe dev subnet.\n\n288\n00:15:50.378 --> 00:15:54.599\nAnd maybe we've decided, we've been\nrunning their old DHCP server in that dev\n\n289\n00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:59.075\nenvironment We're gonna move that to the\nDHCP Server that everybody else is using.\n\n290\n00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:01.841\nIt's now mulithome, so\nit can listen to multiple subnets or\n\n291\n00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:03.640\nmaybe we're setting up relay agents.\n\n292\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.292\nAnyway, we wanna move this\noff to another server.\n\n293\n00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:09.954\nSo, we're gonna open up Powershell, and\n\n294\n00:16:09.954 --> 00:16:16.380\nwe do want an Administrative Powershell,\nso let's do that one more time.\n\n295\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.999\nIt's funny going back to 2012\neverything looks so different.\n\n296\n00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:25.138\nLet's adjust this font, so you can see it,\nactually read what I'm typing.\n\n297\n00:16:31.195 --> 00:16:37.746\nAll right, and for PowerShell the command\nis gonna be Export-DhcpServer, right.\n\n298\n00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:44.167\nExport-DhcpServer, and\nthen we're going to do a -file.\n\n299\n00:16:46.582 --> 00:16:48.012\nAnother tab autofill for me there.\n\n300\n00:16:48.012 --> 00:16:50.134\nI always like to verify\nthat even the word file,\n\n301\n00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:51.899\nI wanna make sure I spelled it, right.\n\n302\n00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:53.081\nSo, do a little tab autofill on it.\n\n303\n00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:54.789\nAnd then, my destination.\n\n304\n00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:56.527\nI did not make a destination folder.\n\n305\n00:16:56.527 --> 00:17:00.420\nSo, let me open up file explorer, and\n\n306\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.179\non that C Drive,\nI'm gonna make a new folder,\n\n307\n00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:11.149\nI'm gonna call it SVR 03 Export.\n\n308\n00:17:14.636 --> 00:17:19.605\nAnd here is c:/ svr03export\\ and\n\n309\n00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:25.665\nlet's call this one again, svr03export.\n\n310\n00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:30.454\nThis one, notice though,\nlook what I'm doing there.\n\n311\n00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:32.637\nYou guys see that?\n\n312\n00:17:32.637 --> 00:17:34.629\nIt's not a .mdb when you use PowerShell.\n\n313\n00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:41.180\nIt actually wants to export that into an\nXML file format rather than the old .mdb.\n\n314\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.201\nSo, we'll give it that name there.\n\n315\n00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:45.160\nThe other thing nope, we should be good.\n\n316\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.054\nWe'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n317\n00:17:46.054 --> 00:17:50.459\nHopefully that process works fine.\n\n318\n00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:55.750\nWe'll go check, and\nthere is my .xml document.\n\n319\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.265\nTechnically, we should be\nable to read that, right?\n\n320\n00:17:57.265 --> 00:18:02.980\nThat's the great thing about .xml is it's\neasy to read and it's a neutral, yeah.\n\n321\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.113\nWe can take it into\nsome other application.\n\n322\n00:18:06.113 --> 00:18:07.530\nLet's not do that.\n\n323\n00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.908\nLet's just get this opened.\n\n324\n00:18:08.908 --> 00:18:10.154\nAsk me later.\n\n325\n00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:12.737\nAnd there's the information right there.\n\n326\n00:18:12.737 --> 00:18:14.472\nWe'll scroll down through.\n\n327\n00:18:14.472 --> 00:18:15.503\nSome of this we'd recognize.\n\n328\n00:18:15.503 --> 00:18:22.149\nSome of the, let's see if I can\nfind an actual lease maybe.\n\n329\n00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.823\nA lot of them,\n\n330\n00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:26.377\nI mean there's a lot of information\njust about the configuration of DHCP.\n\n331\n00:18:26.377 --> 00:18:28.513\nSo, stuff that we might or\nmight not recognize.\n\n332\n00:18:28.513 --> 00:18:30.288\nBut if we look through there long enough,\n\n333\n00:18:30.288 --> 00:18:32.683\nwe'd find information about\nour scopes that existed.\n\n334\n00:18:32.683 --> 00:18:35.293\nThere aren't any particular\nleases on that machine.\n\n335\n00:18:35.293 --> 00:18:39.537\nBut if there were,\nthat would be included in there as well.\n\n336\n00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:40.890\nAll right, so we've got that export.\n\n337\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.701\nNow, what we're gonna do is very\nsimilar to what we did with NSH.\n\n338\n00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:49.520\nI've gotta get that export over to\nthe machine that I wanna import that into.\n\n339\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.645\nSo, we're gonna switch to svr 1, and\n\n340\n00:18:53.645 --> 00:19:00.025\nwe're gonna open up File Explorer,\nnavigate to my C drive.\n\n341\n00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:07.837\nThat is not the right C drive,\n\n342\n00:19:07.837 --> 00:19:11.978\nalthough let's do this one.\n\n343\n00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:19.343\nAnd I'm going to //svr03/c$.\n\n344\n00:19:19.343 --> 00:19:20.659\nAnd there's my server03Export.\n\n345\n00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:25.717\nI'm gonna copy that entire folder,\nwhich is really just that XML file.\n\n346\n00:19:25.717 --> 00:19:32.324\nAnd then back onto my local C drive,\nI will paste my copy.\n\n347\n00:19:32.324 --> 00:19:33.404\nSo, there's my server03Export.\n\n348\n00:19:33.404 --> 00:19:37.980\nAll right, we are cooking with gas now.\n\n349\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.306\nSo, let's just double-check\non server three.\n\n350\n00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:45.288\nSo, server 1 I’ve got two sub\nnets that we imported from VC1,\n\n351\n00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:48.349\nthe 10.192.168.100.\n\n352\n00:19:48.349 --> 00:19:49.839\nBack to my administrative PowerShell.\n\n353\n00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:55.542\nAnd we're going to do dh,\n\n354\n00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:58.653\nnot dhcp, but\n\n355\n00:19:58.653 --> 00:20:03.850\nImport-DhcpServer.\n\n356\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.767\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n357\n00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:06.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There it goes.\n\n358\n00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:07.950\nThen we're gonna do -file.\n\n359\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.648\nAgain wait for it.\n\n360\n00:20:11.648 --> 00:20:12.569\nI know, why do you wait for that?\n\n361\n00:20:12.569 --> 00:20:16.701\nAgain, I like to make sure that PowerShell\nand me are on the same wavelength.\n\n362\n00:20:16.701 --> 00:20:18.263\nAnd so, I tab autofill everything.\n\n363\n00:20:18.263 --> 00:20:21.615\nAnd then, we're gonna do, so -file,\n\n364\n00:20:21.615 --> 00:20:26.059\nwhere am I getting this from,\nc:\\svr03export.\n\n365\n00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.036\nAnd I forget what I called it.\n\n366\n00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:30.724\nI think I called it, yeah, svr3export.xml.\n\n367\n00:20:30.724 --> 00:20:31.307\nThank you Ronnie.\n\n368\n00:20:31.307 --> 00:20:32.581\nSo that's the file name.\n\n369\n00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:39.273\nWe're also gonna do a -backup path.\n\n370\n00:20:39.273 --> 00:20:40.814\nI think wait, aren't you importing?\n\n371\n00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:42.918\nThis is a safe guard.\n\n372\n00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:45.968\nWhat if something goes wrong\nduring the import process?\n\n373\n00:20:45.968 --> 00:20:49.817\nIt's not just a blank DHCP server\nthat I'm importing this into.\n\n374\n00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:51.587\nI've already got two\nother scopes on there.\n\n375\n00:20:51.587 --> 00:20:54.859\nIf I go and do this import and\nsomething goes wrong,\n\n376\n00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:59.059\nI didn't realize the scopes were\nthe same and I over-write one.\n\n377\n00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:02.123\nThere's a few different things that could\ngo wrong during this import process.\n\n378\n00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:07.725\nMostly me not paying attention and\nnot documenting and planning correctly.\n\n379\n00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:11.995\nSo we have to put a backup path, cuz what\nit's gonna do is backup DHCP, real quick,\n\n380\n00:21:11.995 --> 00:21:14.805\nfirst then it's gonna go\nthrough the import process.\n\n381\n00:21:14.805 --> 00:21:17.313\nAnd that gives us that roll back point,\n\n382\n00:21:17.313 --> 00:21:22.500\nwhere if something fails all of a sudden I\ntry to do this import and DHCP is broken.\n\n383\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.483\nI can simply restore from backup to the\npoint before we did the import process.\n\n384\n00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:31.421\nIt's a really cool that it forces me\nto follow best practices really and\n\n385\n00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:32.752\ndo a backup first.\n\n386\n00:21:32.752 --> 00:21:36.509\nAll right, if we wanted to,\nwell let me go ahead and give it a backup.\n\n387\n00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:37.949\nLet me give it a backup location.\n\n388\n00:21:37.949 --> 00:21:45.283\nSo, I'm gonna make a new folder for\nthat, call it DHCP.\n\n389\n00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:45.791\n&gt;&gt; Backup.\n\n390\n00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.095\n&gt;&gt; Back up, how did you know, Ronnie?\n\n391\n00:21:47.095 --> 00:21:48.317\nI'm so creative, aren't I?\n\n392\n00:21:48.317 --> 00:21:51.537\nAnd I don't know why I\ndo that every time and\n\n393\n00:21:51.537 --> 00:21:55.486\nI have to fix it every time\ncuz it will drive me crazy.\n\n394\n00:21:55.486 --> 00:21:58.775\nDHCP backup is where I\nwant to put this backup.\n\n395\n00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:04.209\nSo C:\\DHCPBackup and\n\n396\n00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:12.636\nthen I'll call it b4Import.xml.\n\n397\n00:22:12.636 --> 00:22:19.662\nNow, I could do -ScopeId or\nI could do a -leases.\n\n398\n00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:23.736\nCouple of other switches that I want you\nguys to be familiar with are parameters\n\n399\n00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:24.983\nand PowerShell speak.\n\n400\n00:22:24.983 --> 00:22:30.285\nScope ID, let's say that that server had\nmore than one scope that I exported from,\n\n401\n00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:33.486\nbut I only wanted to import\none particular scope.\n\n402\n00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:39.304\nI could do a scopeID and\nthen 10.0.100.0, right.\n\n403\n00:22:39.304 --> 00:22:42.116\nIf there was more than one,\nI'd separate it out with commas.\n\n404\n00:22:42.116 --> 00:22:49.542\nI also wanna import 10.0, or let's say\nit was a different one, 192.168.50.0.\n\n405\n00:22:49.542 --> 00:22:53.763\nNotice I'm not doing any kind of\nsubnet mask or anything like that.\n\n406\n00:22:53.763 --> 00:22:59.758\nIt’s simply scopeID and then, a comma\nseparated value list with the IDs for\n\n407\n00:22:59.758 --> 00:23:03.047\nthose particular scopes and that's it.\n\n408\n00:23:03.047 --> 00:23:06.997\nNow, in my case, I only have one,\nso it really doesn't matter.\n\n409\n00:23:06.997 --> 00:23:14.197\nThe -leases, well, if that 2012 server\nhad existing leases for that scope.\n\n410\n00:23:14.197 --> 00:23:16.848\nAnd I wanted to make sure to\nbring those leases with me or\n\n411\n00:23:16.848 --> 00:23:19.510\nin the import process\ncuzthey're part of the export.\n\n412\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.179\nBut if I wanted to bring him in\nthrough the import, I can do -leases.\n\n413\n00:23:23.179 --> 00:23:28.911\nIf I leave that off, it's not gonna\nbring any current lease information.\n\n414\n00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:31.305\nI don't have any, so\nI'm gonna leave that off, as well.\n\n415\n00:23:31.305 --> 00:23:35.756\nAnd we're simply gonna hit enter and\nlet it go through the process.\n\n416\n00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.253\nIt tells me that it will\nbe imported in Server 1.\n\n417\n00:23:38.253 --> 00:23:39.958\nDo you want to perform this action?\n\n418\n00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:41.469\nYes, I do.\n\n419\n00:23:41.469 --> 00:23:42.348\nSo Y for yes.\n\n420\n00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:49.287\nAnd no red text is always\na good thing from PowerShell.\n\n421\n00:23:49.287 --> 00:23:53.004\nHad somebody tell me one time that they\njust changed their default colors on\n\n422\n00:23:53.004 --> 00:23:55.719\ntheir PowerShell, so\nthe errors were no longer red and\n\n423\n00:23:55.719 --> 00:23:57.857\nmy statement didn't work anymore [LAUGH].\n\n424\n00:23:57.857 --> 00:24:00.465\nAll right, it's there but\nRonnie I don't see it.\n\n425\n00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:01.137\nWhat happened?\n\n426\n00:24:01.137 --> 00:24:01.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n427\n00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.772\n&gt;&gt; Let's try to refresh that.\n\n428\n00:24:03.772 --> 00:24:05.540\n&gt;&gt; Llook at that.\n\n429\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.374\n&gt;&gt; And look it there.\n\n430\n00:24:06.374 --> 00:24:09.948\nThere is my DevSubnet,\nmy address pool is there.\n\n431\n00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.235\nI don't think I configured any options,\nbut\n\n432\n00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:15.800\nif there were any options on that subnet,\nthat would be there as well.\n\n433\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.718\nSo, really start to see how easy they\nmake it to work with a little bit of\n\n434\n00:24:18.718 --> 00:24:19.564\nplanning, right?\n\n435\n00:24:19.564 --> 00:24:23.580\nSetting up a couple of folders,\nmaking sure I copied it over.\n\n436\n00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.084\nAnd then, learning a couple of those\ncommands we can move DHCP from one server\n\n437\n00:24:28.084 --> 00:24:30.043\nto the other pretty painlessly.\n\n438\n00:24:30.043 --> 00:24:34.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Mike well thank you\nagain for showing us this idea of being\n\n439\n00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:39.413\nable to migrate different types of roles\nover using DHCP as one of the primary ones\n\n440\n00:24:39.413 --> 00:24:43.845\nbecause that one seems to be a good one\nthat has to be changed a lot of times,\n\n441\n00:24:43.845 --> 00:24:47.236\nespecially when your\norganization continues to grow.\n\n442\n00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:51.497\nYou tend to move off of those different\nservers that have multiple roles on\n\n443\n00:24:51.497 --> 00:24:54.258\nthem and\nthen move them off to dedicated roles.\n\n444\n00:24:54.258 --> 00:24:55.182\nA lot of times that helps.\n\n445\n00:24:55.182 --> 00:24:59.513\nAnd a lot of times of course then also the\ninfrastructure that's a little bit older\n\n446\n00:24:59.513 --> 00:25:02.356\ntends to get moved last\nbecause it's still working.\n\n447\n00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:04.432\nThis is one way you can\nalso do this as well.\n\n448\n00:25:04.432 --> 00:25:07.018\nSo there is a bit of setup to do.\n\n449\n00:25:07.018 --> 00:25:08.725\nOnce you actually get that set down.\n\n450\n00:25:08.725 --> 00:25:13.598\nyou see how easy Mike did migrate it using\nboth power shell aswell as the old net sh\n\n451\n00:25:13.598 --> 00:25:14.338\ncommands.\n\n452\n00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:17.188\nAnd of course,\nlike everything else on Microsoft exams,\n\n453\n00:25:17.188 --> 00:25:19.874\nyou're likely to see those\nmore often then you think.\n\n454\n00:25:19.874 --> 00:25:24.064\nDon't just get used to doing everything in\nthe GUI, but in this instance, you can't.\n\n455\n00:25:24.064 --> 00:25:28.060\nSo, make sure you actually do practice the\nidea of using these different commands.\n\n456\n00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.625\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n457\n00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:35.160\nSigning off for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n458\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.975\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n459\n00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:40.557\n&gt;&gt; Stay

00:00:08.188\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:10.626\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n\n5\n00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:12.244\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.917\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:16.550\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n8\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.330\nand today we're taking a look at\nNetworking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n9\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.390\nWe're specifically gonna be taking\na look at the idea of maintaining and\n\n10\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.000\nof course managing DHCP, and\n\n11\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.820\nhere to help us out is going to be our\nDHCP master himself, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.733\nMike, welcome back to the studios.\n\n13\n00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.744\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie,\nglad to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.170\nAnd you are right, continuing the DHCP.\n\n15\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.508\nAnd we've seen how to install it,\nconfigure scopes, get it up and\n\n16\n00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.559\nrunning and once it's up and\nrunning now what do we do right?\n\n17\n00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.579\nWe just put it in the corner and forget\nabout it, let it go it should be fine.\n\n18\n00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.499\nNo, one of the things about DHCP\nit is a relatively simple service.\n\n19\n00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.050\nWhen it comes to getting it set up,\nyou create your scopes,\n\n20\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.690\neverything kinda happens automatically.\n\n21\n00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.820\nThe clients reach out,\nthey get their IP address.\n\n22\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.600\nI mean that's what we like about DHCP,\nit automates that tedious task of\n\n23\n00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200\ndistributing, assigning\nTCP/IP configuration.\n\n24\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.530\nBut, because it is a very dynamic\nenvironment, things change all the time.\n\n25\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.090\nClients have to renew leases,\nthings like that.\n\n26\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.890\nWe really have to make sure we're\nmonitoring it and making sure that it's\n\n27\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.380\nperforming adequately,\nthat our scopes aren't' getting depleted.\n\n28\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.790\nSo it's not a set it and\nforget it type thing.\n\n29\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.910\nIt doesn't take a huge amount of effort,\nbut if we stay on top of it,\n\n30\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.580\nit keeps it pretty straight forward.\n\n31\n00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.083\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\nSo, understanding that concept in that\n\n32\n00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:43.386\nidea, this is our first time working with\nDHCP, are there some certain elements that\n\n33\n00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.185\nwe just need to make sure that happens\nin this idea of the maintenance part.\n\n34\n00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:51.506\nAnd there's just like a step one, two,\nthree and four that we have to do or\n\n35\n00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:55.780\nthis just really general ideas of you\nmight need to consider doing this.\n\n36\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.945\n&gt;&gt; It really is kinda general\nideas on how I can make sure that,\n\n37\n00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:03.720\none everything's working correctly and\nflowing smoothly, and\n\n38\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.560\nthat in the event that something does\ngo wrong, I can easily fix it, right?\n\n39\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.620\nI can get back to a known good point.\n\n40\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.340\nSo it's gonna be relatively simple things\nlike making sure we've got a backup right?\n\n41\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.380\nOf that DHCP information.\n\n42\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.780\nAnd making sure that we can restore\nthat backup, that everything is working.\n\n43\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.120\nAnd we should be backing up our server\naltogether, and we'll get a little bit,\n\n44\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.380\nwe'll do some demonstrations here\non backing up and restoring.\n\n45\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.460\nOther things we might work on\nRonnie are lease information.\n\n46\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.760\nWe haven't spent a lot of\ntime talking about the lease.\n\n47\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.260\nSo let's start there.\n\n48\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.540\nWe've already seen how a client gets\nan IP address from that DHCP server,\n\n49\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.870\nand not just the IP address,\nDHCP is fantastic.\n\n50\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.616\nIt can pass out IP address, subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, DNS server information,\n\n51\n00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:50.684\nwindserver address,\nnet BIOS node type, DNS suffix.\n\n52\n00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:52.483\nI mean the list goes on and on, right?\n\n53\n00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:58.520\nSo DHCP can provide a wealth of\nconfiguration to those client machines.\n\n54\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.342\nWhen that client gets that information,\n\n55\n00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:02.433\ngets the IP address that\nit's supposed to use.\n\n56\n00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:05.930\nDoes that last step of Dora,\nthe acknowledgement.\n\n57\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.130\nOkay, this is now my address,\nI can start using it.\n\n58\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.040\nIt's not a permanent assignment right?\n\n59\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.860\nThe client doesn't get to\nuse that IP address forever.\n\n60\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.041\nIt's leased just like\nwhen you go lease a car,\n\n61\n00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:21.132\nyou have to regularly renew that lease or\ngive the car back.\n\n62\n00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:24.050\nAnd that's the same thing that's\ngonna happen with these IP addresses.\n\n63\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.660\nWhen a client gets an IP address it's\nleased for a certain duration and\n\n64\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.050\nthen either the client has to renew\nthe lease before it expires or\n\n65\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.780\nat the end of the lease, the address\nis removed or it's pulled back.\n\n66\n00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.005\nAnd I will say that doesn't reach out and\ntake it away from the client, but\n\n67\n00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:42.742\nDHCP on its end says,\nthis guy never did renew.\n\n68\n00:03:42.742 --> 00:03:46.960\nI'm gonna put it back in the pool so\nthat I can give it to another client.\n\n69\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.189\n&gt;&gt; Now MIke,\nspeaking of the idea of leases here,\n\n70\n00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.219\nMicrosoft by default leases it for\na particular period of time.\n\n71\n00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.354\nCan you remind us of what that time is and\n\n72\n00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:58.710\nis there possibly a reason when we might\nchange that or why we might change that?\n\n73\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.023\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question and\nabsolutely, that's on of the things we\n\n74\n00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:05.161\nneed to talk about in our And\nwhen we talk about planning this out,\n\n75\n00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.151\nthe least duration by default\nis eight days for the most part.\n\n76\n00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:09.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Say wait,\n\n77\n00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:12.251\nhow can I have a default\nthat's like some of the time?\n\n78\n00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:16.198\nIt really depends on how you\ncreate the scope, it'll change.\n\n79\n00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:19.968\nWhen you go through the initial\ninstallation of DHCP, you can create\n\n80\n00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:24.650\na scope during that installation and\nI believe there it defaults to eight days.\n\n81\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.270\nOther wizards if you go in and\nright click new scope\n\n82\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.080\nsometimes you'll see different options for\nwired versus wireless.\n\n83\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.080\nIt's six days I think for\nthe wireless and eight for wired.\n\n84\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.680\nBut really just think of eight days.\n\n85\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.320\nIf you remember eight days you're\nfine on any exam for the most part.\n\n86\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.480\nSo that is the default, eight days, which\nshould cover a work week plus one right.\n\n87\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.177\nSo that next day,\nMonday you know the client can come in and\n\n88\n00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:51.010\nstill has a chance to renew that lease.\n\n89\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.582\nNow Ronnie brought up a great question,\nshould we ever change that and\n\n90\n00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:58.770\nwe have to think about\nwhy we'd wanna change it.\n\n91\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.530\nRight, what would be the advantage?\n\n92\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.750\nShould we make it longer?\n\n93\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.360\nShould we make it shorter?\n\n94\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.110\nAnd if so why?\n\n95\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.080\nAnd what we have to think about is,\n\n96\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.180\nhow many addresses do I\nhave available in my pool?\n\n97\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.740\nHow many nodes do I have that\nare gonna need IP addresses?\n\n98\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.150\nAnd how dynamic is that, right?\n\n99\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.590\nIf I have a relatively static environment,\nin other words, my corporation,\n\n100\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.690\nwe've got 100, 200 nodes in here,\nbut they're all desktop machines,\n\n101\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.440\nthey're never disconnected\nfrom the network.\n\n102\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.550\nI might think about actually making\nthat lease a little bit longer.\n\n103\n00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.560\nBecause the way the renewal process works\nis, a client at 50% of the lease duration.\n\n104\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.820\nSo if it's an eight day lease,\n\n105\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.685\nthat would be on day four the client\nis gonna begin the renewal process.\n\n106\n00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:45.787\nDoesn't wait till the very\nlast minute like I might do.\n\n107\n00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:47.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n108\n00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:51.205\nthen run the risk of the car\ngetting taken back from you anyway.\n\n109\n00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.255\nThe client says, hey, at 50%,\nI'm gonna go ahead and renew my lease.\n\n110\n00:05:54.255 --> 00:06:00.015\nThe DHCP server should respond, give\nthem a renewal, a new eight day window.\n\n111\n00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:02.473\nBut the client again, four days later,\ntries to renew that lease.\n\n112\n00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:07.500\n[COUGH] Excuse me, so that's\nbasically the process we go through.\n\n113\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.099\nSo that's traffic that the DHCP\nserver has to deal with.\n\n114\n00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.218\nAnd if we multiply that by\nhundreds of clients, right, or\n\n115\n00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:18.105\nlarger corporate environments,\nthousands and thousands of clients,\n\n116\n00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:23.130\nthat's a lot of renewal traffic going to\nthat DHCP server that it's gotta handle.\n\n117\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.280\nSo if I make that lease longer If I say,\nyou know what,\n\n118\n00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.540\nwe're gonna lease it out for 15 days,\nnow all of sudden, the clients are only\n\n119\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.200\ncontacting DHCP every seven and\na half days to renew their lease, right?\n\n120\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.480\nSo, I've reduced the amount of\ntimes the clients of the nodes\n\n121\n00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.820\nhave to talk to the DHCP server,\nreduced the workload on the DHCP server.\n\n122\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.429\nSo, that's great.\n\n123\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.450\nIf you've got a very static environment.\n\n124\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.730\nWhat about scenarios where it's not so\nstatic.\n\n125\n00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.610\nWe have a mix of desktops.\n\n126\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.590\nBut we also have a lot of laptop sales\npeople that come in on Monday morning.\n\n127\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.926\nThey log into the network,\nthey get all their information they need.\n\n128\n00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:02.701\nThen they take off for\nthe day, or even for the week.\n\n129\n00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:05.660\nAnd they don't ever connect\nback to the network.\n\n130\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.520\nWell, think about what's happening\nwith that IP address, all right?\n\n131\n00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.820\nI come in on Monday morning,\nI hook up my laptop to the network.\n\n132\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.820\nIt calls up DHCP, it gets an IP address,\nDHCP says here's your address,\n\n133\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.480\nit's good for eight days.\n\n134\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.430\nAll right, now I leave Monday right\nafter lunch and I hit the road.\n\n135\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.929\nAnd I'm on a two week trip, sales trip.\n\n136\n00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:29.403\nDHCP doesn't know that so\nin its database it says this address\n\n137\n00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:33.543\nwas leased out to this client for\neight days, all right.\n\n138\n00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:37.283\nI've left after,\nbefore the first day is even over but\n\n139\n00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:42.829\nthe DHCP server cant use that address for\nanybody else until that lease expires.\n\n140\n00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:43.633\nHe is waiting and\n\n141\n00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.743\nwaiting and waiting to see if I am\ngoing to try to renew the lease.\n\n142\n00:07:46.743 --> 00:07:50.227\nAt the end of the eight days it\ncould put it back in the pool but\n\n143\n00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:53.250\nthere was seven days that\nthat address was locked.\n\n144\n00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.380\nCouldn't be used by anybody else and\n\n145\n00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.960\nwasn't being used by the original\nlessee of that IP address.\n\n146\n00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.026\nSo, and then you talked about laptops,\nor not laptops, but\n\n147\n00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:06.150\ntablets, and phones, and things like this.\n\n148\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.280\nAnd you realize, when Ronnie walks in,\nhe doesn't get one IP address.\n\n149\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.250\nHe gets one for his laptop,\none for his tablet, one for\n\n150\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.250\nhis phone, one for\nhis iWatch, one for his shoes\n\n151\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.210\nthat are connected to his iWatch via his\nBluetooth headset that also need one.\n\n152\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.235\nNow, I know a lot of these\nthings are private addresses.\n\n153\n00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:24.910\nBut you get the idea,\nit's not just one to one anymore.\n\n154\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.970\nAnd so, all of a sudden,\nmy pool of addresses can be,\n\n155\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.015\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n156\n00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:34.931\nAre used up very quickly by devices that\ndon't really need those addresses anymore.\n\n157\n00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.161\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I do understand that because\nlike right here at ITPro.TV, even though\n\n158\n00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:43.790\nwe don't tend to actually renew a lot of\nleases in the regular business office.\n\n159\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.850\nWe do provide a guest wireless network.\n\n160\n00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.170\nAnd if we think about that idea,\nthe guest wireless network,\n\n161\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.960\nwe don't have a gigantic pool\nof leases that we hand out, but\n\n162\n00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.790\nwe expect for people and vendors to\ncome in and they might say, hey,\n\n163\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.600\ndo you have access to, or\ncan I get access to wireless?\n\n164\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.380\nWe, of course, want them to be\nable to get access to wireless.\n\n165\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.940\nBut we don't want them to get\nassigned an IP address for\n\n166\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.390\nsix days, that would be silly.\n\n167\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.140\nSo, our lease period actually\nis incredibly small.\n\n168\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.000\nI think we normally set it for\ntwo hours right now.\n\n169\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.870\nAnd that allows them to say, hey, look,\nwhen they're actually on the network for\n\n170\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.710\ntwo hours, they'll have an IP address.\n\n171\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.580\nAnd it'll renew about 50% of\nthe time that they stay longer.\n\n172\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.680\nBut then after two hours, in other words,\nif they leave after 30 minutes,\n\n173\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.520\nwe know in an hour and a half,\nthat address is going to be available.\n\n174\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.120\nSo, it makes those\naddresses available again.\n\n175\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.960\nThat's actually one of\nthe powerful arguments for\n\n176\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.690\nusing DHCP, because if not, your\nstatically assigning them and somebody\n\n177\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.330\nactually takes all of the addresses, well,\nthere you go, you have all that then.\n\n178\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.320\nJust kind of realize that it is a powerful\nway that you can control that, and\n\n179\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.390\nif you start running that out of them,\njust like what Mike was saying, right?\n\n180\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.660\nYou wanna reduce the actual lease time,\nbut if you know that you've got a fairly\n\n181\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.450\nstatic environment, keeping it longer,\nkeeping the leases longer, is probably\n\n182\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.190\ngonna help you save a little bit of\nperformance or taxing on your servers.\n\n183\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.940\nSo it's a great environment to be in,\nokay?\n\n184\n00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.160\n&gt;&gt; It really is, yes.\n\n185\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.490\nThe biggest thing you can do is monitor,\nright?\n\n186\n00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.200\nLook at your DHCP console, it's gonna\nshow you how many leases are out there.\n\n187\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.040\nYou can get statistics on DHCP,\n\n188\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.080\nand see what percentage of\nthat scope is being used.\n\n189\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.970\nAnd as Ronnie said,\nif we're running out of IP addresses,\n\n190\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.960\nwe need to determine why,\nare these clients that are coming in,\n\n191\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.580\ngetting an IP address\nnever to be seen again?\n\n192\n00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.190\nOr have we added a bunch of nodes, and\n\n193\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.490\nmaybe my pool was just too\nsmall in the first place.\n\n194\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.070\nMaybe I need to make\nanother class c scope and\n\n195\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.790\ndo a superscope to increase the amount\nof addresses available in the pool.\n\n196\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.560\nBut if it's primarily dynamic stuff,\npeople coming in,\n\n197\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.190\nwe get a lot of visitors,\na lot of phones that are connecting.\n\n198\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.640\nThen adding addresses is really\njust masking the problem, and\n\n199\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.630\nit's just going to run out again,\nso then a shorter lease duration.\n\n200\n00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.757\nKeep in mind, however,\nthe shorter the lease duration gets,\n\n201\n00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:58.881\nthe more traffic DHCP is going to receive.\n\n202\n00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:02.304\nBecause as Ronnie said on our guest\nnetwork, every hour that somebody's\n\n203\n00:11:02.304 --> 00:11:05.339\nconnected to our network,\nthey're talking to our DHCP server,\n\n204\n00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:08.760\nbecause they've gotta renew at 50%,\nthey get a two hour lease again,\n\n205\n00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.470\nthey get that renewal, but\none hour later, they're renewing.\n\n206\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.960\nNow, if we only have 20\npeople in our network, yes,\n\n207\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.110\nat one time, that's not a big deal.\n\n208\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.780\nIf we had thousands, that's a lot of\ntraffic hitting that DHCP server,\n\n209\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.779\nso those are the kinds of\nthings you wanna think about.\n\n210\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.030\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Mike, let's go ahead and\ntake a look then at about\n\n211\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.960\nwhere we would end up trying to be\nable to see and change that list.\n\n212\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.520\nCuz even though I know\nthat I can change it,\n\n213\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.030\nit doesn't necessarily mean I\nknow exactly where to change it.\n\n214\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.260\nSo, Mike, show us where we are gonna\nbe able to change this thing.\n\n215\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n216\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.640\nI've got that DHCP console opened up,\nand I've got one scope created.\n\n217\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.100\nBut first, I want to show you,\nwhen we create a new scope.\n\n218\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.860\nI'm gonna right click on IPB4 and\nchoose New Scope.\n\n219\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.380\nAnd I'll click Next on our wizard.\n\n220\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.110\nI'll give it a name.\n\n221\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.420\nWe'll call this one just Test for now.\n\n222\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.225\nWe'll click Next, and we'll make\nup a nice easy address to type in.\n\n223\n00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:09.265\n.1 through 10.0.101.50.\n\n224\n00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:11.758\nMy subnet mask should be.\n\n225\n00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:13.244\nLet's do 16.\n\n226\n00:12:13.244 --> 00:12:15.578\nOkay, again, this is not important here.\n\n227\n00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:20.990\nBut it is important if it conflicts with\nan existing scope, that would not be good.\n\n228\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.937\nSo let's change that, I have 172.16.\n\n229\n00:12:23.937 --> 00:12:27.700\nAnd we'll change that up to 172.16.\n\n230\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.047\nOops, 16.\n\n231\n00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:33.170\nAnd we'll give that, yeah,\nwe can still use 255, that'll work.\n\n232\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.565\nWe'll click Next.\n\n233\n00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:36.390\nI'm not worried about any exclusions.\n\n234\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.580\nHere is the screen I wanted to get to.\n\n235\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.150\nLeast Duration, all right?\n\n236\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.785\nNotice what the default value is,\nif you guys can see that there.\n\n237\n00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:44.840\n8 days is the default.\n\n238\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.640\nBut I can go down to Hours and\nMinutes, right?\n\n239\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.666\nSo we can get really, really short.\n\n240\n00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:52.740\nKeep in mind, [LAUGH] that's\na lot of traffic in your server.\n\n241\n00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.880\nSo that's the default,\nthen if I just click Next,\n\n242\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.330\nNext, Next through there,\nthen that's what I'm gonna get.\n\n243\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.280\nIf I already know, I've planned this out,\nI know this is a guest network for\n\n244\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.750\nprimarily wireless clients, I might wanna\nshorten that up to a few hours, all right,\n\n245\n00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.680\nor a day.\n\n246\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.620\nMaybe I wanna give them a day, and\n\n247\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.740\nthat way tomorrow that address is\navailable if they don't come back.\n\n248\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.140\nSo, however you want to set that up.\n\n249\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.180\nSo, that's one place you can set the lease\nis during the creation of the scope.\n\n250\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.270\nWhat if the scope is already created?\n\n251\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.617\nWell, we simply go back to\nthe properties of the scope, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:29.360\nAnd right down here at the bottom, I've\ngot my options to change that same value.\n\n253\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.400\nYou also have a new option where\nyou already have an existing scope,\n\n254\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.080\nunlimited, right?\n\n255\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.491\nSo again, in a very,\nvery static environment,\n\n256\n00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.749\nmaybe I've got a scope that's just for\nmy servers, right?\n\n257\n00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:45.880\nAnd think, Mike, who uses DHCP on servers?\n\n258\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.470\nRemember, we talked about that.\n\n259\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.040\nWe said that I can use reservations\n\n260\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.600\nto make sure that server always gets\nthe same IP address, but the rest of\n\n261\n00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.250\nthe information can still be dynamically\nmanage, that's a very good thing.\n\n262\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.972\nPrinters and things like that, might want\nto, have them get the same IP address\n\n263\n00:14:01.972 --> 00:14:05.210\nevery time, but\ndynamically manage the rest of it.\n\n264\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.240\nAnd so, we could change this to unlimited.\n\n265\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.200\nThe problem with doing that is they\ndo not know how to renew, they\n\n266\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.610\nare not going to come and get that new\ninformation if something were to change.\n\n267\n00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.111\nSo, it's kind of a strange scenario.\n\n268\n00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:25.137\nYou end up there, you are trying to keep\nit dynamic, yet you are telling him its\n\n269\n00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:28.492\nan unlimited, so do not know if\nthat one is used all that much, but\n\n270\n00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:31.481\nI can see a couple scenarios\nwhere that might be useful, so\n\n271\n00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:33.330\nthat's where you can change that.\n\n272\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.490\nAll right, so leases, again,\nthe main thing is to know for\n\n273\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.980\nthe exam anyway that\ndefault is eight days.\n\n274\n00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:46.030\nAnd for setting it up, it's planning,\nit's thinking about monitoring your\n\n275\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.950\nDHCP servers, thinking about what type of\nclients you're dealing with, whether or\n\n276\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.010\nnot they're gonna be coming and going from\nthe network, wanting to be able to free up\n\n277\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.650\nthose addresses, or not wanting\nto increase the size of my pool\n\n278\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:03.280\nof addresses I can use that lease duration\nto free up those addresses quicker.\n\n279\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, so\n\n280\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.110\nnow that we understand a bit more about\nthe idea of how we can manipulate and\n\n281\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.400\nchange that idea,\nat least help us maintain what we need to.\n\n282\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.390\nWe also want to talk about the idea\nof backup and restoring DHCP.\n\n283\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.690\nNow Mike,\nif it's as dynamic as you're saying it is,\n\n284\n00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.640\nit doesn't really need to be managed so\nmuch, and it can create things on the fly.\n\n285\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.736\nSo, if new people come on,\nthey get IP addresses,\n\n286\n00:15:26.736 --> 00:15:30.624\nthey get options in terms of\nthe default gateway, DNS servers,\n\n287\n00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:33.878\nwhy do I need to back this\nthing up if it can hand it out?\n\n288\n00:15:33.878 --> 00:15:34.555\n&gt;&gt; You don't.\n\n289\n00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:35.808\n[LAUGH] We just don't back it up.\n\n290\n00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:37.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there you go.\n\n291\n00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:39.608\n&gt;&gt; Or him.\n&gt;&gt; Now, because this is [LAUGH] that would\n\n292\n00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:41.040\nbe incorrect, right?\n\n293\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.030\nBecause it is so dynamic, and things are\nchanging all the time, we've gotta make\n\n294\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.630\nsure that we, I don't know if it's so much\nthat as, what if DHCP wasn't available?\n\n295\n00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.204\nWhat happens to your nodes if\nthey can't get an IP address?\n\n296\n00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.399\nAnd Ronnie,\nI know you know the answer to that one,\n\n297\n00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:59.019\nwhat happens if I haul around and\nI can't find a DHCP server?\n\n298\n00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:01.409\nCuz the database is corrupt,\nand the service didn't start?\n\n299\n00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:04.899\nNormally, on a Windows Client, you're\ngonna end up getting an APIPA address,\n\n300\n00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:07.080\nI believe is what you're\nanswer is looking for?\n\n301\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.908\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n302\n00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:09.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And with APIPA,\n\n303\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.113\nwhat can I communicate with?\n\n304\n00:16:10.113 --> 00:16:13.399\n&gt;&gt; Other APIPA addresses\nwhich means really not a lot.\n\n305\n00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:17.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, all the other devices\nalso could not get an IP address.\n\n306\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.030\nYou're kind of in this little group of,\nwe need help, we're stuck out here.\n\n307\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.866\nThough Microsoft will tell you that\nyou can run a network on APIPA, but\n\n308\n00:16:25.866 --> 00:16:28.086\nthat's another story for another day.\n\n309\n00:16:28.086 --> 00:16:29.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is true, but\n\n310\n00:16:29.592 --> 00:16:31.440\nthat's for another lesson.\n\n311\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.263\nSo yeah, if DHCP's unavailable,\nbecause it's very dynamic or\n\n312\n00:16:35.263 --> 00:16:39.170\nI won't say because it's dynamic,\nbut because we rely on that,\n\n313\n00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.780\nwe've taken the configuration part and\nwe've made this service take it over.\n\n314\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.690\nIf that goes down, all of a sudden\nwe're gonna have problems, right?\n\n315\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.400\nNow keep in mind with DHCP,\none of the interesting things about it,\n\n316\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.450\nbecause it is a lease,\nif DHCP crashes right now, it's\n\n317\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.030\nnot like every node on the network all of\na sudden can't communicate anymore, right?\n\n318\n00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.400\nI've got my lease on my car,\nI'm driving my car.\n\n319\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.690\nThe company that I lease it from just had\nan accident, a fire, something there.\n\n320\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.361\nMy car doesn't go poof and\ngo back to the leaser.\n\n321\n00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.239\nThe lessor, the leaser or\nthe lessor, right?\n\n322\n00:17:13.239 --> 00:17:15.677\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't bother me.\n\n323\n00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:17.832\nAs long as they're back up by\nthe time I have to pay my next bill,\n\n324\n00:17:17.832 --> 00:17:18.616\neverything's good.\n\n325\n00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:21.560\nAnd so, it's the same thing with DHCP.\n\n326\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.170\nIf the DHCP server goes down,\nthe client's already got a lease.\n\n327\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.092\nSo as long as the DHCP server's back up\nby the time the client needs to renew,\n\n328\n00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:32.140\nthat client's gonna be okay.\n\n329\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.910\nSo it's not widespread\npanic across your network.\n\n330\n00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.640\nBut any new devices that are coming\ninto your network are gonna be\n\n331\n00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.650\nunable to obtain information.\n\n332\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.660\nRenewers, they wouldn't be able to renew,\nbut that's okay.\n\n333\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.770\nThey did it so early at 50%,\nthey still have 50% of their lease.\n\n334\n00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.190\nThey can try again and\n\n335\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.710\nhopefully by the time before they run out,\nDHCP's back up and running.\n\n336\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.150\nSo we need to be able to back it up.\n\n337\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.124\nWe need to back it up and\nrestore it because, one,\n\n338\n00:17:57.124 --> 00:17:59.527\nwe've got a lot of time spent\nin the configuration, right?\n\n339\n00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:02.195\nOnce we've got all of those\nscopes created, once we've got\n\n340\n00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:05.597\nall of our options set, once we've got\nour lease durations configured out,\n\n341\n00:18:05.597 --> 00:18:07.690\nwe don't wanna have to do that again.\n\n342\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.150\nSo if that database becomes corrupt or so\nif we have to rebuild that machine because\n\n343\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.320\nof hardware failure,\ndo I have this stuff documented?\n\n344\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.415\nI sure hope so.\n\n345\n00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:19.670\nBut it's gonna be a lot easier\njust to restore from backup\n\n346\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.600\nthan to try to reconfigure everything.\n\n347\n00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.280\nSo as any other backup solution,\nit's a disaster recovery type solution.\n\n348\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.460\nIt's, what if something goes wrong?\n\n349\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.880\nHow do I get back to a good working spot?\n\n350\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.740\nSo we need to back it up.\n\n351\n00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.105\nCool thing about DHCP is it\nbacks itself up automatically.\n\n352\n00:18:38.105 --> 00:18:40.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know I told you DHCP\n\n353\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.080\nis a really good service, right?\n\n354\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.676\nIt backs itself up automatically.\n\n355\n00:18:44.676 --> 00:18:50.455\nFor the exam, understand it's 60 minutes\nor every hour that is configurable.\n\n356\n00:18:50.455 --> 00:18:53.415\nAnd I'll show you where to do\nthat here in just a second.\n\n357\n00:18:53.415 --> 00:18:56.475\nSo DHCP backs itself up every hour.\n\n358\n00:18:57.735 --> 00:19:01.285\nAnd if the DHCP server\nrestarts because of an update,\n\n359\n00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:02.825\nbecause you've rebooted that system.\n\n360\n00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:06.885\nAnd if the DHCP database is corrupt or\nit cannot access it,\n\n361\n00:19:06.885 --> 00:19:12.500\nit will automatically grab the last\nbackup that it did automatically.\n\n362\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.110\nOverwrite the corrupt database,\nreplace it and restart the service.\n\n363\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.900\nAnd resume going,\nas long as that's reachable, right?\n\n364\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.056\nSo, how's that for cool?\n\n365\n00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:21.797\n&gt;&gt; That is cool.\n\n366\n00:19:21.797 --> 00:19:25.587\n&gt;&gt; Got a system that backs itself up and\nrestores itself in the event of a problem.\n\n367\n00:19:25.587 --> 00:19:26.628\nThat's cool.\n\n368\n00:19:26.628 --> 00:19:29.102\n&gt;&gt; That sounds really\nlike a great feature but,\n\n369\n00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:31.902\nMike, even though there's\nan automatic backup,\n\n370\n00:19:31.902 --> 00:19:35.762\nI'm assuming that there is way that\nwe can also manually back this up.\n\n371\n00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:36.413\n&gt;&gt; There is and\n\n372\n00:19:36.413 --> 00:19:41.040\nyou definitely should because let's\ntalk about the automatic backup.\n\n373\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.300\nThat automatic backup that it does, it's\nstoring it on the same drive by default.\n\n374\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.120\nNow, we can move that and we probably\nshould move that to another drive, but\n\n375\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.340\nit can't be a network location.\n\n376\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.730\nIt's gonna be on that physical machine,\nall right?\n\n377\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.470\nSo by default, same drive means\nif I have a hard drive failure,\n\n378\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.540\nI lost the database and\nthe backup of the database.\n\n379\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.420\nThat's not gonna do me any good, right?\n\n380\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.950\nSo we might wanna change\nthat default location.\n\n381\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.486\nCorrupt data, if it's not a database\nfailure, if the data in it,\n\n382\n00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:14.029\nlike somebody deletes a scope,\nwell, what it we don't get to it?\n\n383\n00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:17.464\nWhat if we don't realize it before\nthe next hour, that backup data, then,\n\n384\n00:20:17.464 --> 00:20:19.245\nis gonna be without the scope, right?\n\n385\n00:20:19.245 --> 00:20:23.537\nI need to be able to back this database\nup and store it somewhere else,\n\n386\n00:20:23.537 --> 00:20:26.349\non a different physical server,\non a share,\n\n387\n00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:29.940\nmaybe even offsite if we\nwanna go to those extremes.\n\n388\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.372\nSo that in the event of a major\nhardware failure or data corruption,\n\n389\n00:20:34.372 --> 00:20:35.549\nI can restore it.\n\n390\n00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:37.448\nSo we need to be able to set that up.\n\n391\n00:20:37.448 --> 00:20:40.499\nSo let's take a look at\nhow we can do that I'm\n\n392\n00:20:40.499 --> 00:20:43.572\ngonna up my again my\nDHCP console opened up.\n\n393\n00:20:43.572 --> 00:20:47.630\nAnd we'll pull up the properties\nof the server itself, all right?\n\n394\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.164\nAnd on this one tab called Advanced,\n\n395\n00:20:50.164 --> 00:20:53.860\nwe will see where the database\nis located by default.\n\n396\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.530\nThat's the actual database that's in use,\ndhcp.ndb, a Windows system 32.\n\n397\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.160\nThe backup path,\nWindows\\system32\\dhcp backup.\n\n398\n00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.260\nSo in the folder that contains the\ndatabase is another folder called Backup,\n\n399\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.840\nand that's where the backup is.\n\n400\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.510\nDefinitely wanna change that, right?\n\n401\n00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.570\nCuz you've got a separate physical drive\nin the system, that's where you should\n\n402\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.970\nmove that to so that way if I lose one,\nI don't lose both of them.\n\n403\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.340\nAgain, if it becomes corrupt,\n\n404\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.860\nit'll automatically restore from\nthat backup that it's creating.\n\n405\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.200\nBut to Ronnie's point, yes Sir?\n\n406\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.272\n&gt;&gt; So when start to think about that,\nwhat you're actually showing us is where\n\n407\n00:21:32.272 --> 00:21:34.880\nit automatically would\nactually do the backup.\n\n408\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.630\nBut then, we can actually just change\nthe path of the automatic backup as well.\n\n409\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.410\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n410\n00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.058\n&gt;&gt; We can.\n\n411\n00:21:40.058 --> 00:21:41.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the first step\n\n412\n00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:41.880\nyou should do.\n\n413\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.800\nWhen you're setting up the DHCP and you're\nplanning out your disaster recovery and\n\n414\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.640\nyour full tolerance,\nwell first thing I would do,\n\n415\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.700\nIs try to move that default\nlocation to another physical drive.\n\n416\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.990\nEverything will work the same,\nit'll backup automatically,\n\n417\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.590\nit'll restore automatically.\n\n418\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.780\nBut it's not on the same physical.\n\n419\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.140\nAlthough when you stop and think about it,\n\n420\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.200\nthat physical drive failed that\nhad my original database on it.\n\n421\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.146\nThe backup's on another drive,\nso I still have it.\n\n422\n00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:09.847\nIt's not gonna be able to\nautomatically restore, right,\n\n423\n00:22:09.847 --> 00:22:11.747\nbecause that physical drive has failed.\n\n424\n00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:16.019\nBut at least I've got a copy of that\nbackup that once I get the drive replaced,\n\n425\n00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:20.070\nget DHCP reinstalled, I can simply\nrestore it and we're good to go.\n\n426\n00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.830\nSo that setting I just showed you\nis just for the automatic backup.\n\n427\n00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.668\nNow, we can also manually back it up.\n\n428\n00:22:26.668 --> 00:22:31.490\nWe can right-click on that server and\nI can choose to Backup, and\n\n429\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.210\nI can pick a location.\n\n430\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.371\nNow this is, again, going to be\na local location, unless you've got\n\n431\n00:22:37.371 --> 00:22:42.113\na mapped network drive, in which case I\ncould back up to a mapped network drive.\n\n432\n00:22:42.113 --> 00:22:43.748\nSo it's a very manual process.\n\n433\n00:22:43.748 --> 00:22:47.700\nYou just right-click, choose Backup,\ngive it a destination and\n\n434\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.520\nit backs it up, and it doesn't interfere\nwith the normal hourly schedule.\n\n435\n00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.920\nThis is for that offsite backup or\n\n436\n00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.480\nthe off-machine backup that I\nwanna store on a network share.\n\n437\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.420\nSo if I lose the entire machine,\nI've got that backup.\n\n438\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.770\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, so now that we\nunderstand that a backup is essential and\n\n439\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.720\nsomething that we know\nhappens automatically,\n\n440\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.260\nit's something that we also know\nthat we can do it manually.\n\n441\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.700\nMike, how often should I do this?\n\n442\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.610\nBecause if we think about it, right,\nis this something I can do once a month,\n\n443\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.260\nonce a year or\ndo I need to think about like once a day?\n\n444\n00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.590\n&gt;&gt; Really depends on your environment.\n\n445\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.280\nI mean, how dynamic is it?\n\n446\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.480\nWe talked about that with scopes and\nit really has the same thing.\n\n447\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.780\nIt's really the same thing when\nit comes to backing this up.\n\n448\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.740\nHow much can you afford to lose, right?\n\n449\n00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:36.170\nIf you're adding scopes all the time, then\nmaybe I need to back it up once a day or\n\n450\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.290\nonce a week manually and\ntake that offsite.\n\n451\n00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.560\nIf nothing is really changing in there,\n\n452\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.670\nthen maybe I do it\na little less frequently.\n\n453\n00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.099\nBecause keep in mind, it's not like\nActive Directory or something like that,\n\n454\n00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:53.226\nwhere these clients have an account.\n\n455\n00:23:53.226 --> 00:23:57.279\nAnd if I try to restore, we could lose\nconnectivity between the machine and\n\n456\n00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:58.062\nthe account.\n\n457\n00:23:58.062 --> 00:23:58.919\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n458\n00:23:58.919 --> 00:24:03.859\nThese are just DHCP leases And worst\ncase scenario, if I have to rebuild this\n\n459\n00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:08.460\nmachine from a backup that's a few\ndays old, leases are not correct.\n\n460\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.150\nThe client thinks he has a lease.\n\n461\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.270\nDHCP is unaware of the lease.\n\n462\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.080\nNot the best but\nit's just gonna require a release and\n\n463\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.640\nrenew on the client to say,\nokay my old lease, you don't have it.\n\n464\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.510\nDarn it, I don't know what happened there.\n\n465\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.850\nIt's not like he's paying money.\n\n466\n00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.487\nIt's not like my car where\nI'd have to go fight the guy.\n\n467\n00:24:24.487 --> 00:24:27.441\nHe says, all right, I'll throw this\nlease away that you say I don't have.\n\n468\n00:24:27.441 --> 00:24:28.655\nAnd I'll just get a new lease.\n\n469\n00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.101\nNo big deal, right?\n\n470\n00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:31.260\nSo it's not the end of the world.\n\n471\n00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.520\nIt's a little less frequent.\n\n472\n00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.700\nIt's not like you have to do this\nevery hour or anything like that.\n\n473\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, the idea of backup\nsounds really like a great thing for\n\n474\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.380\nus to actually think about.\n\n475\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.970\nAnd of course, something for\nus to implement.\n\n476\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.070\nBut it still sounds like\nthat we have to recover\n\n477\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.640\neverything first before we can\neven restore that database.\n\n478\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.260\nSo it's still gonna require some time for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n479\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.047\nDo we have any other options?\n\n480\n00:24:57.047 --> 00:24:59.550\nYou were mentioning things like\nfailover a little bit earlier.\n\n481\n00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.579\n&gt;&gt; We do but looking at the clock, I'll\ntell you what, Ronnie, why don't we do\n\n482\n00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:04.820\nthis, cuz it's gonna, surprise, surprise-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.790\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna go over\n\n484\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.290\nour 30 minute window here for this.\n\n485\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.020\nSo let's talk about the next one.\n\n486\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n487\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.260\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll jump back and we'll save\nfailover where I can do a full on demo.\n\n488\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:13.950\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great.\n\n489\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Good?\n\n490\n00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.270\nAll right, so\nthe last thing that I want to mention and\n\n491\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.890\nthis one is something that's relatively\nnew, came out a few editions ago.\n\n492\n00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.990\nAnd that's DHCP Name Protection.\n\n493\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.525\nName protection is to prevent squatting.\n\n494\n00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know,\n\n495\n00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.140\nit's a funny little term, right?\n\n496\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.498\nYou know, name squatting.\n\n497\n00:25:31.498 --> 00:25:36.330\nAnd the idea here is if we\nthink about what can happen.\n\n498\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.122\nI've got an enterprise,\nI've got my environment,\n\n499\n00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:43.029\nI've got machines that are named\nserver one, server two, server three,\n\n500\n00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:46.520\nprinter one, or printservo one,\nClient123, what have you.\n\n501\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:54.400\nWhat can happen is a non-windows\ndevice can come into my network.\n\n502\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.210\nAnd it can attempt to register a name\n\n503\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.320\nthat's already been registered\nby another machine.\n\n504\n00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.270\nOr maybe not register, but update.\n\n505\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.700\nLet's say that I've got a machine\non my network called server one.\n\n506\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.780\nRonnie comes in with his laptop\nthat's running Linux and\n\n507\n00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.010\nhe comes into my network,\nhe's here to sell me with some things.\n\n508\n00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.306\nI'm like, go away Ronnie.\n\n509\n00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:14.484\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But no, I wouldn't do that,\n\n510\n00:26:14.484 --> 00:26:16.440\nhe's a nice guy, he can sell me whatever.\n\n511\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.480\nBut they come in and their machine\nhappens to be named servo one.\n\n512\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.460\nAnd that machine does its normal thing\nwhen he connects it to my network.\n\n513\n00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.410\nIt gets a DHCP address,\nit sees the IP address of the DNS server.\n\n514\n00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.250\nThat network stack on Linux\ncalls up DHCP and says, hey,\n\n515\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.960\nI need to create a record so\npeople can find me.\n\n516\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.720\nThere's already a record with my name,\ngreat, I'll just update it.\n\n517\n00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.150\nAnd now all of a sudden that record gets\nupdated with Ronnie's laptop's IP address.\n\n518\n00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.160\nSo when a user on my network is\ntrying to connect to server one,\n\n519\n00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.870\nthey end up getting the IP\naddress of Ronnie's machine.\n\n520\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.070\nSo you can definitely see\nsome problems with that.\n\n521\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.170\nCould also be an intentional thing.\n\n522\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.330\nI could do a denial of service\non you by trying to squat one of\n\n523\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.580\nthe names of your servers.\n\n524\n00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.564\nAll of a sudden none of your users can\nconnect to their mailboxes because I\n\n525\n00:27:03.564 --> 00:27:07.170\nbrought in a laptop that has the same\nname as your mailbox server.\n\n526\n00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.630\nAnd I try to update that IP address,\nso you see where I'm going with that.\n\n527\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.488\nSo name protection creates\na new record in DNS,\n\n528\n00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:20.231\nand along with DHCP,\nthat DHC ID, all right?\n\n529\n00:27:20.231 --> 00:27:24.948\nAnd that record ties the identity\nof the machine with that lease or\n\n530\n00:27:24.948 --> 00:27:29.480\nthat DHCP information,\nthat IP address registration.\n\n531\n00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.350\nAnd so what happens is when\na client tries to contact DHCP and\n\n532\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.920\nupdate that information,\nrenew that lease, what have you,\n\n533\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.660\nit can check to see if that's the actual\nmachine that originally created it.\n\n534\n00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.764\nOr let me rephrase that,\n\n535\n00:27:43.764 --> 00:27:46.666\ncuz you're actually updating your\ninformation on DNS not DHCP.\n\n536\n00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:48.570\nSo you go to contact DHCP.\n\n537\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:54.700\nAgain, Ronnie's laptop that happens to be\nnamed server one, connects, talks to DHCP.\n\n538\n00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.975\nCan't get my DNS, yeah,\ngot my acronyms going crazy here.\n\n539\n00:27:57.975 --> 00:28:01.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's laptop talks to DNS and says,\n\n540\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.240\nhey, I need to update that information,\nhere's my IP address.\n\n541\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.383\nDNS can contact DHCP and say,\n\n542\n00:28:07.383 --> 00:28:11.860\nis this the client that originally\ncreated this, all right?\n\n543\n00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.480\nAnd if not, DNS can say no,\nyou're not allowed to update that record.\n\n544\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.630\nThat record is locked.\n\n545\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.380\nOnly the originator, the one that\noriginally created that record that got\n\n546\n00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.070\nthat lease,\nis going to be able to update information.\n\n547\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.372\nThat is name protection and\nit's a simple check mark.\n\n548\n00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.420\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n549\n00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.730\nAnd we can go, you can actually do\nthis at a couple different places.\n\n550\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.938\nGo to Properties, not on the server,\nMichael, of IPv4.\n\n551\n00:28:35.938 --> 00:28:41.436\nI can right-click on that, I can go to\nProperties, and I can go to Advanced.\n\n552\n00:28:41.436 --> 00:28:43.310\nAnd I thought that's where it was.\n\n553\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.352\nI lied to you.\n\n554\n00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.465\n&gt;&gt; And\nprotection there on the bottom, yep.\n\n555\n00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:49.860\n&gt;&gt; There it is, I'm blind.\n\n556\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.610\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.350\nName protection, DHP name protection\nis disabled at the server level.\n\n558\n00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.720\nI can choose Configure, and\nI can enable name protection.\n\n559\n00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.525\nWe can do that IPv4,\nwe can also do it for IPv6.\n\n560\n00:29:02.525 --> 00:29:06.630\nWe can also do it for an individual scope.\n\n561\n00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.490\nActually, let's see if\nI can find it in here.\n\n562\n00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.830\nWe go Properties &gt; Advanced, and\n\n563\n00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.860\nthere it is right there on my DNS tab,\nconfigured name protection.\n\n564\n00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.750\nSo maybe you only wanna provide name\nprotection on one particular scope,\n\n565\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.150\nlike your scope that supports all of\nyour servers or something like that.\n\n566\n00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.740\nSo you can enable it at the IPv4 level,\n\n567\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.186\nat the IPv6 level, at the server level,\nor at the individual scope level.\n\n568\n00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:33.875\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I do have a question on that,\ncuz it sounds like a neat thing.\n\n569\n00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:36.955\nBut what if I intentionally\nam replacing a sever,\n\n570\n00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:40.195\nsuch as my original server dies,\nthat server01.\n\n571\n00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:44.384\nAnd I go, I need to bring server01 back up\nand I'm gonna put new hardware on it and\n\n572\n00:29:44.384 --> 00:29:45.620\nI now have server01.\n\n573\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.700\nDo I need to uncheck this and\nthen we're fine or [CROSSTALK].\n\n574\n00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.201\n&gt;&gt; With that,\nyou know that's a good question, Ronnie.\n\n575\n00:29:52.201 --> 00:29:55.775\nAnd I believe you're gonna have manually\ngo in and just remove those records and\n\n576\n00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:56.801\nupdate information.\n\n577\n00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:57.984\nYou definitely don't want to turn it off.\n\n578\n00:29:57.984 --> 00:30:01.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And turn it back on cuz it'll end up\n\n579\n00:30:01.227 --> 00:30:05.970\ngenerating these DHCP ID records and\nyou don't need multiples of those.\n\n580\n00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.450\nSo it'd be to just manually clear\nthat out, update that information,\n\n581\n00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.530\nand you'll be good to go.\n\n582\n00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.700\nHonestly, it's gonna be the DNS record.\n\n583\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.709\nSo if you remove the DNS record, that\nnew machine creates that new DNS record,\n\n584\n00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:18.000\nyou should be good to go.\n\n585\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well,\n\n586\n00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:24.190\nthat's a lot more on the idea of\nmaintaining of course and managing DHCP.\n\n587\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.480\nBut there's actually more for\nus to also take a look at as well.\n\n588\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.070\nSo remember that when we took\na look at here in this episode\n\n589\n00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.230\nis the idea of working with the leases and\nshowing how you can change the leases.\n\n590\n00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.200\nAs well as taking,\nwe got backup and restoration and\n\n591\n00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.640\neven working with name protection to\nprevent something like what would,\n\n592\n00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.950\nDNS squatting, I think is technically\nwhat we're actually talking about here.\n\n593\n00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.810\nSo to actually take a look\nat those issues as well.\n\n594\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.090\nBut there is more to go.\n\n595\n00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.900\nWe need to talk about some failover,\nwe need to talk about a few other items.\n\n596\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.800\nBut that's gonna be for another part then.\n\n597\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.900\nSo it's a great place for us to sign off.\n\n598\n00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.970\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n599\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:00.833\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n600\n00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:05.915\n&gt;&gt; Stay

The team briefly mentions the places within DHCP to check the dhcp logs and in the event viewer when needing to troubleshoot dhcp operations.",

Windows.\n\n10\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.900\nAnd here to help us is our Microsoft kung\nfu master himself, Mister Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.260\nMike, welcome back to our studio.\n\n12\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie, and\nthanks for allowing me to come in and\n\n13\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.040\nteach you guys all about good old DHCP.\n\n14\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.840\nAnyway, we're continuing on with DHCP,\nin this one.\n\n15\n00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760\nWe wanna take a look at how we can\nprovide some fault tolerance for DHCP.\n\n16\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.060\nWe've already talked a little bit\nabout disaster recovery backups,\n\n17\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.080\nmaking sure we've got our automatic\nbackups setup the way we want it.\n\n18\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.170\nThat we are performing manual backups for\n\n19\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.340\noffsite, other types of\ndisasters we might have.\n\n20\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.600\nBut now I wanna talk\nabout high availability.\n\n21\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.630\nJust making sure that DHCP is available.\n\n22\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.745\nAnd in the past,\n\n23\n00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:09.902\nproviding high availability on\nDHCP was really no easy task.\n\n24\n00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:14.175\nYou could because DHCP\nwas very independent.\n\n25\n00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:17.193\nIt didn't share its information\nwith other DHCP servers.\n\n26\n00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:21.000\nSo when you were setting them up,\nyou had to do several things.\n\n27\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.050\nYou had to make sure that there\nwas no overlapping scopes.\n\n28\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.400\nAnd it was good about warning you, but\n\n29\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.450\nyou couldn't have a scope overlap\nbecause DHCP didn't talk to each other.\n\n30\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.640\nSo we had two servers that\nhad two different scopes but\n\n31\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.220\nthose scopes overlapped a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.170\nIf there were no safety checks,\nyou could have two servers passing\n\n33\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.290\nout the same IP addresses,\ncausing duplicate IP addresses use, and\n\n34\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.130\nthere were connectivity issues for\nthose nodes.\n\n35\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.690\nHow do I provide high availability\n\n36\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.095\nif I can't have two servers\nthat have the same scope.\n\n37\n00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:54.346\nWe would do things like\nsplitting up a scope and\n\n38\n00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:57.946\nputting 80% of it on one server and\n20 % on another.\n\n39\n00:01:57.946 --> 00:02:01.220\nThat way the 80% server would be\nable to handle the workload but\n\n40\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.030\nif it ever failed the other one\nhad 20% of the addresses and\n\n41\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.250\ncould kinda keep chugging along\nif that first one had failed.\n\n42\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I understand the idea of\nbacking up a server and getting it to\n\n43\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.080\nthat point where if that server actually\nfails, I need to restore the DHTP.\n\n44\n00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.850\nIt means that I have to go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.390\nreinstall DHTP,\nget that backup database up and going.\n\n46\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.640\nOne makes high availability\nspecial though.\n\n47\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.910\nWhat are we really talking about here.\n\n48\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.815\nWhen one server fails, what happens.\n\n49\n00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:36.250\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about limiting\nthe downtime s really what it's about.\n\n50\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.070\nWhen that server fails,\nin Ronnie's scenario there for one,\n\n51\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.405\nI get to discover that it's failed.\n\n52\n00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.380\nAnd that's probably not gonna\nbe instantaneous because\n\n53\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.820\npeople have leases already.\n\n54\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.070\nSo it's gonna be when a new\nclient comes into the network and\n\n55\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.990\ncannot obtain a lease.\n\n56\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.320\nI'm gonna have to go figure out what's\nwrong, find out that that server,\n\n57\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.130\nthat service is no longer running.\n\n58\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.530\nAnd then I've gotta go get my backup.\n\n59\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.340\nI've gotta do my restore.\n\n60\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.370\nAnd in the meantime, I've got\nclients waiting for IP addresses or\n\n61\n00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.740\ntrying to renew addresses and they can't.\n\n62\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.060\nSo we wanna try to prevent that downtime.\n\n63\n00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.950\nThat's where the high\navailability comes in.\n\n64\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.710\nAnd as I said, you really couldn't do it.\n\n65\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.680\nOne thing you would see people doing\nwas put DHCP on a failover cluster.\n\n66\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.720\nBut that's again a lot\nof setup involved and\n\n67\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.630\nhardware involved in\ncreating a failover cluster.\n\n68\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.220\nAnd then putting DHCP on top of that.\n\n69\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.765\nAnd then that way, you weren't really\ndoing anything to DHCP directly.\n\n70\n00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:28.250\nTt was underneath there\nwas some fault tolerance.\n\n71\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.780\nSo if that node failed,\n\n72\n00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.410\nthe roll would shift over to another node\nusing your fail over cluster method.\n\n73\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.600\nRecently they've added, and\nthis was a couple additions ago so\n\n74\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.960\nit's not brand new to 2016 by any means,\nis we can do DHCP fail over.\n\n75\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.870\nAnd that's a fail over\nmethod within DHCP itself.\n\n76\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.120\nWe can now have our DHCP\nservers working together.\n\n77\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960\nTalking to each other,\nsharing their information about the scope,\n\n78\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.800\nabout the leases that we have for\nthat particular scope, and\n\n79\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.890\ncommunicating with each other,\nchecking the status of their partner.\n\n80\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.640\nAnd if the other one is down, knowing,\nhey, it's time for me to take over.\n\n81\n00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.880\nSo that's the idea here.\n\n82\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.120\nDHCP fail over is a fail over method I can\nimplement within DHCP with multiple DHCP\n\n83\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.040\nservers to provide that up time, that\navailability that I might need for DHCP.\n\n84\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Now the idea of high availability\nis something that we really want to\n\n85\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.370\nunderstand, because most networks\nare really gonna want something like this.\n\n86\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.840\nEspecially if that network needs to be\nup 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n87\n00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.990\nIt's something that's very important in\ntodays world, because a lot of us can't\n\n88\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.360\nafford the downtime even though we might\nsay we're just replacing the server.\n\n89\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.600\nIt still takes time to bring up even a\nvirtual server and get the role installed,\n\n90\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.150\nget everything back up and\nverify then that everything is working.\n\n91\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.160\nWith high availability,\n\n92\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.640\nwhat we're saying is that we're not gonna\nhave that issue as much as possible.\n\n93\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.890\nAnd that way by the way\nthat it's actually setup,\n\n94\n00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.680\nwe're saying that it can actually handle\nthe failover and still continue to run.\n\n95\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.590\nAnd so it's a great option for\nus to consider,\n\n96\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.420\nespecially we have all\nthe resource that we need.\n\n97\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.910\n&gt;&gt; It really is and we think like I've\nbeen saying, DHCP if it fails, okay,\n\n98\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.750\neverybody's kind of okay for a little\nwhile We've gotta try and get it back up.\n\n99\n00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.550\nBut what about scenarios like\nwe've got a heavy remote access.\n\n100\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.510\nA lot of people are remoting into\nthe network do work from home or\n\n101\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.700\ntraveling sales people.\n\n102\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.720\nThey need an IP address when they connect.\n\n103\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.030\nIf DHCP is down the VPN server\nmight not be able to get those.\n\n104\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.740\nAnd then also they can't connect and\nwhat that's gonna do.\n\n105\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.810\nPhone calls to the helpdesk.\n\n106\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.960\nHey did you know I can't connect.\n\n107\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.920\nI can't connect.\n\n108\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.240\nWhat if I'm a service provider.\n\n109\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.230\nNow we're multiplying the number of phone\ncalls the people that are experiencing\n\n110\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.790\ndown time, because DHCP was unavailable\nand that could end up costing me money.\n\n111\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.570\nI'm sure I've got contracts, I've got\npolicies in place with our, what are-\n\n112\n00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.140\n&gt;&gt; SLA's.\n\n113\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.510\n&gt;&gt; SLA's in place that say hey we're\ngoing to provide this level of up time.\n\n114\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.480\nI need to be able to provide that.\n\n115\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.110\nOtherwise, I'm gonna face\nprobably fines or fees or\n\n116\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.010\na loss of customers, so not a good thing.\n\n117\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.480\nSo how do we do it.\n\n118\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.190\nIt's actually pretty straightforward.\n\n119\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.850\nLet's talk about it and\nthen we'll jump in and we'll do it.\n\n120\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.390\nWhen we set up failure with DHCP,\n\n121\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.170\nthe first thing we need to understand Is\nthat it's a two node failover scenario.\n\n122\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.710\nThere's only two partners.\n\n123\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.330\nI can't take five or six or seven servers\nand make them part of this failover.\n\n124\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.110\nSo it's only two.\n\n125\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.690\nThere are two modes I can do this in.\n\n126\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.410\nI can do this in what we call hot\nstandby mode or I can do load balancing.\n\n127\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.980\nHot stand by out of the two servers,\none is considered active.\n\n128\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.020\nAnd he's managing and\nmaintaining all of the lease information.\n\n129\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.640\nOnly when that one is unavailable does\nthis standby come in and take over.\n\n130\n00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.850\nSo that'd be hot stand by one active,\none waiting for the active to fail.\n\n131\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.305\nLoad balancing we're just\ngonna split the workload.\n\n132\n00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.720\nWe're gonna send some of\nthe requests to this server,\n\n133\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.330\nsome of the requests to this server.\n\n134\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.780\nHopefully splitting that workload between\nthe two which gives us better performance\n\n135\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.190\nand high availability.\n\n136\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.810\nAnd that's a key to remember.\n\n137\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.310\nWith the standby by you're doing nothing\nfor performance, if I can say that.\n\n138\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.180\nYou're not decreasing the workload\non that DHCP server at all.\n\n139\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.930\nIt's still one server handling everything,\nand\n\n140\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.550\nonly if he fails does the other one\ntake over, which might be what you want.\n\n141\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.790\nBut if you're looking\nto split the workload,\n\n142\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.000\nif you're looking to increase\nthe performance of DHCP,\n\n143\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.930\nthen the load balancing mode\nmight be a better way to go.\n\n144\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.870\nBecause now I can take that workload and\nsplit it apart.\n\n145\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.720\nWhen you set up these again there's only\ntwo per fail over group is what they end\n\n146\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.505\nup calling them but a single server can be\na part of more than one fail over group.\n\n147\n00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:37.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know right.\n\n148\n00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:37.955\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n149\n00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:39.810\n&gt;&gt; A little twisty there.\n\n150\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:46.920\nIn other words I could have server A and\nserver B as part of a fail over group.\n\n151\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.730\nAnd they're working together.\n\n152\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:55.764\nBut server A can also be in a fail over\ngroup with server C for a different scope.\n\n153\n00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:56.686\nImagine this scenario.\n\n154\n00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:59.909\nThis is where you most commonly see this,\nis a.\n\n155\n00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:02.949\nCorporate office and branch offices.\n\n156\n00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.220\nWe end up setting basically a hub and\nspoke.\n\n157\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.620\nEach one of my branches has a DHCP\nserver to provide IP addresses for\n\n158\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.180\nthat particular branch and normally it\ndoes a rock solid job, no problems.\n\n159\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.350\nIf that server fails at that branch,\n\n160\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.575\nI want those users to still\nbe able to get an IP address.\n\n161\n00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:24.078\nSo that server back at that\ncorporate office, in the center,\n\n162\n00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:28.640\nacts as a standby for\nthat DHCP server at the branch office.\n\n163\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.980\nThat's one failover partnership, but\nI also have a failover partnership between\n\n164\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.680\nthat same server at corporate and\nthe server at branch two.\n\n165\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.500\nSo if the branch two fails, the guy at\ncorporate becomes that hot standby, right?\n\n166\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.190\nSo you see what I'm saying?\n\n167\n00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.160\nThere's only two per failover group, but\n\n168\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.558\na server can be a part of more\nthan one fail over group.\n\n169\n00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:50.361\nAll right?\n\n170\n00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.750\nAnd that's normally,\n\n171\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.210\nlike I said, a very common scenario is\ncorporate office becomes the back up.\n\n172\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.140\nI don't want people going across the WAN\nto get an IP address, but if that server\n\n173\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.320\nout there in that branch office fails,\nthat's when I want them to hit that.\n\n174\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.860\nLoad balancing is typically done\njust because the work load.\n\n175\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.837\nI might have a scenario where\nI have multiple sub nets, HDH,\n\n176\n00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:15.480\nDHCP server can handle multiple sub nets,\nbut if the work load gets too big,\n\n177\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.930\nI could add another DHCP server.\n\n178\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.360\nTake some of that work off of them,\n\n179\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.770\nso both servers are able to\nhandle the multiple sub nets,\n\n180\n00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.950\neach doing a piece of the job or splitting\nup the work load between the two.\n\n181\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.040\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I like that idea of that\nscenario that you gave us because it\n\n182\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.790\nreally does show where an organization\ndoesn't have to set up two\n\n183\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.200\nDHCP servers in each one of those branch\noffices to ensure for high availability.\n\n184\n00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.360\nBut by being able to actually set one\nup as a hub and spoke type of network,\n\n185\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.160\nwe can actually see where multiple\nbranches end, can have that high\n\n186\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.360\navailability with the idea of actually\nnot having to set up both of those.\n\n187\n00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.230\nAnd so, that can save cost.\n\n188\n00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.230\nBut it's probably a solution\nthat Microsoft really does like.\n\n189\n00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.860\nSo, it might be something\nwe want to consider.\n\n190\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.770\nEspecially when we start thinking\nabout the idea of getting ready for\n\n191\n00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.920\nthe exam, as well.\n\n192\n00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.330\nI can see questions like\nthat coming up very easily.\n\n193\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n194\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.280\nAnd I didn't think about that.\n\n195\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.363\nLet's say I've got ten branch offices,\nall right?\n\n196\n00:10:09.363 --> 00:10:12.495\nI can take one server at\nthe corporate office and\n\n197\n00:10:12.495 --> 00:10:16.420\nprovide high availability for\neach one of those branches.\n\n198\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.930\nLike Ronny was saying, I'm not putting\ntwo servers at every branch and\n\n199\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.370\nsetting up 20 servers.\n\n200\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.960\nI added one server and all of a sudden\nI've got high availability for\n\n201\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.100\nevery one of those branch offices,\nas far as DHCP is concerned.\n\n202\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.600\nAnd all done without setting\nup a cluster underneath.\n\n203\n00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.820\nNone of this is installing\nthe failover cluster,\n\n204\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.710\nroll and configuring that and\nsetting up shared storage, none of that.\n\n205\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.060\nThe only stipulation is that the nodes\ncan communicate with each other.\n\n206\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.770\nSo the branch office and the corporate\noffice would have a permanent VPN\n\n207\n00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.390\ntunnel set up between them, most likely\nanyway, for corporate access to corporate\n\n208\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.330\nresources because they are gonna\ncheck with each other.\n\n209\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.850\nBecause the standby has to know\nif the primary has failed.\n\n210\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.616\nSo there's a little heart\nbeat that goes back and\n\n211\n00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:04.875\nforth that they communicate with to see\nif the other node is up and running.\n\n212\n00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.320\nAll right, so let's see how we can do it.\n\n213\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.820\nAnd I think you'll be surprised that\nit's not nearly as difficult as\n\n214\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.900\nsetting up a failover cluster\nin the Windows operating system.\n\n215\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.290\nSo let's take a look at my screen here and\nwhat I've got, is got server one.\n\n216\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.960\nServer one is currently hosting,\nor is running DHCP.\n\n217\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.910\nSo let's open up good old DHCP here.\n\n218\n00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:27.820\nGet that console up and running.\n\n219\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.040\nAnd on this node I have\na few scopes set up.\n\n220\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.780\nClient subnet, scope A, scope B, just\nsome things we have to play around with.\n\n221\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.920\nSo that's server one.\n\n222\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.770\nAnd then on server two, if I can find him.\n\n223\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.790\nThere he is.\n\n224\n00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:50.010\nWe're gonna be looking at,\nlet's see, I have DHCP installed\n\n225\n00:11:53.973 --> 00:11:56.650\nBut there are no scopes on this guy,\nright?\n\n226\n00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.670\nAnd I did that intentionally cuz I\nwant you to kinda see the process.\n\n227\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.161\nBut by no means does this have to be\na blank, fresh install of DHCP, right?\n\n228\n00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:08.722\nHe could already have scopes for\nother reasons, for other subnets.\n\n229\n00:12:08.722 --> 00:12:10.513\nBut when you're setting this up,\n\n230\n00:12:10.513 --> 00:12:15.090\nyou're thinking about what scope do I\nneed to provide high availability for?\n\n231\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.877\nI might not need to do all of them, right?\n\n232\n00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:23.250\nMaybe it's just the one for my servers or\nthe clients, but not the dev.\n\n233\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.320\nI don't worry about the dev department,\n\n234\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.680\nif a DHCP is unavailable\nthey can get by for a while.\n\n235\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.770\nI don't know why you wouldn't honestly,\nit's so\n\n236\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.560\neasy to do, just to include all\nthe scopes, you might as well but just so\n\n237\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:41.820\nyou understand it is done on\na per scope basis, all right?\n\n238\n00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.000\nLet's go back to server one and\nwe'll start this process up.\n\n239\n00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.454\nAll right so on server one I want\nto provide some DHCP failovers so\n\n240\n00:12:52.454 --> 00:12:55.190\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to right click and\n\n241\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.320\nyou can really right click\njust about anywhere.\n\n242\n00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.286\nYou'll see if I right click on IPv4,\nconfigure failover.\n\n243\n00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:07.440\nIf I right-click on the server,\nI might not have it at that level.\n\n244\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.010\nIf I right click on the scope itself.\n\n245\n00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:14.210\nI can provide failover as well.\n\n246\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.070\nAnd they both launch the same wizard.\n\n247\n00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:23.550\nIf I click here, versus clicking on IPv4,\nI'm going to get the same wizard.\n\n248\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.090\nRight?\nAnd on the first screen of this wizard it\n\n249\n00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.870\nsays, okay here you go,\nwelcome to DHCP failover.\n\n250\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.510\nWe're gonna guide you through the process.\n\n251\n00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.700\nThank you, Microsoft.\n\n252\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.470\nAnd there's a check mark here that's\nchecked by default and it says select all.\n\n253\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.630\nAnd so you can see the scopes\nthat I have are grayed out.\n\n254\n00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.840\nI cannot choose which one.\n\n255\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.790\nIf I uncheck this, that's when I\ncan say I wanna provide it for\n\n256\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.580\nthis one and this one but\nnot the other one.\n\n257\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.170\nAll right, so free to choose one scope,\nmore than one, or\n\n258\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.440\nall and I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo all.\n\n259\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.800\nLet me zoom back out so\nwe can see the rest of that.\n\n260\n00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.540\nI'll click Next and then specify\nthe partner server to use for failover.\n\n261\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.510\nSo if I hit my drop down\nlist I've got nothing.\n\n262\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.200\nSo we'll click Add Server.\n\n263\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.350\nAnd I get a list of\nthe authorized servers.\n\n264\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.210\nI'm gonna choose server two and\nI'll click OK.\n\n265\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.640\nSo it's gonna reach out and\n\n266\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.090\nmake sure that server two is up,\nmake sure that server two is running DHCP.\n\n267\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.075\nAll right, and\nevidently server two is not responding.\n\n268\n00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:23.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n269\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:29.070\nwe'll give it just a second to hopefully\nbegin responding cuz we know he's up.\n\n270\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.380\nWe were just on there.\n\n271\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.360\nThere we go, little slow, but again,\n\n272\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.100\nit's the heavy network traffic\nI have on my virtual network.\n\n273\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n274\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.680\n&gt;&gt; So it did find it.\n\n275\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.890\nEverything looks good.\n\n276\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.430\nWe are good to go there.\n\n277\n00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.810\nI'll click Next.\n\n278\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.070\nAnd then here's where I've gotta\nstart making a couple decisions.\n\n279\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.810\nCreate a new failover relationship.\n\n280\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.290\nI called it a group earlier.\n\n281\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.260\nThey actually call it a relationship.\n\n282\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.940\nThe first thing that we have to pay\nattention to is this right here.\n\n283\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.350\nAnd normally we will say\ncall it whatever you want.\n\n284\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.560\nIt doesn't matter,\ncomputers don't care about names.\n\n285\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.560\nIt's just the numbers.\n\n286\n00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.010\nDo whatever you like there.\n\n287\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.520\nThere is something that you've got\nto understand about this name and\n\n288\n00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.260\nit's a great test question.\n\n289\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.600\nThey have to be unique.\n\n290\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.270\nRemember how I said you could have more\nthan one relationship, that there could\n\n291\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.480\nonly be two per relationship but\nyou could have more than one?\n\n292\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.790\nSo each relationship needs a unique name,\na way to identify it.\n\n293\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.930\nAnd that needs to be unique\nthroughout your organization.\n\n294\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.110\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n295\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.469\nWhen you're naming this just don't\ncall it something as simple as\n\n296\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.665\nfailover, all right?\n\n297\n00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:33.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you're probably gonna\n\n298\n00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:33.800\nhave others.\n\n299\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.490\nAnd if you call it failover one, failover\ntwo, it's not gonna be all that useful.\n\n300\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike, on this relationship name,\n\n301\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.720\nsince you're emphasizing it, is that\nactually gonna be the same thing that we\n\n302\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.890\nput on the other node that\nwe're doing in the failover?\n\n303\n00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.890\n&gt;&gt; It is, in a way.\n\n304\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:47.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What's gonna happen is,\n\n305\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.095\ncuz the other node doesn't\nknow about it yet.\n\n306\n00:15:49.095 --> 00:15:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That we're setting this up.\n\n307\n00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.168\nWe're kind of setting this up and\nthen we're gonna surprise it with it.\n\n308\n00:15:52.168 --> 00:15:55.383\nHey, you're now part of\na failover relationship.\n\n309\n00:15:55.383 --> 00:15:56.865\nAnd it'll just pull that name.\n\n310\n00:15:56.865 --> 00:16:01.699\nBut if that server was a part\nof another relationship already.\n\n311\n00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:05.295\nAnd we're setting this one up and\nwe happen to use the same name as\n\n312\n00:16:05.295 --> 00:16:08.310\nthe relationship that it\nwas already a part of?\n\n313\n00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.060\nThat's gonna cause a problem, right?\n\n314\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.980\nSo that's why we gotta make\nsure we understand, hey,\n\n315\n00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.580\nwhat does server two already have?\n\n316\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.100\nDoes he have any relationships?\n\n317\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.130\nWhat are their names?\n\n318\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.950\nLet's make sure they're unique.\n\n319\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.900\nTypically, you can do IP\naddress to IP address, or\n\n320\n00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.270\nname to name because\nimagine that hub in spoke.\n\n321\n00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.825\nOne relationship is corp\nDHCP to branch ADHCP.\n\n322\n00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:33.663\nThe other relationship is\ncorp DHCP to branch two DHCP.\n\n323\n00:16:33.663 --> 00:16:38.250\nSo if we use name like that I can\nensure their uniqueness all right.\n\n324\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.808\nSo it's not really difficult\nto come up with a unique name.\n\n325\n00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:44.310\nI'm gonna just call this, I'll leave\nthe default there, that's fine with me.\n\n326\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.183\nIt's awfully ugly though.\n\n327\n00:16:46.183 --> 00:16:47.031\nLet's do this.\n\n328\n00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:52.880\nsvr01 to svr02.\n\n329\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.160\nWe'll do that.\n\n330\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.860\nThen we have what's known as\nthe maximum client lead time.\n\n331\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.459\nThis is an interesting little number.\n\n332\n00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:06.946\nWhat this is, is when there's\na fail over from a hot standby,\n\n333\n00:17:06.946 --> 00:17:09.902\nfrom a active to the hot standby,\n\n334\n00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:14.670\nthere's a few phases that\nthese servers go through.\n\n335\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.150\nWhen that standby no longer can\ncommunicate with the active server,\n\n336\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.160\nthe one that's doing all the work, right.\n\n337\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.320\nIf he loses communication with them that's\nwhen he starts to go, wait a second.\n\n338\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.868\nI can't reach the active one.\n\n339\n00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:28.601\nI'm gonna have to take\nover this job right?\n\n340\n00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:30.130\nBecause he's unavailable.\n\n341\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.480\nAt least that's what he thinks.\n\n342\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.530\nIt very well could be just\nthe communication between them but\n\n343\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.760\nhe doesn't know that.\n\n344\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.120\nSo it starts to go through these different\nphases where communication is interrupted.\n\n345\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.890\nAnd it's gonna temporarily take over, and\n\n346\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:50.650\nthe maximum lead time is how long\nthat standby can extend leases,\n\n347\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:56.530\nprovided by the primary, the active one,\nbefore completely taking over right.\n\n348\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.205\nBasically, what he's going to say.\n\n349\n00:17:57.205 --> 00:18:00.026\nLet's say Ronnie was the active and\nI am the standby and\n\n350\n00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:02.420\na client got an ip address from Ronnie.\n\n351\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.630\nNow Ronnie is no longer available\nthe client's trying to renew his\n\n352\n00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.190\nlease, I've taken over.\n\n353\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.220\nWhat I can do is I can say, you know what?\n\n354\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.950\nHe's not available, I'm gonna just extend\nthe lease you currently have with Ronnie,\n\n355\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.840\neven though Ronnie's not around.\n\n356\n00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.650\nFor a little while.\n\n357\n00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.030\nWhatever this maximum client lead time is.\n\n358\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.960\nNow once that runs out you\nstill can't talk to Ronnie,\n\n359\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.090\nI'm going to take over I'm going to become\nthe one responsible for generating you're\n\n360\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.465\nlease you not going to any down time\nyou're not gonna have any issues.\n\n361\n00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:36.085\nIt's just the servers themselves trying to\nfigure out who's really in charge of that\n\n362\n00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:37.415\nrecord, right.\n\n363\n00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:39.825\nSo MCLT, or maximum client lead time,\n\n364\n00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:44.735\nhow long we can extend the lease for\nin a fail-over situation.\n\n365\n00:18:44.735 --> 00:18:46.481\nThen you have your mode.\n\n366\n00:18:46.481 --> 00:18:50.745\nAnd you see the two choices are gonna\nbe load balancing or hot standby.\n\n367\n00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:53.320\nDepending what I choose here\ndetermines what I see for\n\n368\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.200\nthe rest of this dialogue box.\n\n369\n00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.990\nLoad Balancing, all right,\nLocal Server, Partner Server.\n\n370\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.330\nHow much workload do you wanna provide,\nor force on each one of those?\n\n371\n00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.113\nWanna do 50-50, do you wanna do 60-40,\nwhat do I wanna do?\n\n372\n00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:10.071\nAll right if I choose Hot standby,\nwell this changes,\n\n373\n00:19:10.071 --> 00:19:13.300\nwhat is the role of the partner server?\n\n374\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.440\nNot the one I'm on, but\n\n375\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.360\nthe one that I'm getting ready to add to\nthis, is that the active or the standby?\n\n376\n00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.753\nTypically you're configuring the active\nand the other one is gonna be the standby,\n\n377\n00:19:22.753 --> 00:19:24.255\nbut it definitely doesn't matter.\n\n378\n00:19:24.255 --> 00:19:27.980\nAnd then address is reserved for\nstandby server.\n\n379\n00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.110\nIf I'm active,\nI've got control of the entire scope,\n\n380\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.410\nevery IP address that's\npart of that scope.\n\n381\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.630\nIf I fail, then the other guy takes over,\nbut he has no IP addresses.\n\n382\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.960\nI had them all right.\n\n383\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.868\nSo what we do is we have to say,\nI'm gonna take, in this case,\n\n384\n00:19:42.868 --> 00:19:47.178\nthe default 5% of that pool away\nfrom the active server all right.\n\n385\n00:19:47.178 --> 00:19:51.020\nAnd I'm gonna hand them\nto the standby server.\n\n386\n00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.165\nThat way, if the active server fails,\n\n387\n00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:55.960\nthe standby server has some IP addresses,\nright?\n\n388\n00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.893\nMost of those are just gonna be renewals,\n\n389\n00:19:57.893 --> 00:20:00.510\nbut there might be some\nnew clients that come in.\n\n390\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.180\nAnd he needs a pool of addresses that he\ncan use to pass out to those new clients.\n\n391\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.720\nAnd so that's what the reserved for\nstandby is all about.\n\n392\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:15.150\nI'm gonna leave this on hot standby, cuz\nthat's gonna be the demo that we do here.\n\n393\n00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.380\nMake sure I got that right, set at Hot\nstandby, I'm gonna roll the partner,\n\n394\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.710\nis gonna be my standby.\n\n395\n00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.610\nWe'll do 5%, that's fine.\n\n396\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.000\nState Switchover Interval,\n\n397\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.820\nwe can start automating the switchover,\notherwise it is a manual process.\n\n398\n00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.900\nThe one node will go into\na communications interrupted node and\n\n399\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.890\nthe other node will begin\nthe process of taking over.\n\n400\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:40.750\nBut he's not gonna take over completely\nuntil the switch over occurs.\n\n401\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.850\nAnd the state switchover interval,\n\n402\n00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.095\nwe want to automate that as how\nlong the standby will wait.\n\n403\n00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.870\nUntil the other one,\nor till it takes over.\n\n404\n00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.180\nDoes it wait, by default, 60 minutes.\n\n405\n00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.100\nSo after 60 minutes if\nthe primary hasn't come back up,\n\n406\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.982\nI still cannot communicate with him,\nI'm going to assume server down.\n\n407\n00:20:59.982 --> 00:21:04.120\nI'm gonna change the status on the one\nthat I can no longer communicate with,\n\n408\n00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.890\nsay he is down and out.\n\n409\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.360\nI am now taking over.\n\n410\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.820\nI am the new primary.\n\n411\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.380\nI am no longer the hot standby.\n\n412\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.316\n&gt;&gt; So even if I don't check that box,\n\n413\n00:21:13.316 --> 00:21:16.513\nyou're saying that the default\nis gonna be 60 minutes?\n\n414\n00:21:16.513 --> 00:21:21.402\nBut even if I check it, and I leave it\nat 60 minutes, that's kind of okay.\n\n415\n00:21:21.402 --> 00:21:22.186\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:21:22.186 --> 00:21:22.686\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n417\n00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:23.291\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n418\n00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:23.823\n&gt;&gt; That was a little confusing wasn't\n\n419\n00:21:23.823 --> 00:21:24.343\nit?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n420\n00:21:24.343 --> 00:21:26.173\n&gt;&gt; This is,\n\n421\n00:21:26.173 --> 00:21:29.140\nwhat's a good way to say this if\nwe're gonna automate the process?\n\n422\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.150\nIf we don't automate it,\nwhat'll happen is the primary goes down,\n\n423\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.700\nthe standby will takeover, but\nit'll never fully switch over and\n\n424\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.760\ntakeover the role as being the primary.\n\n425\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.790\nIt's just gonna sit there and say, look,\nI don't know what happened to my partner.\n\n426\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.720\nI'm doing what I can for him.\n\n427\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.630\nBasically but\nI'm not going to assume his role.\n\n428\n00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.400\nIf we start enabling this we can say look,\n\n429\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.550\nafter 60 minutes assume he's gone and\ntake over the role completely.\n\n430\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.650\nYou are now the primary.\n\n431\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.160\nSo that's what we're trying to\nautomate is that switch over from\n\n432\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:04.080\nwhich one is considered the primary or\nactive and which one is the hot standby.\n\n433\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.140\nThe hot standby could remain\nin hot standby mode and\n\n434\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.530\nstill provide the IP addresses.\n\n435\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.610\nBut if I want it to fully switch,\n\n436\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.560\nthat's where we start doing\nthe state switch over interval.\n\n437\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.010\nSo we can automate that process.\n\n438\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.380\nBecause, a lot of times,\nwhat people will do.\n\n439\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.620\nLet's say we've got this scenario\nwhere I've got the active and\n\n440\n00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.600\nthen the hot standby.\n\n441\n00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.870\nWhen it fails over, I'll go ahead and\nlet the standby become the primary.\n\n442\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.840\nWhen I finally rebuild\nthe original one that failed.\n\n443\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.100\nI'll just add him back as the hot standby.\n\n444\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.260\nSo now the roles are kind\nof reversed there.\n\n445\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.600\nDepends again on how you're doing it.\n\n446\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.810\nIf it's the corporate versus\nbranch office health and\n\n447\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.880\nspokes, you might not want that.\n\n448\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.350\nI wanted to switch over to corporate, but\n\n449\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.830\nas soon as I bring that one bakc at\nthe branch office, I want to switch back.\n\n450\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:54.080\nI don't ever want the one at corporate to\nactually assume the primary role for good.\n\n451\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.650\nI want it to eventually switch\nback to the branch office.\n\n452\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.320\nMessage authentication,\ndefinitely a good idea here.\n\n453\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.990\nThis is just setting up a shared secret\nbetween the two servers that are part of\n\n454\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.030\nthis failover relationship so that they\ncan authenticate each other, right?\n\n455\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.450\nSo I know that Ronnie's not spinning\nup a DHCP server of his own and\n\n456\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.960\ntrying to jump in and\ncreate a relationship.\n\n457\n00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.270\nWith one of my DHP servers and then maybe\nbring that guy offline so he can take\n\n458\n00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.980\nover, and then start passing out bogus\ninformation or redirecting people.\n\n459\n00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.017\nSo it's always a good idea.\n\n460\n00:23:24.017 --> 00:23:26.660\nIt's not huge security.\n\n461\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.670\nBut it at least allows my nodes to\nauthenticate each other, and they know\n\n462\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.470\nthey're talking with their actual\npartner and not some rogue DHCP server.\n\n463\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.235\nSo I'll go ahead and\nput a little shared secret in here.\n\n464\n00:23:39.235 --> 00:23:41.769\nI am gonna uncheck that for now.\n\n465\n00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:44.364\nAnd we'll go ahead and click next.\n\n466\n00:23:44.364 --> 00:23:45.734\nAnd then I get my summery.\n\n467\n00:23:45.734 --> 00:23:49.026\n[COUGH] It tells me we're\ngonna be in Hot Standby Mode,\n\n468\n00:23:49.026 --> 00:23:52.685\nthe State Switchover is Disabled,\nMCLT an hour, my part or\n\n469\n00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:57.025\nmy name's there and I can see my\npercentages set up, and what scopes.\n\n470\n00:23:57.025 --> 00:24:00.820\nSo at this point I can either go back and\nfix something I didn't like or\n\n471\n00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.235\nwe can click Finish And\nyou'll see it goes through a process.\n\n472\n00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:09.590\nAnd really quick, add scopes on partner\nserver, disable scopes on partner server.\n\n473\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.240\nWait, what?\nYeah, remember we're doing hot standby so\n\n474\n00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.960\nthat guy's not active.\n\n475\n00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.740\nHe's got everything but\nhe's in a holding pattern.\n\n476\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.140\nCreation of failover configuration.\n\n477\n00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.770\nOn both partner and the host,\n\n478\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.630\nactivate the scopes on the partner,\nconfigure failover successful.\n\n479\n00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.820\nSo everything looks good.\n\n480\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.990\nWe'll click close, and\nlet's see if anything's changed.\n\n481\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.220\nLet's refresh our screen here.\n\n482\n00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.699\nAnd you don't see really anything here.\n\n483\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.820\nIt doesn't look like anything has changed.\n\n484\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.310\nAll right, let's go over to,\nexcept for this, I guess,\n\n485\n00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.240\nout here is the key indicator.\n\n486\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.180\nYou can see they're now a part\nof a failover relationship and\n\n487\n00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.100\nthe name of that failover relationship.\n\n488\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.750\nSo it's telling me that it is protected.\n\n489\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.745\nAll right, now let's switch over to server\ntwo and see what's going on over there.\n\n490\n00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:56.620\nSo we got server two.\n\n491\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.070\nAnd oops, that is server one.\n\n492\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.840\nLet's try that again,\nwe'll go to server two.\n\n493\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.330\nAnd, let's see.\n\n494\n00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.688\nWe're going to have to refresh.\n\n495\n00:25:09.685 --> 00:25:13.470\nAnd we expand it out,\nand there's the magic.\n\n496\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:18.120\nThey're all there waiting or ready to go,\nin the event that one fails.\n\n497\n00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.890\nSo let's try, let's fail something over.\n\n498\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.500\nLet's see.\n\n499\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:28.150\nI've got a client up and running, and\nwe will tend to do a false failover here.\n\n500\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.889\nAnd open a PowerShell,\n[INAUDIBLE] administrative.\n\n501\n00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:40.090\nAnd I should have changed my\nleases a little bit on one of.\n\n502\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.280\nIn fact let's do that.\n\n503\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.340\nI say we should.\n\n504\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.670\nWhy don't we Mike, you've got\nthe computers right in front of you.\n\n505\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.530\nLet's go to serve one, and that scope.\n\n506\n00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.510\nThis is the one he's going to\nbe getting the IP address from.\n\n507\n00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.869\nI'm going to pull up the properties.\n\n508\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.210\nIf I can see the bottom of my window.\n\n509\n00:25:59.717 --> 00:26:02.968\nAnd I'm going to change that\nlease duration to two minutes.\n\n510\n00:26:02.968 --> 00:26:07.890\nWhich is obviously not good for\na production environment.\n\n511\n00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:17.313\nNow I'm going to go to the client And\nwe'll see what we've got here.\n\n512\n00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:20.970\nMake that a little bit bigger.\n\n513\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:26.940\nSo if we do an ipconfig right now,\n&gt;&gt; You misspelled ipconfig [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.810\n&gt;&gt; I did, didn't I?\n\n515\n00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.759\nIt helps if you spell that correctly.\n\n516\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.620\nI'll try that again.\n\n517\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.710\nThere we go.\n\n518\n00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.980\nWe see I've got an IP address.\n\n519\n00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.760\nIf I did an IP config all,\n\n520\n00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.320\nI can see that I currently get that IP\naddress from 101, which is server one.\n\n521\n00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.180\nMy lease is still not the right lease.\n\n522\n00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.290\nThis is the one I obtained\na little bit ago, but that's okay.\n\n523\n00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.158\nWe can do a release.\n\n524\n00:26:52.794 --> 00:26:56.814\nAnd and ipconfig/renew.\n\n525\n00:26:56.814 --> 00:27:00.380\nAnd we should get an IP address\nback with a two minute lease.\n\n526\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, while we're waiting for\nthis thing to refresh.\n\n527\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.380\nI noticed that on the one that\nyou said is being the standby,\n\n528\n00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.060\nyou didn't really have\nto configure anything.\n\n529\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.170\nIs that the way that it actually works?\n\n530\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.000\nThere's no need to\nconfigure the other side.\n\n531\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.\n\n532\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.200\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool.\n\n533\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.268\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic isn't it?\n\n534\n00:27:14.268 --> 00:27:15.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n535\n00:27:15.228 --> 00:27:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Because it already has\nall the configurations.\n\n536\n00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.410\nIt just replicates that\ninformation over and we're done.\n\n537\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.050\nSo there, I got a new IP address.\n\n538\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:26.450\nLet's check on the status of that.\n\n539\n00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.260\nAnd there I can see I've got\na whopping two minute lease.\n\n540\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.930\nAll right?\n\n541\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:37.780\nSo in that two minutes, what I need to do\nIs jump over to server one and kill it.\n\n542\n00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.930\nSo we are going to stop our servers.\n\n543\n00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.990\nSo we'll let that drop.\n\n544\n00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.350\nAnd then we are going to jump\nover to server two Al right.\n\n545\n00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:02.510\nI'm really not going to see anything\nhere until we drop that list.\n\n546\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.705\nFirst of all see,\nwe should see,that the list is here.\n\n547\n00:28:06.705 --> 00:28:07.215\nRight?\n\n548\n00:28:07.215 --> 00:28:10.405\nBefore I stopped it, as soon as\nI got the lease from server one,\n\n549\n00:28:10.405 --> 00:28:13.045\nthat information was\nreplicated over to server two.\n\n550\n00:28:13.045 --> 00:28:15.775\nSo in the event that he has to take\nover he knows what's going on.\n\n551\n00:28:15.775 --> 00:28:17.835\nIt's like hey,\nwe're working on the same page here.\n\n552\n00:28:17.835 --> 00:28:20.075\nSo it's really cool that\nthey share the information.\n\n553\n00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:23.045\nWe don't have to worry\nabout overlapping scopes.\n\n554\n00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:27.790\nAs far as having two copies of\nthe same scope, very, very good.\n\n555\n00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.970\nSo let me go to the client.\n\n556\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.410\nAnd I'll tell you what.\n\n557\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.820\nWhile we're waiting for that,\nbecause it'll take a couple minutes,\n\n558\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.970\nlet me just see what we got so far.\n\n559\n00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.710\nIt was done at 48, 24,\nwhich should be in about 20 seconds.\n\n560\n00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.540\nSo we're probably trying to\nrenew it in the background.\n\n561\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.460\nRemember at 50% I'm trying\nto renew that lease.\n\n562\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.390\nSo we'll just let him go for a second.\n\n563\n00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.535\nAnd while we're waiting,\nlet's flip back over to server two.\n\n564\n00:28:51.535 --> 00:28:54.640\nBecause if a couple more things that\nI want to share to round this out.\n\n565\n00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.940\nIts just some troubleshooting and really\njust about knowing where to look for\n\n566\n00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.880\nyour log files.\n\n567\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:04.106\nIf I pull up the properties\nof the server we'll see that.\n\n568\n00:29:04.106 --> 00:29:10.181\nNot there, lets go\n\n569\n00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:15.980\nto There we go.\n\n570\n00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.320\nThe properties of IPV four,\non my advanced tab,\n\n571\n00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.130\nI can see my audit log file path,\nSQL Windows System 32 DHCP.\n\n572\n00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.560\nSo if you're having trouble with DHP,\nyou're trying to figure out what's going\n\n573\n00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.380\non, that's one place you\nwanna look is that audit log.\n\n574\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.460\nYou also have your operational\nlogs in the normal place.\n\n575\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.420\nIf you go to your event viewer and\nyou expand out the Windows log,\n\n576\n00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.890\nnot the standard logs.\n\n577\n00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.696\nRight here, let me show you.\n\n578\n00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:47.047\nLets do event viewer\n\n579\n00:29:53.514 --> 00:29:57.500\nAnd in here, we can go to Windows logs.\n\n580\n00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.100\nI'm sorry, not Windows logs, application\nservice logs and then Microsoft.\n\n581\n00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.210\nJust thinking about it.\n\n582\n00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.603\nThere are going to be some in your\napplication log like general lease\n\n583\n00:30:08.603 --> 00:30:09.590\ninformation.\n\n584\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.280\nThat can show up there.\n\n585\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.370\nDepending on what you're troubleshooting,\nhow deep the problem might be.\n\n586\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:21.350\nWe can go down to windows and\nthen we can find DHCP in our list.\n\n587\n00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.870\nThere's my DHP server\nas well as DHP client.\n\n588\n00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:31.080\nAnd under here, I've got my,\nwhat's the one I'm looking for?\n\n589\n00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.120\nMy operational log.\n\n590\n00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.410\nAnd this is going to show me,\nyou can see scoped in dot 000 for\n\n591\n00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.730\nIPP four is activated by lab Mike.\n\n592\n00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.950\nSo that was when I first\nbuilt that scope up.\n\n593\n00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.640\nHere's where I set up\nthe failover relationship.\n\n594\n00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.020\nSo this operational log is\nmore about the backend stuff.\n\n595\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.630\nNot so much the current leases and\nthe renewals.\n\n596\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.900\nThat's going to be in the client log.\n\n597\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.260\nAlso some log information\non the client itself.\n\n598\n00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.990\nYou want to check their application\nlog to see if they have any\n\n599\n00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.010\npertinent information.\n\n600\n00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.600\nAll right, in the meantime let's\ngo back over to our client.\n\n601\n00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.120\nWe'll do an ipconfig all.\n\n602\n00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.490\nAnd notice who my DACP server is now.\n\n603\n00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.190\nIt is 102, which is DACP server two.\n\n604\n00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.080\nSo without me doing anything, all right?\n\n605\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.680\nThe client tried to renew his lease.\n\n606\n00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.030\nCould not contact the original DHP server.\n\n607\n00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.640\nDid a discover.\n\n608\n00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.970\nFound the other DHCP server.\n\n609\n00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:29.900\nThat DHCP server says wait, you've\nalready got a lease, or you had a lease.\n\n610\n00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.190\nSo it was able to renew the lease\nwith the same IP address\n\n611\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.940\nlike nothing ever happened.\n\n612\n00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.370\nJust change owner of the record there and\nwe're good to go ahead.\n\n613\n00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.470\nAnd that's the key, right?\n\n614\n00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.220\nI didn't have to change IP addresses.\n\n615\n00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.740\nI was able to basically renew with the\nsame IP address without doing anything.\n\n616\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.220\nAnd that's how we set up DHCP failover.\n\n617\n00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:47.860\n&gt;&gt; Alright, Mike.\n\n618\n00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.090\nWell thank you again for\n\n619\n00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.800\nhelping us to actually see this idea\nof using something like DHCP fail over.\n\n620\n00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.310\nAnd to show up the ease and\nset up the configuration of it.\n\n621\n00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.310\nAs well as a little bit of basic\ntrouble shooting there and verifying,\n\n622\n00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.250\neverything is up.\n\n623\n00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.330\nAnd we need it to be to\nremain functional here.\n\n624\n00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.920\nNow, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode as well.\n\n625\n00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.300\nSo, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n626\n00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n627\n00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:20.482\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Networking with Windows Server 2016.\n\n628\n00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:26.473\n[MUSIC]\n\n629\n00:32:26.473 --> 00:32:29.805\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.723\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:15.578\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining the Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.702\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:23.810\nIn this episode, we're gonna be focusing\non all things IPv6 and implementing that.\n\n7\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.470\nWith us today, back in studios\nwe have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.370\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody, hello Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.230\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n&gt;&gt; Always a pleasure to spend time with\n\n11\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.890\nyou and all of our studio, and\nnon studio participants here at ITPro.TV.\n\n12\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.420\nWe're gonna be spending some time talking\n\n13\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.460\nabout IPv6 as Cherokee discussed\nwith you in the intro.\n\n14\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.530\nWe're actually gonna step back and\nlook at it from a high level,\n\n15\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.980\nmuch like we did in our prior episodes,\nin our overview for IPv4.\n\n16\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.842\nWhere we went through and\nreally talked about some of the rules, and\n\n17\n00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:56.247\nthe thought process behind how IPv4,\nIP addresses and networks are set up,\n\n18\n00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:57.830\nhow they're configured.\n\n19\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.467\nReminding ourselves for\nthose of you that are familiar with it.\n\n20\n00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:03.771\nHow it's done for perhaps some of you\nthat are a little bit newer to this\n\n21\n00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.970\nwhole thought process and discussion.\n\n22\n00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060\nHopefully giving you some\ngeneral background and\n\n23\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.490\ninformation that proved to valuable.\n\n24\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.880\nWe're gonna attempt to do\nthe same thing here with IPv6.\n\n25\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.250\nAnd of course,\nas always you will let us know,\n\n26\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.050\njust how successful we have\nbeen by telling us whether or\n\n27\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.860\nnot this episode makes sense for\nyou, or any or all of our episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.232\nDo encourage you, especially since we're\nabout to jump into something that maybe\n\n29\n00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:27.927\nnew for a lot of you, to go back and\nmaybe review those IPv4 episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:30.497\nJust make sure you got all the networking,\nthe language,\n\n31\n00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:33.720\nthe syntax the thought process,\nthe rules straight in your head.\n\n32\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.600\nSo as we turn your world\nupside down here in IPv6, and\n\n33\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.630\nexpand your horizons literally and\nfiguratively by expanding the IP universe.\n\n34\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.466\nThings make sense to you, and you're not\nget lost because your not quite clear on\n\n35\n00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.728\nwhat we're doing and where we are.\n\n36\n00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:51.154\nWe are gonna refer to many\nthings that you know from IPv4.\n\n37\n00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:54.370\nBut we're gonna give them new names,\nor extend their functionality.\n\n38\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.953\nWe'll talk for instance about addresses,\nbut we'll give some of them new names.\n\n39\n00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:01.422\nWe'll talk about link local,\nwe'll talk about unicast addresses,\n\n40\n00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:03.380\nwe'll talk about any cast addresses.\n\n41\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.630\nAnd those are address types\nthat are used in IPv6,\n\n42\n00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.550\nand they do map back to\nwhat we know in IPv4.\n\n43\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.680\nBut we do wanna make\nsure we understand that,\n\n44\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.300\nand that you have a reference point for\nthat as we draw them forward.\n\n45\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.960\nSo, just reminding you that there's always\nthe opportunity to go back and review.\n\n46\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.970\nTake advantage of that information,\nuse it, and pay it forward,\n\n47\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.630\nif you will, to better understand\nwhat we're gonna talk about here.\n\n48\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170\nAll right, so now that I've done that,\nCherokee's gonna talk.\n\n49\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.020\nNo, I'm only kidding, she's not gonna\ntalk, she gets all nervous when I do that.\n\n50\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.470\nWhat am I gonna talk about, IPv6, right?\n\n51\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you are gonna help you though,\n\n52\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.490\nif you don't mind,\njust by setting the stage, if you will.\n\n53\n00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nBefore we go in.\n\n54\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.630\nI do have some notes.\n\n55\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.010\nWe'll take a look at\nsome stuff in a minute.\n\n56\n00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.358\nJust about the structure of the IPv6,\nIP address.\n\n57\n00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:44.820\nBut before we do that you had mentioned\nsomething in some of our last episodes.\n\n58\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.826\nWhen I was struggling and fumbling over\nmy words, try to figure out after a full-\n\n59\n00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:49.426\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n60\n00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.464\n&gt;&gt; Set of episodes of shooting DHCP, and\n\n61\n00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.520\ncramming that all into my head.\n\n62\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.080\nHow we could refine and\n\n63\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.710\ndiscuss the idea of how we break\ndown the IP address blocks in IPv6?\n\n64\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.140\nAnd I like what you said a lot, cuz you\nhelp me by throwing out the idea the fact\n\n65\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.430\nthat it's a hexadecimal\nbased numbering system.\n\n66\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.530\nA base 16 hexadecimal numbering system.\n\n67\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.240\nAnd so let's talk about that for\na minute, right?\n\n68\n00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.810\nBecause, that actually is\na really important concept\n\n69\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.640\nwith regards to how we start\nour discussions about IPv6.\n\n70\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.870\nNothing complicated I promise, I promise.\n\n71\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.060\nDon't have that scared look in your eye.\n\n72\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.220\nBut I know you know about IPv6.\n\n73\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.190\nI know that this is something you\nare not only knowledgeable about, but\n\n74\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.060\nyou will spend time thinking about,\n\n75\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.730\ndiscussing, doing your Cisco\nstuff you learned all about.\n\n76\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.095\nIt's very important stuff, and\nI know you understand the value of it.\n\n77\n00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.407\nSo when we think about IPv6, and\n\n78\n00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:40.720\nwe think about taking that IPv4 address\nfrom 32 bits out to 128 bits, right?\n\n79\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.300\nExtending it,\nmaking it bigger as an address space.\n\n80\n00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.140\nAnd also, changing the way we come\nup with the thought process around\n\n81\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.380\nstructuring the address.\n\n82\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.210\nAnd we use the idea of the base\n16 hexadecimal system.\n\n83\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.160\nWouldn't it be great if we could do\nsomething like this as a comparison to\n\n84\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.202\nshow people what we're talking about and\nwhere we come from, where we're going to?\n\n85\n00:03:58.202 --> 00:04:00.530\nYou're gonna tell me,\nwhether or not you think.\n\n86\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.150\nLet's try that again.\n\n87\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.730\nThe magic finger's not working.\n\n88\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.860\nThere we go, okay\n&gt;&gt; You have to charge it.\n\n89\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.480\n&gt;&gt; We have a latency problem today on our\nmagic finger interaction network here.\n\n90\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.010\nSo something like this.\n\n91\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.580\nJust as a conversion chart.\n\n92\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.208\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't this be a good idea to have so\n\n93\n00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:16.084\nthat we can think about, not only\ndiscussing where we came from from\n\n94\n00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.370\na decimal perspective,\nbut our binary equivalent.\n\n95\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.730\nBut then also looking at a hex equivalent.\n\n96\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.680\nBecause as you pointed out,\nit is a hexadecimal based system, right?\n\n97\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you start using\nletters to describe numbers,\n\n98\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.510\nit can get confusing to people.\n\n99\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.060\nSo providing that visual aid,\nat least for me, is a plus.\n\n100\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.760\n&gt;&gt; So something like this would be good?\n\n101\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.825\n&gt;&gt; It would be very valuable.\n\n102\n00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Awesome,so I'm glad we're gonna\nbe able to provide this to you.\n\n103\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.930\nAnd it is as always in the show notes.\n\n104\n00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.049\nYou will have an opportunity\nto get it then.\n\n105\n00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.390\nTake advantage of it,\ndownload it, if you will.\n\n106\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.331\nIt is in Excel and\nI put some of these charts in Excel.\n\n107\n00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.824\nAnd these episodes around\nthe Networking stuff in particular.\n\n108\n00:04:46.824 --> 00:04:49.434\nJust because I think that way's easier for\nyou to work with,\n\n109\n00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:51.180\nyou want to be able to modify them.\n\n110\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.210\nMake notes, study with them,\nyou know copy them,\n\n111\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.840\nmake another tab and then maybe\nplay around with them a little bit.\n\n112\n00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.680\nIt's easier to do that than if it's\nlike work table, or a notepad,\n\n113\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.760\nor something like that.\n\n114\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.878\nSomething that works for everybody.\n\n115\n00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:06.012\nBut you could see, we do have\na basic standard 16 thought process,\n\n116\n00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:11.163\nin terms of letters and numbers here,\nright, decimal from 0 to 15, 16 places.\n\n117\n00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:13.668\nWe have the binary equivalent\nthat are given to you here.\n\n118\n00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:17.645\nAnd we have the hex decimal equivalents,\nwe do 0 through 9 which already exist,\n\n119\n00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:18.633\nby the way, right?\n\n120\n00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:21.924\nLogically but then we got to 10,\nwe have to flip over and\n\n121\n00:05:21.924 --> 00:05:24.058\nwe start using the letters, right?\n\n122\n00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:24.723\nA through F,\n\n123\n00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:28.440\nto augment our ability to be able to\nspecify what our values are gonna be.\n\n124\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.120\nAnd this is where we wind up\ngetting our IPv6 addresses that\n\n125\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.030\nlook a little strange\nto us in the beginning.\n\n126\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.940\nBut ultimately as we think about them,\nwe realize that they're blocks of hex,\n\n127\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.720\nand then we're able to start\ninteracting with them that way.\n\n128\n00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.270\nThey make a lot more sense to us.\n\n129\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.400\nAnd so, hopefully, we'll come back\nto this later, but hopefully,\n\n130\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.275\nsomething like this also\nwill make sense to you.\n\n131\n00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:52.638\nI gave you a type of address,\nI gave you an IPv4 address equivalent, or\n\n132\n00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.150\nan IPv6 address equivalent here.\n\n133\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.750\nAnd the thing I'm talking about,\nis something like this for instance,\n\n134\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.740\nwhen we look at, our auto configured\nright here, address in an IPv4,\n\n135\n00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.150\nthat would our HIPAA-based address, right?\n\n136\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.500\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n137\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.317\nBut you'll see the concept also\nwith multi-casting of what a hex\n\n138\n00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:12.727\nblock looks like.\n\n139\n00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:17.016\nFE80 or FF00 is gonna be one of\nthe equivalent blocks in hex, for IPv6,\n\n140\n00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:17.894\nas you can see.\n\n141\n00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:21.994\nAnd so, being able to figure out\nthe logic of that, track through that,\n\n142\n00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:26.710\nand understand that, is what we're gonna\nfocus on and start talking about here.\n\n143\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.910\nSo, to that end, just some notes\nto help us go through this.\n\n144\n00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.644\nWe go full strings,\n\n145\n00:06:30.644 --> 00:06:33.760\nI'm gonna block out half of what we're\ntalking about as we scroll down here.\n\n146\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.900\nSo we did talk about the idea\nthat we do have this idea of\n\n147\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.330\nusing a hex based system letters and\nnumbers.\n\n148\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.200\nWe have 0 through 9 for our first 10.\n\n149\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.980\nWe then add our six new symbols for\nhex, a through f.\n\n150\n00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.300\nSo as a result, we get 128 bit\nIPv6 address as we talked about.\n\n151\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.531\nAnd in binary, and\nI have to put this up on the screen,\n\n152\n00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:54.377\ncuz I'm not gonna recite all this, right?\n\n153\n00:06:54.377 --> 00:06:58.000\nIt looks like all this, and by the way\nit would be one continuous stream.\n\n154\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.100\nImpossible to do that or\nelse it'll make the font so small,\n\n155\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.980\nthat you wouldn't be able to see anything.\n\n156\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.908\nRight, and so you can see that we\ndo have one, two, three, four,\n\n157\n00:07:06.908 --> 00:07:10.410\nfive, six, seven, eight blocks there.\n\n158\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.690\nRight of our binary equivalent for\nan IPv6 address.\n\n159\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.900\nThe conversion chart is the Excel\nspreadsheet I was just showing you,\n\n160\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.400\nit helps us to understand that.\n\n161\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.750\nWe convert that into hex using that chart.\n\n162\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.969\nAnd I'm gonna show you just the way\nwe would do this logically,\n\n163\n00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.065\nin a minute we will go back and\nwe'll refer to the chart here,\n\n164\n00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:30.945\nwere gonna chunk essentially\nthis into a block of four.\n\n165\n00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:34.400\nWe're gonna look at our chart,\nlook for the equivalent, and\n\n166\n00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.929\nthen look up essentially\nthe reference whatever that will be.\n\n167\n00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:39.630\nAnd then we'll start mapping this out.\n\n168\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.810\nAnd so if we took for instance this\nright here, 0010 as our first block.\n\n169\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.875\nAnd if we go over here to our spreadsheet,\n\n170\n00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.707\nlet's just come back over\nhere to our conversion chart.\n\n171\n00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:53.727\nAnd what I will do is the following,\n\n172\n00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:58.071\njust minimize this here,\nso we can see it this way.\n\n173\n00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.217\nGive me just a second just to go down.\n\n174\n00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:06.044\nIf you look at 0010, and\nwe look for 0010 right here,\n\n175\n00:08:06.044 --> 00:08:10.910\nwe see that as the hex equivalent of 2,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.660\nAnd so if we start to translate\nthis address, and by the way if\n\n177\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.890\nI just do it right here, if I could\njust kind of get it to the right size so\n\n178\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.760\nI can block it, let me just do that, and\nsee if I can then hold on half a second.\n\n179\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.920\nThis is all about the mechanics and\nmathematics of managing screen area here.\n\n180\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.826\nLet me scroll down this way and do this.\n\n181\n00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:34.695\nI just want to try to show it to you\nby blocking it off this way, but\n\n182\n00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:37.905\nalso having the address right\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n183\n00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:40.895\nJust so we can kind of see both.\n\n184\n00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.685\nAnd so when I do this 0010, right?\n\n185\n00:08:42.685 --> 00:08:47.160\nConverted over to hex equivalent to,\nyou'll see that becomes the first item.\n\n186\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.060\nRight there in my block for\nthe first part of the first four digits or\n\n187\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.480\nalphanumeric equivalents that are entered\ninto the first part of my IPv6 address.\n\n188\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.080\nAnd literally, I would walk through that\nstream of binary bits four block items\n\n189\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.080\nat a time or four bits at a time, chunking\nas I go, converting back to the chart and\n\n190\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.460\ndoing my lookup and\nthen coming up with my equivalent.\n\n191\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.060\nNow do you want to do this manually or\ndo you want to do this and\n\n192\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.160\nhave the system do it for you?\n\n193\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.090\nClearly, we could sit here and we\nliterally could walk through this entire\n\n194\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.370\nprocess and come up with that IP\naddress right down here at the bottom.\n\n195\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.600\nAnd that is going to be the equivalent\ngoing through and actually converting.\n\n196\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.650\nOr taking a look at how\nto convert every set or\n\n197\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.755\nblock of 4 bits here as we go\nthrough all the way through.\n\n198\n00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:37.555\nBut do you really want to do that before\nwe get to the question you wanted to\n\n199\n00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:38.335\nask, right?\n\n200\n00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:42.635\nUltimately, clearly, the answer is\nprobably not on a regular basis, right?\n\n201\n00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:46.230\nBut is it important to understand\nthe logic of how we would do it?\n\n202\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.400\nIt's important to understand the way it\ncan be done so that as we look at and\n\n203\n00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.100\nIP bit block and we look at, ultimately,\n\n204\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.920\nthe IP address, we could at least\nget a sense of where it comes from.\n\n205\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.760\nAnd it's important to have a sense\nof how this is done, right?\n\n206\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.210\nEven if we're not going to engage in\ndoing this on a regular basis, right?\n\n207\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no I was just going to\nsay it's very cumbersome and\n\n208\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.460\ntedious to go a head and\ntype all that out.\n\n209\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.760\nSo I was just wondering even with\nour converted version there's got\n\n210\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.670\nto be a better way, Adam?\n\n211\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, so if we go back to\nfull screen for it we can see,\n\n212\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.460\nso I do say this is a pretty\nlong address right.\n\n213\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.650\nI wonder if we could shorten that up\nany and so maybe there is some, or\n\n214\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.270\nare some rules or\nshort hand items that we can use, right?\n\n215\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.140\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n216\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.540\nBecause Cherokee has a great point, which\nis it's shorter than the binary, right.\n\n217\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.630\nI mean when we do reduce it down\nultimately to our address string, and\n\n218\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.560\nthis is what our IPv6 address would\nlook like from that binary strain.\n\n219\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.140\nIt is going to ultimately be that.\n\n220\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.200\nBut even when we get to that\nboy that's still a mouthful or\n\n221\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.570\na handful in this case right?\n\n222\n00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.980\nOr a finger full to have to type out and\nactually deal with.\n\n223\n00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.140\nAnd so there is a better way right?\n\n224\n00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.880\nUltimately there are some shortcuts.\n\n225\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.150\nSome rules that we can leverage,\nhopefully if we remember what they are and\n\n226\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.130\nwe know of course, what they aren't.\n\n227\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.790\nEven if you don't know, we'll tell you, so\n\n228\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.620\nyou will know by the time\nwe're done talking.\n\n229\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.900\nBut you can see them on the screen.\n\n230\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.110\nWe are going to give you some\nopportunities here to condense and\n\n231\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.460\nmake life a little easier.\n\n232\n00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.980\nAnd there are some things that stand out.\n\n233\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.790\nFor instance,\n\n234\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:08.980\nwe do have two groups of blocks right here\nthat are identical for instance, right?\n\n235\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.680\nThat maybe something we can look at and\nperhaps take advantage of.\n\n236\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.040\nWe're going to talk\nabout things like that.\n\n237\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.670\nWe're also going to talk about this\nidea of leading zeroes, right?\n\n238\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.370\nAnd whether or\nnot we can do some with that.\n\n239\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.280\nWe'll start with the leading zero concept,\nbut\n\n240\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.580\nthen we'll go back to this idea of two or\n\n241\n00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.300\nmore consecutive blocks that are going to\nhave those zeros and what we do with them.\n\n242\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.796\nSo let's start here, rule number one,\ndiscarding leading zeros.\n\n243\n00:11:30.796 --> 00:11:34.170\nThis is going to help us to have\na sense to what we can do and\n\n244\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.290\nso you'll see here in block number five,\nand if we're numbering,\n\n245\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.150\njust to be clear, left to right, right.\n\n246\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.610\nSo block one, block two,\nblock three, block four, block five.\n\n247\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.860\nIf you look at the original address,\n\n248\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.390\nI didn't really put them\nexactly over each other, but\n\n249\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.840\nthey're fairly close if I do this probably\nget them to line up just about right.\n\n250\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.230\nNow we can see them a little bit easier\nand kind of keep the blocks lined up.\n\n251\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.320\nAnd when we think about block one,\nblock two, block three, block four,\n\n252\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.260\nblock five, leading zeroes right here\nwhat we're doing is we're truncating.\n\n253\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.200\nEssentially we're removing\nthose leading zeroes.\n\n254\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.769\nYou can see the effect of that right down\nhere where we still have the six and\n\n255\n00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:13.940\nthe three in block five, but\nwe’ve removed the double zeroes,\n\n256\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.030\nthat are the leading zeroes and just\nsimply removed them out of the address.\n\n257\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.540\nAnd by doing that and\n\n258\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.620\nthen reminding ourselves, because we\nhave built-in logic that says, hey,\n\n259\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:28.080\nwhen we see a block that is not fully\ninstantiated, right, with all four values.\n\n260\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.430\nThat must mean that we\nhad leading zeros and\n\n261\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.610\nsince we've removed them, we know we\njust have to put them back when we use\n\n262\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.830\nthe address where the logic is that\nthe stack will translate that for us.\n\n263\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.670\nAnd so we know that that's the case.\n\n264\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:45.570\nSo when we see a truncated block without\nfully instantiated four digits there,\n\n265\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.160\nwhatever they would be if we see maybe two\nthen we know we had leading zeros, right?\n\n266\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.010\nAnd we know that we could\nsimply remove those and\n\n267\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.260\nthat that's going to be a shorthand.\n\n268\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.640\nSo we do see that and\nwe can see that we emit those there.\n\n269\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.720\nWhat about rule number two?\n\n270\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.690\nIf two more blocks have\nconsecutive zeroes,\n\n271\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.440\nwell I did point that out blocks six and\nseven right up here,\n\n272\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.960\nright we can omit them all and\nreplace them with the double colon sign.\n\n273\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.080\nSo you'll see that a further truncation\ngetting rid of block six and seven right\n\n274\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.190\nhere and allowing us to simply specify\ntwo colons back to back essentially.\n\n275\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.890\nWe talked about deduping at some point.\n\n276\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.760\nYou and I were chatting about that,\nCherokee.\n\n277\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.600\nAnd the idea of essentially\ndeduping the address here is what\n\n278\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.220\nwe're doing by removing\nthose consecutive blocks.\n\n279\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.970\nBut as I point out here right below,\nconsecutive blocks of zeroes can\n\n280\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.300\nbe replaced only once within the address,\nright?\n\n281\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.120\nSo we just have to be aware of that and\nunderstand that because if we had\n\n282\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.870\nadditional blocks of zeroes, they could\nbe shrunk down to a single zero block,\n\n283\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.180\nyou'll see right over here, we actually\nhave additional blocks to zeros.\n\n284\n00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.230\nThey're not going to be consecutive, you\nknow they are jumped over in other words.\n\n285\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.910\nWe have a whole bunch of\nstuff in the middle here.\n\n286\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.380\nSo this is what we would say\nis the consecutive block,\n\n287\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.430\nwe'll trunk it down with two semi-colons.\n\n288\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.870\nThese zeros can also be dealt with and we\nsimply just remove the repetitive zeros at\n\n289\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.120\nthe end of the block,\nleaving only the first one there.\n\n290\n00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.710\nAnd you'll see that we can then\nfurther shorten this address, right?\n\n291\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.425\nAnd so as I go down here, you'll see\nthat the address ultimately becomes\n\n292\n00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:19.351\n2001:0 to represent\nthe remaining zeros in this\n\n293\n00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:23.490\nspot after we've done the truncations\nin blocks five and six.\n\n294\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.520\nWe shrink that block to a single zero,\nplaceholder for the entire block.\n\n295\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.430\nBlock 3238, so block 3 doesn't change.\n\n296\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.670\nIt's been consistent there all along.\n\n297\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.070\nBlock four doesn't change, DFE1,\nbeen consistent all along.\n\n298\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.590\nSo we leave that alone.\n\n299\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:44.060\nA block, if I remember we took off the\nleading zeros so we are minus two there.\n\n300\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.580\nWe only have 63 left over, but\nwe know there's two zeros there.\n\n301\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.700\nOur leading zeros as we call them.\n\n302\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.830\nWe truncated the consecutive zero blocks,\nright?\n\n303\n00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.390\nBlocks six and seven.\n\n304\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.350\nTwo zeros truncated\ndown to two semicolons.\n\n305\n00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.370\nBlock eight FEFB has been\nleft in tact because again\n\n306\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.970\nnothing that we would do there.\n\n307\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.170\nAnd so by applying some simple rules,\n\n308\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.460\nwe've been able to shrink\nour IP address down.\n\n309\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.180\nNow it's nowhere near as\ncumbersome as it was.\n\n310\n00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.170\nIt's still a handful to manage.\n\n311\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.585\nWe got to wrap our heads around the idea\nthat we have a different IP address form,\n\n312\n00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:19.865\na different structure we\nhave to work with, and\n\n313\n00:15:19.865 --> 00:15:21.285\nobviously a different look and feel.\n\n314\n00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:23.925\nIt's a little foreign to us if\nwe're not familiar with IPv6.\n\n315\n00:15:23.925 --> 00:15:27.255\nHere we used the IPv4\ndot decimal notation.\n\n316\n00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:30.105\nIt's a little bit different, hex notation.\n\n317\n00:15:30.105 --> 00:15:33.755\nBut as soon as we can wrap our\nheads around the logic of this, and\n\n318\n00:15:33.755 --> 00:15:36.920\nwe can get used to the rules,\nit's going to make it a lot easier for us.\n\n319\n00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.460\nNot only to read IPv6 addresses, which\nis important because you're going to see\n\n320\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.320\nthese rules applied and\nshorthanded in the IP config, right?\n\n321\n00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.970\nWhen you look at an interface,\n\n322\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.090\nyou're going to see an address\nrepresented with these rules applied.\n\n323\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.940\nYou may not, in other words, see the full\naddress, you'll see the truncated version\n\n324\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.803\nof the address because these\nrules get applied automatically.\n\n325\n00:15:56.803 --> 00:16:01.688\nSo instead of something like this, right,\nyou will ultimately get something like\n\n326\n00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:06.460\nthis if you do an ipconfig, let's say,\non An interface that's running IPv6.\n\n327\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.490\nAnd you would have to understand that\nthat address has had the rules applied,\n\n328\n00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.190\nfiltered essentially or shrunk down so\nthat it's more manageable.\n\n329\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.410\nSo you do wanna take a moment and\n\n330\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.060\nreally just kind of internalize\nthis thought process.\n\n331\n00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.230\nThink about it, I'm gonna leave\nthe rules up on the screen for a minute.\n\n332\n00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.770\nI know Cherokee's been dying\nto say something here,\n\n333\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.770\nshe's just been real patient.\n\n334\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.200\nSo we're gonna let her ask her question or\nmake her comment.\n\n335\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.970\nBut I'm gonna leave them up real quick\njust while we're talking so you guys can\n\n336\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.720\nactually think through the logic of\nthis and absorb this a little bit.\n\n337\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.270\nWhile we're actually discussing this.\n\n338\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\nI think it's a really great idea and\n\n339\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.820\nyou've done a good job breaking it\ndown because it is important to\n\n340\n00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.520\nunderstand in my opinion how this\ninformation does happen in the background.\n\n341\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.580\nBut once we've performed our leading\n\n342\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.785\nzero compression as well as\nthe truncation of those continuous zeroes.\n\n343\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.610\nI've always been told\nthat you can not apply\n\n344\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.730\nthat truncation more than\nonce within one IPv6 address.\n\n345\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.400\nSo that's maybe something\nto keep in mind as well.\n\n346\n00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.310\n&gt;&gt; We do talk about that right?\n\n347\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.470\nBecause we talked about the fact that\nonce weve done all that, and our leading\n\n348\n00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.140\nzeroes, we talked about the fact that\nonce we do the leading zero truncation,\n\n349\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:20.540\nthat any remaining zeroes, right can\nbe replaced only once right here right?\n\n350\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.410\nSo consecutive blocks is placed\nonly once by the double quote.\n\n351\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.540\nCan we go back to full screen cuz I'm\ntalking and we can't really see what I'm\n\n352\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.690\ntalking about and you'll see here I did\nsay specifically as you pointed out.\n\n353\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes I know you said that.\n\n354\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.210\nIt's just sometimes people\nkind of question that.\n\n355\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.350\nI've had a lot of questions about that.\n\n356\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.100\nSo no, it is important to note.\n\n357\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.890\nSo to be clear for both of us,\nwe're putting it in the notes and\n\n358\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.500\nshowing it to you to make sure\nthat we're reinforcing it for you.\n\n359\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.917\nWe're both saying the same thing.\n\n360\n00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We just want to make sure\n\n361\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.330\nthat you see it there and\nthat you're aware of it, but yes.\n\n362\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.850\nWe can do that truncation only once.\n\n363\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.920\nSo in other words, this trick of\ntaking the consecutive zero blocks and\n\n364\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.710\ntruncating them down to this essentially,\nright, is a one-time thing per IP address.\n\n365\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.190\nAnd as a result of that, any additional\nzero blocks can be shrunk to a single\n\n366\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.810\nzero block but not truncated the way\nthey were with the consecutive block.\n\n367\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.450\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And that's an important distinction.\n\n368\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.930\nWould you wanna make sure we are familiar\nwith think about and kind of Internalize\n\n369\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:18.430\nthat thought process cuz again it will be\napplied and we'll look at the address.\n\n370\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.070\nAnd just like we've gotten\nreally good at reading an IPv4\n\n371\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.370\naddress looking at it going yeah I\nknow exactly what class that is.\n\n372\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.540\nIf I see a sub net mask\nas we've talked about.\n\n373\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.330\nI probably got a sense in my mind of\nwhat kind of networking is happening.\n\n374\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.690\nAm doing supernetting?\n\n375\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.680\nClasses internet domain routing.\n\n376\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.060\nAm I extending my networks\nat the expense of my host or\n\n377\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.080\nvice versa, supernetting, subnetting?\n\n378\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.590\nWhatever.\n\n379\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.900\nWe've been through all that.\n\n380\n00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.570\nMy point is a lot of us can\nlook at an IPv4 address block,\n\n381\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.330\nwith the appropriate\nsupporting information.\n\n382\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:51.240\nSubnet, mask, default gateway,\nand very quickly in our minds\n\n383\n00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.650\nkind of go through, and we can get\na sense of When I hit my arm on the side\n\n384\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.030\nhere sometimes maybe I make a little\nnoise with my bracelet, so I apologize.\n\n385\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.420\n&gt;&gt; I thought I was making\nnoise with my microphone.\n\n386\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.320\n&gt;&gt; No, it may have just been me.\n\n387\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.730\nI think I hit the side of the table here.\n\n388\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.800\nI got all this crazy jewelry on, and\nwhen I do that I'm pretty clunky and\n\n389\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.580\nnoisy sometimes.\n\n390\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.270\nThat may have just been me, so I apologize\nif was doing that while we were We have in\n\n391\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.120\nour mind, at least most of us\nanyway that are familiar with IPv4.\n\n392\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.410\nWe have, in our minds the logic,\nthe math and the thought process.\n\n393\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.180\nWhat we got to do is get used\nto the same idea with IPv6.\n\n394\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.420\nThis is coming whether we like it or not.\n\n395\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.700\nThis is the future just like I keep\ntelling you PowerShell is the future,\n\n396\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.570\nit's going to be here eventually.\n\n397\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.330\nIt's already here by the way, right?\n\n398\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.910\nBut it's gonna be here eventually.\n\n399\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.000\nAnd by the way IPv6 has been around for\nsome time.\n\n400\n00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.540\nThis is not the future that's coming,\nthis is the future that's been here for\n\n401\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.540\nover a decade.\n\n402\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.440\nWe just haven't really taken it on and\n\n403\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.160\nstarted to internalize it inside\nof Our enterprise networks.\n\n404\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.280\nBut there are many networks\nthat run IBP 6 today.\n\n405\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.870\nIt's incredibly prevalent in\nmany portions of the world.\n\n406\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.960\nIt's used extensively in Europe,\nfor instance.\n\n407\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.120\nused extensively across many networks.\n\n408\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.790\nIt's used for routing on the internet.\n\n409\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:02.650\nYet we see it in a lot of places,\nwe just may not be paying attention to it.\n\n410\n00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.640\nIt's kind of subtlety In the background\nsince Windows 7 we've had\n\n411\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.600\nsupport natively for IPv6 in our stack.\n\n412\n00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.960\nWe could enable it going back to XP and\nturn it on if we wanted to and enable it.\n\n413\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.410\nWe could go back all the way to 2000 but\nwe had to really turn ourselves inside out\n\n414\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.580\nto be able to add IPv6 support enabled and\nrun it.\n\n415\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.930\nSo we've had it around for some time.\n\n416\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.750\nJust a question of now really getting\nuse to the idea of leveraging it.\n\n417\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.570\nAnd as a result of that, really getting\ncomfortable with what it means and\n\n418\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.710\nwhat our capabilities will be as a result.\n\n419\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.760\nAnd so that's what we're focusing\non as we begin our conversations.\n\n420\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean, even, and\nI know you know about this.\n\n421\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.650\nYou talked about it quite a bit, but you\nmay encounter a situation where you have\n\n422\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:48.720\nsome kind of regulatory compliance that\nenforces the use of IPv6 on that network.\n\n423\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.520\nAnd so I was just going to\nsay movie reference here,\n\n424\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.960\nI have to give a little disclaimer.\n\n425\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.600\nBut it's like Aladdin,\nwe're going on a magic carpet ride and\n\n426\n00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.795\nwe're singing a whole new world, right?\n\n427\n00:20:57.795 --> 00:21:01.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, I don't think I've ever\n\n428\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.420\ntalked about networking and\nbrought Aladdin and Disney into the mix.\n\n429\n00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.560\nSo, I like that.\n\n430\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is just,\n\n431\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.600\nthat's awesome, that is cool.\n\n432\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.150\nIt is like a magic carpet ride.\n\n433\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.820\nI mean, it's fun, exciting, it's new.\n\n434\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.575\nYou gotta wear seatbelts,\nwe don't have airbags, so pay attention.\n\n435\n00:21:13.575 --> 00:21:14.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n436\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.850\nthe reality is\n&gt;&gt; You know is a new adventure.\n\n437\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.010\nAnd it is this brave new\nworld that opens up for\n\n438\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:23.370\nus, and it's a world that in many respects\nis very similar to what we already know.\n\n439\n00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.490\nBut at the same time,\nthere are different rules of engagement.\n\n440\n00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.510\nAs long as we're familiar with them, and\njust like it took us a little bit of time\n\n441\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.060\nto learn the rules of engagement for\nthe IPV 4 world, we've come to take it for\n\n442\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.550\ngranted, and just expect that they're\nthere, and we don't even think about them.\n\n443\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.240\nI mean how often do we really stop and\nsay wow, I gotta really sit down and\n\n444\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.600\nthink about How those things work.\n\n445\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.970\nWe just assume that they work really\nwell these days, because they do.\n\n446\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.410\nAnd IPv6 is that same thing,\n\n447\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.860\nit's just that we have to get used to\nthe idea that it will be that force.\n\n448\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.491\nThat's going to be important.\n\n449\n00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:52.034\n&gt;&gt; Plus you already noted this,\n\n450\n00:21:52.034 --> 00:21:55.924\nit's kind of cool that you can take\nthat pre-existing IPv4 knowledge and\n\n451\n00:21:55.924 --> 00:22:00.320\nthen kind of compare you have something\ncomparable to really asses IPv6 too.\n\n452\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:05.640\nNot in every situation, but\nthere are a lot of kind gimmes there.\n\n453\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.040\n&gt;&gt; There is a lot of synergy,\na lot of sameness.\n\n454\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.160\nThere is certainly a lot of difference,\nbut there is a lot of sameness or\n\n455\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.960\nsimilarities, and\nwe can leverage those, absolutely.\n\n456\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.830\nSo speaking of similarities, sameness,\nand differences, prefix an interface ID.\n\n457\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.680\nYou kind of see them at\nthe bottom of my notes there.\n\n458\n00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.460\nBut let's just talk about them for\na minute.\n\n459\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.890\nThe idea here as we just continue to build\nout in this introductory episode our\n\n460\n00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.020\nthought process around what is IPv6?\n\n461\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.780\nHow do we work with this address?\n\n462\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.430\nWhat does it look like?\n\n463\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.740\nWhy is it important to us?\n\n464\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.520\nWhen we think about overall\nlet's just go back up here to\n\n465\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.710\n&gt;&gt; Right here.\n\n466\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.070\nWe'll just kinda go up to\nthe full version of the address,\n\n467\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.660\njust so we can highlight this and kind\nof see it before we look at truncation.\n\n468\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.640\nYou know, when we think about\nthe beginning part of the address,\n\n469\n00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.980\nthe first four blocks there,\nthis is what we're thinking about.\n\n470\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Where the prefix is the part of\nthe address that has the bits that\n\n471\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.370\nare going to be set up,\nor our fixed values.\n\n472\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.240\nThis is essentially\nthe sub-net prefix bits, right?\n\n473\n00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.760\nThat's what we're thinking of here.\n\n474\n00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.200\nIt's equivalent to the network ID for\n\n475\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.970\nthe IPv4 address we were taking\nabout equivalency, right.\n\n476\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.140\nAnd what's similar, what do we know,\nwhat don't we know.\n\n477\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.090\nAnd the idea is that if we look at that,\nthat part of the address,\n\n478\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.310\nactually minus the little semicolon.\n\n479\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.680\nBut I mean we can just say that it goes\nup to that point essentially, right.\n\n480\n00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.340\nThat is going to be the equivalent\nof the network portion of our IPv4\n\n481\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.740\naddress when we think about\nour summon mass, right.\n\n482\n00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.510\nBecause that's what identifies initially\nwhat network we are a member of or\n\n483\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.910\nwhat network we are a part of.\n\n484\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.390\n&gt;&gt; In the address and\nthen we just simply call prefixes in IPv6\n\n485\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.470\nwhat we call a subnet mask in IPv4, in\nother words is what I'm trying to explain.\n\n486\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.350\nProbably not being as clear as I could\nbe with that, but that's the idea.\n\n487\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.630\nAnd so again, it's one of those language\nthings that I was talking about.\n\n488\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.380\nWhen I was saying hey it's gonna be very\nsimilar but we just have to understand and\n\n489\n00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.981\nlearn and understand the logic and\nthe language of what we're referring to.\n\n490\n00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:55.960\nBut that is really\nthe same thought process.\n\n491\n00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.699\nAnd so the prefix is equated to or is the\nsame process as The subnet mask in IPv4.\n\n492\n00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:03.765\nAnd so thinking about it looking at that.\n\n493\n00:24:03.765 --> 00:24:08.681\nThat would be our network portion of\nthe IP address that tells us we're\n\n494\n00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:13.370\non that network the 2001\n0003238 DFE1 network.\n\n495\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.720\nTry telling somebody at work that's\nthe network you want to join next time you\n\n496\n00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.670\ntalk to them, and\nsee what they tell you, right.\n\n497\n00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.190\nBut that's gonna indicate our\nnetwork portion of our course.\n\n498\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.300\nObviously the other half of the blocks\nthere from 0063 on through the end,\n\n499\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.720\nFEFB, is gonna represent our\nunique ID Our IP Address that is\n\n500\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.120\nthe host portion in other works IPV 4\nlanguage, unique within that network.\n\n501\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.380\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I give you analogies,\nI don't know if you'll like this one, but.\n\n502\n00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.130\n&gt;&gt; There's always that possibility.\n\n503\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.480\n&gt;&gt; I had a student give me this\na while ago, and I like it.\n\n504\n00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.110\nAnd it was actually talking about IPV 4,\nbut it can relate here as well.\n\n505\n00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:50.540\nSo If we crack that address in half and\nthat first chunk, that network portion,\n\n506\n00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.600\nkind of like the street address,\n\n507\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.610\nwhereas that second half, that second\nchunk is your house number, right?\n\n508\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.380\n&gt;&gt; So, the street address for\nthe network address, in other words.\n\n509\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; The prefix or\n\n510\n00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.660\nthe subnet mask address\nthat indicates network.\n\n511\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.820\nAnd then the host portion would\nbe the equivalent of your\n\n512\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.840\nhouse address on the street.\n\n513\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the number.\n\n514\n00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.620\n&gt;&gt; Your unique identifier\nwithin the street itself.\n\n515\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.280\nYeah I mean that works,\nit's identical to what we think of and\n\n516\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.220\nit's saying the same thing, right?\n\n517\n00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.010\nIt's just a matter of how\ndo we specify group and\n\n518\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.160\nthen how do we specify unique member\nwithin group, cuz that's really what we're\n\n519\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.350\ntalking about when we strip away all of\nthe specificity and talk about just simply\n\n520\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:30.210\nHow do we identify a logical element that\ntells us we're a member of this and work\n\n521\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.870\non this area and then a unique instance or\nID within that area that we work in?\n\n522\n00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.610\nIt's the same thing, so\nthat works really well.\n\n523\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.250\nNothing wrong with that at all,\nabsolutely.\n\n524\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.420\nYou ever see that car commercial,\n\n525\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.920\nI know I'm asking probably no reason I\nshould even ask Because the answer is,\n\n526\n00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.590\nyou can just tell me now,\nno, and we can move along.\n\n527\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.380\nBut they have a car commercial.\n\n528\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.110\nActually, I think it's\nan insurance commercial.\n\n529\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.010\nBut one of the scenes in\nthe commercial I saw recently was\n\n530\n00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.225\nyou have this guy's walking\na young lady Lady through.\n\n531\n00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:59.555\nHey, you know, welcome to the company and\nyou would get all these great benefits.\n\n532\n00:25:59.555 --> 00:26:03.185\nAnd so, you know, they talk about\nthe world's second best sushi chef.\n\n533\n00:26:03.185 --> 00:26:04.475\nWhy couldn't I get the first one?\n\n534\n00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:05.635\nWell because he was busy.\n\n535\n00:26:05.635 --> 00:26:07.535\nSo they have almost everything you'd want.\n\n536\n00:26:07.535 --> 00:26:10.585\nAnd at one point he looks out across\nthe parking lot and he he says,\n\n537\n00:26:10.585 --> 00:26:14.025\nwe have these great personal\ntransportation for everybody.\n\n538\n00:26:14.025 --> 00:26:17.465\nAnd you just see a sea of like, they're\nBMW's, but it's like a sea of white cars.\n\n539\n00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:20.090\nLike nothing But every car's identical.\n\n540\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.320\nAnd actually,\nit's not an insurance commercial,\n\n541\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.950\nI think it's a commercial for Audi.\n\n542\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.340\nAnd so,\nat that point you cut to like her face,\n\n543\n00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:32.250\nshe just seems disgusted, she leaves and\nshe's in like a black car driving down\n\n544\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.940\nthe road like a customised car,\nand that's like the whole thing.\n\n545\n00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.470\nSo it's similar to that.\n\n546\n00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.310\nWhen we think about this, I don't\nwanna be concerned about necessarily\n\n547\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.390\nwhat is the specificity of the analogy,\nbut\n\n548\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.840\nrather generically,\nwhat do all the analogies point to.\n\n549\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.850\nThe idea of a group And then the idea\nof uniqueness within the group,\n\n550\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.340\nand that's the prefix and the following\non address that gives us our host ID,\n\n551\n00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.460\nand that's exactly what we need,\nregardless of how we get there.\n\n552\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.830\nSo that was good.\nI like that analogy.\n\n553\n00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:57.480\n&gt;&gt; Never saw it.\n\n554\n00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Good stuff.\n\n555\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.270\nI didn't think you would have.\n\n556\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.670\nI was just actually just throwing it out\nthere, just cuz we need to have that and\n\n557\n00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.860\nestablish that In every show,\nalthough Cherokee does pertain to and\n\n558\n00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.830\nultimately watches some streaming media.\n\n559\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:13.180\nIt seems very random, odd, and different,\ndifferent levels than most of us.\n\n560\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.720\nBut then again you have a young child.\n\n561\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.810\nSo you do watch things that are probably\nmore aligned with her needs and therefore-\n\n562\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.350\n&gt;&gt; Your children.\n\n563\n00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, but he's a little older.\n\n564\n00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.710\nYou're not necessarily watching Aladdin.\n\n565\n00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:25.460\n&gt;&gt; Cartoons.\n&gt;&gt; Just.\n\n566\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.710\nYou're watching more with your daughter.\n\n567\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:27.290\n&gt;&gt; No that's for me.\n\n568\n00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.330\nMe.\n&gt;&gt; That's for you.\n\n569\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n570\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.270\nI love all the Disney stuff.\n\n571\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.380\nI mean, I'm of an age where I grew\nup with some of the original ones,\n\n572\n00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.400\nbefore they all came out or recreated.\n\n573\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.050\nBut I love watching them.\n\n574\n00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.720\nI used to love that one.\n\n575\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.440\nMy kids were little, watching all\nthat stuff, that was really cool.\n\n576\n00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.600\nI sneak around and watch whenever So,\nI can appreciate that.\n\n577\n00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.060\nAlright, so we have talked about prefix,\ntalked about the IP Address,\n\n578\n00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.080\nhow we would break it down.\n\n579\n00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.860\nRemember, we do have subnets,\nprefixes, routes, address ranges.\n\n580\n00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.310\nThey are all represented here for IPv6.\n\n581\n00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.620\nIt's just a matter of what we call\nthem and how we deal with them.\n\n582\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.980\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n583\n00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.740\nWe do represent the address prefix Are\nnotations we talk about here in this form\n\n584\n00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.550\ntraditionally.\n\n585\n00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.550\nNow, if we wanted to\njust modify this perhaps.\n\n586\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.450\nSo if we took a look at this down here,\nsince I'm talking about this.\n\n587\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.490\nIf we just go right here and\nyou'll see right here,\n\n588\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.510\nthis is going to be what we would do for\nsomething.\n\n589\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.270\nLet's just put this right here and\njust highlight it.\n\n590\n00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:25.950\n2001 DA::/48 we do use still\nour short hand notation,\n\n591\n00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.800\nas you can see there,\nthat's gonna be our route prefix.\n\n592\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.440\nAnd you'll see here this is\na subnet prefix right over here.\n\n593\n00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:36.765\nSo you can see we have those and\nwe do represent them.\n\n594\n00:28:36.765 --> 00:28:39.745\nI didn't highlight the two on the end of\nthat there, but you can kind of see, or\n\n595\n00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:41.525\nthe beginning of that rather,\nI should say.\n\n596\n00:28:41.525 --> 00:28:44.085\nBut you kind of see it right there,\nand it will look very similar.\n\n597\n00:28:44.085 --> 00:28:47.062\nIn the sense that we do have\nthe beginning part Part of that address.\n\n598\n00:28:47.062 --> 00:28:49.692\nBut we use shorthand notation to specify\n\n599\n00:28:49.692 --> 00:28:51.462\nthe number of bytes in things\nthat we're talking about.\n\n600\n00:28:51.462 --> 00:28:55.132\nSo we still see that,\n/64 is our subnet prefix.\n\n601\n00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:59.882\nBecause that says hey, take the first half\nof the total address block and assign it,\n\n602\n00:28:59.882 --> 00:29:01.652\nin this case for the network address.\n\n603\n00:29:01.652 --> 00:29:02.812\nThat is our subnet prefix.\n\n604\n00:29:02.812 --> 00:29:06.452\nThat's what we think of as our\nnetwork portion of our subnet in IPv4.\n\n605\n00:29:06.452 --> 00:29:09.500\nWe're just writing it in\na IPv6 friendly shorthand.\n\n606\n00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.090\nright equivalent, if you will.\n\n607\n00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:16.360\nWhereas, something like this, again, I'm\nhaving trouble highlighting the 2, there.\n\n608\n00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.160\nThere we go.\n\n609\n00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.080\nSomething like this is going to\nindicate we're using less than the full\n\n610\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.280\namount of 64 bits in\nthe first part of the block.\n\n611\n00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.610\nThat's a route pre-fix.\n\n612\n00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.780\nIt's just going to be a little\nbit different for us.\n\n613\n00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.500\nI want to make sure that we're\nfamiliar with the logic of this And\n\n614\n00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.090\njust as we wrap up the beginning\npart of our conversation,\n\n615\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.440\nI wanna bring up a document that\nmay help us to just structure\n\n616\n00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.710\nsome of the conversation here a little\nbit, could we go, there we go.\n\n617\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.140\nSo you could see I put\ntogether a little document for\n\n618\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.240\nus with the differences between IPv4 and\nIPv6, cuz there are Some\n\n619\n00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.660\nfundamental differences that we want\nto be able to compare an contrast.\n\n620\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.880\nand so we talk about the structure\nof the address block.\n\n621\n00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.520\nWe've talked about the fact that we\nare quadrupling the number of bytes\n\n622\n00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.050\nfrom 32 to 128.\n\n623\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.900\nWe talked about the fact that we\nare no longer using a base two system.\n\n624\n00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.270\nWe are using now a hexadecimal system.\n\n625\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.730\nBase 16, so we have a totally\ndifferent thought process here.\n\n626\n00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:12.240\nWe are Obviously, because we are going\nto be managing traffic across the scene.\n\n627\n00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.140\nKinds of network using sensory\nsame kind of traffic and\n\n628\n00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.070\nmost likely the same kind of protocol and\nthe same kind of network service\n\n629\n00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:23.260\nPurposes we would have to have support for\nIPv6 in those areas.\n\n630\n00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.720\nOr we may have to modify what we do,\n\n631\n00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.340\nand that's where some of\nthe differences come in.\n\n632\n00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.980\nRight DNS, DHCP we've already\nestablished a DHCP is IPv6 friendly.\n\n633\n00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.350\nSpent a lot of time in our prior episodes\ntalking about DHCP, went through,\n\n634\n00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.260\nspecifically broke out a separate\nepisode just on setting IPv6 scopes for\n\n635\n00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.140\nyou in a DHCP.\n\n636\n00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.710\nDNS, we haven’t gotten there yet,\n\n637\n00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:47.100\nalthough we’ll hint at that Talk about\nsome of that as we get going, but\n\n638\n00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.840\nyou'll see that in DNS, we do have IPv6\nsupport, with the sense that we do support\n\n639\n00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.720\nhost records and records that will\nbe used for resolution in DNS.\n\n640\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.590\nAlso, we do have those capabilities.\n\n641\n00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.020\nSo all of that stuff is gonna be there.\n\n642\n00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.560\nAnd we do, as you can see, Have some\nability to modify our existing routing\n\n643\n00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.490\nprotocols and\nmake sure that they are friendly as well.\n\n644\n00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.360\nSo you'll see here fragmentation for IPv4.\n\n645\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.950\nBoth the router and\nascending function whereas in IPv6,\n\n646\n00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.650\nnot performed by routers but\nby ascending host.\n\n647\n00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:20.520\nSo we're changing the way certain things\nwork, based on the IPv6 network, and\n\n648\n00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.620\nimplementation of network functionality.\n\n649\n00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:27.140\nYet we do rely heavily on\nrouters in IPv6 to do a lot for\n\n650\n00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.240\nus, because we can do auto-configuration\nbased on router advertisements.\n\n651\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.720\nAnd we rely on the host to do a lot\nof the configuration on its own for\n\n652\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.550\naddressing, right.\n\n653\n00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.830\nWe don't necessarily have to\nleverage a lot of that information\n\n654\n00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.370\nthat may come from other areas.\n\n655\n00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.100\nWe actually will go to a router,\nwe can get an advertisement, stateful or\n\n656\n00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:48.680\nstateless depending on the type of\nadvertisement we're talking about or both.\n\n657\n00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.776\nWe'll talk about that in a little more\ndetail in upcoming conversations.\n\n658\n00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:54.340\nBut generically, the router can become and\n\n659\n00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.426\nindeed is envisioned as becoming\nthe central hubll For information,\n\n660\n00:31:58.426 --> 00:32:01.347\nprovisioning out to the host\non an IPv6 network.\n\n661\n00:32:01.347 --> 00:32:03.818\nSo it's a slightly different\ntake on things and\n\n662\n00:32:03.818 --> 00:32:06.740\na slightly different approach\nto what we may be used to.\n\n663\n00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:11.040\n&gt;&gt; You know it's almost like we, and\nnot me when I say we, but whomever-\n\n664\n00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.810\n&gt;&gt; So everybody, but you?\n\n665\n00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Everybody but me, yeah.\n\n666\n00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.130\nWhomever came up with IPv6, it's almost\nlike they had a second shot at this whole\n\n667\n00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:22.520\nnaming convention,\nthis address idea and they really\n\n668\n00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:27.030\nput a lot of thought into it and started\nat the top to make things more simplified.\n\n669\n00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:31.040\nIt may look a little daunting or\nscary when we look at these numbers here.\n\n670\n00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.310\nBut really overall, even like you\nwere showing us the prefixes,\n\n671\n00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:38.659\nstarting at that ISP level filtering down,\nit's a more intuitive,\n\n672\n00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:41.260\nmore intelligent naming convention.\n\n673\n00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.030\nAnd yes, these may be a little bit\ndifferent, but it's gonna be pretty cool.\n\n674\n00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.590\nSo you guys gotta hang around with us for\nthis.\n\n675\n00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.830\nThat's all.\n&gt;&gt; What she said, exactly.\n\n676\n00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.900\n&gt;&gt; That's all. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All that cuz\nI'm not part of that collective either.\n\n677\n00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.800\nI did not invent IPv6, nor\n\n678\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.330\ndid I have anything to do with it\nbecause clearly, it's been around for\n\n679\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.120\nsome time to talk about, and\nis obviously very special system.\n\n680\n00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.200\nSo you do wanna make sure\nyou go through this chart.\n\n681\n00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.610\nTake a look at some of\nthe differences here.\n\n682\n00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.330\nThere's a few more than what I just hinted\nat the top of the chart here, but it does\n\n683\n00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:11.450\ngo through talks about IGMP, ARP, talked\nCMP router discovery here a little bit.\n\n684\n00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.430\nWe do talk about host records and\n\n685\n00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.960\nthe fact we now have a host record\nthat is a four a host record,\n\n686\n00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.750\nas opposed to a standard a, single a\nrecord for DNS to signify the difference.\n\n687\n00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.640\nWe do use pointer records for\nboth, but IP 6 ARPA.DNS domain as\n\n688\n00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.980\nopposed to address.ARPA for DNS domains as\nCherokee was talking about a little bit.\n\n689\n00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:36.860\nAnd the size of ultimately the packet,\nor the byte size here is different.\n\n690\n00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.350\nYou can see that we go from\na 576 byte packet size\n\n691\n00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.340\nright to a 1280 byte packet\nsize without fragmentation.\n\n692\n00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.460\nWe may possibly fragment on the IPv4 side,\nwe don't fragment on the IPv6 side for\n\n693\n00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.180\nthat support.\n\n694\n00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.400\nSo just some things for\nyou to go through and take a look at.\n\n695\n00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.610\nImportant on the underlying\ninformation architecture area for\n\n696\n00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.040\nyou to have a better understanding.\n\n697\n00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.620\nAlso important from an exam\npreparation perspective.\n\n698\n00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.390\nYou never know when you may\nbe asked to compare and\n\n699\n00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.560\ncontrast some differences here, so\nit would be helpful for you to know.\n\n700\n00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.570\nJust one thing to throw out before we\nfinish up quickly and we'll return back to\n\n701\n00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.460\nthe logic of address types for IPv6\nhere when we get into our next episode.\n\n702\n00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.840\nBut I mentioned unicast.\n\n703\n00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.900\nI mentioned multicast.\n\n704\n00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.270\nI mentioned minicast at the top\nof our episode and said, hey,\n\n705\n00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.650\nthese are types of addresses\nthat we now see with IPv6.\n\n706\n00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.160\nAnd we'll talk more about them.\n\n707\n00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.450\nThe unicast addresses the traditional\nhost based address that we would think of\n\n708\n00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.340\nin IPV4 that we split into our network and\n\n709\n00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.310\nwe split into our host portion when we\ntalk about our subnet and our prefix.\n\n710\n00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.818\nRight, let's just call it unicast address.\n\n711\n00:34:38.818 --> 00:34:43.500\nNow that unicast address can be set up and\nis indeed set up and given to the host.\n\n712\n00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.050\nThe host may be able to pull that\nthrough DHCP from an IPV 6 scope.\n\n713\n00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.540\nThe host may be able to have\nthat manually assigned, right?\n\n714\n00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.950\nThere's different ways we can do that,\nbut remember it can be based on, and\n\n715\n00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:58.280\nindeed we saw, it can be based on\nthe idea of setting that up and\n\n716\n00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.220\nmanually putting it in.\n\n717\n00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.620\nIt could be derived,\n\n718\n00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.640\nthe host unique identifier portion,\ncould be derived from the Mac address.\n\n719\n00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.330\nIt is potentially a randomly generated\nstring of hexadecimal information.\n\n720\n00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.330\nThere's different ways we may get that\nhost portion, so just keep that in mind.\n\n721\n00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.250\nThe route portion, or\n\n722\n00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.730\nthe prefix in the beginning rather,\nthat specifies the network portion.\n\n723\n00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.550\nIt's obviously gonna have to be coded and\n\n724\n00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.670\nput in based on whatever we're thinking\nthe network is we're gonna join.\n\n725\n00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:26.080\nSo that part is not randomly generated,\nthe way the host ID can be, but,\n\n726\n00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.400\nit is going to be important to understand\nthat that prefix will associate us with\n\n727\n00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.910\nthe network, and the other block,\nor end of that part of the address,\n\n728\n00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.795\nthe back end of it is gonna\nbe the host identifier.\n\n729\n00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:38.530\nAnd the unicast address is\njust the name we give that for\n\n730\n00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.142\na standard address in IPv6.\n\n731\n00:35:40.142 --> 00:35:44.620\nMulticasting refers to the ability\nto have a multi cast based address,\n\n732\n00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.210\nor multiple interfaces.\n\n733\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.970\nThat's what multi casting refers to.\n\n734\n00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.150\nAnd any cast identifies\nthe idea that we can again,\n\n735\n00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.630\nuse an address in\na slightly different way.\n\n736\n00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.938\nWe'll go into more detail associated\nwith this in our next upcoming episode.\n\n737\n00:35:56.938 --> 00:35:58.670\nBut just wanna at least\nget that out there so\n\n738\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.930\nyou're starting to think about the address\ntypes and that we're familiar with.\n\n739\n00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.730\nAgain, the vocabulary thought\nprocess associated with this.\n\n740\n00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, what a great start to IPv6,\nbut we really haven't just scratched\n\n741\n00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.100\nthe surface so stay with us for\nmore information.\n\n742\n00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.570\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n743\n00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.770\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n744\n00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n745\n00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.421\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n746\n00:36:18.421 -->

00:00:22.930\nAdam did, and guess what?\n\n9\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.180\nWe were able to convince him to\ncome back in studios with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.887\nSo thank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:30.210\n[LAUGH] Don't go.\n\n12\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm tethered.\n\n13\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.980\nI can't go too

processes, and\n\n16\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.050\njust general over view material that we\nwanna make sure we're aware of for IPV6.\n\n17\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.580\nWe're gonna continue that conversation.\n\n18\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.531\nWe left off the end of last episode,\n\n19\n00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:51.380\njust really laying down the idea of what\nthe different address types would be.\n\n20\n00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.030\nAnd we talked about or at least I\nthrew out there for you quickly.\n\n21\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.283\nUnicast, multicast, talked about anycast.\n\n22\n00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:02.094\nThought we'd probably just pick up there\nand talk about, as a high level category,\n\n23\n00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.410\nthose addresses, and then drill down.\n\n24\n00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.420\nBecause within the unicast IPv6 addresses,\n\n25\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.550\nwe could talk about things like\nglobal unicast, and some of the other\n\n26\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.010\nones that are there that make up the\nspecificity of different address types.\n\n27\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.140\nSo, we'll start with that.\n\n28\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.364\nSo let's talk about unicast\nversus multicast versus anycast.\n\n29\n00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:24.488\nWe often in IPv4, would talk about\nunitcast, multicast, and broadcast, right,\n\n30\n00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:29.200\nand that's the three categories or\nthree types of addresses that we refer to.\n\n31\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.670\nAgain, at a very high level, think of them\nas large containers or buckets or for-\n\n32\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Baskets.\n\n33\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.016\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee has said baskets.\n\n34\n00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:38.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we can think about that.\n\n35\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.955\nAnd we can think about just\nputting different types of\n\n36\n00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:44.502\naddresses into those baskets.\n\n37\n00:01:44.502 --> 00:01:49.010\nTo just categorized the kinds of\ninformation that would be flowing across\n\n38\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.170\nthem or and the kinds of\ncommunication that we may engage in,\n\n39\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.080\nwith those kinds of addresses or those\naddress types that are assigned there.\n\n40\n00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.110\nSo unicast would traditionally\nbe a one-to-one transmission.\n\n41\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.390\nEach party has a dedicated IP address.\n\n42\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.520\nIn our case, IPv4 and or IPv6, doesn't\nreally matter which, but has a dedicated\n\n43\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840\nIP address on either side that we\ncan send or receive traffic between.\n\n44\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.720\nThis would be very similar to our\nability to be able to have let's say,\n\n45\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.910\na phone conversation.\n\n46\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.010\nIf we each had a cell phone, and we picked\nup our cell phones, and one of us dialed\n\n47\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.080\nthe other, using our phone numbers\nas the dedicated endpoints or\n\n48\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.170\naddresses to complete that communication,\nwe would then have a unicast transmission.\n\n49\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.230\nA dedicated one to one transmission.\n\n50\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.321\nSo that would be the equivalent\nof what a unicast would be.\n\n51\n00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.233\nIt is a category, and\n\n52\n00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.940\nwe have the same categorical\nthought process here with IPv6.\n\n53\n00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.262\nMulticast, allows us as I\nsaid in the last episode,\n\n54\n00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:45.481\nto identify multiple\ninterfaces as does anycast.\n\n55\n00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:50.340\nBut the idea behind it is multicast would\nbe the equivalent of one to a group.\n\n56\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.990\nMeaning, I wanna send information but\nI wanna do it to a specified group or\n\n57\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.340\na subset of a very large area that's\ngonna be identified through some\n\n58\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.624\nsort of mechanism.\n\n59\n00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:03.466\nIn this case,\nperhaps a multicast IP address, or\n\n60\n00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.843\na member of the multicast address block.\n\n61\n00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:10.389\nFor instance, would be here, packets\naddressed to a multicast address or\n\n62\n00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.200\ndelivered to interfaces that are\nidentified or mapped with that address.\n\n63\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.456\nRemember, we talked about\nthe fact that an IPv4,\n\n64\n00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:23.013\nour multicast address block is\ngonna be from 224 to 239, right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:26.793\nSo, we're thinking about the fact that\nwe'll be in a class D address block\n\n66\n00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:28.162\nin IPv4.\n\n67\n00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:33.320\nMulticast in generically, is the idea of\nmaybe turning on the radio in your car,\n\n68\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.100\nand tuning in to a certain channel.\n\n69\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.145\nWhatever that may be, you become\na member of that group, quote unquote,\n\n70\n00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:43.861\nthe listeners of channel X, or Y, or Z, by\ntuning into a certain station frequency.\n\n71\n00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.928\nAnd because you're listening on\nyour end point, your receiver,\n\n72\n00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:52.635\nto a very specific address, or\nin this case, a tuned in station channel.\n\n73\n00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.582\nThat's the wavelength, or\nthe information you received.\n\n74\n00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:59.222\nYou ignore filter out all the other\nchannels, all the other wavelengths,\n\n75\n00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:02.512\nall the other opportunities to\nlisten to programs out there,\n\n76\n00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:06.432\ncuz you made a selective choice to become\ninvolved with that particular one.\n\n77\n00:04:06.432 --> 00:04:10.232\nThis will be the concept that we think\nwhen we think a multicasting, right?\n\n78\n00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:12.755\nAnd then, when we think of anycasting,\n\n79\n00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:16.700\nwe're thinking about the equivalent\nof a broadcast in IPv4.\n\n80\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.275\nWe're sending out a signal to anybody,\nhence the concept or the label or\n\n81\n00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:26.525\nthe name, right, any entity that is on\nthat particular system that is listening,\n\n82\n00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.675\nwhether they wanna know about it or\nnot in theory,\n\n83\n00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:32.600\nwill at least hear\nthe anycast transmission.\n\n84\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.420\nOr in the IPv4 language,\nthe broadcast transmission.\n\n85\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.340\nSo I wanna think about the fact that\nwhen we have an anycast solution,\n\n86\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.450\nits like we're having\na broadcast in some respect.\n\n87\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.280\nSo essentially,\nvery similar to what we talked about.\n\n88\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.369\nThe nearest interface identified,\nwhen we are sending out information,\n\n89\n00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:51.680\nwe'll send out anycast address or\nwill think about them as,\n\n90\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.080\ninstead of a broadcast on IPv4\nwhere we send to everybody, right?\n\n91\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.350\nBecause, we are broadcasting\nessentially on IPv4 when we do this.\n\n92\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.580\nBut anycast is a little bit different.\n\n93\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.870\nWhat I wrote down on my notes just to give\nyou with the specific with the appropriate\n\n94\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.020\nrouting topology I say, package addressed\nany cast addresses are delivered to\n\n95\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.880\na single interface, and also the nearest\ninterface identified by that address.\n\n96\n00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.764\nMeaning, were zeroing in specifically on\na target that is gonna be near to that\n\n97\n00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:16.951\ninterface.\n\n98\n00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:20.540\nInterface defined as being closest\nwith regards to routing distance.\n\n99\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.640\nSo as in any cast address is used for\none to many communications, right,\n\n100\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.980\nthe idea is, we're sending that\ninformation out and we're saying, hey,\n\n101\n00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.560\nI wanna be able to deliver that.\n\n102\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.723\nI wanna be able to send that out.\n\n103\n00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:35.352\nI talked about broadcast\njust in the IPv4 language.\n\n104\n00:05:35.352 --> 00:05:39.824\nAnd anycast address is used, essentially\nfor this one to many communications,\n\n105\n00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:41.810\nright, or one of many I should say.\n\n106\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.470\nOne to one of many I should say, it's\nprobably the better way to think of that.\n\n107\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.538\nWhere we are sending it, but unlike in\nIPv4, we're gonna broadcast everybody,\n\n108\n00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:52.212\nwe're gonna send it out, and send it\nto somebody in that everybody group.\n\n109\n00:05:52.212 --> 00:05:53.950\nOr we're gonna be selective.\n\n110\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.220\nWe're gonna say, you know what,\nI'm not gonna send it to everybody.\n\n111\n00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.810\nI don't care if everybody hears it, but\nI don't wanna bother everybody with it.\n\n112\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.970\nI'm gonna send it to Maybe Cherokee,\n\n113\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.960\nor I'm gonna send it maybe to whoever's\nclosest to this particular endpoint.\n\n114\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.295\nBecause that's what I'm targeting,\nright, whatever it may be.\n\n115\n00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:08.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n116\n00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:11.660\nyou're not gonna be able to\nsneak in a comment, right?\n\n117\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.390\nSo we're gonna be delivering it to\na single interface in other words.\n\n118\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.032\nSo it is the radically different thought\nprocess, we're switching this idea around.\n\n119\n00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:21.370\nBut we're sense at getting\naway from broadcasts, right,\n\n120\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.810\ncuz we're not broadcasting\nin the traditional sense.\n\n121\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.900\nWe're directing our\nconversations to endpoints.\n\n122\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.522\nBut we're doing it with some specificity,\ndepending on the degree of specificity.\n\n123\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.260\nI can't get that word out twice.\n\n124\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.420\nSpecificity that we want to\nbe able to essentially use.\n\n125\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.300\nOr choose to use,\nas we think about targeting, or\n\n126\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.080\nthink about putting our transmissions in\nthese different buckets as address types.\n\n127\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.376\nAnd Cherokee did want to say something so,\nwhat was the comment,\n\n128\n00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:48.226\nwhat was the question?\n\n129\n00:06:48.226 --> 00:06:50.700\n&gt;&gt; So it's not super important,\nI was just going to ask you,\n\n130\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.329\nif you ever play that game telephone.\n\n131\n00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:55.873\nIt's a game, where you can kind of sit\nin a circle, and one person starts, and\n\n132\n00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.024\nthey whisper into the other person's ear,\nand\n\n133\n00:06:58.024 --> 00:07:00.200\nit goes around the circle\nto deliver a message.\n\n134\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.080\n&gt;&gt; But it always changes.\n\n135\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.610\n&gt;&gt; I know, [CROSSTALK] But\nsee with IPv6, we don't change, right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.614\n&gt;&gt; Well, we hope we don't.\n\n137\n00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:05.369\n&gt;&gt; We hope we don't.\n\n138\n00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:06.791\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] we have integrity.\n\n139\n00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:11.179\nWe also have confidentiality, cuz we do\nuse IPv6 uses IP Sec to be able to send\n\n140\n00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.620\ntransmissions securely, unlike IPv4.\n\n141\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.960\n&gt;&gt; No eavesdropping.\n\n142\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.358\n&gt;&gt; Potentially, no eavesdropping.\n\n143\n00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:17.412\n&gt;&gt; Telling our secret, right, potentially.\n\n144\n00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:18.422\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we do that properly,\n\n145\n00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:19.410\nthat won't happen.\n\n146\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.551\nSo I mean, those things are gonna be\nimportant, right, those are gonna be good,\n\n147\n00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:24.337\nand we are hoping that,\nthat will be the case.\n\n148\n00:07:24.337 --> 00:07:27.503\nBut, we don't know for sure, I mean, this\nis one of the challenges in general with\n\n149\n00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:29.610\ntransmissions, that's\nwhy we need integrity.\n\n150\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.898\nRight, we don't know for\nsure the transmission may or\n\n151\n00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:35.140\nmay not have been modified,\nif we don't have an integrity mechanism.\n\n152\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.700\nTypically a hash, right,\nmore often that not.\n\n153\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.307\nWe call it a digital signature for\nsigning and sending emails.\n\n154\n00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.743\nBut it's essentially just\na message I just for hash value,\n\n155\n00:07:42.743 --> 00:07:45.811\nthey mean the same thing at the end of\nthe day, no matter where we use them and\n\n156\n00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:48.073\napply them, but\nthere are integrity checks, right?\n\n157\n00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:52.328\nThey're mechanisms that say, this packet\nstructured this way, whatever it is,\n\n158\n00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:56.396\nwhen it was sent it looked like this, and\nalong the way, if we use your telephone\n\n159\n00:07:56.396 --> 00:07:59.707\nanalogy, everybody who touches\nit kept the integrity intact.\n\n160\n00:07:59.707 --> 00:08:03.205\nThey didn't modify the packet in any way,\nand when we ultimately delivered it, But\n\n161\n00:08:03.205 --> 00:08:06.622\nwe can validate that, right, because we do\nhave the ability to be able to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:10.232\nSo what would be our favorite hashing\nalgorithm that maybe we would see\n\n163\n00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:12.262\nimplemented for something like this?\n\n164\n00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:14.050\n&gt;&gt; SHA256?\n\n165\n00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.695\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking MD5, but it could be MD5,\nit could be SHA160, it could be SHA256.\n\n166\n00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:22.448\nIt could be lots of different\nhashing algorithms in theory, right,\n\n167\n00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:23.260\nwe do have choices.\n\n168\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.710\nWhether we choose any one in particular or\n\n169\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.610\nnot, what's important is that we\nwant it to do something like that.\n\n170\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.152\nWe would need a hash of some kind.\n\n171\n00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:33.874\n&gt;&gt; An in the future we could even utilize\nquantum cryptography to have that\n\n172\n00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:38.610\nself destruct capability if the message\nwas interfered with, right?\n\n173\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Potentially.\n\n174\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.890\nSo you mentioned something that's\nkinda cool in a future technology.\n\n175\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.180\nBut if you look at what we can do now.\n\n176\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.780\nWe don't do it with quantum cryptography,\n\n177\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.930\nbut many of those instant\nmessaging systems,\n\n178\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:58.380\nnot WhatsApp per say although WhatsApp\ndoes this, it does have this capability.\n\n179\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.620\nTools like WhatsApp or\napps I should say like WhatsApp.\n\n180\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.835\nWhatever instant messaging platform or\n\n181\n00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:08.120\nVOIP-based instant messaging app\nyou may choose to use today.\n\n182\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.147\nA lot of them have this capability\nto be able to send messages but for\n\n183\n00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:14.084\na specified amount of time before\nthey will disappear, right?\n\n184\n00:09:14.084 --> 00:09:15.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even [CROSSTALK].\n\n185\n00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.675\n&gt;&gt; So that's a new thing in the sense that\nthat's a feature that's been around now,\n\n186\n00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:19.200\nI don't know, maybe a year or two.\n\n187\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.380\nBut in the beginning, they just\nsent messages, they were archived,\n\n188\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.760\nthey were there all the time.\n\n189\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.860\nFacebook does it, I guess, right?\n\n190\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.805\nThey have that capability as well.\n\n191\n00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Facebook, iPhones.\n\n192\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.160\n&gt;&gt; iPhones do it as well, right,\n\n193\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.470\nso a lot of the instant messaging\napplications are going this route.\n\n194\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.370\nNot because of IPv6,\n\n195\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.930\nnot because of quantum cryptography,\nbecause of a lot of other reasons.\n\n196\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.340\nThe underlying technologies are not so\nimportant, but\n\n197\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.970\nthe idea generically that\nwe could send a message.\n\n198\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.280\nThat it could exist in theory for\n\n199\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.180\na period of time as you're suggesting,\nit could then actually be self destructed.\n\n200\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.440\nMechanism again, irrelevant, not\nwithstanding, whatever choices we make.\n\n201\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.450\nBut the fact that we essentially\nset a TTL on the message and\n\n202\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.940\njust destroy the message\nafter seven seconds or\n\n203\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.590\nwhatever it may be is actually\na concept that exists now, right?\n\n204\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.830\nIt's not foreign to us by any means.\n\n205\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.790\nAnd it is another way of\nensuring depending on what other\n\n206\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.110\nmechanisms we apply on top of that.\n\n207\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.053\nThat our information maybe more secure,\nprobably less likely to be intercepted.\n\n208\n00:10:14.053 --> 00:10:18.386\nAnd it's less likely to be gathered if\nit is not intercepted on the wire in\n\n209\n00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:19.785\ntransmission.\n\n210\n00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.715\nHighly unlikely that it\ncan be intercepted and\n\n211\n00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:25.890\ngathered from the end point cuz it\nwon't exist there for very long.\n\n212\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.220\nSo, there are some positives to that, but\n\n213\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.790\nthen the downside is of course you can't\ngo back and look at your history and\n\n214\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.660\ngo what was that thing I was suppose to\ndo and it's not there anymore, right?\n\n215\n00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.780\nWe just don't know what it is.\n\n216\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.260\nSo there's ups and down I suppose,\nbut we could do that.\n\n217\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.370\nQuantum cryptography would give us some\ninteresting opportunities there and\n\n218\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.690\nit would be interesting to see\nin several years how that.\n\n219\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.290\nYeah, ultimately plays out\nbecause we're actually playing\n\n220\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.980\nwith those ideas as we speak\nwith quantum cryptography.\n\n221\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.280\nBut they're not being\nimplemented right now\n\n222\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.910\nin a production environment commercially.\n\n223\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.330\nThey're really more in the lab and\n\n224\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.780\nbeing used in some strange and\ninnovative ways outside of the mainstream.\n\n225\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.340\nBut they may come to fruition,\nwho knows, at some point in the future.\n\n226\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.447\nSo it's definitely something to think\nabout and to keep your eyes open for\n\n227\n00:11:04.447 --> 00:11:05.157\nas we would say.\n\n228\n00:11:05.157 --> 00:11:08.709\nIPv6 new and\nimproved would be the title of that one.\n\n229\n00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:11.400\nAll right, so within the concept\nof these address buckets,\n\n230\n00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.370\nlet's just talk about some\nspecific addresses that exist.\n\n231\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.600\nGlobal unicast addresses.\n\n232\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.682\nThis is going to be allowing\nus to have the equivalent of\n\n233\n00:11:19.682 --> 00:11:22.094\npublically routed IP addresses in IPv4.\n\n234\n00:11:22.094 --> 00:11:25.434\nOur ISPs will provide this to us for IPv6.\n\n235\n00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:29.652\nSo a global unicast address is\nthe equivalent of that publically routable\n\n236\n00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:30.880\nIPv4 address.\n\n237\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.200\nUnique local addresses, these are gonna\nbe the equivalent of IPv4 private\n\n238\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.000\naddresses that are routable on the LAN but\nare not gonna exist outside.\n\n239\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.620\nSo this would be the 10 dot address block,\n\n240\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.610\nthe 172.16 dot address block in IPv4 that\nare added and then translated over to\n\n241\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.220\npublicly routable IPs, unique local\naddresses are what we call those in IPv6.\n\n242\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.890\nLink local addresses for\ncommunication only on the local subnet.\n\n243\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.940\nThese would be the equivalent\nof the automatic private IP\n\n244\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.670\naddress block in IPv4.\n\n245\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.800\nThe APIPA base addresses.\n\n246\n00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.950\nAnd that's what we would see If\nwe're talking about them in IPv6,\n\n247\n00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.120\nthey're called link local addresses.\n\n248\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.980\nAnd they are configured on our interface\nfor us and the equivalent in IPv6 in terms\n\n249\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.090\nof the hex decibel structure is\nwhat we would see for those.\n\n250\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.570\nThey always by the way, the prefix for\n\n251\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.800\nthe link local address always\nstarts with FE80::/64.\n\n252\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.150\nRight, as the 64 bits\nsignify the whole prefix.\n\n253\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.817\nBut it's always gonna be FE80::.\n\n254\n00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:30.770\nAnd that's what we're gonna see for that.\n\n255\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.060\nSo, if we were to take a look at that,\nthat's what you would see, right?\n\n256\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.136\nSo just so you know.\n\n257\n00:12:35.136 --> 00:12:39.010\nAnd we also have what are called\n\"special addresses\", right?\n\n258\n00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.740\nI'm gonna pull up the address,\n\n259\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.890\nipconfig here in a second to show of\nwhat a couple of these look like.\n\n260\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.940\nBut before I do that,\nunspecified addresses,\n\n261\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.670\nthese are going to be the equivalent\nof no address assigned.\n\n262\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.002\nAll zeros in other words.\n\n263\n00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:56.760\nIn IPv4, 0.0.0.0 indicates no address,\nthis will be eight zeros, right?\n\n264\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.240\nIn a row with colons,\nwe don't write it that way,\n\n265\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.185\nwe write it instead it's just two semi\ncolons, right, with nothing there.\n\n266\n00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:06.580\nAnd that would signify no address assigned\nor unspecified address and a loopback\n\n267\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.404\naddress cuz we do have the capability\nto do loop back address in IPv6.\n\n268\n00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:14.880\nThat would be seven of the eight areas or\nblocks will be zeroes.\n\n269\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.440\nThe last one would have a one.\n\n270\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.871\nSo we again, tend to shorten that and\njust simply say ::1 and\n\n271\n00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.105\nthat will be the equivalent of\nour loopback adapter, 127.0.0.1.\n\n272\n00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:28.230\nIn IPv4 language or speak,\nthat becomes our loopback address.\n\n273\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.630\nAgain, a special \"address\" in IPv6.\n\n274\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.190\nAnd I showed you this I\nthink in the last episode.\n\n275\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.250\nBut let's just take a look real quick,\nwhen we bring this up, I showed you or\n\n276\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.150\nat least I think I brought this up for\nyou.\n\n277\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.420\nThat we would have unspecified right here.\n\n278\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.980\nAll zeroes for IPv4,\n\n279\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.760\ntwo colons will signify that with\nno zeroes in the IPv6 equivalent.\n\n280\n00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.750\nAgain, in theory you could write\neight blocks with just a zero in each\n\n281\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.395\none and a colon.\n\n282\n00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:54.030\nBut that's the long way of doing it.\n\n283\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.710\nAnd we don't use that notation unless\nwe're just showing it to you and\n\n284\n00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.580\nperhaps writing it out to explain it.\n\n285\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.650\nYou would see it actually just\ndesignated as two colons right there.\n\n286\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.300\nLoopback would be the equivalent\nto two colons and a one.\n\n287\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.403\nYou'll see our autoconfigured, right,\nthat's gonna be our equivalent of\n\n288\n00:14:10.403 --> 00:14:14.960\nthe APIPA address as we talked about,\nFE80::, that's what you'll see there.\n\n289\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.720\nOur broadcast address, right, remember,\n\n290\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.511\nwe use multi casting instead of\nbroadcasting as we were talking about.\n\n291\n00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:23.438\nSo we'll use multi casting in IPv6 to\nbe able to send out to that group,\n\n292\n00:14:23.438 --> 00:14:26.460\nthat's kind of our thought process for\nbroadcast.\n\n293\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.925\nRemember, any casting is me sending to\nsomebody specified within that range that\n\n294\n00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:34.549\nwe were talking about and\nthen multi casting was that the signal for\n\n295\n00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:35.952\nyou to ask a question.\n\n296\n00:14:35.952 --> 00:14:36.790\n&gt;&gt; When you're finished?\n\n297\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.070\n&gt;&gt; I thought you may have just\nbeen waving or shooing a fly away.\n\n298\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.905\nWasn't sure, caught it out of\nthe corner when I was looking down.\n\n299\n00:14:41.905 --> 00:14:47.283\nOr multicasting as you can see and\nas we talked about FF00, right?\n\n300\n00:14:47.283 --> 00:14:48.280\n:: And then /8 notation, right?\n\n301\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.699\nCuz that's our 224 address block for\nmulticasting.\n\n302\n00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:54.190\nSo, we'll leave this up for\na second while Cherokee ask cuz\n\n303\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.150\nshe may be wanting to ask something\nreferring to one of these addresses.\n\n304\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.120\n&gt;&gt; It's not really a question but\n\n305\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.150\njust maybe a statement of the fact,\nyou guys are so lucky, you're still lucky\n\n306\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.690\nto have this information we\nare gonna include in the show notes.\n\n307\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.590\nAdam, I would have died for\n\n308\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.880\nthis, 10 years ago they were\ntalking about the advent of IPv6.\n\n309\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.810\nAnd just going,\nI know personally going back and trying to\n\n310\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.460\ncompile this information off the Internet,\nnot knowing if it's legit or not.\n\n311\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.530\nLooking at this information\nall in one clear spot.\n\n312\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.550\nIt's not like this is really exclusive\nto your Microsoft exam here.\n\n313\n00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.640\nThis is great information and\nit's attached to your show notes.\n\n314\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.300\nSo take advantage of that.\n\n315\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.080\nI can't even tell you.\n\n316\n00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.686\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nWe'll just have that up there for\n\n317\n00:15:30.686 --> 00:15:31.750\nseconds while we retire this.\n\n318\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.900\nYou can see all I'm doing\nis pulling up a interface,\n\n319\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.770\nI'm on my Windows 10 machine just so\nyou know where we are.\n\n320\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.345\nWe do have demo environment set up,\n\n321\n00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:42.310\nwe're gonna take a look at it\nin some upcoming episodes here.\n\n322\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:47.383\nSome things that will take us\nout into the great wild and\n\n323\n00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:52.363\nwooly world of IPv6, and\nwe will talk about ISATAP.\n\n324\n00:15:52.363 --> 00:15:57.440\nAnd we'll talk about 6to4, and tunneling,\nand Teredo adapters, and all that stuff.\n\n325\n00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.616\nAll that's coming up,\nwe will get to all that.\n\n326\n00:15:59.616 --> 00:16:03.331\nBut for the moment, I just wanna show you\njust the basic concept we were talking\n\n327\n00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:05.088\nabout with that link local address.\n\n328\n00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:06.508\nSo on one of our tunnel adapters,\n\n329\n00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:10.130\nright here's probably a good place to just\nhighlight that, and probably see that.\n\n330\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.090\nAnd you'll see right there that that is\nthe link local IPv6 address on the tunnel,\n\n331\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.060\nstarts with FEAD:: right.\n\n332\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.571\nAnd so you can see that designation is set\nup, there you can see our IPv6 address.\n\n333\n00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:27.040\nOn the tunnel adapter,\nstarts with 2001 right there, right?\n\n334\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.001\nSo that part of it right there,\nthat's our network designation.\n\n335\n00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:32.420\nRemember, our prefix as we refer to it.\n\n336\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.133\nAnd the other part is gonna be\nsignifying our host identifier.\n\n337\n00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:38.109\nSo we can see just the basics\nthat we were talking about.\n\n338\n00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:42.565\nAnd we can see just the structure and\nthe thought process.\n\n339\n00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:45.730\nYou'll also see here for\nthe default gateway.\n\n340\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.790\nRemember, we talked about the fact when\nwe don't have an address assigned,\n\n341\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.870\nwe get those two colons\nsignifying no address.\n\n342\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.944\nWe could see a block of zeroes, right\na block of zeroes with colons in between,\n\n343\n00:16:55.944 --> 00:16:57.318\nbut we shorthand it here.\n\n344\n00:16:57.318 --> 00:17:01.280\nAs you can see, all that's telling us is\nthere's no default gateway assigned on\n\n345\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.810\nthe tunnel adapter right now.\n\n346\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.715\nThat doesn't mean anything per se.\n\n347\n00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:07.770\nCuz we may or may not be using that tunnel\nadapter, right now I can tell you for\n\n348\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.140\na fact we're not using it for\nanything in particular, but\n\n349\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.680\nyou could see that if I was I\nwouldn't have a default gateway.\n\n350\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.851\nAnd that's just all it's telling me.\n\n351\n00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:17.471\nAnd I can see that the tunnel adapter for\n\n352\n00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:22.010\nISATAP ITProTV right down here\nbelow it shows Media Disconnected.\n\n353\n00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.326\nSo it's not being used.\n\n354\n00:17:23.326 --> 00:17:26.730\nThat other tunnel adapter is not\nbeing used ether on that network.\n\n355\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:31.148\nSo I can take a look there and\nI can see many of the address structures.\n\n356\n00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:34.920\nOr at least the beginnings of them that\nwe've been talking about presented.\n\n357\n00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.330\nAnd again this is just\nthe Windows 10 interface.\n\n358\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.630\nAll I did was just simply go up and\nopen a command line.\n\n359\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.763\nNothing special, nothing unusual.\n\n360\n00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:45.310\nAll I did was issue an IP config command,\nsomething we're all used to doing.\n\n361\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.969\nRight, we know additional information\nrequired didn't even use the all switch\n\n362\n00:17:48.969 --> 00:17:49.899\njust the ipconfig.\n\n363\n00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:54.090\nAnd we do see evidence to the fact that\nwe're native supporting an interacting\n\n364\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.052\nwith IPv6 here.\n\n365\n00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:55.996\nJust so we know.\n\n366\n00:17:55.996 --> 00:17:56.760\nYeah.\n\n367\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Just so when you are referencing that\nlink local address being similar to way\n\n368\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.380\nin APIPA.\n\n369\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.150\nThere's one thing I wanted plan is\nthat the APIPA that link local,\n\n370\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.510\nthe IPv6 address is there even if you have\n\n371\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.120\na good address that's not-\n&gt;&gt; It is automatically assigned.\n\n372\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.795\nIt's there all the time.\n\n373\n00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:15.656\n&gt;&gt; So it is always there?\nYes.\n\n374\n00:18:15.656 --> 00:18:17.050\n&gt;&gt; That's correct to call that out.\n\n375\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.950\nIt is going to be available to us.\n\n376\n00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.060\nWe're gonna always rely on it.\n\n377\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.676\nWe're not gonna use it necessarily.\n\n378\n00:18:22.676 --> 00:18:26.888\nBut it is unlike in APIPA address\nwhich will be assigned an IPv4\n\n379\n00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:31.430\nspecifically only at the loss of\nour DHCP derived IP address lease.\n\n380\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.488\nThis one is gonna be with us from\nthe time we turn on the system and\n\n381\n00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.670\nthe sentuar is there all the time correct.\n\n382\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.764\nSo that is a distinction that is important\nto think about that and be aware of that.\n\n383\n00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:45.419\nAll right, so one other thing to\nconsider here and just to talk about and\n\n384\n00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:48.690\nconsider is this idea of\naddress configuration.\n\n385\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.210\nRight we mentioned we could\ndo this essentially manually.\n\n386\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.692\nWe could go and type in our addresses and\nif we didn't wanna do that for\n\n387\n00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:59.150\ninstance hypothetically, if you just wanna\ntake a look here with me, just one second.\n\n388\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.070\nLet me just minimize all the stuff\nI have open here real quick.\n\n389\n00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:07.640\nBut if we come down here to our network\ninterface on my Windows 10 machine here,\n\n390\n00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.290\nand I open this up,\nthat is one of my demo boxes.\n\n391\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.935\nThat's a Server 16 interface and\nthe graph of a window there.\n\n392\n00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:14.990\nWe're not gonna go into that right now.\n\n393\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.810\nI'm on my Windows 10 box.\n\n394\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.846\nI'm just gonna show you something here.\n\n395\n00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:20.702\nBut if I go in here just to my\nnetworking center, gonna change adaptor,\n\n396\n00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.902\nand you'll see I go to my adaptor that's\nturned on right now, this one here.\n\n397\n00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:27.463\nRight click, go to properties, and\n\n398\n00:19:27.463 --> 00:19:32.764\nI provide the password that we need to\nget in there, so we do that real quick.\n\n399\n00:19:32.764 --> 00:19:36.226\nAnd we go in and\nwe have our properties for IP interface,\n\n400\n00:19:36.226 --> 00:19:40.360\njust like we would in Server 16,\nthis will look identical.\n\n401\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.126\nOnly difference is I'd be on the server,\nas opposed to on the Windows 10 client.\n\n402\n00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:47.570\nAnd I come down here, you'll see I\ndo have IPV4, we would expect that.\n\n403\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.090\nI do have IPV6, we would expect\nthat as well if we're using it.\n\n404\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.077\nYou could see it right there.\n\n405\n00:19:52.077 --> 00:19:54.723\nAnd if I go in and\nI look at the properties of IPV6,\n\n406\n00:19:54.723 --> 00:19:56.934\nyou'll notice that it is, here anyway.\n\n407\n00:19:56.934 --> 00:20:02.610\nSet to draw an IPv6 address automatically,\nin theory to use DHCP.\n\n408\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.137\nCould I manually put\nan IPv6 address in here?\n\n409\n00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:08.915\nSure I could, just like I would in IPv4,\nI would just have to know what it is and\n\n410\n00:20:08.915 --> 00:20:09.980\ntype it in there.\n\n411\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.600\nCould I put in my prefix length,\nso I understand\n\n412\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.200\nhow much of that address is the network\nportion versus what is the host portion?\n\n413\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.230\nI could do that as well,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n414\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.495\nCan I put my default gateway in there?\n\n415\n00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:21.542\nSure I can I just have\nto to have what it is?\n\n416\n00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:23.975\nAnd just know the equivalent and\nI can put it in there.\n\n417\n00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:27.220\nCould I use my DNS information\nspecify preferred and\n\n418\n00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.890\nalternate DNS servers just\nlike I would in IPv4?\n\n419\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.960\nI could do that as well as long as I'm\nwilling to sit here types some stuff out\n\n420\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.670\nand you'll have the appropriate\ninformation contain either on our file or\n\n421\n00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.700\njust you go ahead and\nset it up and know what it is.\n\n422\n00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.950\nDo I have advanced settings here?\n\n423\n00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.003\nI do just like I'm used to seeing in IPv4.\n\n424\n00:20:45.003 --> 00:20:49.430\nDo I have the ability to add additional\nIP addresses and bind them there?\n\n425\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.858\nOf course, I can.\nDefault gateways can do this too.\n\n426\n00:20:51.858 --> 00:20:55.550\nCan I specify DNS, right?\n\n427\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.730\nI can go, and I have to have\nan address to be able to do that.\n\n428\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.444\nBut assuming I have an address there,\ncan I go to DNS and\n\n429\n00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:03.934\nadd additional DNS servers just\nthe way I would in my IPv4 interface?\n\n430\n00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:05.660\nI could do that as well.\n\n431\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.260\nRight, so all those things, manually,\ncan be put in with no trouble.\n\n432\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.120\nCan I set this up and\nadd these adapter addresses in and\n\n433\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.720\nmanipulate this interface?\n\n434\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.045\nUsing netsh, absolutely you can see some\nevidence of that right behind you there.\n\n435\n00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:22.089\nWe'll come back and\ntalk about what this is a little later on.\n\n436\n00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:26.181\nThis is part of the background information\nthat we're gonna have set up for you and\n\n437\n00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:27.680\ntalk about as we set up.\n\n438\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.920\nOur ISATAP routing capability and\n\n439\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.390\nshow you how to do that with IPv4 and\nIPv6 interfaces communicating\n\n440\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.270\nthrough a software based routing\nfunction on a server 16 server.\n\n441\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.132\nThat's a mouth full.\n\n442\n00:21:38.132 --> 00:21:40.634\nYou should say that three times and\ntry not to take a breath.\n\n443\n00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:44.060\nBut can we use Netsh\nto be able to do this?\n\n444\n00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.684\nNot just to do what I just describe but\ngenerically to modify the IP interface and\n\n445\n00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:50.003\nassign IP addresses.\n\n446\n00:21:50.003 --> 00:21:54.140\nWe can do that as well that's not\na problem actually had that up\n\n447\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.915\nhere just before I moved off it Netsh\ncommands here for IPv4 and IPv6 So\n\n448\n00:21:58.915 --> 00:22:01.040\nwe could do this from Netsh.\n\n449\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.120\nCan we do this from PowerShell?\n\n450\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.070\nWe can do this from PowerShell as well.\n\n451\n00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.245\nCould we use auto configuration?\n\n452\n00:22:05.245 --> 00:22:07.420\nWe can use auto configuration.\n\n453\n00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.710\nI've talked about this or hinted at\nthis already in the prior episode.\n\n454\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.010\nWe can do this the system itself, in other\nwords, the IP host, can configure and\n\n455\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.800\nindeed will, configure its link\nlocal address automatically,\n\n456\n00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.090\nas Cherokee pointed out for us.\n\n457\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.986\nAnd we have that capability but by talking\nto routers and doing router discovery.\n\n458\n00:22:22.986 --> 00:22:26.020\nWe can then leverage\ninformation on the router or\n\n459\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.820\nthe information packets that\ncome back from the router.\n\n460\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.610\nTo then to be able to do additional\nconfiguration depending on whether\n\n461\n00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.030\nwe are doing a state for\n\n462\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.460\nstate list connection with\nthe router in a discussion.\n\n463\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.371\nNow the thing to remember to remember\nwith IPv6 and auto configuration.\n\n464\n00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:44.752\nOur interface must support or must be most\ncapable, if you wanna think support later,\n\n465\n00:22:44.752 --> 00:22:49.120\nevery one had heard that but\nultimately address auto configuration.\n\n466\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.386\nIs supportive, but it's supportive on\nmulticast capable Interfaces which as I\n\n467\n00:22:53.386 --> 00:22:55.971\nthink I pointed out in one\nof the prior episodes.\n\n468\n00:22:55.971 --> 00:22:59.785\nWould be probably any brand new network\ninterface that we have that's in\n\n469\n00:22:59.785 --> 00:23:03.286\nthe system currently,\nprobably going back last several years and\n\n470\n00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:06.240\nwe would most likely have\nthat capability as well.\n\n471\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.660\nYou go back in the systems\nthat are really, really, old.\n\n472\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.865\nThey may not have the appropriate drivers,\nmaybe after an update.\n\n473\n00:23:10.865 --> 00:23:14.857\nSo maybe a little sketchy before they're\nback to go but in the last few years any\n\n474\n00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:18.368\ninterface that's been created has\nthose capabilities cuz we know,\n\n475\n00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:21.170\nthat this system out there,\nwe know it's being used.\n\n476\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.775\nWe know that we have to supported it.\n\n477\n00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:25.540\nSo we just need to make sure we're\nmultitasking capable interfaces but\n\n478\n00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.057\nwe can determine the address of routers,\nadditional addresses other configuration\n\n479\n00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:33.140\nparameters can be discussed and\nprovided there.\n\n480\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.163\nThe router advertisement message.\n\n481\n00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:38.419\nWhich is what comes back from the router\nwill give us this information and\n\n482\n00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:42.210\nwhether it is a stateful address\nconfiguration or stateless.\n\n483\n00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.300\nIf it's stateful we're getting a stateful\naddress configuration protocol indicator\n\n484\n00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.245\nin plain old fashioned normal language.\n\n485\n00:23:48.245 --> 00:23:52.670\nWe're being told hey go to DHCP and\nuse the IPv6 scope that's there and\n\n486\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.114\nhere's where that DHCP interface is.\n\n487\n00:23:55.114 --> 00:23:58.540\nBecause that's how we would configure\nif we were getting a stateful address\n\n488\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.660\nconfiguration, we would use\na stateful address protocol.\n\n489\n00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.890\nDHCP6 provides that or\n\n490\n00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.480\nDHCP with IPB6 scope support will\nprovide that, and so we could do that.\n\n491\n00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.180\nStateless autoconfiguration is\njust based on the receipt of that\n\n492\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.050\nrouter advertisement message, just\ncoming from the router and nothing else.\n\n493\n00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.870\nWe're not able to fully provision out\nthe system with all the bells and\n\n494\n00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.910\nwhistles if we do stateless configuration.\n\n495\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.660\nFor instance, DNS servers cannot be\n\n496\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.660\nprovisioned through stateless\nconfiguration coming off routers.\n\n497\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.390\nWe would need to get that from\na stateful configuration through DHCP.\n\n498\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.200\nSo we get basic information, right,\nwe can get basic information\n\n499\n00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.360\ncoming back from the router that can\ntell us additional information we need.\n\n500\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.460\nBut being able to go in and\ndo additional configuration options,\n\n501\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.085\nlike, hey,\nhere is your list of five DNS servers.\n\n502\n00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:48.095\nThat has to come from a DHCP,\na stateful configuration interface.\n\n503\n00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:51.885\nAnd so we would get that by being told\nto go to the stateful configuration,\n\n504\n00:24:51.885 --> 00:24:54.705\nin this case the DHCP interface,\nand use it there.\n\n505\n00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:57.940\nWe get our instructions from\nthe router advertisement.\n\n506\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.047\nBut it tells us to essentially go talk to\na DHCP server that supports IPv6 scopes.\n\n507\n00:25:02.047 --> 00:25:05.524\nSo we showed you how to set up\nthose scopes in a prior episode, so\n\n508\n00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:07.280\njust keep that in mind.\n\n509\n00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.510\nWe can also set this to both where\nwe essentially support both stateful\n\n510\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.080\nand stateless.\n\n511\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.430\nSo we have an option stateless only,\nstateful only or\n\n512\n00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.150\nboth in terms of our auto\nconfiguration settings.\n\n513\n00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.370\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n514\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.610\nAnd with regards to address states that\nare auto configured, just wanna make\n\n515\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.180\nsure we're aware of the fact that we do\nhave five, if I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n516\n00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.568\nI'm asking you five, right?\n\n517\n00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:27.673\nI know there's five.\n\n518\n00:25:27.673 --> 00:25:28.280\n&gt;&gt; Five.\n\n519\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.264\n&gt;&gt; I'm just keeping you on your toes.\n\n520\n00:25:29.264 --> 00:25:31.205\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know there's five,\n\n521\n00:25:31.205 --> 00:25:32.920\nlet's just quickly talk\nabout what they are.\n\n522\n00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.730\nSo we have tentative, we have valid,\nprefered, deprecated, and\n\n523\n00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.310\ninvalid are the five address states\nthat an auto configured address can be.\n\n524\n00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.460\nAnd if you think about the logic of\nwalking through those, it's kind of just\n\n525\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.145\nthe lifecycle of how the address is being\nconfigured as we're getting information.\n\n526\n00:25:48.145 --> 00:25:51.950\nAnd/or walking through the logic\nof Interacting, right,\n\n527\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.540\naround the system sort of\ngonna help us understand that.\n\n528\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.070\nSo it's just a matter of which state we\nexist in or what that state might be.\n\n529\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.960\nWhen we are talking about configuring\nIPv6 addresses, right, we did say manual,\n\n530\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.150\nI'm pretty sure I said manual.\n\n531\n00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.140\nWe talked about stateful and stateless,\nand we've talked about both stateful and\n\n532\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.960\nstateless being set.\n\n533\n00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.500\nSo those are the four different\nways we can assign interfaces.\n\n534\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.370\nI showed you how you could do\nit manually through Netsh.\n\n535\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:21.820\nWe can go in, obviously configure that as\nwell, remember, using a DHCPv6 IP scope.\n\n536\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.090\nWe can do stateful configuration.\n\n537\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.230\nStateless address auto configuration\nis based on interacting with the router\n\n538\n00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.540\nthat's been configured for\nthose router advertisements messages.\n\n539\n00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.549\nAnd we can support that or\nany combination of those,\n\n540\n00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:36.664\ndepending on the infrastructure that we\nmay be running or that we have access to.\n\n541\n00:26:36.664 --> 00:26:40.074\nSo just again some additional\nlayers of information,\n\n542\n00:26:40.074 --> 00:26:42.971\nkind of peeling back\nthe complexity of IPv6.\n\n543\n00:26:42.971 --> 00:26:46.053\nOpening it up and beginning hopefully\nto examine a little bit more\n\n544\n00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:49.930\nwhat's going on there and having a better\nunderstanding of some of those things.\n\n545\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.325\nBut wanna make sure we're familiar with\nthat since we showed you the netsh\n\n546\n00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:54.210\ncommand, right?\n\n547\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.270\nWe do also have the PowerShell\ncommands for the NetTCPIP Module.\n\n548\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.040\nPretty sure we put these up on one of the\nprior episodes as we were talking about,\n\n549\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.760\nI think IPv4 and some of the DHCP stuff.\n\n550\n00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.470\nAt some point I think we threw these\nup and showed them to you, but\n\n551\n00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.400\nit's never a bad idea to\nshow them to you again.\n\n552\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.475\nWe do have support for\na variety of things in here.\n\n553\n00:27:10.475 --> 00:27:15.450\nYou'll see here we do have GetNetIP,\nwe can look at the IP configuration.\n\n554\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.690\nThat's kinda the equivalent\nof doing an ipconfig, but\n\n555\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.270\njust doing that through PowerShell so we\ncan take a look at the IP address config.\n\n556\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.750\nNotice GetNetIP v4,\nwe've talked about the value of that.\n\n557\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.040\nGetting it at IPv6 would be one of\nthe ones that we will be working with\n\n558\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.500\nspecific to IPv6 if\nwe're using PowerShell.\n\n559\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.190\nOr wanna use the PowerShell\nconsole to be able to do this.\n\n560\n00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.270\nGets the IPv6 protocol configurations,\nright?\n\n561\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.540\nSo if we wanted to just learn a little\nbit more about that one just this week,\n\n562\n00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.290\nwrap up this part of the conversation.\n\n563\n00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.870\nIf you drill in, as I've shown you before\nyou can do that, you just drill down.\n\n564\n00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.990\nAnd you'll see, we've got an information\nitem here that gives us a syntax.\n\n565\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.581\nGetting an IPv6 protocol,\nwriting in the default hop limit,\n\n566\n00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:58.406\nthe neighbor cache limit entries, route\ncache limit, reassembly limit, bytes.\n\n567\n00:27:58.406 --> 00:28:02.180\nThere's all these settings that we'd have\nto learn about and understand more about.\n\n568\n00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.610\nBut where do you get all that information?\n\n569\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.395\nWell, all you gotta do, just go down here\nand take a look at all the parameters.\n\n570\n00:28:07.395 --> 00:28:10.610\nIt explains everything to you\nright here on the website.\n\n571\n00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:15.220\nAgain, the nice thing about using this is\nyou get the most recent documentation and\n\n572\n00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.820\nupdated information from Microsoft about\nwhatever version of support they're\n\n573\n00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.830\nputting into.\n\n574\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.760\nIn this case probably PowerShell\nversion five right now.\n\n575\n00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.740\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n576\n00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.870\nBecause as that updates, there may be new\nfeatures, new parameters that are added.\n\n577\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.900\nNew commandlets that are added\nbased on additional functionality.\n\n578\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.150\nAnd that's always important\nto take a look at.\n\n579\n00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.573\nThis is in early April of 2017.\n\n580\n00:28:37.573 --> 00:28:42.190\nSo this is a relatively up to date and\nrecent update for this.\n\n581\n00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.990\nAnd this is gonna give you\nthe most recent information.\n\n582\n00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.630\nIt's available right now about\nIPv6 support via PowerShell.\n\n583\n00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam.\n\n584\n00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.290\nI know that we are out of time for\nthis particular episode, but\n\n585\n00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.500\nwe have more IPv6 headed your way.\n\n586\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n587\n00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.190\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n588\n00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n589\n00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.227\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IProTV.\n\n590\n00:29:01.227 --> 00:29:07.143\n[MUSIC]\n\n591\n00:29:07.143 -->

gonna continue\nlooking at IPv6 addressing.\n\n9\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.230\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.971\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:30.924\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna change my name, just so\nwhen you say that I can say, but\n\n12\n00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:32.290\nwait I'm somebody else now.\n\n13\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.640\nCuz you know, you're so\npolite you introduced me formally,\n\n14\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.869\nwhich I think is great by the way.\n\n15\n00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.013\nDon't get me wrong, but just you're\nalways so formal, and so polite.\n\n16\n00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:40.970\n&gt;&gt; Just let me know who you wanna be,\nand we can make that happen.\n\n17\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.800\n&gt;&gt; I thought we said I was gonna be ROSA,\nyou're gonna be DORA, didn't we do that?\n\n18\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.690\n&gt;&gt; ROSA?\nYeah okay, I'll be DORA.\n\n19\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so.\n\n20\n00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Our DHCP DORA and our DHCP ROSA.\n\n21\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, or\nwhat was the name of DORA's monkey?\n\n22\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.200\nIt wasn't.\n\n23\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Boots, kind of like Boot Key.\n\n24\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.873\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a relationship there.\n\n25\n00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:57.356\n&gt;&gt; That could be that.\n\n26\n00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:01.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so we can theorize and you know,\n\n27\n00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.325\ngo out and\njust talk about the way we link,\n\n28\n00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:07.839\nDora the Explorer to\ntheir broader IP world.\n\n29\n00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:10.605\nIn another episode, we're not gonna\nsubject you to that right now.\n\n30\n00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.765\nBut we are gonna dive back in to IPv6.\n\n31\n00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:15.905\nSee, we've been talking last\ncouple of episodes about just all\n\n32\n00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:17.917\nthe things that I have to\ngo on to understand IPv6.\n\n33\n00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:22.137\nWe have some additional information\nI wanna share with you.\n\n34\n00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:24.947\nAlso gonna try to get in, do a little\nshow and tell under the hood here.\n\n35\n00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:27.247\nWe already took a look\nat some IPv6 addresses.\n\n36\n00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:29.827\nJust scratched the surface\non what was there.\n\n37\n00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.123\nLooked at our Lync local address,\nfor instance.\n\n38\n00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:35.009\nLooked at the lack of a default\ngateway on the tunnel adapter,\n\n39\n00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.681\nshowed you the general structure.\n\n40\n00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.737\nBut those are all gonna\nbe there by default.\n\n41\n00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:44.421\nWe're gonna take a look at how we actually\nset up, and use ISOTAP to be able to.\n\n42\n00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.827\nIn a sense create a software based router\nthat's capable of providing an IPv6,\n\n43\n00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:48.536\nIPv4 support.\n\n44\n00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:52.410\nWe're gonna walk through the logic on how\nto do that, along with some other stuff.\n\n45\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.020\nSo we're gonna start demoing some\nof the functionality here for IPv6.\n\n46\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.120\nWe did talk about DHCP\nbased IPv6 scope support.\n\n47\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.786\nSo that's something that\nobviously carries forward.\n\n48\n00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:06.510\nWe have hinted at the fact, and\nwe'll take a look at in future episodes.\n\n49\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.410\nAnd I'll preview it for\n\n50\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.710\nyou as we do the demo, that in DNS\nwe do have IPv6 host record support.\n\n51\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.550\nAmong other support that we need there.\n\n52\n00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.690\nSo we have a 4A post record as\nopposed to a single A representing\n\n53\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.150\nan IPv4 host record.\n\n54\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.100\nSo we do have the capability to do that,\nand that's not new to 2016 by the way.\n\n55\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.870\nDNS has provided that host record for some\ntime now in terms of the support for IPv6.\n\n56\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.120\nSo, we do have that but\nwe'll take a look at it.\n\n57\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.570\nWe'll go into the IPv6, or\nrather the 2016 DNS server, and\n\n58\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.310\njust see we do have indeed,\nthe opportunity to create those records.\n\n59\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.140\nSo we'll take a look at\nthat as part of the demo.\n\n60\n00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.550\nBut I thought we'd start by talking about\nthis concept of nodes, and what nodes are.\n\n61\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.933\nAnd we refer to nodes in IPv6, but\n\n62\n00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.618\nwhat we're really talking about\nis nothing more than just hosts.\n\n63\n00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:53.386\nIt's another word for hosts, and\nnodes and hosts are synonymous.\n\n64\n00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:55.754\nSo, just wanna keep that in mind, and\n\n65\n00:02:55.754 --> 00:03:00.480\nthink about that when you hear us\ntalk about node types in IPv6.\n\n66\n00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.300\nWe're talking about host types, in other\nwords how do we identify the host?\n\n67\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.971\nWhat kind of support does it provide?\n\n68\n00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.300\nWe get out of IPv4 only node.\n\n69\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.013\nAnd IPv4 only capable host in other words,\n\n70\n00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:16.130\none that supports only IPv4 is\nconfigured with IPv4 addresses.\n\n71\n00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.460\nNo support for IPv6, right?\n\n72\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.289\nSo a Windows 98, a Windows 95 machine\nwould be considered an IPv4 only node.\n\n73\n00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.908\nNot that you would run one of\nthem necessarily, but just so\n\n74\n00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:29.370\nyou know that we had not support for\nit back then.\n\n75\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.683\nThat's just the idea behind\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n76\n00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:35.402\nAn IPv6 only node, and\nthough that support only IPv6.\n\n77\n00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:38.293\nSo a host that's configure for\nIPv6 support,\n\n78\n00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:43.224\nbut does not have IPv4 enabled, and\ntherefore we're not be able to support it.\n\n79\n00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:46.368\nThis is something where,\nremember we may have,\n\n80\n00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:49.751\nperhaps applications that\nare IPv6 only capable.\n\n81\n00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.535\nOr may wanna isolate that, and\nprovide that support on the machine,\n\n82\n00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:55.182\nthat's dedicated to that stack,\nbecause maybe they will have.\n\n83\n00:03:55.182 --> 00:03:57.776\nAlthough I don't know of any applications\noff the top of my head that would fall\n\n84\n00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:58.493\ninto this category.\n\n85\n00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:02.960\nBut in theory, maybe we have\na requirement that it runs only IPv6.\n\n86\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.780\nMaybe a statutory, regulatory compliance\nissue that Cherokee brought out or\n\n87\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.050\nreminded us of in some prior episodes.\n\n88\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.144\nSo maybe there's a reason for that, or an\napplication that requires only that kind\n\n89\n00:04:13.144 --> 00:04:16.780\nof stack support, because maybe IPv4\nwill cause some sort of a problem.\n\n90\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.680\nSo, we may have a reason to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.120\nIPv4 and/or IPv6 node, one that's gonna be\n\n92\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.980\nable to support both in other words is\nwhat we would often talk about there.\n\n93\n00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.810\n2008 and newer on the server side.\n\n94\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.430\nVista and newer on the desktop side.\n\n95\n00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.440\nWe'll follow on its category, where we\ndo have the stack support available, and\n\n96\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.040\nwe'll be able to have that duality.\n\n97\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.135\nIPv4 node, one that is going to have\nan IPv4 address assigned to it.\n\n98\n00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:48.260\nBut, can operate is either on IPv6, or\non IPv4 node, depending on how it's setup.\n\n99\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.320\nRemember IPv4 only node is just\nIPv4 with no IPv6 support enabled,\n\n100\n00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.715\ninstalled, or configured.\n\n101\n00:04:55.715 --> 00:05:00.635\nBut an IPv4 node, is simply a machine that\nhas both, but is preferencing IPv4, and\n\n102\n00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.525\nis configured for IPv4.\n\n103\n00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:04.408\nSo just so you're aware of that.\n\n104\n00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:08.325\nWe would do that, where essentially we'd\ngo in maybe to the network properties.\n\n105\n00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:11.572\nUnclick the check or\nselect box for IPv6, right?\n\n106\n00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:14.232\nAnd just disable it in the interface, but\n\n107\n00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:16.152\nit's still there on the stack\nwe're just not using it.\n\n108\n00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:18.371\nThat kind of thing,\nthat's what we think of there.\n\n109\n00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.382\nAnd IPv6 now, same idea but\njust going the other way.\n\n110\n00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:26.172\nIPv6 is enabled, we're using it,\nwe don't have an IPv4 address, or\n\n111\n00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:29.102\nperhaps reason to have one, but\nthe support is there if we want one.\n\n112\n00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:31.000\nWe're just not leveraging it right now.\n\n113\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.260\nSo the different node types will\nbe important just to remember, and\n\n114\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.440\nremind yourselves of those and\nknow what they are.\n\n115\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.580\nMay come up at some point in the future.\n\n116\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.410\nYou may be interacting with a system,\nand see the node type designation,\n\n117\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.340\nwanna know what it is.\n\n118\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.730\nYou'll remember it, hopefully.\n\n119\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.245\nAnd they are pretty self explanatory.\n\n120\n00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.940\nWhen you look at them,\nit should make sense.\n\n121\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.650\nYou may be asked about them at some\npoint in the future on an exam.\n\n122\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.450\nSo you'd always want to be able to\nanswer questions there, if asked and\n\n123\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.470\nknow what they are.\n\n124\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.500\nWe talked about DNS\ninfrastructure requirements.\n\n125\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.120\nImportant just to remember that we do\nneed host records, A host records,\n\n126\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.923\nas in the single A for IPv4.\n\n127\n00:06:02.923 --> 00:06:05.820\nWould you need IPv6 host records,\n\n128\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.260\nfour As in the parentheses designate\nthe IPv6 resource records.\n\n129\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.820\nAnd we may need pointer records depending\non how we're setting up on our zones,\n\n130\n00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.180\nand we'll do support pointer\nrecords to both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n131\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.982\nYou just wanna remember that,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n132\n00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:21.473\nWe'll take a look at DNS in a few minutes,\nyou could see that.\n\n133\n00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:27.011\nWe also have something known as prefix\npolicies when we are doing IPv6.\n\n134\n00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.998\nWhen we have a name that could be resolved\nto both IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.\n\n135\n00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:34.707\nBoth addresses get returned\nback to the client as a result.\n\n136\n00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:37.857\nSo we wanna think about the fact that\nwe would then have to choose what we're\n\n137\n00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:39.619\ngonna use and how we're gonna interact.\n\n138\n00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:42.951\nAnd we may choose, or\nmake those choices prefix policies.\n\n139\n00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:47.627\nAnd so prefix policies can be assigned,\nwe are gonna wrap them through Power Shell\n\n140\n00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:50.489\nfor instance,\nto get net prefix policy command.\n\n141\n00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:55.440\nAnd get dash that prefix policy, which\nshow us what prefix policy has exist.\n\n142\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.680\nI do have a handy little Word\ndocument that I put together for\n\n143\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.140\nyou with the prefix policies.\n\n144\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.510\nYou can see them here.\n\n145\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.460\nSo you can see, I just scroll down,\nwhoops, too far there.\n\n146\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.040\nYou can see that we do have some\nprefixes that would be important for\n\n147\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.210\nus to perhaps specify or designate.\n\n148\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm keeping all these notes,\nAdam [LAUGH].\n\n149\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.170\nThe ones you gave me, these are good\nnotes, I love these notes [LAUGH].\n\n150\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, good, thank you for\n\n151\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.810\nrandomly associating while I'm in the\nmiddle of talking, I do appreciate that.\n\n152\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.100\nFeel free to just scream at anything\nyou'd like, at any point in time.\n\n153\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.630\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH].\n\n154\n00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.550\n&gt;&gt; No problem, cuz when you get\nexcited everyone wants to participate.\n\n155\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.436\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; These are good notes.\n\n156\n00:07:30.436 --> 00:07:31.041\nThe skies, yes.\n\n157\n00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:31.641\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n158\n00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:33.696\nyou do have access to\nall the notes obviously,\n\n159\n00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:35.339\nencourage you to take a look at them.\n\n160\n00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:37.755\nAnd I'm glad that Cherokee is\nfinding them to be helpful.\n\n161\n00:07:37.755 --> 00:07:39.962\nAnd all kidding aside,\nwhen we talk about this stuff.\n\n162\n00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:42.002\nBut her saying hey these are good notes,\n\n163\n00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:45.190\nthey're really valuable they\ngot a lot of great information.\n\n164\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.688\nTo help me, and hopefully by extension\nhelp you to clarify things consider normal\n\n165\n00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:49.762\nto be ask about on exams.\n\n166\n00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:54.437\nWe just wanna provide context for that,\nbut more broadly, because on exam may,\n\n167\n00:07:54.437 --> 00:07:55.971\nmay not be on your future.\n\n168\n00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:59.019\nIt is perhaps Part of what you wanna do,\nbut it's not the only part.\n\n169\n00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:00.342\nIt's not the end game by any means,\n\n170\n00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:02.650\nbecause you have to take this\nknowledge out to the real world.\n\n171\n00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.820\nYou have to interact with it.\n\n172\n00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.370\nYou have to use it to manage\nyour networks long-term.\n\n173\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.420\nSo having the notes as a reference point\nto then build your knowledge about IP or\n\n174\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.730\naround IPv6,\nhopefully becomes valuable for you.\n\n175\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.860\nSo glad that we have the Cherokee\nseal of approval on the notes.\n\n176\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.800\nThat will be good.\n\n177\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.660\n&gt;&gt; I'll try to contain myself.\n\n178\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.311\n&gt;&gt; Get you a stamp or something so you\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.100\n&gt;&gt; can stamp the notes as approved.\n\n180\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n181\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.990\nyou do see that we do have different\nprefixes that would be applied here.\n\n182\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.000\nWe can then, obviously, use those as\nnecessary, if we need to specify or\n\n183\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.140\nsignify that we are gonna give\npreference to something, or\n\n184\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.400\nthat we want to be able to do that.\n\n185\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.677\nEach prefix has a precedence\nlevel assigned to it.\n\n186\n00:08:39.677 --> 00:08:42.930\nHigher precedence is preferred\nover a lower precedence.\n\n187\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.690\nForgot to mention that specifically here.\n\n188\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.150\nSo obviously the precedence ranking\nis much like a metric value.\n\n189\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.410\nWhen we're look at\nan IPv4 route statement,\n\n190\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.120\nthe metric remember is gonna\nsignify that cost, quote unquote,\n\n191\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.280\nvalue meaning just a preference based\non numerical value higher versus lower.\n\n192\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.560\nAnd being able to figure out what\nthat means as a result of that,\n\n193\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.520\nlower cost is always preferred.\n\n194\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.631\nWith metrics, here we're saying\nthe higher the precedence label, or\n\n195\n00:09:07.631 --> 00:09:11.890\nrather the higher precedence value,\nthe more preference we have for it.\n\n196\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.740\nSo kind of the opposite that we're\nthinking of their worth regards\n\n197\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.340\nto a metric.\n\n198\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.986\nBut, so we would obviously say precedence\nof 50 for the loop back adaptor.\n\n199\n00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:23.205\nThat means that that would have a higher\nprecedence and something like a default\n\n200\n00:09:23.205 --> 00:09:26.330\ngateway in my example here just\nas we see them stacked up.\n\n201\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.990\nBut just keep in mind that we\nassign precedence, priorities here,\n\n202\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.180\nessentially to specify that\nwe want to use certain things\n\n203\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.431\nover others that may be coming back.\n\n204\n00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:37.017\nRight?\nSo\n\n205\n00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:42.622\nif the IPv4 loopback adapter comes back\nand the IPv6 equivalent comes back and\n\n206\n00:09:42.622 --> 00:09:46.670\nthe IPv4 adapter statement is not gonna\nhave a precedence that's as high,\n\n207\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.590\nwe're gonna signify or specify with\nthe precedence value of 50 that\n\n208\n00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.780\nwe have a preference for the version\n6 one if we're using v6 addressing.\n\n209\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.570\nAnd that's the kind of thing we're\nthinking about and we're trying to get\n\n210\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:02.250\ninto our minds when we think about\nprefaces or prefix policies here.\n\n211\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.530\nSo when we do that, if we issue that\nget command that I was talking about.\n\n212\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.830\nI can demo that for\nyou really quickly here.\n\n213\n00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.490\nGet net prefix policy.\n\n214\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.944\nLet me just show you this real quick and\n\n215\n00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.960\nthen I'll bring back up the registry\neditor and all the stuff I'm doing here.\n\n216\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.020\nI'll explain this.\n\n217\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.732\nBut just before I get ready to\nexplain what we're doing here,\n\n218\n00:10:17.732 --> 00:10:19.040\nlet me just show you what I mean.\n\n219\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.560\nSo Get-Net prefix policy is\nwhat we would enter here.\n\n220\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.290\nThis is our command.\n\n221\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.070\nNow I'll do this in a second.\n\n222\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.860\nBut keep in mind I did\nshow you this before.\n\n223\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.570\nBut remember we do have\nour PowerShell commands.\n\n224\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.505\nI showed you these in the last episode\njust to remind you where they come from.\n\n225\n00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:39.680\nNetTCPIP module,\nwe took a look at these or\n\n226\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.820\nI focused in on the Get NetiPv6 protocol\nat the very end of our last episode.\n\n227\n00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.270\nBut right below it there you'll see we\nhave Get-NetPrefixPolicy right there and\n\n228\n00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.730\nthat's the one we're talking about\nthat we could examine that I\n\n229\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.250\njust teed up in the interface for you.\n\n230\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.580\nSo we do have all of these commands\nlisted and you can obviously go in and\n\n231\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.060\ntake a look at them right here.\n\n232\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.777\nBut if you were to enter right here and\ndo that, let me just get back in there and\n\n233\n00:11:02.777 --> 00:11:05.763\njust do that and do that and\ndo that, there we go.\n\n234\n00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:09.519\nThen we would get a list of whatever\npolicy prefixes, you see them\n\n235\n00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:14.108\nlisted right there, that are in the system\nthat are available for us for IPv6.\n\n236\n00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:17.085\nYou could see what traditional\noutput may look like there.\n\n237\n00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:20.187\nAnd you could see there's our\nloop back adaptor at the bottom.\n\n238\n00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:21.731\nIt mirrors the list I just gave you.\n\n239\n00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:25.360\nIt's essentially the central default ones\nthat are programed into the interface.\n\n240\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.690\nBut you could see them there.\n\n241\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.980\nSo you could see all of them\nlisted from lowest to highest.\n\n242\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.560\nAnd the labels go from whatever they are.\n\n243\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.360\nAt the top they're based on\nthe specification for that down to that.\n\n244\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.900\nAnd it looks very similar to what\nI have here on my diagram or\n\n245\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.960\nmy chart that I put together for\nyou, right?\n\n246\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.020\nSo, just be aware that we'll\nsee our default gateway,\n\n247\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.000\nwe'll see our IPv4 compatible address,\netc.\n\n248\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.210\nWhatever's there you can\nsee all of that here.\n\n249\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.030\nThere's our IPV4 compatible address,\nthere's our default gateway,\n\n250\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.810\nthere's a loop back adapter.\n\n251\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:55.760\nRight?\nSo, they're all down there and\n\n252\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.570\nthey're all signified.\n\n253\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.120\nYou can look at that word document to\nkind of map those in your mind, but\n\n254\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.130\nthat's what we would actually see If\nwe were going in and taking a look or\n\n255\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.290\npulling up the prefix policies\nusing the PowerShell command.\n\n256\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.980\nJust so you know how that would play out.\n\n257\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.510\nAll right, so we're gonna leave\nthat there for just a moment.\n\n258\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.480\nJust talk quickly about the concept\nof tunneling, the concept of some of\n\n259\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.910\nthe additional capabilities we're gonna\nstart discussing and showing you here.\n\n260\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.630\nWhile I'm doing that or\n\n261\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.860\nwhile I'm starting to do that I'm just\ngonna reset our lab timer so we don't\n\n262\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.950\nlose out on all the hard work I just put\ninto setting up that whole environment.\n\n263\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.550\nSo let's talk about IPv6 over\nIPv4 tunneling for just a minute.\n\n264\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.420\nThe idea of tunneling overall,\n\n265\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.810\ngenerically something that hopefully\na lot of you are already familiar with.\n\n266\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.940\nWe talk a lot about tunneling in many,\nmany instances in many areas for\n\n267\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.710\na lot of reasons, generically,\n\n268\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.700\nthe idea behind tunneling is the ability\nto be able to take information.\n\n269\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.430\nWe often talk about encapsulating\nit inside of a tunnel,\n\n270\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.627\na generic term we use to wrap the traffic,\nwrap the data inside of something.\n\n271\n00:12:54.627 --> 00:12:58.050\nWrap it with something that\nwill essentially control it or\n\n272\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.430\nspecify how it will be used\nwhile it is being transmitted.\n\n273\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.467\nProtecting it and enveloping it in some\nsort of outer wrapper and then we send it\n\n274\n00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:09.337\nthrough some sort of system that tunnels\nwhere we often will send the data.\n\n275\n00:13:09.337 --> 00:13:12.643\nAnd then on the other side we open\nup the tunnel, we take the data out,\n\n276\n00:13:12.643 --> 00:13:15.330\nwe un-encapsulate,\nessentially unwrap, the data.\n\n277\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.010\nAnd then the original information,\nthe original addressing, and all the stuff\n\n278\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.310\nthat may be associated with it,\nis often then gonna be able to be seen.\n\n279\n00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.330\nSo when we think about\ntunneling IPv6 over IPv4,\n\n280\n00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.280\nthe name implies exactly what we're doing,\nright.\n\n281\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.890\nWe're taking this traffic and\nwe're tunneling it, or sending it\n\n282\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.850\nthrough a system that traditionally\nmay not be designed to support it but\n\n283\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.110\nwould allow us to transmit and\ncommunicate it.\n\n284\n00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.670\nSo we send IPv6 packets with\nencapsulation over IPv4, or\n\n285\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:46.720\nwith an IPv4 header in other words, so\nthat the IPv6 packets can be seen, read,\n\n286\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.960\ntransmitted and understood by\nIPv4 only infrastructure, right.\n\n287\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.420\nSo we're gonna take an IPv6 packet,\nslap an IPv4 translation header on it and\n\n288\n00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.180\nthen send it off,\nmaking it appear as if it's IPv4 traffic.\n\n289\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.490\nSo it can be interacted with, and\nprocessed across our IPv4 networks.\n\n290\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.590\nCherokee, I know you wanted to jump in.\n\n291\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.080\nYou wanted to say\nsomething here real quick.\n\n292\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that concept that you\njust explained, theoretically,\n\n293\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.590\nif we take that individual packet, and\nrepackage it with the IPv4 header, well,\n\n294\n00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:20.220\nwe know that the internet, and\nmost networks are still using IPv4.\n\n295\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.710\nBut theoretically it is also\npossible to reverse that although\n\n296\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.820\nit's not as popular, correct?\n\n297\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.320\n&gt;&gt; To do?\n&gt;&gt; Six to four.\n\n298\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.205\n&gt;&gt; To do Six to Four, yeah, well we could\n\n299\n00:14:29.205 --> 00:14:30.245\ndo Six to Four as well.\nWe'll\n\n300\n00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:31.460\nactually talk a bit about that\n\n301\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.145\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; in just\n\n302\n00:14:32.145 --> 00:14:32.665\na few minutes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n303\n00:14:32.665 --> 00:14:33.176\n&gt;&gt; We could do both\n\n304\n00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:34.565\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee is right.\n\n305\n00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:35.915\nWe can do it either way.\n\n306\n00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:36.775\nNot as popular,\n\n307\n00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.655\nbut still obviously very important for\n\n308\n00:14:38.655 --> 00:14:44.030\nus to think about the fact that we do have\nthis bi-directional, backwards compatible,\n\n309\n00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.420\ninteroperability thought process\nto transmit traffic either way.\n\n310\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.360\nAs we go down the road a little bit,\n\n311\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.660\nthis becomes more prevalent, we may\nhave a further need for that, right?\n\n312\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.630\nSo instead at some point we may have\nto be able to take IPv4 traffic and\n\n313\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.770\nmake it accessible to IPv6\nnetworks as we're transitioning.\n\n314\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.870\nAnd that may also be\nsomething to consider.\n\n315\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.030\nSo we can do both, but the idea here and\nsomething just to keep in mind,\n\n316\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.440\nat least with the IPv6\nover IPv4 tunneling.\n\n317\n00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIs that things like ISATAP,\n\n318\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.595\nwhich is kinda what's going on behind us\nhere, we'll take a look at in a minute,\n\n319\n00:15:15.595 --> 00:15:18.800\nare going to be able to\nuse this technology.\n\n320\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.050\nSo we're gonna be able to set these\ntunnels up and transmit traffic,\n\n321\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.230\nthat's good to know.\n\n322\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.990\nBut keep in mind these tunnels\nare not secured natively.\n\n323\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.760\nMeaning in and of themselves\nthe transmission, and the setup, and\n\n324\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.060\nthe architecture,\njust creates the pipe and\n\n325\n00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.380\nallows us to create the pathways\nto send and receive the data.\n\n326\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.480\nBut we're not focusing on the security of\nthe data, we're focusing on the nuts and\n\n327\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.410\nbolts of the networking and\nbeing able to create a path and\n\n328\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.820\na transmission mechanism that\nmoves that data back and forth.\n\n329\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.275\nThe IPv6 tunnel does not in and\nof itself provide\n\n330\n00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:55.957\nthat protection or\nset up some sort of protection.\n\n331\n00:15:55.957 --> 00:15:57.354\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n332\n00:15:57.354 --> 00:16:00.690\nThey're not secure the IPv6\npackets inside the tunnel.\n\n333\n00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.679\nBut the reason for that, if you\nremember why, and we talked about this,\n\n334\n00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:04.468\nwe hinted at this.\n\n335\n00:16:04.468 --> 00:16:07.981\nIf you remember, I think in our last\nepisode we talked about the fact that IPv6\n\n336\n00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:10.711\nnatively uses what,\nin order to provide confidentiality?\n\n337\n00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:14.119\nRemember we talked about the fact that\nwe are automatically with IPv6 doing\n\n338\n00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:14.712\nsomething.\n\n339\n00:16:14.712 --> 00:16:15.809\n&gt;&gt; IPSEC is required.\n\n340\n00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:23.143\n&gt;&gt; IPSEC is required, right, so we're not\nsetting up an encrypted tunnel end-to-end.\n\n341\n00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:27.121\nBecause we're encrypting and providing\nconfidentiality on the packets already.\n\n342\n00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:28.951\nSo we're not as worried\nabout the tunnel security.\n\n343\n00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:31.790\nBecause we're not really worried about\npeople seeing the data because they\n\n344\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.420\nare protected.\n\n345\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.551\nSo that's just something to\nkeep in mind and consider.\n\n346\n00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:41.413\nThe fact that because of the structure\nof the IPv6 protocol we do provide for\n\n347\n00:16:41.413 --> 00:16:44.996\nthat requirement that IPv6 requires IPSEC.\n\n348\n00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:48.851\nOr we mandate that it must be used, we're\nnot as worried about tunneling process.\n\n349\n00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:50.647\nWe're not as worried about,\nhey, we got to make sure.\n\n350\n00:16:50.647 --> 00:16:56.940\nThat we're architecting this really,\nreally involved complex security solution.\n\n351\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.771\nTo offset the issues and concerns\nthat maybe in IPv4 we would have had.\n\n352\n00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:03.158\nWhere natively we were not\nencrypting this package, right.\n\n353\n00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:04.413\nI mean we could certainly.\n\n354\n00:17:04.413 --> 00:17:08.664\nBut normally without going to\nthe trouble of setting up a VPN\n\n355\n00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:12.160\nwith an L2TPNIPSEC overlay or\nan SSL based VPN.\n\n356\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.190\nAn application layer VPN through\nthe web or whatever we would do.\n\n357\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.571\nWhen we're doing those things we're\noffsetting the fact that natively the IPv4\n\n358\n00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.589\npackets have no security\nassociated with them.\n\n359\n00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.157\nIn other words,\n\n360\n00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:24.557\nyeah they are just wide open,\nthey are just transmitted in the clear.\n\n361\n00:17:24.557 --> 00:17:28.570\nIPv6 packets natively are encrypted\nby default and by design.\n\n362\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.820\nSo, it does gives us some\nadditional capabilities.\n\n363\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.040\nAnd it's good just to think about that and\n\n364\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.780\nbe aware of that when we're talking\nabout these tunneling mechanisms.\n\n365\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.920\nCuz we're not as worried about the hey,\nwe need to do this whole thing and\n\n366\n00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.370\nmake sure it's encrypted end to end.\n\n367\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.316\nThe packets are encrypted.\n\n368\n00:17:42.316 --> 00:17:43.508\nThey are using IPv6.\n\n369\n00:17:43.508 --> 00:17:46.652\nSo as a result we've already got native\nsecurity in effect if you think about\n\n370\n00:17:46.652 --> 00:17:47.390\nit that way.\n\n371\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.980\nIt's already there natively and built-in.\n\n372\n00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.540\nThat is cool,\nyou should think that's cool.\n\n373\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.930\nYou should say, that was awesome.\n\n374\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.220\n&gt;&gt; That is awesome, Adam.\n\n375\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.300\nI gotta throw my arm in there too, whoo.\n\n376\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.000\n&gt;&gt; I like it, it gives me a chance just to\nreset the lab timer while we're talking.\n\n377\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.500\nVery good, so\nwe've got that thought process.\n\n378\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.464\nLet's talk about ISATAP.\n\n379\n00:18:02.464 --> 00:18:06.307\nI want to get into the idea for the last\nremaining part of our time together of\n\n380\n00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:08.634\nwhat we've done to this\npoint to set this up.\n\n381\n00:18:08.634 --> 00:18:11.990\nOther than just to get net prefix\npolicy I just quickly demoed for you.\n\n382\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.700\nBut I've got a bunch of stuff\nthat I've already set up.\n\n383\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.374\nI want to talk about it with you, kind of\nlay out the foundational thought process.\n\n384\n00:18:17.374 --> 00:18:20.062\nWhy do we have the registry editor open,\nwhat is going on with that?\n\n385\n00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:23.159\nWe're gonna talk through this, I'm gonna\nrestart this machine along the way.\n\n386\n00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:27.511\nBecause we are about to enable the ISATAP\ntunneling and further instantiate it so\n\n387\n00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:29.372\nit's already set and ready to go.\n\n388\n00:18:29.372 --> 00:18:32.809\nAnd then we are going to be able to go\nahead and complete the demonstration here.\n\n389\n00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:35.770\nAnd explain the thought process\nbehind what we are doing.\n\n390\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.020\nBut what I've done,\nessentially is taken this machine.\n\n391\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.420\nThis is just a Windows Server 16 Server.\n\n392\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.684\nAnd I've gone into the registry.\n\n393\n00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:45.193\nAnd you could see right here,\nif you take a look at the bottom.\n\n394\n00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:47.290\nYou could probably see the path here.\n\n395\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.180\nI'm in the H key local machine\nsystem current control set\n\n396\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.030\nservices TCP/IP parameters subfolder.\n\n397\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.530\nAnd you could see off to the left here.\n\n398\n00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.160\nLet me go up just a click or\ntwo so you can kind of see this.\n\n399\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.530\nYou could see the path.\n\n400\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.900\nAnd it is important to know we're\nin the parameter sub folder.\n\n401\n00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.990\nSo go to TCP IP and don't go to\nparameters you won't find the value\n\n402\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.390\nthat is highlighted for\nyour IP enabled router.\n\n403\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.150\nYou'll find a bunch of other stuff but\nnot the one you need.\n\n404\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.984\nSo you've got to go into that sub folder.\n\n405\n00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:19.326\nAnd then remember server 16 server so\nwe're talking about on server 16.\n\n406\n00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:23.183\nIP enable router, reg D word,\nthis is normally set to all zeros,\n\n407\n00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:25.250\nmeaning it's not enabled.\n\n408\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.330\nI went in, enabled this because this\nis how we turn on ISATAP support for\n\n409\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.850\nenabling software-based\nrouting on a server.\n\n410\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.000\nWe do this through the registry,\nwe enable this, we restart the machine.\n\n411\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.490\nIt then sets up and binds and\nshows us that that's functional.\n\n412\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.891\nThat's kind of step one.\n\n413\n00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:43.057\nAnd once we've done that,\nwe then do some net sh commands.\n\n414\n00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.476\nTo further clarify and\n\n415\n00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:48.620\nenable features that we then want\nto use with the ISATAP routing.\n\n416\n00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.430\nBut before we do that, so\nI've shown you just the registry part.\n\n417\n00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.220\nLet me just minimize,\nwe'll leave that there for a second.\n\n418\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.280\nLet me, that's just my hostname,\njust one second.\n\n419\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.830\nActually, you know what,\nI can do that from right here, no problem.\n\n420\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.420\nLet me just do ipconfig really quick.\n\n421\n00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.873\nAnd I can show you what\nthe output of that is.\n\n422\n00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.602\nLet me just come back up here.\n\n423\n00:20:09.602 --> 00:20:12.280\nI don't have to go all the way up there.\n\n424\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:18.600\nAnd let me see, where is that?\n\n425\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.610\nActually, you know what?\n\n426\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.260\nI do need to do this.\n\n427\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.130\nJust one second.\n\n428\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.200\nSo I forgot I need to do all.\n\n429\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.830\nAnd just go back up to right there.\n\n430\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.700\nAnd I'll make that a little bigger for\nyou.\n\n431\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.060\nI'm gonna highlight that\njust before I do that.\n\n432\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.430\nBut I'm gonna make that a little bigger,\njust so you can see it.\n\n433\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.618\nBut what I turned on with the registry\nediting is what I'm just highlighting and\n\n434\n00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:43.865\nI'm gonna show you right now.\n\n435\n00:20:43.865 --> 00:20:47.344\nI'm just gonna blow it up, so\nyou could see in a little bit bigger,\n\n436\n00:20:47.344 --> 00:20:49.724\njust make that 20 point so\nyou can see that.\n\n437\n00:20:49.724 --> 00:20:54.357\nAnd what I did, what we turned on,\nwas right here and I have to go back and\n\n438\n00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:57.615\nre-highlight so\njust give me a second to do that.\n\n439\n00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:03.077\nThat will be right up here and\nIP routing enabled right there.\n\n440\n00:21:03.077 --> 00:21:07.475\nSo I turned on that function by\nediting the registry key and\n\n441\n00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:11.444\nenabling IP routing in\nthe network stack for TCP IP.\n\n442\n00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:17.190\nWe started the machine, that value now set\nto 1 turns that feature on right there.\n\n443\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.185\nAnd that's gonna be the beginning\nof the journey for ISATAP.\n\n444\n00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:22.798\nWe have to enable the software based\nrouting capabilities in the network stack\n\n445\n00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:24.505\nto be able to leverage this feature.\n\n446\n00:21:24.505 --> 00:21:28.570\nAnd so we've done that and that is\nshowing us that IP routing is enabled.\n\n447\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.417\nRemember we're not setting\nup a remote access server.\n\n448\n00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:33.266\nWe're not enabling and\ninstalling RAS here.\n\n449\n00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:36.752\nAnd putting a whole console and\nan entire software based GUI for\n\n450\n00:21:36.752 --> 00:21:38.473\nrouting management in place.\n\n451\n00:21:38.473 --> 00:21:42.575\nWe're doing this just from the command\nline with just the basic networking stack\n\n452\n00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:43.428\ncapabilities.\n\n453\n00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:46.035\nAnd with the basic\nfunctionality that's there.\n\n454\n00:21:46.035 --> 00:21:49.885\nWe could go and install a RAS server and\nconfigure all sorts of other stuff.\n\n455\n00:21:49.885 --> 00:21:53.100\nBut ISATAP's not managed there,\nit's managed here.\n\n456\n00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.680\nAnd so, this is how we're going\nto enable this and stand this up.\n\n457\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.480\nSo, we set this up so far, we've already\nrebooted the server just to enable that.\n\n458\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.413\nI just wanted to show that to you, just so\nyou can see what that command does, and\n\n459\n00:22:03.413 --> 00:22:05.312\nwhat the registry editing was about.\n\n460\n00:22:05.312 --> 00:22:08.129\nNow that we've done that,\nwe're then gonna go ahead.\n\n461\n00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:14.132\nAnd we're gonna be able to configure\nthe interfaces here to support ISATAP.\n\n462\n00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:17.940\nAnd to provide addressing\nthrough ISATAP interfaces.\n\n463\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.230\nTo provide the tunneling that we wanna be\nable to use and do software routing with.\n\n464\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.610\nAnd so what I have here is, and\n\n465\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.140\njust ignore the get -netprefixpolicy\nthing that I just did below.\n\n466\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.620\nI just wanted to show you these\ntwo commands before I restart.\n\n467\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.020\nNetsh interface IPv6,\nwe're using Netsh right and\n\n468\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.090\nremember, just to remind you we've\ntaken a look at these before.\n\n469\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.907\nBut all the Netsh commands for IPv4 and\n\n470\n00:22:39.907 --> 00:22:44.781\nIPv6 overall are here specifically for\nthe interface for ISATAP.\n\n471\n00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:48.038\nThe ones that I'm using\nright now are on this page.\n\n472\n00:22:48.038 --> 00:22:50.570\nAnd you can go out and\nlook at a subset of them.\n\n473\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.762\nAnd we're using set router, set state,\nshow router, show state, in particular.\n\n474\n00:22:54.762 --> 00:22:58.569\nBut I'm configuring the ISATAP Interface\nso I'm using NetSH.\n\n475\n00:22:58.569 --> 00:23:02.890\nAnd using these kinds of commands for\nthat interaction.\n\n476\n00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.774\nAnd you'll see here set interface, so I'm\ndoing netSH interface IPv6 set interface.\n\n477\n00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:12.758\nAnd I've gotten this ISATAP string\nright here, it actually is just so\n\n478\n00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:14.538\nyou can see, it is this.\n\n479\n00:23:14.538 --> 00:23:17.865\nAnd I'll just bring that forward for\nyou just so you can see it.\n\n480\n00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:19.900\nI copied it and just dropped into Notepad.\n\n481\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.731\nI'm gonna make it just a little but\nbigger just so\n\n482\n00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:23.213\nyou can see exactly what it looks like.\n\n483\n00:23:23.213 --> 00:23:26.115\nAnd I'll show you where we\ngot this in just a second.\n\n484\n00:23:26.115 --> 00:23:27.645\nBut let me just blow this\nup a little bit just so\n\n485\n00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:30.155\nyou can see what that actually looks like.\n\n486\n00:23:30.155 --> 00:23:32.955\nThat's that string, it sit in blue and\nit kind of trails of and\n\n487\n00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.990\nwraps around it's kind of hard to see it.\n\n488\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.900\nBut it's the unique identifier for\none of the tunneling interfaces.\n\n489\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.890\nThe ISATAP string, the identifier for\nthe interface in question and\n\n490\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.700\nwhere I got that from, let's just\ngo back to our command line here.\n\n491\n00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.850\nI could do it from PowerShell or\nthe command line, it doesn't matter which.\n\n492\n00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:56.418\nJust center this so you can kind of\nsee this, but all we did here, so\n\n493\n00:23:56.418 --> 00:23:58.710\nipconfig all, remember right?\n\n494\n00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.164\nWe go down after we enable\nISATAP restart the machine, and\n\n495\n00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:05.416\nyou'll see I've got my\ntunnel adapter here, right?\n\n496\n00:24:05.416 --> 00:24:07.911\nTunnel adapter ISATAP right there.\n\n497\n00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.626\nAnd what I did is just highlighted this\ncuz I need this string, and I copied that\n\n498\n00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:17.341\nstring out because that's the unique\nidentifier that I have to use in the netsh\n\n499\n00:24:17.341 --> 00:24:22.290\ninterface, to set the tunnel adaptor and\nconfigure it so that way I can enable it.\n\n500\n00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.250\nAnd you see it says right below\nMicrosoft ISATAP adapter,\n\n501\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.110\nand I'm gonna be able to\nconfigure the information here.\n\n502\n00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.200\nAnd you'll see right now I do have\nan IPv6 address that's preferred.\n\n503\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.370\nI do have my link-local address,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n504\n00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.360\nAnd I've got some information here.\n\n505\n00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.611\nBut I'm gonna be able to work with\nthese tunnel adapters All right,\n\n506\n00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:44.830\noops sorry, went the wrong way.\n\n507\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.810\nGot another one right down below here,\nthere's my other one.\n\n508\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.080\nAnd you'll see I've got two of them and\n\n509\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.850\nI have to distinguish which\ntunnel adapter I wanna use.\n\n510\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.860\nAnd that's why I'm grabbing that string,\nthat unique identifier,\n\n511\n00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.920\nand I'm specifying which one I\nwanna be able to go in and program.\n\n512\n00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.240\nAnd so I grabbed that particular adaptor,\nthat's the one,\n\n513\n00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.870\nthe B7, BC 0 whatever, that's the string\nthat I grabbed, the first one.\n\n514\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.470\nAnd you could see that it matches there.\n\n515\n00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.540\nI just copied that out,\n\n516\n00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.300\nI did it in PowerShell cuz I can\nmark it in copy from PowerShell,\n\n517\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.450\nit's easier to do it than out of\nthe command line interface on the shell.\n\n518\n00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.470\nWith PowerShell actually if\nyou're not familiar with it,\n\n519\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.340\nyou can use the mark feature like\nyou would, like I just did here, but\n\n520\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.630\nyou can go up to the console, can actually\ncopy it, it'll copy what you mark.\n\n521\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.150\nSo you can actually just grab that.\n\n522\n00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.210\nAnd you could just make a copy of it.\n\n523\n00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.950\nThat's what I did just to have it here.\n\n524\n00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.880\nSo I grabbed that, right?\n\n525\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.000\nI went in.\nAnd I did that.\n\n526\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.010\nSo that's where we're getting\n\n527\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.460\nthat unique string from that\nyou're seeing here in blue.\n\n528\n00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.340\nSo NetSH interface, ipV6 set interface.\n\n529\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.530\nWhat interface are we setting?\n\n530\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:42.290\nWe're specifying which tunnel adapter,\nwhich ISATAP tunnel adapter we wanna set.\n\n531\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.020\nSo I set that.\n\n532\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.020\nAnd then what I do?\n\n533\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.330\nForwarding enabled.\n\n534\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.560\nAdvertise enabled.\n\n535\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.220\nNotice the end of the command there.\n\n536\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.600\nI'm enabling forwarding and\nI'm enabling advertisement.\n\n537\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.750\nAnd when I do that with netsh and\nnetsh is kinda interesting.\n\n538\n00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.030\nWhen we use netsh for most things,\nwe don't get back a response.\n\n539\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.330\nIn other words typically\nnetsh just does its thing and\n\n540\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.960\nthen just gives us a command prompt,\ndoesn't tell us anything.\n\n541\n00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.864\nIt's the silent, quiet type, right,\nit doesn't really say a lot.\n\n542\n00:26:06.864 --> 00:26:07.780\nVery stoic, as we would say.\n\n543\n00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.190\n&gt;&gt; You normally have to go and\nmanually check with ipconfig or\n\n544\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.850\nsomething like that.\n\n545\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.390\n&gt;&gt; You do, and you typically would in\nmany cases cuz you wanna make sure.\n\n546\n00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.870\nNow If you don't get an error back,\nit is good.\n\n547\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.520\nIf you screw something up, it does yell at\nyou and say hey, sorry that didn't work.\n\n548\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.770\nSo if you don't get anything back,\ntypically you could assume it's good.\n\n549\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.850\nBut you never wanna assume, right?\n\n550\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.830\nWe know that that's a problem.\n\n551\n00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.970\nSo Cherokee is making a great point.\n\n552\n00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:26.830\nHey, go check that.\n\n553\n00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.760\nAnd the way you check that Is with\nipconfig, like I just did in the console.\n\n554\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.940\nI'm gonna go back in a minute\nto the shell and show you that.\n\n555\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.480\nSo interestingly though, when we do\nnetsh and we're setting up the ISOTAP\n\n556\n00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.120\ncontent here, I know it's kinda hard to\nsee cuz it's right off to the side, but\n\n557\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.740\nit actually gives us some pointing to it.\n\n558\n00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.990\nAt the end of the command,\nit actually gives us the okay.\n\n559\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.940\nIt says literally okay period.\n\n560\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.020\nAnd it says okay I did that.\n\n561\n00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.470\nOkay, it gives us okay\nat the end of the line.\n\n562\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.190\nAnd so it actually comes back\nin this particular area.\n\n563\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.340\nAnd it does respond and\nactually gives us a little input.\n\n564\n00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.440\nIt says okay, yeah, you're good.\n\n565\n00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.390\nAnd I do the next one and\nit says okay again.\n\n566\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.650\nNetsh interface ipv6 add route,\nwhat am I doing there?\n\n567\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.490\nI'm adding a route.\n\n568\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.440\nSo, I'm adding it and you could see\nI'm adding my route prefix actually,\n\n569\n00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.060\nright cuz that's what I'm doing, right?\n\n570\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.860\nSo, and on again on that interface,\n\n571\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.270\non that tunnel the interface,\nam I publishing that?\n\n572\n00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.080\nYeah, I'm publishing that.\n\n573\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.040\nAnd then it comes back and\nsays okay again.\n\n574\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.720\nAnd so before I restart because I have to\nrestart to get this all set up, right?\n\n575\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.200\nSo we are saying here forwarding enabled\nadvertising enabled on this, right?\n\n576\n00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.860\nWell let's go take a look, right?\n\n577\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.130\nJust before we restart.\n\n578\n00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.280\nSo we're on our first adaptor, right?\n\n579\n00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.760\nYou'll notice here,\nI've got my basic information,\n\n580\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.330\njust if you can keep it straight in your\nhead for a minute what you're seeing.\n\n581\n00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.460\nBut I don't have those settings here yet.\n\n582\n00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.250\nThey're not totally instantiated.\n\n583\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.610\nRestarting again,\nwhich is what we're about to do right now,\n\n584\n00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.950\nis gonna enable those features\nthat we just turned on with netsh.\n\n585\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.470\nYou do have to restart\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n586\n00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.800\nSo keep in mind, you're setting up and\n\n587\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.740\nenabling ISATAP initially with the\nsoftware interface in the registry edit.\n\n588\n00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.660\nSetting up and publishing the route and\nbinding it and doing all that.\n\n589\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.558\nWe gotta restart when we're doing this.\n\n590\n00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:05.030\nSo you are gonna have some disruption here\nin terms of the ability to be able to\n\n591\n00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.380\njust have things up and\nrunning continuously.\n\n592\n00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.780\nAnd just cleaning up real quick\nbefore we restart just so\n\n593\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.440\nthat we are not restarting\nwith the registry editor open.\n\n594\n00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.530\nStuff like that, never a good idea to do\nthat, that can always lead to problems.\n\n595\n00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.922\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nwe are gonna shut down here so,\n\n596\n00:28:18.922 --> 00:28:21.106\nwe will just issue our shut down command,\nright?\n\n597\n00:28:21.106 --> 00:28:25.257\nSlash r slash t0, all right,\nso we will do that.\n\n598\n00:28:25.257 --> 00:28:25.990\nWe are just gonna restart.\n\n599\n00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.290\nWe will lose connectivity there for\njust a second.\n\n600\n00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.010\nWe will wait for that to come back up.\n\n601\n00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.390\nLet me just come back over here,\njust refresh that real quick.\n\n602\n00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.138\nAnd we'll come back in, in just a moment.\n\n603\n00:28:38.138 --> 00:28:42.493\nI'm just gonna choose my machine here and\nopen up a console in just a moment to get\n\n604\n00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:46.210\nback into it as soon, we got to wait\nabout a minute for it to restart.\n\n605\n00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:46.790\nSo we'll wait on that.\n\n606\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.230\nSo while we're waiting,\nlet me just show you what ISATAP addresses\n\n607\n00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:54.800\nbased on either private IPv4 or public\nIPv4 addresses are formatted out as.\n\n608\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.570\nCuz you just saw me use one for\nthe public IPv4 address that was\n\n609\n00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.660\nthe statement there why I\nset up the second route.\n\n610\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.390\nAnd I said, 2001 DBA,\nyou know etc slash 64.\n\n611\n00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.400\nThat was the translation for\nan IPv4 address.\n\n612\n00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.510\nSo let's just take a look here,\nI've got them just teed up right here.\n\n613\n00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.890\nYou'll see if we do an ISATAP\nbased address, right?\n\n614\n00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.370\nFormatted as follows for\nan IPv4 translation.\n\n615\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.780\nWe'll have our 64-bit unicast prefix,\nright?\n\n616\n00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.941\nYou guys know about that now.\n\n617\n00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:25.274\nAnd then we'll end it with this right\nhere, and whatever the w, x, y, z is,\n\n618\n00:29:25.274 --> 00:29:29.412\nas I put in the bracket or parenthesis\nhere, it's meant to signify part of\n\n619\n00:29:29.412 --> 00:29:34.680\nthe IPv4 and part of the IPv6 address that\nwe're using in the last part of the block.\n\n620\n00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.740\nSo this right here should be\nrecognizable to all of you.\n\n621\n00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.290\nThat's our IPv4 address.\n\n622\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.580\nThat would be whatever address\nwe're gonna use, right?\n\n623\n00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.630\nI just put in a ten dot address.\n\n624\n00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.350\nYou could put in anything you\nwant there obviously, right?\n\n625\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:50.850\nFor a public address, it will be the same\nkind of thing, our 64 bit unit cast\n\n626\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:57.450\nprefix, right, and then,\nyou'll see right here 200:5EFE.\n\n627\n00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.600\nAnd then again, our IPv4 address.\n\n628\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.970\nSo, we did 2001:db8::, right.\n\n629\n00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.910\nWhatever that would be for our prefix.\n\n630\n00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:09.637\nI had that in there with my /64 In the\ncommand line that I issued to signify that\n\n631\n00:30:09.637 --> 00:30:10.847\nwould be my prefix.\n\n632\n00:30:10.847 --> 00:30:14.305\nAnd then, I've got the host ID, 205 FE and\n\n633\n00:30:14.305 --> 00:30:18.573\nthen whatever my IPv4,\npublic IPv4 address would be.\n\n634\n00:30:18.573 --> 00:30:21.490\nThis would typically come from our ISP for\ninstance, right?\n\n635\n00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.280\nMost likely that's what we would be using.\n\n636\n00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.330\nSo you could see that there.\n\n637\n00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.040\nAgain, in the real world\nwhat are you doing?\n\n638\n00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.910\nYou're substituting in the value for\n\n639\n00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.640\nthat IPv4 address given whatever\nyou're gonna use, right?\n\n640\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.860\nI'm just giving you an example of what it\nwould look like here as we're talking.\n\n641\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.270\nThis is not gonna be exactly, in other\nwords verbatim, what you would do.\n\n642\n00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.850\nBut you would put in the IP addresses that\nare specific to your environment, right?\n\n643\n00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.250\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n644\n00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.610\nNow the ISATAP router which is\nwhat we're setting up here, right?\n\n645\n00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:50.250\nIf we don't have certain kinds\nof configuration and support,\n\n646\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.920\nwe're using this essentially right to\nbe able to provide our information,\n\n647\n00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.750\nour tunneling,\npotentially our ISATAP capabilities.\n\n648\n00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.300\nAnd so the ISATAP router as you could see\nright here, can we go full screen just so\n\n649\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.720\nyou can see that cuz I'm kinda\nhovering over a part of it.\n\n650\n00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.640\nYou'll see, right?\n\n651\n00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.770\nIf there are no IPv6 only host\nmeaning we don't have hosts\n\n652\n00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.090\nthat are only using IPv6\nas we talked about.\n\n653\n00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:13.460\nRemember we talked about hosts and nodes\nas being equivalent to one another, right?\n\n654\n00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.210\nSo if we don't have IPv6 only host,\nthe router, the IPv6 router, the ISATAP\n\n655\n00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.830\nrouter, excuse me, advertises the IPv6\nprefix that those clients are gonna use.\n\n656\n00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.957\nRemember we talked about the fact that we\ncan get router advertisements using IPv6.\n\n657\n00:31:27.957 --> 00:31:31.717\nIPv6 only hosts or\nones that are just gonna use IPv6 and\n\n658\n00:31:31.717 --> 00:31:35.810\nnothing else were probably\ncoexisting most of the time.\n\n659\n00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.490\nWould probably have IPv4\nand/or IPv6 capable nodes,\n\n660\n00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.200\nprobably a little bit of both, right?\n\n661\n00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.420\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n662\n00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.940\nThe ISATAP interface on the computer\nis configured for that prefix.\n\n663\n00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.811\nAnd when an application needs that,\nthe packet is encapsulated,\n\n664\n00:31:48.811 --> 00:31:50.564\nas we talked about with this tunneling.\n\n665\n00:31:50.564 --> 00:31:54.730\nRight into the IPv4 packet and\ndelivered to the IPv4 address on\n\n666\n00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.758\nthe destination host that also understands\nand uses the ISATAP capability.\n\n667\n00:31:59.758 --> 00:32:03.461\nThe ISATAP router, unpacks IPv6 packets,\nmakes them available.\n\n668\n00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:07.981\nHosts are able to send to the IPv4 address\nof the router, and the ISATAP router\n\n669\n00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:12.860\nunpacks those packets and sends them back\nthe other way on to the IPv6 only network.\n\n670\n00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.420\nSo it's that translation device\nthat sits back and forth or\n\n671\n00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.730\nsits on the board of a twin.\n\n672\n00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.240\nSo it's almost like a NAT device if\nyou think about the way NAT works,\n\n673\n00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.700\nit's very similar to a NAT device\nhiding and interacting with and\n\n674\n00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.780\ncausing or allowing translation back and\n\n675\n00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.240\nforth between private internal on\nthe IPv4 traditional networks with NAT.\n\n676\n00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.680\nPrivate internal,\nyou know class A, class B,\n\n677\n00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.400\nclass C set aside addresses from public\naddresses out on the routable internet,\n\n678\n00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.290\ninterfaces on the network,\nmeaning out on the internet, right?\n\n679\n00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.145\nWe're translating it to gateway,\nwe're going between them because we're\n\n680\n00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:47.775\nencapsulating and uncapsulating,\nthat's what it does.\n\n681\n00:32:47.775 --> 00:32:52.480\nISATAP routers act essentially the same\nway, they're just updating NAT devices on\n\n682\n00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.510\nour IPv6 networks to provide this IPv6\nto IPv4 capability back and forth.\n\n683\n00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.550\nI'm not suggesting that is what\nthey do a hundred percent.\n\n684\n00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.170\nI'm just pointing out that\nthat is an approximation for\n\n685\n00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.720\nthe kind of functionality that\nwe are seeing, just to be clear.\n\n686\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.640\nJust wanna make sure we don't\nspecify that that's the case,\n\n687\n00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.490\nnecessarily, without that caveat.\n\n688\n00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.140\nMeaning that it does\ndefinitely work that way, but.\n\n689\n00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.210\nRemember there are other things\nthat ISATAP is providing.\n\n690\n00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.150\nAll right, so I want to go ahead and\nwant to log back in.\n\n691\n00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.880\nWe should have our console up right now,\n\n692\n00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.840\nexcept of course it just\ndisconnected on me.\n\n693\n00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.680\nSo give me just a second.\n\n694\n00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.040\nWe're gonna log back in.\n\n695\n00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.035\nSo let me just drop this one here,\nwe're just reconnected.\n\n696\n00:33:30.035 --> 00:33:31.975\nWell, actually,\nthat's cuz I chose the wrong machine.\n\n697\n00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:32.965\nThat would be why?\n\n698\n00:33:32.965 --> 00:33:33.485\nWhere's my SA?\n\n699\n00:33:33.485 --> 00:33:34.345\nThere it is, right there.\n\n700\n00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:37.015\n&gt;&gt; And it's interesting that you\nmentioned NAT because not all these\n\n701\n00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.425\nthese technologies will work\nsuccessfully with the NATs but\n\n702\n00:33:39.425 --> 00:33:42.375\nI think that's coming\nup in the next episode.\n\n703\n00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.\n\n704\n00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Awkward.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not awkward,\n\n705\n00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.580\nI'm just logging in.\n\n706\n00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.340\nSo, I'm just focusing on that for\na minute.\n\n707\n00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.500\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you out here, okay.\n\n708\n00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.430\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwe can pick back up where we left off.\n\n709\n00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.050\nRight, so we're gonna keep going here.\n\n710\n00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.410\nWe will, we will,\nat some point talk about that.\n\n711\n00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.625\nWe're not necessarily going to get to it,\nactually I'm looking at the time.\n\n712\n00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:02.112\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will get to it in the next episode,\n\n713\n00:34:02.112 --> 00:34:04.039\ncuz we are gonna,\nI didn't realize we were [CROSSTALK]\n\n714\n00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:06.186\n&gt;&gt; My subtle but, so obvious cues here.\n\n715\n00:34:06.186 --> 00:34:07.844\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm deep in the demo here,\n\n716\n00:34:07.844 --> 00:34:09.600\nI'm not paying attention to your cues.\n\n717\n00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.710\nYou've got to just you know,\n\n718\n00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.230\nsmack me on the head a the notebook\nto make me pay attention.\n\n719\n00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.130\nAll right, so we are bringing the machine\nback up after having configured and\n\n720\n00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.440\nset essentially all of this.\n\n721\n00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.450\nWe've got our service, hopefully\nnow everything is instantiated, but\n\n722\n00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:24.320\nwe'll do an IP config real\nquick just to take a look.\n\n723\n00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.630\nAnd then once we have that set up, what\nwe're gonna see is our IPv6 address now,\n\n724\n00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.190\nour global IPv6 address,\nwill be there on the tunnel adapter.\n\n725\n00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.580\nWe're gonna take a look at that right now.\n\n726\n00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.500\nLet me just wait one more second for\nthis just to make sure everything is good,\n\n727\n00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.810\ndo a refresh here real quick,\njust make sure everything has started.\n\n728\n00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.820\nJust wanna make sure we don't\nhave any service issues.\n\n729\n00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:49.280\nAlways good to take the extra 15\nseconds when you're restarting the box.\n\n730\n00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.820\nJust make sure everything looks good.\n\n731\n00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.020\nWe expect those services not\nto be running, by the way.\n\n732\n00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.050\nThose are fine.\n\n733\n00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.140\nSo we're not worried about that.\n\n734\n00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.310\nAll right, so\nlet's get back in there to PowerShell.\n\n735\n00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.850\nGive me just a second to open up.\n\n736\n00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.910\nPowershell here, you can't see it behind\nthe menu there behind the picture, but\n\n737\n00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.020\nI just loaded powershell up just so\nyou could see it.\n\n738\n00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.660\nAll right, so we're just gonna\nan IP config write from in here.\n\n739\n00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.850\nWe can do it from\nthe command line as well,\n\n740\n00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.950\nit doesn't matter we can do it either way.\n\n741\n00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.610\nBut we'll just bring this up,\n\n742\n00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:18.510\nlet's take a look at out tunnel adapter,\nthere's out tunnel adapter right here.\n\n743\n00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.110\nThat is the one if you remember\nthat we were focusing on.\n\n744\n00:35:22.138 --> 00:35:27.010\nAnd you could see now,\nwe do have our IPv6 address right there\n\n745\n00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.460\nwith our IPv4 address\nappended to it at the end,\n\n746\n00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:38.550\nthe IPv4-IPv6 combo address that ISATAP\nprovides that I was setting up and\n\n747\n00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.400\nconfiguring with netsh as\nwe were just talking about.\n\n748\n00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.760\nYou'll see it there.\n\n749\n00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.940\nAnd when we restarted,\nall of that information was specified or\n\n750\n00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.720\nbound to the tunnel adaptors as they\ncame back up and re-initialized.\n\n751\n00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.700\nAnd notice,\nthe second tunnel adaptor here,\n\n752\n00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.520\nthe one we didn't bother to configure and\nwe're not using.\n\n753\n00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.510\nNotice it is still set\nup just out of the box\n\n754\n00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.430\nwith just it's default link-local address,\nright?\n\n755\n00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:06.160\nBut we haven't actually specified\neverything else associated with it.\n\n756\n00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.830\nYou'll notice for instance there,\n\n757\n00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.710\nwe do have our link local address on both,\nright?\n\n758\n00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.060\nAnd notice it is 192.168.0.40, right?\n\n759\n00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:20.970\nFor this and this one is 0.4 because\nit has a separate IP assigned to it.\n\n760\n00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.680\nWe have two interfaces,\nI have one for each but\n\n761\n00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.680\nI've assigned my IPv6 address\nto the first tunnel adaptor and\n\n762\n00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.080\nspecified it because I actually\nprogrammed it in through netSH.\n\n763\n00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.950\nThis other one is just a link\nlocal on the other tunnel adaptor,\n\n764\n00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:36.820\nthat's the one that host\nconfigures automatically.\n\n765\n00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.700\nBut it's not actually used to be\nable to remember connect out and\n\n766\n00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.080\ntalk to boxes everywhere.\n\n767\n00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.940\nThat link local address is essentially\nlike that automatic private\n\n768\n00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.870\nIP that we talked about in IPv4.\n\n769\n00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:50.130\nIt's really just used for\nsub net communication or\n\n770\n00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.840\ncommunication on the LAN but\njust in that one area not routable and\n\n771\n00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.070\ncertainly not able to communicate back and\nforth with that.\n\n772\n00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.718\nSo, this is the output\nof what we just did.\n\n773\n00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:04.190\nWe actually bound that IP\n0.40 to the IPV6 string.\n\n774\n00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.150\nAnd now, we're gonna be able\nto use ISATAP to send and\n\n775\n00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:11.390\nreceive, and move traffic back and\nforth, between an IPV4 and IPV6 network.\n\n776\n00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:15.550\nAnd we're gonna enable ISATAP\non an IPV4 only domains server.\n\n777\n00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.470\nWe're gonna go in and take a look at\nhow to do that, but we're gonna do\n\n778\n00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.560\nthat when we come back, because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n779\n00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.790\n&gt;&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n780\n00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:24.090\nout of time for\nthe first part of our demonstration here.\n\n781\n00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.410\nSo I want to be sensitive to that.\n\n782\n00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.190\nSo we're going to come back with a part\ntwo of the demo, you're gonna join me.\n\n783\n00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.020\nI'm gonna leave it right here so when you\ncome back you'll see, we're just gonna\n\n784\n00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.620\npick it right up from there, but\nthen we'll flip over to our other box.\n\n785\n00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.140\nI'm gonna go over to my, or setup the\nenablement for the IPv4 support and we'll\n\n786\n00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.720\ntake a look and kind of step through the\nlogic of how the rest of this works, okay.\n\n787\n00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.320\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nThat’s right you heard us.\n\n788\n00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.830\nSo please join us for\nan additional parts to this demonstration.\n\n789\n00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.780\nBut for this show we will go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n790\n00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.060\nRemember, I'm your host, DHCP Dora.\n\n791\n00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.840\n&gt;&gt; That means I'm Boots.\n\n792\n00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.985\nOtherwise

much like\n\n795\n00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:07.530\nwe're doing in IPv4 and IPv6 [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I see what you did.\n\n796\n00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n797\n00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.532\n&gt;&gt; I made a hybrid.\n\n798\n00:38:08.532 --> 00:38:09.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n799\n00:38:09.531 --> 00:38:12.440\nso please join us for that.\nBut thank you and have a great day.\n\n800\n00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.359\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n801\n00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:22.434\n[MUSIC]\n\n802\n00:38:22.434 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.975 --> 00:00:08.023\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.023 --> 00:00:11.854\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:15.166\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 Series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.327\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:20.711\nIn this episode,\nwe'll continue taking a look at IPv6.\n\n9\n00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:23.960\nAnd back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.830\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nalways a pleasure to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.940\nSo we're going to continue our march\ntoward the sea, as Sherman said.\n\n13\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.880\nWe're gonna actually continue\ngoing through our demo.\n\n14\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.420\nWe left off if you remember trying to\nfinish up our ISATAP configuration.\n\n15\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.750\nRemember ISATAP is one of the ways\nwe can tunnel traffic, IPv4 to IPv6,\n\n16\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.740\nsoftware based routing capabilities\ninstalled on a machine and configured.\n\n17\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.032\nISATAP adapters on the client side,\nremember,\n\n18\n00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:54.143\nis natively supported Windows 8,\n8.1, Windows 10.\n\n19\n00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:56.881\nOn the server side,\ncertainly server 16 supports it.\n\n20\n00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.891\nSo we do see it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.200\nI showed you how to enable\nit on the server side.\n\n22\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.130\nThe clients are already capable\nof using it as you've seen,\n\n23\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.370\nwe're about to demonstrate that for\nyou right now.\n\n24\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.610\nBut we left off having set up with netsh,\nthe interface, we configured\n\n25\n00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.590\nthe ISATAP tunnel adapter, one of the two\nthat we targeted, or said we would use.\n\n26\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.600\nWe started the system, logged back in,\nsaw the address was bound.\n\n27\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.100\nNow what we're going to do is\njump over to the other machine.\n\n28\n00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.310\nSo if you join me back here, we'll take\na look at the last little part of this.\n\n29\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.330\nAnd then we're going to jump in and\n\n30\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.410\ncontinue our conversation as soon as we\nfinish up this part of the demo here.\n\n31\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.645\nAnd we'll jump over to the other kind of\ntechnology we can also set up which is\n\n32\n00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:34.020\nthe 6 to 4 tunneling.\n\n33\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.780\nWe talked about that as well.\n\n34\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.170\nWe'll set up our 6 to 4 tunnel and\nwe'll take a look at how to configure that\n\n35\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.410\nas kind of an added feature,\nan added bonus for you.\n\n36\n00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.720\nSo we'll just continue the netsh\nin here and go through and\n\n37\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.220\nshow you how to set that up.\n\n38\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.903\nBut before we do that if you take a look\nhere at the netsh command that I issued,\n\n39\n00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:55.441\nI'll just highlight it for you right\nhere on this machine, I went ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.130\nI set up netsh interface\nisatap set router.\n\n41\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.717\nRemember we took a look at, or\n\n42\n00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:04.033\nI showed you in the last episode that we\nhave a netsh command specific for ISATAP,\n\n43\n00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.200\nset router, set stage show,\nrouter show state, right, set in show.\n\n44\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.300\nSo you see here,\nwe were looking at the set router command.\n\n45\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.600\nWe specified the router would be equal\nto the configuration we specified and\n\n46\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.950\nset up on our other box.\n\n47\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.260\nRemember I showed you that we\nhad configured this restarted.\n\n48\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.810\nAnd that our router was\ngonna be 192.168.0.40.\n\n49\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.451\nSo what we're doing now on this machine\nis telling it to look to that router at\n\n50\n00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:33.350\nthat IP address to use to translate and\nsend and receive ISATAP traffic.\n\n51\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.490\nAnd once we've done that, I'll show you\nwhere that comes up in just a minute.\n\n52\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.460\nBut before we do that, let's go back,\nlet's go over here, to our, whoops,\n\n53\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.790\nthat was the wrong one.\n\n54\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.930\nLet's go over here,\ntry that one more time, there.\n\n55\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.040\nLet's go over here, that's what I wanted,\nlet's go over here to the box where we\n\n56\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.400\nmade that software router and\nessentially configured it.\n\n57\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.613\nThis was the box we were working on,\nwe left it here, said we'd start out,\n\n58\n00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:58.930\nwe'd take a look and\nremind ourselves of that.\n\n59\n00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.190\nYou see our tunnel adapter if you\nwere keeping track of what we did.\n\n60\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.147\nThat's the tunnel\ninterface right there and\n\n61\n00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:09.202\nthat's the IPv6 address string\nthat we're using, right.\n\n62\n00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:15.217\nAnd we said hey, 61 [CROSSTALK] 0.40,\nthat's the routing interface.\n\n63\n00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:18.970\nOr that's the ISATAP interface\nwe're using as our tunnel adapter.\n\n64\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.686\nSo we've set this up here for ISATAP,\nthis is where we programmed it.\n\n65\n00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:29.620\nAnd we used that 2001.db80.10.0.5efe\nstring on the IPv6.\n\n66\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.420\nThat is how we know that we're getting our\nIP address through the tunnel adapter and\n\n67\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.550\nthat we're configuring communication,\nif we see that.\n\n68\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.570\nSo we know that this is\nthe software router,\n\n69\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.390\nnow what we're doing is going back to\nthe box I was just on, the one that\n\n70\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.680\nI kept clicking on cuz I thought I\nwas changing the console interface.\n\n71\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.470\nAnd what we're doing is now you're seeing,\nwe're issuing that command right here.\n\n72\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.720\nThen we get our okay,\nI love the fact that it's cut off there.\n\n73\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.418\nBut I love the fact,\nas I pointed out, okay, yes, but\n\n74\n00:03:56.418 --> 00:04:00.236\nI love the fact I told you that netsh in\nthe last episode actually speaks back to\n\n75\n00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:04.377\nus here and says, okay, yeah, I did that,\nas opposed to just telling us nothing.\n\n76\n00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:07.040\nSo it actually does give us the okay here.\n\n77\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.500\nYou'll see I did an ipconfig, and\nwhen I do that what you will find or\n\n78\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.790\nsee, just go back over here and\nmake this full screen.\n\n79\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.640\nAnd let me just scroll down ever so,\n\n80\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.930\njust a little bit right there,\non this tunnel adapter.\n\n81\n00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.230\nAnd you can see tunnel adapter\ninterface right there is different.\n\n82\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.310\nWe're on a different machine.\n\n83\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.411\nThat is the adapter interface, so\nthe ISATAP tunnel adapter on this machine,\n\n84\n00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.845\nthe one that we're telling to go and\nfind the router at 0.40.\n\n85\n00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:40.864\nAnd so you can see we're using a different\ninterface, so what you see here is\n\n86\n00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:47.260\nthe IPv6 address that is assigned,\ntake a look at that, 2001.db8.010.05efe.\n\n87\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.090\nThat's coming rom the ISATAP\nrouter that's set up at 0.40.\n\n88\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.056\nThat's the prefix that we specified,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:58.090\nAnd we're getting 192.168.0.2 on\nthis interface, that's the address\n\n90\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.810\nwhere the interface IPv4 address\nthat we're using on this machine,\n\n91\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.120\nyou could see it right here,\nethernet adapter vEthernet.\n\n92\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.251\nRight above it,\nIPv4 address right there is 192.168.0.2.\n\n93\n00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:13.896\nWe're binding, in other words,\n\n94\n00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:18.470\nthis IPv4 adapter assigned\naddress to the adapter above.\n\n95\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.144\nYou see that we're using that in concert\nwith the IPv6 address on the tunnel\n\n96\n00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:23.810\nadapter.\n\n97\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.350\nIt's coming from this local machine, and\nthat shows us where it's coming from, but\n\n98\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.070\nit also shows us where we got the IPv6\nportion of that IPv6 address the prefix\n\n99\n00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.870\nfor, which is from the routered\ninterface on the other machine.\n\n100\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.870\nSo it shows us, unequivocally, that we\nare communicating with the router and\n\n101\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.220\nhave configured that and that is set\nup and we're all set, ready to go.\n\n102\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.745\nAnd so we've completed our journey,\nso to speak.\n\n103\n00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:45.680\nWe've got that but\n\n104\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.970\nwe're gonna double check, cuz we're\nnot gonna just take my word for it.\n\n105\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.690\nCherokee said trust but verify, you've\nalways gotta ping, do an ipconfig and\n\n106\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.310\ncheck all that.\n\n107\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.390\nSo let's go over to our other machine,\nand see whether or\n\n108\n00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.900\nnot that's actually happening.\n\n109\n00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.910\nSo let's go to our Windows 10 machine,\n\n110\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.430\njust got another Windows machine that's\nrunning here, you can see it right here.\n\n111\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.190\nAnd assuming that all of that is working,\n\n112\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.580\nwhat we should be able\nto see is the following.\n\n113\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.426\nI should be able to ping, and indeed I\njust did, right, ping the DM01 machine,\n\n114\n00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:16.830\nthe machine where I just was looking at.\n\n115\n00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.990\nYou can see when I pinged it,\nwhat do I get back?\n\n116\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.780\nI get back four replies using IPv6, right?\n\n117\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.892\nAnd you'll see that's coming from, and\nwe'll go back, we'll take a look and\n\n118\n00:06:24.892 --> 00:06:26.341\nsee it's coming from that machine.\n\n119\n00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:27.981\nWe'll take a look at\nthat in just a minute.\n\n120\n00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:32.568\nAnd you see that when I ping\nthe IP address, 192.168.0.2,\n\n121\n00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:36.870\nwhich we know is assigned to that\nmachine I was just looking at.\n\n122\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.020\nThe server where we just took a look at\nand saw that we're communicating with\n\n123\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.240\nthe router, when I ping that, you see\nI do get a response back using IPv4.\n\n124\n00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.840\nSo I can ping either the IP address or\nthe host name,\n\n125\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.450\nbecause the host name of\nthat machine is plabdm01.\n\n126\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.765\nI can ping either one, when I ping the IP,\nspecifically IPv4, I get back a response.\n\n127\n00:06:56.765 --> 00:07:00.100\nWhen I ping the host name, I'm getting\nback the full cloud 5 domain name.\n\n128\n00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.530\nI'm getting back\na response using the IPv6.\n\n129\n00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.310\nWe're using both interfaces, we're talking\nusing both IP address interfaces and\n\n130\n00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.510\nI'm able to now use and move back and\n\n131\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.770\nforth through the ISATAP router that I've\nspecified to be able to move that traffic.\n\n132\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.280\nSo we're seeing evidence of that.\n\n133\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.332\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool that we can at least\ncontinue our communications, and\n\n134\n00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:21.342\ndon't have to really worry about\nif we're using IPv6, IPv4.\n\n135\n00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:24.020\nIt's not prohibiting us in\nany way in that concept.\n\n136\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.660\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not, and it's enabling us, in\nother words, or allowing us to be able to\n\n137\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.570\nmove the traffic back and forth\nirrespective, in other words, essentially\n\n138\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.380\nas you were saying, as we've talked about,\nof the IP address support, right?\n\n139\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.450\nBecause we now have a device that will\nallow us to interact with and see both.\n\n140\n00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.523\nAnd so when we go back and\n\n141\n00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:47.919\nwe take a look at our, yep, right there.\n\n142\n00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:54.403\nWhen we take a look at this, right, you'll\nsee this is this IPv6 address right here.\n\n143\n00:07:54.403 --> 00:07:56.376\nIf you go back, and\nwe'll go back one more time.\n\n144\n00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.894\nBut if I highlight, just to remind you,\n\n145\n00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.693\ncuz I didn't really say\nby the way look at both.\n\n146\n00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:01.860\nCuz it's a lot of information\nto keep track of all at one.\n\n147\n00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.287\nBut the IPv6 address that is answering us.\n\n148\n00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:10.048\nWhen we ping the PLAB DM 01 machine\nhostname is that IPv6 address right there.\n\n149\n00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:13.502\nAnd you'll see the IPv4 address\nthat's answering us when we\n\n150\n00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:18.230\nping 192.168.0.2 is the one right\nbelow on the same interface, right?\n\n151\n00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.645\nWe have both bound as you can see\nto that ethernet adapter vethernet.\n\n152\n00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:23.231\nSo we can see unequivocally and\n\n153\n00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:26.224\nbeyond any doubt that we\nare communicating with this box.\n\n154\n00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:29.524\nAnd we're getting both kinds\nof traffic being sent back and\n\n155\n00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:33.615\nforth coming through the ISO tap router,\nsoftware base router.\n\n156\n00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:38.175\nThat, by the way, is not just cool,\nit's awesome, awesomely cool.\n\n157\n00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:40.795\nIt's IPv6 cool that's\ngonna be how cool it is.\n\n158\n00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:43.745\nAll right so we've set that up,\nthat's one way we can do this.\n\n159\n00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:44.675\nBut we're not done yet.\n\n160\n00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:46.865\nWe said we would talk about yet\nanother way to do this.\n\n161\n00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:49.395\nWhat about doing six to four tunneling,\nwe talked about this.\n\n162\n00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.186\nRemember we can do six to\nfour tunneling as well.\n\n163\n00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:56.118\nTalked about the ability to be able to\nmove traffic between two IPv6 sites or\n\n164\n00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.905\nbetween an IPv6 host and or an IPv6 site.\n\n165\n00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.045\nProviding support on both sides.\n\n166\n00:09:01.045 --> 00:09:03.804\nBut remember and I don't know\nif I necessarily specified this.\n\n167\n00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:07.058\nWe talked generically about this\nidea of the ISOTAP functionality.\n\n168\n00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:09.372\nBehaving very similar to\nwhat NAT would be like.\n\n169\n00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:11.501\nIn a sense we are moving traffic back and\nforth.\n\n170\n00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:13.664\nI made it clear,\nI said hey this is not NAT.\n\n171\n00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:16.922\nBut I was just using it as\nan analogy to say, you know what?\n\n172\n00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:19.986\nIt acts in a similar way in a sense\nthat we're able to move the traffic back\n\n173\n00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:20.498\nand forth.\n\n174\n00:09:20.498 --> 00:09:22.892\nAnd translate it seeing one or the other.\n\n175\n00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:26.550\nAnd we have a device that understands\nboth, essentially what NAT does more or\n\n176\n00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.530\nless, right.\n\n177\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.450\nBut with 6to4 tunneling, it's not\na suitable scenario that required NAT.\n\n178\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.460\nWe do not use NAT or support this concept,\nonly use 6to4 tunneling.\n\n179\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.790\nSo I just wanna make sure you're\naware of this when you think about\n\n180\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.680\nthe logic of this.\n\n181\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.070\nBut when the 6to4 tunnel has set up and\n\n182\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.840\nwe'll walk through the steps to\nget this up and running here.\n\n183\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.740\nWe provide sites with IPv6 connectivity\nover the IPv4 internet, or\n\n184\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.390\npublicly routing networks.\n\n185\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.460\nSo we're able to move IPv6 traffic through\nIPv4 networks using 6 to 4 tunneling.\n\n186\n00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.560\nGonna be important for\nus to think about that.\n\n187\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.025\nThere's a lot of need for that in certain\ncircles, maybe not so much in others.\n\n188\n00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.549\nYou pointed out when we\nwere talking about this.\n\n189\n00:10:04.549 --> 00:10:06.514\nThat hey, it's good to know\nthat we can do this either way.\n\n190\n00:10:06.514 --> 00:10:10.883\nBut how much do we really have a need to\nbe able to move IPv6 traffic over IPv4\n\n191\n00:10:10.883 --> 00:10:11.924\nnetworks today?\n\n192\n00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:13.110\nIt's hard to say, I don't know.\n\n193\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.152\nI know that the more IPv6 traffic\nwe start to see being used and\n\n194\n00:10:17.152 --> 00:10:18.880\nthe more support we have.\n\n195\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.228\nWhile we continue to support\nIPv4 as our main backbone and\n\n196\n00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:26.067\nit's ubiquitous everywhere,\nwe obviously have a need for that.\n\n197\n00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:29.657\nBut over time are we going\nto see a switch to IPv6,\n\n198\n00:10:29.657 --> 00:10:32.660\nonly networks and IPv6 native support.\n\n199\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.010\nAnd IPv4 becomes kinda that odd thing out,\nthat's gonna happen but\n\n200\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.500\nprobably not for a long time to come.\n\n201\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.900\nSo will we need these kinds\nof solutions in the meantime.\n\n202\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.610\nProbably gonna see them for a while as\nwe transition and bridge back and forth.\n\n203\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.930\nI know you wanted to say\nsomething really quick,\n\n204\n00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.670\njust while I'm getting started for a sec.\n\n205\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been a little while,\nI don't really deal with IPv6 networks.\n\n206\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.972\nSo I'm gonna have to dust\nthe cobwebs off a little bit.\n\n207\n00:10:53.972 --> 00:11:01.880\nBut to your point with 6to4 not working\nwell with NAT or, at all, not recommended.\n\n208\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.430\n&gt;&gt; Not recommended for-\n&gt;&gt; Not recommended.\n\n209\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.314\n&gt;&gt; NAT networks, right.\n\n210\n00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:10.180\n&gt;&gt; We do have an alternative called Turito\nand then Marito in NIX based systems.\n\n211\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.925\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n212\n00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:13.332\n&gt;&gt; So there is an alternative out there.\n\n213\n00:11:13.332 --> 00:11:15.798\n&gt;&gt; There is but we're gonna focus\non six to four right now, right?\n\n214\n00:11:15.798 --> 00:11:16.302\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:17.550\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna talk about that.\n\n216\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.290\nAll right, so let's go and talk about how\nwe're gonna set up the 6 to 4 solution.\n\n217\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.900\nHow do we implement a 6 to 4\ntunnel address, in other words.\n\n218\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.890\nSo let's start by assigning or\nwe will start here in just a minute.\n\n219\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.100\nBy assigning a public IP address, at\nleast, one that we're thinking as public.\n\n220\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.690\nWe'll just assume it's\npublic based on how it is.\n\n221\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.700\nSo let me go in and do this.\n\n222\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.650\nSo I'll just have to make sure\nI'm on the right machine.\n\n223\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.970\nCuz as we know, we have to make\nsure we're in the right place.\n\n224\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.770\nAnd we're not right now.\nSo let me get off of this one,\n\n225\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.001\nactually you know what?\n\n226\n00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:46.670\nI think we are,\nhold on one second, let me see.\n\n227\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.580\nI cheated a little bit because\nI put up the host name,\n\n228\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.980\nno we're not on the right one.\n\n229\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.030\nLet me go,\nthat's not the right one either.\n\n230\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.250\nAnd this should be the right one,\nlet me just double check.\n\n231\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.208\nI'm just gonna make sure\nthat we do all this work and\n\n232\n00:11:58.208 --> 00:11:59.812\nthat it actually is on the right machine.\n\n233\n00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:02.250\nSo I'm just gonna do\na quick host name here.\n\n234\n00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:07.250\nAll right perfect so let's go in and\nlet's just get right down here.\n\n235\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.051\nJust gonna clear this out a little\nbit just so we start from scratch.\n\n236\n00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.733\nIn PowerShell nothing is gonna\ndistract us or get in the way.\n\n237\n00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:17.309\nSo let's open that up,\nlet's do some netsh here.\n\n238\n00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:21.347\nSo netsh, and our nets for short, right,\nif we don't complete that statement.\n\n239\n00:12:21.347 --> 00:12:24.193\nAll right, you're gonna bear\nwith me here while I type.\n\n240\n00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:26.432\nBecause I'm the world's\nmost horrible typer,\n\n241\n00:12:26.432 --> 00:12:29.100\ncoupled with the world's\nmost horrible speller.\n\n242\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.450\nSo we're gonna try to make this\nwork the first time around,\n\n243\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.450\nbut we're gonna take our time.\n\n244\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:38.133\nI'm doing a netsh interface ip set\naddress command as you can see here.\n\n245\n00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:42.037\nI'm gonna specify the address\ninterface that I want to use.\n\n246\n00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:45.292\nI'm gonna call it ethernet 1 or\nattach to ethernet 1.\n\n247\n00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:47.829\nSo I'm gonna program that in right there.\n\n248\n00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:51.211\nI'm gonna specify this is gonna\nbe a static address grant.\n\n249\n00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:53.925\nSo I'm gonna specify static and\nthen put in the IP, and\n\n250\n00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:55.644\nthe subject mass that I wanna use.\n\n251\n00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:59.310\nSo I'm gonna program those in right now or\n\n252\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.435\ntype those in, 132.168.0.40.\n\n253\n00:13:03.435 --> 00:13:06.259\nJust stealing a quick glance at my notes\nto make sure I've put the right IP\n\n254\n00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:07.014\naddress in there.\n\n255\n00:13:07.014 --> 00:13:10.981\nNothing worse than doing the whole demo\nand finding out that I mistyped the IP.\n\n256\n00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.627\nAnd we're actually talking to\nPluto as opposed to talking\n\n257\n00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:15.631\nto the machines were\nsuppose to connect to.\n\n258\n00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:19.574\nAll right so you'll see I got there\nI got my class c subnet mask,\n\n259\n00:13:19.574 --> 00:13:22.060\neverything associated with that.\n\n260\n00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.683\nJust go ahead and we'll hit Enter.\n\n261\n00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:25.672\nRemember I talked about NetSH being\nreally kind of stoic and unfriendly and\n\n262\n00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:26.866\ntypically not talking to us.\n\n263\n00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:29.360\nNotice I don't get an okay back for\nthat, right?\n\n264\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.350\nWe talked about that.\n\n265\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.940\nThat by the way means it's fine,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n266\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.920\n&gt;&gt; The silent treatment.\n\n267\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.940\n&gt;&gt; The silent treatment,\nit did what I asked it to do.\n\n268\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.250\nIt just doesn't echo back our response\ntypically it's very rare we get that okay.\n\n269\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.936\nAs I said only when we're in\nthere dealing with ISATAP\n\n270\n00:13:42.936 --> 00:13:45.081\ndo we typically see that behavior\nwith those additional commands.\n\n271\n00:13:45.081 --> 00:13:47.848\nSo normally NetSH just does this.\n\n272\n00:13:47.848 --> 00:13:50.368\nIt just goes, does its stuff,\ncomes back and says, yeah I'm good and\n\n273\n00:13:50.368 --> 00:13:52.108\ndoesn't really tie to anything at all.\n\n274\n00:13:52.108 --> 00:13:54.710\nIt will scream at you if you have\nan error just so you know, but\n\n275\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.190\nit's not gonna normally do that otherwise.\n\n276\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.800\nAll right, so we're now gonna go in and\n\n277\n00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.030\nwe're gonna go over to our Windows\n10 machine, and open up PowerShell.\n\n278\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.341\nGotta do a little\nconfiguration there as well.\n\n279\n00:14:04.341 --> 00:14:07.887\nThis is typically some of the stuff I do\nbehind the scenes before we jump into\n\n280\n00:14:07.887 --> 00:14:08.408\nthe demo.\n\n281\n00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:10.333\nAnd take it to the last five or\nsix steps and\n\n282\n00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:13.196\njust show you all the stuff that\nwe do to configure the routes.\n\n283\n00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:15.390\nThis is all the behind the scenes magic.\n\n284\n00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.560\nBut I want you to see, kind of end to end,\nwhat we do on this one.\n\n285\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.950\nJust so you get a sense of all\nthe configuration that we may have to\n\n286\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.040\nactually engage in.\n\n287\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.180\nNow could we assign that\nIP address from the GUI?\n\n288\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.690\nAnd just go in and right click,\nand go program that IP address in?\n\n289\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.286\nDo we have to do it right\nfrom here with Netsh?\n\n290\n00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:32.797\nNo, we don't have to do that.\n\n291\n00:14:32.797 --> 00:14:34.870\nI could go to ethernet 1.\n\n292\n00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.080\nI can right click, go to properties and\nthe networking sharing center.\n\n293\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.570\nI can open it up and I can program that\nIPv4 address in just by typing it and\n\n294\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.160\nassigning it.\n\n295\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.880\nI don't have to use NetSH.\n\n296\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.347\nSo keep in mind we have multiple\nways on doing this, right?\n\n297\n00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:49.840\nI can do it from PowerShell, could do\nit from the command line with NetSH.\n\n298\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.036\nDo NetSH in PowerShell.\n\n299\n00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:52.885\nThere are different ways to do it.\n\n300\n00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:57.957\nI'm going in and doing it from here,\njust to really focus on and\n\n301\n00:14:57.957 --> 00:15:01.699\nreally show you the use of PowerShell and\nNSH.\n\n302\n00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:03.570\nAnd get you really comfortable with that.\n\n303\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.640\nBut remember there is more\nthan one way to do this and\n\n304\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.110\nit doesn't necessarily have\nto be from the command line.\n\n305\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.358\nI know that may or\nmay not thrill some of you.\n\n306\n00:15:11.358 --> 00:15:14.290\nI'm just gonna clear the screen in here\non PowerShell on the Windows 10 client\n\n307\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.520\nwhile we're talking.\n\n308\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.910\nThat may or may not thrill some of\nyou in the sense that you may or\n\n309\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.350\nmay not be excited about using PowerShell.\n\n310\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.960\nAnd I get that, no big deal.\n\n311\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.023\nBut just keep that in mind, okay?\n\n312\n00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.906\nAll right, so we're in here.\n\n313\n00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:28.443\nWe're going to go ahead and\n\n314\n00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:33.419\ndo the following netsh again,\ninterface and ip set.\n\n315\n00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:38.494\nAnd we're gonna do address and\nwe're gonna do\n\n316\n00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:43.711\nname equal to,\nwe're doing here ethernet 2.\n\n317\n00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:48.410\nSo do Ethernet 2 and close.\n\n318\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.543\nWe've got static.\n\n319\n00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:57.795\nAnd we're going to do 132,168,\n\n320\n00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:00.574\nand 0.60?\n\n321\n00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:03.824\nAnd we'll do our subnet mask.\n\n322\n00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:08.312\nOf course,\nit'll help if I put Periods in there.\n\n323\n00:16:08.312 --> 00:16:10.560\nAll right, we've got our subnet mask.\n\n324\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.310\nLet's just do that.\n\n325\n00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.805\nWhoops, did I type that incorrectly?\n\n326\n00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:17.581\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Meaning something identified was\n\n327\n00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:18.630\nnot there.\n\n328\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.130\nYou know what, I'm wondering,\nI should actually close this real quick.\n\n329\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.510\nStupid though I am,\n\n330\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.790\nlet me just make sure I'm on the right\nmachine now that I'm doing that.\n\n331\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.440\nReal quick.\nSo give me one second.\n\n332\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.810\nI may have wound up on the wrong machine.\n\n333\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.570\nNope, that's the plat Win10 machine,\nthat's where I should be.\n\n334\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.240\nLet me try that one more time I may\nhave just inadvertently I either had\n\n335\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.530\nsomething in the command line or perhaps\nnot realized I had something in there.\n\n336\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.710\nIt looked like there was text or\nsomething at the bottom and\n\n337\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.920\nI may have actually not\ncleared the shell totally.\n\n338\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.520\nThere may have been something in there\nthat it thought it was working with.\n\n339\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.880\nSo let me just open this up one more time.\n\n340\n00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.610\nWe'll give this one more\nshot here real quick.\n\n341\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.230\nAnd just load a brand new\nclean version of the console,\n\n342\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.370\nthat way we're not gonna have any issues.\n\n343\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.901\nAll right, so\n\n344\n00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:07.611\nnetsh interface ip\n\n345\n00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:12.327\nset address name=\n\n346\n00:17:15.122 --> 00:17:19.801\nAnd let us do Ethernet 2 and\n\n347\n00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:26.516\nlet's do static and let's do 132,\n\n348\n00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:32.022\n168.0.60 and whoops.\n\n349\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.245\nGot a forward slash there.\n\n350\n00:17:36.245 --> 00:17:38.450\n255.255.255.0.\nAnd let's just\n\n351\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:45.170\ndo something really\nsilly before we do this.\n\n352\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.920\nLet's just make sure that\nthe Ethernet 2 is actually there.\n\n353\n00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.210\nI'm proving to you that\nit should be there.\n\n354\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:49.770\nIt should find it.\n\n355\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.710\nYou could see that Ethernet\n2 [LAUGH] does exist.\n\n356\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.680\nJust making sure we're referencing a card\nthat is there, ethernet 2 is there, right?\n\n357\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.790\nSo we should be able to work\non that interface right there.\n\n358\n00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.530\nI may have spelled it incorrectly, or\nmaybe as I said the console may not have\n\n359\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.150\nactually the PowerShell,\nshell may not have actually just been.\n\n360\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.530\nWhoops, this is what I\ndon't like about that.\n\n361\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.440\nLet me click here one second,\nthere we go, okay.\n\n362\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.200\nJust get that to reactivate.\n\n363\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.670\nElement not found,\nwhat am I not doing correctly here?\n\n364\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.310\nNSH interface IP set address name.\n\n365\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.190\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, what happens if we're\ntrying to run this command and\n\n366\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.980\nwe don't have IPv4 bound\nto our particular adaptor?\n\n367\n00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know, you ever see that\nthing on TV where you have that nuclear\n\n368\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.040\nmushroom that kind of goes like this and\njust everything blows up?\n\n369\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.310\nIt's kinda like that.\n\n370\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.140\nSo what would actually\nhappen is the following.\n\n371\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.790\nWhen we're trying to actually go through\nfind this the first time we saw that we\n\n372\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.600\nhave that little glitch\ndidn't seem to work.\n\n373\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.430\nWent back take a quick look, check\neverything, did a little troubleshooting\n\n374\n00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:53.220\nand come to find believe it or not that\nsomehow IPv4 was unbound on the interface.\n\n375\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.070\nAs a result of that error we're getting.\n\n376\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.320\nIt can mean several things but it\nultimately turned out to mean is that we\n\n377\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.480\ndon't actually have IPv4 support to bind\nthe static IPv4 adapter address that we\n\n378\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.730\nwanna bind to that adapter cuz essentially\nIPv4 doesn't exist on that adapter.\n\n379\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.470\nSo we checked that box back off,\nrestarted the host.\n\n380\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.580\nEverything is good.\n\n381\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.330\nShould be ready to go.\n\n382\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.090\nOf course unless said that\nit probably blow up again.\n\n383\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.080\nBut we're gonna take a look and\ngive it a shot right here.\n\n384\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.640\nSo we go back.\n\n385\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.640\nYou see how there type the interface\ncommand back in Set it up,\n\n386\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.620\nI'm just gonna hit Enter there,\n\n387\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.840\nlet me just actually activate the console\nthere, just type that back in, do that.\n\n388\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.970\nAnd then of course you could\nsee boom goes through and\n\n389\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.800\nas it always does netsh\ndoesn't say a word to us.\n\n390\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.040\nYou know it'll be nice when it actually\ngives us that error instead of saying\n\n391\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.240\nelement not found, it would be nice if\nit just said hey, guess what you should\n\n392\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.940\nprobably go check that box off right,\ncuz that's what you actually need to do.\n\n393\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.920\n&gt;&gt; Could you imagine if\nall IT was like that Adam?\n\n394\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.360\n&gt;&gt; No.\nI can't imagine a world where that would\n\n395\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.710\nbe the case because that would\nmake sense and, well, you know.\n\n396\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.650\nWe know things don't always make sense.\n\n397\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.860\nAll right.\nSo we have set up our, using netsh,\n\n398\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.600\nour user interface IP here.\n\n399\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.990\nRemember we're just binding\na static IPv4 based on IP 2.\n\n400\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.350\nThe Ethernet two interface in\nthis case gonna switch over and\n\n401\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.650\nenable our six to four tunnel adapter.\n\n402\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:11.175\nUse our set net six to four configuration\nPowerShell commandlet here on our server.\n\n403\n00:20:11.175 --> 00:20:13.125\nSo we're going to go over and\ndo that right now.\n\n404\n00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:13.845\nJust bring this up.\n\n405\n00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:18.555\nWe're going to go onto our PLAB SA 01\nmachine, just minimize that there.\n\n406\n00:20:18.555 --> 00:20:21.585\nWe're in PowerShell, you could see\nwe were just there a minute ago.\n\n407\n00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:24.215\nSetting up our IP address there for\n0.40 on the 132.168 public IP.\n\n408\n00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:29.425\nNow we're going to go ahead and\nissue this command.\n\n409\n00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:30.860\nGoing to do the set.\n\n410\n00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.460\nAnd we're gonna do net 6 to 4.\n\n411\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.480\nAnd remember, that, just as I do this, and\n\n412\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.300\nwe'll just use the auto complete there,\nI just hit Tab, takes just a second.\n\n413\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.670\nRemember, just while,\nbefore I finish typing.\n\n414\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:50.010\nWe've talked about this before And\nremember that we do have all of\n\n415\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:55.030\nthese commands, we talked about them, this\nis specific to the 6 to 4 tunnel adaptor.\n\n416\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.200\nSo we would go in and\nobviously search for them.\n\n417\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.720\nBut what we're doing is going in and\nwe are using one or\n\n418\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.720\nmore of these commands,\nnot necessarily the ones that are here,\n\n419\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.350\nbut we are using commands like this.\n\n420\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.000\nFrom the TCPIP module and, in this case,\n\n421\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.640\nthe six to four tunnel adapter\nsupports specifically.\n\n422\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.820\nEncourage you to go out,\ntake a look on the Internet,\n\n423\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.800\nread up on the commands, if you need to\nsee what they are and understand them.\n\n424\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.170\nWe also talked about how to\nget help within PowerShell.\n\n425\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.500\nGet help command lit, and\nthen you can read up on it,\n\n426\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.490\nget help command lit full or\nonline, or detailed,\n\n427\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.040\nsee examples of syntax I'll walk you\nthrough that thought process and some\n\n428\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.050\nprior episodes explained to you how you\ncould use PowerShell to your advantage.\n\n429\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.890\nSo just thinking about that\nwhile we're talking here.\n\n430\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:44.140\nAll right, so Set-Net6to4Configuration,\nwe're gonna specify the state here.\n\n431\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.870\nWe're gonna give it a state of enabled.\n\n432\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.420\nAnd by the way PowerShell\ncommands Are not case sensitive.\n\n433\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.960\nSo almost without exception,\nyou can type in there upper or lower case.\n\n434\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.520\nI just autotab to do the complete or\nuse that when I'm typing it,\n\n435\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.240\njust makes it all pretty and nice.\n\n436\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.510\nYou can see it and understand it.\n\n437\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.120\nAnd when you go look it up in theory, if\nyou're referencing it in the episode and\n\n438\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.730\nyou say hey can we pause that for\na minute?\n\n439\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.410\nI'm gonna go look that command up like\nhe was talking about or Share it here.\n\n440\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:14.170\nWhoever is talking about it is, you see it\nconfigured out and detailed on the screen,\n\n441\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.170\nthe way it'll show up when you look for\nit and help it looks that way.\n\n442\n00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.640\nSo it's the only reason I do that.\n\n443\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.300\nI could type that all on all lower\ncase and it'll work just fine,\n\n444\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.120\ntheres no difference.\n\n445\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.980\nSo Just keep that in mind,\nit is not case sensitive,\n\n446\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.040\nunless we're typing in something\nspecific like a name, in quotes,\n\n447\n00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.570\nwe want us a literal string,\nwe wanna make it that way, but\n\n448\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.470\nnormal commands, not case sensitive at\nall, you don't have to worry about that.\n\n449\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.640\nAll right, we set that state\nenabled as you can see there.\n\n450\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.340\nWhat we're now gonna do is\nSet-NetIPInterface in our IP\n\n451\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.220\ninterface alias.\n\n452\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.110\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n453\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.380\nSo we're gonna use another command here\nexcept we're gonna use set instead of zet.\n\n454\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.760\nZ is not supported for-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.880\n&gt;&gt; Networking commands.\n\n456\n00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.830\n&gt;&gt; That's a great version.\n\n457\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I should actually have new\nclient, but I should tell you what I want\n\n458\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.490\nyou to type here, because-\n&gt;&gt; That'll be fun.\n\n459\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:54.990\n&gt;&gt; It is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.440\n&gt;&gt; Just like ridiculous.\n\n461\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.830\nAll right, so Set-NetIPInterface.\n\n462\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.710\nAll right, we're gonna do\n\n463\n00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.650\nparameter interface alias here.\n\n464\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.350\nSo interface alias.\n\n465\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.250\nSo we'll just thought a tab on that one,\ninterface alias and\n\n466\n00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.370\nwe're gonna specify our\nalias of ethernet 2.\n\n467\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.310\nRemember we spoke about that,\nthat does need a space there.\n\n468\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.290\nOr no actually no space on this one,\nI forgot.\n\n469\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.280\nThis one has ethernet too but no space cuz\nwe're gonna set specified as an alias.\n\n470\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.790\nAnd we're going to enable forwarding, so\nwe're gonna do forwarding, forwarding.\n\n471\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.230\nI do have to sound things out when I type,\n\n472\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.650\nits the only way that I could\nactually get them to be correct.\n\n473\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.330\nIf you're wondering why the hell is\nhe talking to himself and doing that.\n\n474\n00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.080\nIt's actually for that very reason.\n\n475\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.110\nJust because if I don't do that there is\nabsolutely no way I will get it right.\n\n476\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.680\nAll right, you can see even\nthen I may have a problem.\n\n477\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.160\nI may actually, actually,\nI think I do need that space.\n\n478\n00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.050\nNo, net IP with property interface sales.\n\n479\n00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.940\nYeah I think I do need the space\nI think that was my fault.\n\n480\n00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.154\nGive me just one second.\n\n481\n00:23:56.731 --> 00:23:58.474\nNope, hold on.\n\n482\n00:23:58.474 --> 00:24:00.301\nOppositional parameter, you know why?\n\n483\n00:24:00.301 --> 00:24:03.860\nThat was also silly of me On second-\n&gt;&gt; Quotation?\n\n484\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just forgot since\nI put the space in, yep.\n\n485\n00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.040\nI just need to put those there.\n\n486\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.770\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n487\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:12.840\nNow no property found.\n\n488\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.740\nInterface is equal to Ethernet2.\n\n489\n00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.830\nOkay, so wait, so\nmaybe that's just an issue.\n\n490\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.750\nMaybe I'm referencing the wrong alias,\nor rather the wrong interface.\n\n491\n00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.360\nSo I'm gonna set that equal on this one.\n\n492\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.070\nGive me just one sec, gotta make sure\nthat we actually have that on this one.\n\n493\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.250\nNope, it's ethernet one.\n\n494\n00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.410\nLook at that, that's why because I\nhave two and it's called Ethernet one.\n\n495\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.570\nSo I'm going to fix that right now,\nbut it's Ethernet one, no space.\n\n496\n00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.280\nI wrote down Ethernet two with no space.\n\n497\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.951\n&gt;&gt; Well you switched machines on, that's\nbecause we had Ethernet two a moment ago.\n\n498\n00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:39.708\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I did, and\n\n499\n00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:41.670\nI wasn't paying attention to\nwhere I was or what I was doing.\n\n500\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.880\nSo let me fix that,\nwe're gonna go back here like that and\n\n501\n00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.950\nwe're just gonna put it in as ethernet1\ninstead of ethernet2 like that.\n\n502\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.680\nAnd you see it goes in with no trouble.\n\n503\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.420\nAnd well if you go full-screen for\n\n504\n00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.950\nme just a sec cuz I'm covering\nover like half the screen there.\n\n505\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.090\nSo the others are good to see, right?\n\n506\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.980\nIts always good to learn\nfrom what we're doing.\n\n507\n00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.614\nAgain logical thought process\non troubleshooting there,\n\n508\n00:25:04.614 --> 00:25:08.193\ncould have owned on a couple of things, it\ncould have been that the alias that I was\n\n509\n00:25:08.193 --> 00:25:11.007\nusing was referencing as it turn\nout to be the wrong interface.\n\n510\n00:25:11.007 --> 00:25:15.038\nOr I spelled it incorrectly meaning hey,\nit should have been ethernet spelled\n\n511\n00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:19.068\nlogically and I spelled it the wrong way\nor it had a space, I didn't account for\n\n512\n00:25:19.068 --> 00:25:22.973\nthat, I had to put the space in, tried\na couple of things and I said Clearly,\n\n513\n00:25:22.973 --> 00:25:24.216\nit's not ethernet 2.\n\n514\n00:25:24.216 --> 00:25:26.590\nI just gotta go look and\nmake sure I know what it is.\n\n515\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.400\nAnd when I looked, sure enough,\nit's not ethernet 2, it's ethernet 1.\n\n516\n00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.310\nAnd so\nwe're able to fix that really easily.\n\n517\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.430\nAnd you could see that it's there now,\nand it does work with ethernet 1.\n\n518\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.180\nSo, it does make sense for\n\n519\n00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.200\nyou to logically walk through the thought\nprocess, just make sure you know what it\n\n520\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.460\nis And that you understand that\nsometimes you may have an issue.\n\n521\n00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.660\nYou learn from your mistakes.\n\n522\n00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.840\nI make mistakes all the time, by the way.\n\n523\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.820\nThere's nothing wrong with making\nthem as long as you use them\n\n524\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.570\nto figure out what went wrong and\nsolve it.\n\n525\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.345\nNow the nice thing about this just\nbefore we get off to continue.\n\n526\n00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:58.745\nIf you pay attention to PowerShell errors,\nthey typically, the red,\n\n527\n00:25:58.745 --> 00:26:02.445\nangry screaming text at you in the console\nhere, right, they will normally give you\n\n528\n00:26:02.445 --> 00:26:06.215\na really good indication as to what\nthe problem may be, but you gotta stop and\n\n529\n00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:09.357\nread them and understand it and And\nit will tell you what's going on.\n\n530\n00:26:09.357 --> 00:26:13.017\nAnd it tells me here in the first one,\nno interface alias equal to this.\n\n531\n00:26:13.017 --> 00:26:14.817\nIt's telling me essentially\nI can't find that,\n\n532\n00:26:14.817 --> 00:26:17.847\nthat's why I tried a different\ncombination with a space.\n\n533\n00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:20.067\nNow it's telling me hey,\nby the way, I can't accept that,\n\n534\n00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:23.217\nbecause I forgot, I wasn't paying\nattention and thinking logically.\n\n535\n00:26:23.217 --> 00:26:27.097\nPut a space in, got to enclose it in\nquotes so it treats it as a string and\n\n536\n00:26:27.097 --> 00:26:28.427\nunderstands the space.\n\n537\n00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:32.810\nDid that, but then it says hey, guess\nwhat still don't find that ethernet two,\n\n538\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.950\nspace, no space, not there.\n\n539\n00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.363\nWell now we've got to go and check it out.\n\n540\n00:26:36.363 --> 00:26:38.210\nAnd that's when I said,\nhey let me go look.\n\n541\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.140\nSince it's probably not ethernet two,\n\n542\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.230\nand sure enough it winds up being ethernet\none or whatever it would have been.\n\n543\n00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.480\nIt could have been ethernet in this case,\ncuz they have two interfaces,\n\n544\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.810\nbut they're just not labeled correctly,\nright?\n\n545\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.290\nSo it is important to pay\nattention to your over codes.\n\n546\n00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.640\nIt's really important to know what's\ngoing on there because that allows you\n\n547\n00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.130\nto come back and actually fix the problem,\nif you're willing to just stop long enough\n\n548\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.500\nand look at it and\ngo hey I did make a mistake.\n\n549\n00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.110\nWhat do I need to do to fix that?\n\n550\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.320\nAnd I could probably get some useful\ninformation coming out of that\n\n551\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.620\nerror return if I just understand\nthat I have to stop and read it.\n\n552\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.920\nSpeaking of stopping.\n\n553\n00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, looking ahead here, I do see\nthat you have torito noted in your notes,\n\n554\n00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.525\nbut I think we're gonna have\nto go ahead and continue.\n\n555\n00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Lloved that torito, though,\nyou just love saying that word.\n\n556\n00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.460\n&gt;&gt; It's a cool word to say, yeah.\n\n557\n00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.560\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nit's the word more than anything else.\n\n558\n00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.330\nBut we do need to finish this\ndemonstration on setting up 6to4.\n\n559\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.240\nSo I'm thinking maybe we need to come\nback and just do that real quick.\n\n560\n00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.606\nAnd I promise you I'll say something\nabout Tarito when we come back other than\n\n561\n00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:31.620\nthe word Tarito.\n\n562\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.783\nBut I want to finish this demo up.\n\n563\n00:27:32.783 --> 00:27:34.320\nSo I want to invite you to comme back.\n\n564\n00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.570\nTake a look at the last episode\nwith us here to round that out.\n\n565\n00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.350\nAnd we're gonna do that as\nsoon as we say goodbye here.\n\n566\n00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.730\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you so much for\n\n567\n00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.260\njoining us, but stay tuned,\nwe have more information.\n\n568\n00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.320\nAnd as Adam promised,\nhe's going to explain Teredo and\n\n569\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.760\nyeah, go ahead and wrap things up here.\n\n570\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.860\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n571\n00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.470\nAnd remember, I'm your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n572\n00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.446\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon and I soon will\nbe Tarito Man if you come back and\n\n573\n00:27:57.446 --> 00:27:58.071\ntake a look.\n\n574\n00:27:58.071 --> 00:27:59.800\n&gt;&gt; See you

today.\n\n16\n00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.170\nIs that because we have a shorter demo so\nit's not gonna take long so\n\n17\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.915\nyou're trying to eat up\nsome time in the

gonna continue talking\nabout setting up our 6to4 adapter.\n\n21\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.590\nWe are going to, if you join me\nright back in our demo environment,\n\n22\n00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.270\nwe're gonna see here.\n\n23\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.250\nWe are on our Windows 10 machine,\ngot our interface configured.\n\n24\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.610\nWe're about to just go through, or\nat least I typed in the command anyway.\n\n25\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.640\nWe're gonna go ahead and do set net 6to4.\n\n26\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.970\nThe set net 6to4 configuration cmdlet,\nas I trip over getting that out.\n\n27\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.650\nWe're gonna set that\nto a state of enabled.\n\n28\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.610\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nhit Enter there.\n\n29\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.570\nThat should take just a second and\ncome back.\n\n30\n00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.939\nLet's go ahead and\nset our net IP interface.\n\n31\n00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.500\nSo we'll type this in real quick.\n\n32\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.890\nInterface, and\njust do an auto complete for that.\n\n33\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.482\nWe'll do our interface alias and\n\n34\n00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:36.900\nwe'll set that to, Ethernet 2.\n\n35\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.880\nAnd we're gonna set that to forwarding.\n\n36\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.950\nAnd we'll set forwarding,\nreturn on forwarding, and\n\n37\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.070\nmake sure that that is enabled.\n\n38\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.546\nGo ahead and do that real quick.\n\n39\n00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.398\nGet that to come back, and so\nonce we have all that set up\n\n40\n00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.500\nremember we've already done\nthe set up on the server side.\n\n41\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.320\nSo we're working with server and\nthe client.\n\n42\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.606\nThis is our Windows 10 side,\n\n43\n00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:59.840\nso our desktop client essentially,\njust completing the configuration.\n\n44\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.190\nWhat we're gonna do is go\nback over to the server,\n\n45\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.570\nwe'll just do a quick IP config over\nthere, see the outcome of everything.\n\n46\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.253\nSo let's just switch back over, and\n\n47\n00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:14.281\nlet's do an IP config.\n\n48\n00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:21.595\nWe'll take a look and see that on our\n6to4 adapter right up at the top here,\n\n49\n00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:27.420\njust kind of put that in\nthe center of the screen for you.\n\n50\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.595\nYou'll see that we do have\nour IPv6 [COUGH] address.\n\n51\n00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.539\nAnd we'll see it right there,\n\n52\n00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:39.860\nour 2002 84a8 28, 84a8 28 address.\n\n53\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.320\nRemember the 2002 is the prefix,\nright, that we're using.\n\n54\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.700\nAnd the 84aa28 portion\nis the IPv6 equivalent\n\n55\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.620\nof our public address, our IPv4 public\naddress, which was our 132.168.0.40,\n\n56\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.760\nright, which is what we were setting up.\n\n57\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.880\nSo we're seeing that there,\n\n58\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.192\nwe're just gonna go ahead,\njust come down here real quick.\n\n59\n00:03:03.192 --> 00:03:05.632\nJust gonna put that at the top of\nthe screen so you can see that.\n\n60\n00:03:05.632 --> 00:03:09.298\nAnd what we're gonna do is just simply\ngo in and ping now to double check and\n\n61\n00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:11.770\nmake sure that our\nconnectivity is working.\n\n62\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.680\nWe'll do that on the Windows 10 side,\nlet's just do an IP config as well there.\n\n63\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.560\nLet's just make sure we\nsee both of the IPs and\n\n64\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.690\njust make sure both sides are set up.\n\n65\n00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.310\nCould have actually done\nthis while we were here.\n\n66\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.100\nDoesn't really matter\nwhat order we do it in.\n\n67\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.356\nBut when we take a look here at our 6to4\nadapter on the IPv6 address for it on\n\n68\n00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:37.780\nthe Windows 10 side you'll see we do have\none that is in the same area, 2002 8488.\n\n69\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.556\nBut we do have a different ending\naddress because remember we set up 132,\n\n70\n00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:46.524\n168, 0, 60 and 040,\nthis one is our other address.\n\n71\n00:03:46.524 --> 00:03:49.820\nWe'll see 060 right up there,\nso we can see this one.\n\n72\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.240\nAnd then once we now see that we have our\naddresses on both sides, we can go ahead,\n\n73\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.261\nand we can ping from one to the other.\n\n74\n00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:00.549\nSo since we're on the Windows 10 box,\nlet's just go ahead, we'll move this down,\n\n75\n00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.080\na little bit here.\n\n76\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.660\nAnd we can just go ahead and\ndo a ping here.\n\n77\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.403\nSo let's do ping and,\nlet's do our 2002: we're\n\n78\n00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:13.020\ngonna ping the server, so we'll do A4.\n\n79\n00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.961\nWhat was that,\n\n80\n00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:23.660\n8488:28::8488:28.\n\n81\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.831\nJust make sure we got all that correct,\ncuz we all know how well I type, right?\n\n82\n00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:29.343\nPing 2002.\n\n83\n00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:33.686\n84a8:28:a4a28.\n\n84\n00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:34.587\nSo we'll do that.\n\n85\n00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.814\nAnd you'll see we get\nback our response here.\n\n86\n00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:38.340\nAnd you can see it's coming back.\n\n87\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.710\nAnd that means that our 6to4\ntunnel adapter is working.\n\n88\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.590\nWe're able to ping across.\n\n89\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.021\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo, high five.\n\n90\n00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:49.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you can see that\nwe've set up our 6to4 adapter.\n\n91\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.110\nWe've been able to go in, configure\nthat and set up our communication.\n\n92\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.630\nNow keep in mind,\nyou have been talking about,\n\n93\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.110\nwe talked about in the previous episodes\nwe talked about the ISATAP Adapter.\n\n94\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.660\nWe've done the 6to4 adapter, talked\nabout some of the differences there.\n\n95\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.650\nWe've got this one little thing that\nwe keep referring to we haven't\n\n96\n00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.720\ntalked about yet.\n\n97\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.300\nBut Cherokee keeps reminding\nus in the background every so\n\n98\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.480\noften when we mention it.\n\n99\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.140\nWhich is, I'm gonna let you say it,\ncuz I know you like saying it so much.\n\n100\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Teredo.\n\n101\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.832\n&gt;&gt; Teredo, exactly.\n\n102\n00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:17.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about Teredo.\n\n103\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.916\nTeredo is essentially what we\njust talk about with 6to4.\n\n104\n00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.223\nWe just showed you with one exception\nas Cherokee was pointing out and\n\n105\n00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.677\nreminded us a couple times,\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about it,\n\n106\n00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:29.606\nit's literally described as 6to4 but\nwith the ability to work with NAT, right?\n\n107\n00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:31.465\nBecause you've been reminding us that,\n\n108\n00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.465\nhey, all this other stuff we do is really\nunfriendly with NAT, it doesn't work well.\n\n109\n00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:37.485\nIt's not designed to deal with NAT.\n\n110\n00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:39.715\nSo we do need something,\na solution as you pointed out,\n\n111\n00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:43.135\nthat does address the NAT issue\nbecause it is so prevalent today.\n\n112\n00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:44.835\nAnd the Teredo solution does that.\n\n113\n00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:49.170\nIt's literally nothing more than 6to4, the\nsame capabilities we looked at here but\n\n114\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.180\nwith the ability to understand and\nwork with NAT.\n\n115\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.870\nAnd so if you have a NAT environment,\n\n116\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.360\nwe need to be able to work\nwith this kind of technology.\n\n117\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.180\nSo if the NAT device could be configured\nas a 6to4 router that has the ability\n\n118\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.770\nto deal with the 6to4 interface\nbecause it understands it,\n\n119\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.890\nwe don't need to use Teredo.\n\n120\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.938\nBut for older systems, cuz not all systems\nwill support the 6to4 functionality,\n\n121\n00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:17.980\nit's an IPv6 function, and\nit is obviously a newer bot process.\n\n122\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.800\nNot brand new for 16, but\nnewer in the sense that\n\n123\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.430\nwe need to have a device that\nwould understand and support that.\n\n124\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.650\nIf we don't have that device\nthat we fall back on the idea of\n\n125\n00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.320\nusing Teredo as a client, or the ability\nfor systems to be configured to use,\n\n126\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.270\nthe Teredo adapter will be able\nto send and receive traffic.\n\n127\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.930\nSo there are public Teredo servers\nout there on the Internet that\n\n128\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.410\nwe could interact with.\n\n129\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.990\nMicrosoft maintains at least one.\n\n130\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.610\nTheirs is Teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n131\n00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.180\nI've got it in the notes; I'm\npretty sure that's what it is.\n\n132\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.590\nBut they maintain one, there are other\npublic Teredo services out there as well.\n\n133\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.530\nBut it allows us to communicate,\nessentially facilitate communication\n\n134\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.080\nfrom an IPv only host or,\nIPv6 only host or node as we talked about.\n\n135\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.413\nRemember, we said nodes and\nhosts are essentially the same idea.\n\n136\n00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:07.095\nIPv6 only host or\nnode on the IPv6 Internet, and\n\n137\n00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:13.430\nwe can facilitate that conversation or\nthat communication across there.\n\n138\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.160\nSo keep in mind that this\nis what we're using it for.\n\n139\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.220\nConfiguring it, not very difficult.\n\n140\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.390\nA Windows machine,\na Windows Server 2016 client\n\n141\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.830\ncan be set up either as a Teredo relay or\na Teredo server.\n\n142\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.980\nWe use PowerShell to configure this.\n\n143\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.260\nWe would use the set net\nTeredo configuration.\n\n144\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.160\nWe're in here,\nlet's just take a look real quick.\n\n145\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:40.409\nWe just go over here to the server and\nif we do set -net.\n\n146\n00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:42.920\nWhat did I say, say -netteredo.\n\n147\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.249\nWe're doing teredo,\nset -netteredoconfig, right.\n\n148\n00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:52.139\nI think I spelled that correctly\nwith two t's, set -netteredo.\n\n149\n00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.433\nCome on, come on, come one,\ncome on, come on.\n\n150\n00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.050\nI'm just looking to see if it's, no.\n\n151\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.128\nIt's one, no, no, it's two t,\n\n152\n00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:05.917\nit is two t's, set-netteredoxconfiguration\n\n153\n00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:11.730\nAll right, there we go, just for\nsome reason I wasn't picking it up.\n\n154\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.550\nThe Set-NetTeredoConfiguration\ncmdlet is what we would type in\n\n155\n00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.980\nto be able to go ahead and configure this.\n\n156\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.390\nConfiguration by default,\nwe're set up as a client.\n\n157\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.280\nWe obviously can then specify\nwhat it is that we need.\n\n158\n00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.640\nWhat I would suggest you do here,\n\n159\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.100\nwe've talked about this before,\nis do a get-help, right?\n\n160\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:37.760\nAnd for the cmdlet, and then if you're not\nsure about it, you can do online, right?\n\n161\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.450\nJust to see whether or not that's there.\n\n162\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.630\nOnline cannot be displayed.\n\n163\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.870\nIt's the Internet address.\n\n164\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.462\nThe help tab is not specified.\n\n165\n00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:46.933\nAll right, so\nI haven't done an update on PowerShell,\n\n166\n00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:49.900\nso it's not gonna be able to go\nout right away to do online.\n\n167\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.580\nBut if you just do get help,\nright, you should be able to,\n\n168\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.330\nin theory, get information on it.\n\n169\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.650\nWe've talked about that.\n\n170\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.860\nAnd you can read up on it.\n\n171\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.900\nRemember we've shown you PowerShell\ncmdlets for a variety of things and\n\n172\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.580\ntalked about where they are.\n\n173\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.680\nYou could go out, and\nwe've taken a look at these before.\n\n174\n00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.930\nYou could go out and just simply\nsearch out here, for that matter, and\n\n175\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.090\nprobably find information\nout about it as well.\n\n176\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:18.106\nIf we just typed it in,\nand did the set.netteredo,\n\n177\n00:09:18.106 --> 00:09:24.124\nwith one e, configuration cmdlet and\nwe searched,\n\n178\n00:09:24.124 --> 00:09:31.265\nwe would be able to find information\nout about it here as well.\n\n179\n00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:34.090\nYou'll see set.netterredo\nconfiguration right here.\n\n180\n00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.360\nWe just follow the link.\n\n181\n00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.561\nYou just go out to the Internet,\nyou'll find it, whether or\n\n182\n00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:38.608\nnot you look it up directly.\n\n183\n00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:41.225\nAnd you'll see you could just\nbring it right up and you could\n\n184\n00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.860\nfind the information on it just by doing\na search off that main page we've listed.\n\n185\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.940\nAll the Net TCP IT module commands\nwe referred to from time to time.\n\n186\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.150\nYou could certainly see them here.\n\n187\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.420\nAnd you would just be able to go\nthrough and see all the parameters for\n\n188\n00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.470\nconfiguration.\n\n189\n00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.631\nBut this is how we would actually bring in\nthe Teredo configuration we want to set\n\n190\n00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.980\nit up in PowerShell.\n\n191\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.730\nThe other thing just to take\na look at here real quick is,\n\n192\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.970\ncan we go full screen just so\nyou can see the bottom there?\n\n193\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.950\nYou'll see the address structure for\nTeredo address is a little bit different.\n\n194\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.194\nIt is IPv6.\n\n195\n00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.636\nIt is 128 bit.\n\n196\n00:10:12.636 --> 00:10:13.800\nThat's not the different part.\n\n197\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.325\nIt's just the way we break down the\naddress and what we specify within it that\n\n198\n00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.900\nis different from\na traditional Unicast address.\n\n199\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.007\nAnd you could see I broke it down for\nyou here.\n\n200\n00:10:22.007 --> 00:10:25.459\nThe first 32 bits are gonna be\nthe Teredo-specific prefix, so\n\n201\n00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:28.676\nall Teredo addresses start\noff with 2001::, right?\n\n202\n00:10:28.676 --> 00:10:31.990\n32 bits of the 128 bits specified.\n\n203\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.090\nThe Teredo server IPv4\naddress is the next 32 bit\n\n204\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.210\nblock that will identify\nthe server that's being used.\n\n205\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.620\nOptions are then the next 16 bits,\nassuming that you're specifying them,\n\n206\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.840\nwhether we're behind a client is behind\nthe NAT server or not, or where it is.\n\n207\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.870\nObscured external ports,\nnext 16 bits, the NAT device has to\n\n208\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.170\nuse this to prevent NAT from\ntranslating or be told what to do.\n\n209\n00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.670\nSo it knows what it can and\ncan't translate.\n\n210\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.940\nAnd then obscured external IP address,\n\n211\n00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.400\nthe last 32 bits of the address block,\nthis is the NAT device's external IP\n\n212\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.090\nthat's obscured to prevent\nNAT from translating that.\n\n213\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:10.172\nSo we're specifying certain things that\nthe NAT server needs to be aware of, but\n\n214\n00:11:10.172 --> 00:11:13.067\nmay or may not be able to use\nas part of its communication.\n\n215\n00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:17.193\nAnd we have to be detailed about that in\nthe address structure so it understands,\n\n216\n00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:21.280\nit being the Teredo client, understands\nhow to work with the NAT environment.\n\n217\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.910\nAnd so the last 64 bits,\njust highlighting it kinda here,\n\n218\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.260\nbroken up into three distinct blocks are\nreally given over to that configuration.\n\n219\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:38.020\nThe first 64 bits right here identify\nthe Teredo setup, the specific prefix and\n\n220\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.730\nthe address of the server that\nwe're actually going to, right?\n\n221\n00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.790\nSo it's a little bit of\na different structure for\n\n222\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.776\nthe Unicast address that we would see\nnormally in a traditional IPv6 address.\n\n223\n00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:50.366\nSo it may be important just to\nknow how that's broken down.\n\n224\n00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:53.880\nPerhaps a testable item at some point,\nyou never know.\n\n225\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.410\nChanges or modifications to\nthe overall address block structure,\n\n226\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.590\nmaybe good testable items in\nthe sense that we may say hey,\n\n227\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.350\nyou know that Teredo block is\nset up a little bit differently.\n\n228\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.410\nWhat may be the five different blocks,\nhow are they configured?\n\n229\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.350\nWhat does the options obscure,\n\n230\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.480\nthe options block or\nobscured external port block represent?\n\n231\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.340\nYou may be asked to pull\nthat definition out.\n\n232\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.856\nThere's a lot of different ways I could\nenvision potentially talking about this.\n\n233\n00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:19.075\n&gt;&gt; Just like those other addresses\nthat you've noted as well.\n\n234\n00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:20.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; Like with the 6to4 being\n\n235\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.830\nable to identify what type of\ntechnology is being utilized there.\n\n236\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it would just be good\ninformation to be aware of, right,\n\n237\n00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.365\njust in that respect.\n\n238\n00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:31.370\nAnd very last little tidbit of information\nI wanna throw out there is this thing\n\n239\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.890\ncalled PortProxy as you can see here.\n\n240\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.586\nThis allows applications that don't\nsupport IPv6 to be able to be\n\n241\n00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:41.815\nIPv6 friendly in the sense of being\nable to communicate with an IPv6 host.\n\n242\n00:12:41.815 --> 00:12:46.732\nSo the PortProxy service is turned on on\nthe server where the app will be running,\n\n243\n00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:51.578\nand incoming IPv6 packets are translated\ninto IPv4, passed over to the app,\n\n244\n00:12:51.578 --> 00:12:56.765\nthey do their stuff and interact coming\nout the other way that translated back.\n\n245\n00:12:56.765 --> 00:13:00.335\nSo this is literally, and this is not,\nlet me be clear of this analogy.\n\n246\n00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:02.865\nAnalogy's a big thing for us, so\nlet me throw mine out there and\n\n247\n00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.110\nthen translate into Cherokee analogy.\n\n248\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.327\nBut this is like and\nthis is not what he does.\n\n249\n00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:09.366\nI wanna be clear.\n\n250\n00:13:09.366 --> 00:13:10.880\nThis is not functioning as a modem.\n\n251\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.517\nI'm using the modem simply as an example,\nright?\n\n252\n00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:14.980\nA analogy.\n\n253\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.850\nThis is translating back and\nforth, modems traditionally,\n\n254\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.120\nif you're familiar with what a modem did,\nright?\n\n255\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.640\nModulation, demodulation.\n\n256\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.599\nWhat a modem does, translate analog\nto digital, digital to analog,\n\n257\n00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:26.570\nback and forth.\n\n258\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:31.155\nIt acts as a bridge between two distinctly\ndifferent kinds of transmissions, and\n\n259\n00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:34.013\nexplains them and\ntranslates them back and forth so\n\n260\n00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:37.390\nwe go from an analog to\na digital signal and back again.\n\n261\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.630\nThat's what a modem did traditionally for\nus.\n\n262\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.280\nThe PortProxy acts like\nthis in one respect.\n\n263\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.420\nIt translates IPv6 to IPv4.\n\n264\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.970\nSo IPv4 applications that\ndon't understand IPv6\n\n265\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.812\ncan actually interact and understands,\nor is able to understand the traffic.\n\n266\n00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:57.350\nIt's really, as the name implies,\nit's a proxy.\n\n267\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.330\nIt's just simply proxying\nthe traffic back and forth.\n\n268\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.100\nAnd part of what proxies do\nis this translation idea or\n\n269\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.010\nthis obfuscation of\ntraffic on either side,\n\n270\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.630\nso that we're not able to fully see and\nunderstand it, but we are able to interact\n\n271\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.750\nwith it with some sort of device in\nthe middle that helps us to translate it.\n\n272\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.880\nSo that's what it is and what it does.\n\n273\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.150\nI just wanna make sure we're\naware of the logic there,\n\n274\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.530\nand then we have a sense of how\nPortProxy is designed to function.\n\n275\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.770\nIt is, and I just have some\nlimitations down at the bottom,\n\n276\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.110\nlet's just throw them up so\nyou can see them.\n\n277\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.360\nCan we just go full screen?\n\n278\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.050\nCuz I can't, yeah,\nI can't bring that bottom one up.\n\n279\n00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.240\nIt's all the way at the bottom.\n\n280\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.290\nSo it is only for\nTCP connections, as you can see.\n\n281\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.640\nAnything that uses UDP is not\ngonna be able to leverage this.\n\n282\n00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.310\nAnd we're not gonna restart now, but\n\n283\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.340\nwe'll just click there just\nto make sure we know that.\n\n284\n00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.520\nAnd we cannot change address information,\n\n285\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.200\nas you see, embedded in\nthe data portion of the packet.\n\n286\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.380\nSo we do have some limitations.\n\n287\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.650\nReally, the proxy is just dealing with the\naddressing portion of the package back and\n\n288\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.630\nforth translating that, so\n\n289\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:00.120\nit's available to us and we understand\nhow to be able to work with the traffic.\n\n290\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.070\nBut we're not actually manipulating or\nmodifying, right, that information.\n\n291\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.920\nWe're just making sure\nit's available to us.\n\n292\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.680\nSo limited to TCP only.\n\n293\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.040\nJust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n294\n00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.176\nSo anything that runs on UDP would\nnot be able to leverage this,\n\n295\n00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:13.308\nright, but just TCP.\n\n296\n00:15:13.308 --> 00:15:17.074\nSo just wanna make sure we know that\nas part of our conversation for\n\n297\n00:15:17.074 --> 00:15:18.380\nwhat PortProxy does.\n\n298\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.906\nBut having said that, right, and\n\n299\n00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:22.530\njust making sure that we're just\ncomfortable with that we've gone through.\n\n300\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.070\nWe've taken a look at how to finish\nthe configuration on the 6to4 adapter.\n\n301\n00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.638\nAnd we've also just talked\nabout how to set up,\n\n302\n00:15:28.638 --> 00:15:32.630\nreally show you the idea behind\nsetting up the Teredo solution.\n\n303\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.449\nWe didn't actually configure it, but\nyou could see using this command that it\n\n304\n00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:37.350\nwouldn't to difficult to go in and\ndo that.\n\n305\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.610\nAnd we threw in some\ninformation about PortProxy for\n\n306\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.830\nyou just to finish up our\nconversations here around IPv6,\n\n307\n00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.370\nholistic kind of system overview\nof IPv6 support end-to-end.\n\n308\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.140\nAnd I think that is probably about it,\n\n309\n00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.250\ncuz that's everything we have\nto talk about with IPv6.\n\n310\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.990\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n311\n00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.740\nGood job, Adam.\n\n312\n00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.940\nAnd thank you for joining

digging into DNS?\n\n316\n00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.150\n&gt;&gt; Digging into DNS.\n\n317\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.938\n&gt;&gt; Digging into DNS.\n\n318\n00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:01.553\n&gt;&gt;

implementing DNS.\n\n9\n00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.675\nWith us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.572\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nalways a pleasure to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.922\nWe're going to talk about DNS, really\nstart talking about DNS in Server 16.\n\n13\n00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:35.127\nThe good news,\njust like we talked about with IPv4,\n\n14\n00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:37.342\nif you remember seeing some\nof these early episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:40.112\nIf you haven't, I always encourage\nyou to go back, take a look, but\n\n16\n00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:44.780\nthe good news is that most of what we\nknow about DNS really hasn't changed.\n\n17\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.920\nThere are some new features.\n\n18\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.690\nThere are some new things\nwe could talk about.\n\n19\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.290\nDNS policies, things of that nature,\nthat may be of interest to us, and so\n\n20\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.690\nwe'll take a look, but the overarching\nthought process around how name resolution\n\n21\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.060\nworks with DNS, all the ideas\nbehind the DNS server commandments.\n\n22\n00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.620\nFor the most part there\nare a few new ones.\n\n23\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.740\nBut traditionally almost all of them\nare going to be ones we've seen,\n\n24\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.730\nperhaps from server 12, 12 R2,\nthe use of the DNS management console.\n\n25\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.520\nAll of that stuff is going to look and\nfeel pretty much the same.\n\n26\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.410\nSo that part I guess is hopefully\na little bit comforting for\n\n27\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.720\nthose of you that already have\nsome background with DNS.\n\n28\n00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.280\nBut for those of you that\nmay need a little refresher,\n\n29\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.670\nthought we'd start out with\nsomething kind of cool.\n\n30\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.860\nSomething unusual we don't see everyday.\n\n31\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.904\nHow many of you have seen\na DNS server comic book?\n\n32\n00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.110\nHow does DNS work and how does that work?\n\n33\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.066\nI had never seen one until I went out and\nlooked for\n\n34\n00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.311\nsome interesting resources to put it in\nthe show notes and make available to you,\n\n35\n00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.650\nshared it with Cherokee while she was-\n&gt;&gt; That was the first time\n\n36\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.280\nI had ever seen one.\n\n37\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Also blown away by it,\n\n38\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.300\nnever seen it before.\n\n39\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.150\nSo we thought we'd show it to you, but use\nit just to kind of start our conversation\n\n40\n00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.800\naround how does DNS actually work,\nwhat are the name resolution steps.\n\n41\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.990\nSo take a look on my screen here,\nyou'll see that we have our How DNS works,\n\n42\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.420\nfun and colorful explanation as\nthey point out on the website here.\n\n43\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.812\nBut How DNS Works the comic book it's\nactually kinda neat, you could just go in,\n\n44\n00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:06.948\nand just to the How DNS.works website and\nyou can actually start reading and\n\n45\n00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:11.166\ntake a look at it, you can flip through\nthe thing, couple of the pages there.\n\n46\n00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:11.877\n&gt;&gt; Cool graphics.\n\n47\n00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:12.585\n&gt;&gt; Neat, right?\n\n48\n00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:13.384\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good information.\n\n49\n00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:14.687\n&gt;&gt; It was kind of cool\n&gt;&gt; You may,\n\n50\n00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:17.288\nwe're going to just talk through the\nresolution steps, we'll just kind of keep\n\n51\n00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:19.300\nthis up as a background graphic for\na minute while we do that.\n\n52\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.820\nBut encourage you to go out and\n\n53\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.150\ntake a look if you need perhaps either\na little primer and or just a thought\n\n54\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.115\nprocess that may help you to understand\nit with some pictures and some graphics.\n\n55\n00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.120\nIt'll help you just to get a sense of\nhow that works, may be worth while.\n\n56\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.970\nBut let's talk about\nthe DNS resolution process.\n\n57\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.469\nThere's several steps involved.\n\n58\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.150\nI traditionally think of it as being\na six step process, you may have more or\n\n59\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.440\nless steps to go, just depends on\nhow many steps you group together or\n\n60\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.300\nyou explain the process.\n\n61\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300\nBut when we think about the process it\ngoes roughly something like this right,\n\n62\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.120\nstep one we have an end user\nsitting on a client machine.\n\n63\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.191\nLet's say it's myself sitting here\non this machine attempting to get\n\n64\n00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.336\nto the How DNS Works comic book site.\n\n65\n00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:05.660\nI want to ask a question using an\napplication, in this case a web browser.\n\n66\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590\nTo go out and find a resource, and I have\nto walk through that process step by step.\n\n67\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.410\nAnd so the end-user makes a request for\n\n68\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.250\nname resolution through some sort\nof application that will support\n\n69\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.855\nthe use of that, and provide an\napplication or a service back ultimately.\n\n70\n00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:22.785\nAnd we do a look up essentially,\nright, to get this information and\n\n71\n00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:26.315\nwe look up against, starting with\nour locally available information,\n\n72\n00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:29.655\nultimately ending up out on\nthe web through the DNS service.\n\n73\n00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:33.615\nWe look up to see whether we have\nknowledge of this, so if our address is\n\n74\n00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:38.730\nhowdns.works, I'm looking for\nhowdns.works locally first,\n\n75\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.180\nand then ultimately I'm gonna go to\nmy IP configuration and look for\n\n76\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.630\nmy DNS entry or entries if I have more\nthan one server, maybe a primary and\n\n77\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.560\nor alternate or alternates,\nI could have several.\n\n78\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.400\nAnd I'm going to start\nthe resolution process.\n\n79\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.840\nSo when we say we look locally first, what\nwe're actually doing is the following.\n\n80\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.110\nLet me just do this and\njust open up a run line real quick and\n\n81\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.735\nif we go into our command prompt on\na server 10, server 10, that would be new.\n\n82\n00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:09.708\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; On a Windows 10 machine like I'm doing\n\n83\n00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.230\nhere or on the equivalent,\non a Sever 16 machine.\n\n84\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.870\nRemember, for basic stuff like just using\na command line, showing you a basic\n\n85\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.748\ncommand to take a look, in this case, the\nDNS resolver cache, ipconfig displaydns.\n\n86\n00:04:20.748 --> 00:04:24.340\nThat's going to look identical, whether\nwe do it on Server 16 or Windows 10.\n\n87\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.880\nSo one versus the other in this\nparticular case, it's the same.\n\n88\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.121\nWe're looking at the same interface,\nreally no difference there.\n\n89\n00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:34.195\nSo, when we go and we talk about being\nable to resolve or do a look up locally,\n\n90\n00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:36.570\nwe're talking about two distinct things.\n\n91\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.886\nWe're going to look in our DNS resolver\ncache, we're going to look locally,\n\n92\n00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:41.825\nsee what's already available to us.\n\n93\n00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:45.350\nWhat we have knowledge of because\nof prior resolution attempts or\n\n94\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.150\nprior information that's been provided\nto us in one or more forms and\n\n95\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.670\nwe see that cached for a period of time.\n\n96\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.990\nI'll remind you of how to do\nthat here in just a minute.\n\n97\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.557\nWe're also going to take a look at,\nor we would look at,\n\n98\n00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:58.358\nthe host file if we have any\nentries in our host file locally.\n\n99\n00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:01.470\nMost systems will not use the host\nfile even though it's there.\n\n100\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.954\nIt is always part of what we do, but\n\n101\n00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:06.663\nusually you don't have a lot of entries in\nthere right, so it's not going to be used.\n\n102\n00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:09.718\nOr what I should say is we'll query it but\nwe don't see anything of are there any\n\n103\n00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:13.425\ninterests there that matches what we're\nlooking for, and we tend to then move on.\n\n104\n00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:16.725\nWe do happen to have something\nin the host file or happen to\n\n105\n00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:20.555\nhave something in our local resolve for\ncache, we would use that reference and\n\n106\n00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:23.225\nthen go out and\nattempt to look up to find the website.\n\n107\n00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:26.045\nIn this case whatever we're looking for\nand see if we could resolve it.\n\n108\n00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.110\nNow this is both good and bad.\n\n109\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.760\nThis is good because it saves us time and\nit makes the DNS process run very\n\n110\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.930\nquickly and optimizes it if\nwe have information locally.\n\n111\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.630\nWhy go remote when we can shop\nlocally in other words, right?\n\n112\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.700\nThink about that, but the bad side\nto this potentially is, hackers and\n\n113\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.540\nbad actors know about this behavior.\n\n114\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.530\nThis is common, this is the way DNS has\nworked forever in a day and if they can\n\n115\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.590\nmanipulate or modify entries, either\nin this resolver cache that we're about\n\n116\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.970\nto talk about and take a look at through\nwhat's called a DNS cache poisoning or\n\n117\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.060\ncache pollution attack, depends on\nwhat you're doing and how you do it.\n\n118\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.817\nBut if they can manipulate or\nmodify entries here, or\n\n119\n00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:10.108\nalthough it's not often done, we don't\noften modify the host's file in theory to\n\n120\n00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:12.884\nbe able to attempt an attack or\nredirect resolution.\n\n121\n00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:15.116\nBut if we did modify\nentries in a host file,\n\n122\n00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:19.335\nwe would potentially be able to redirect\nthat resolution from the client to a site\n\n123\n00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:21.645\nthat's controlled by a bad actor, right?\n\n124\n00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:24.825\nAnd this could potentially,\nobviously, cause confusion and\n\n125\n00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:28.076\nmaybe even, ultimately,\na lead to the box being compromised.\n\n126\n00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:31.860\nSo just want to think about the fact\nthat while we're really focusing here\n\n127\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.690\non the process, the methodology,\nthe steps, the just nuts and\n\n128\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.690\nbolts about how DNS resolution works,\n\n129\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.260\nwe do want to have that broader context\nof the fact that there are some\n\n130\n00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.370\nsecurity concerns even though it's not\nthe primary focus of what we're doing.\n\n131\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.870\nLet me bring Bring this up, because\nCherokee wanted to say something and\n\n132\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.410\nwhile I'm just bringing up the resolver\ncache we can hear from Miss Cherokee.\n\n133\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.910\n&gt;&gt; So Adam you actually just covered my\npoint about that host file being modified\n\n134\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.480\nby malware because that can happen and\nit is very seldomly used.\n\n135\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.050\nI've legitimately used it one time.\n\n136\n00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.040\nAnd that particular issue is pretty\nrare as where an individual had\n\n137\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.140\nincorrectly registered their\ndomain name with the registrar.\n\n138\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.850\nSo as a temporary fix until they\ncan get in touch with them and\n\n139\n00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.810\nhave it all sorted out.\n\n140\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Overrode that essentially, right?\n\n141\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.300\n&gt;&gt; To over write it.\n&gt;&gt; This is a manual configuration.\n\n142\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.940\n&gt;&gt; In the meantime.\nBut\n\n143\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.390\nalso, what,\nit doesn't always have to be malware, too.\n\n144\n00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.330\nIf there are changes,\ndifferent IP addresses,\n\n145\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.590\nthen this could also be a problem if you\nare retaining that information locally and\n\n146\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.280\nyou might want to flush it out if you're\ndealing with some kind of dynamic\n\n147\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.270\nchange there with that IP address.\n\n148\n00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.760\n&gt;&gt; So you would absolutely and we since\nyou mentioned flushing out the DNS cache,\n\n149\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.240\nwe're not going to do that just now\nbecause that would obviously cause me some\n\n150\n00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.500\nproblems with all the websites and things\nI have loaded up and stuff we're doing in\n\n151\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.720\nthe discussion, but the command\nwould just be IP config flush DNS,\n\n152\n00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.650\nis supposed to display DNS and that\nwould let us clear that resolver cache.\n\n153\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.890\nAnd you can see that I've got\na bunch of stuff that's in here just\n\n154\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.060\nliterally went scrolling\nby while I set it up.\n\n155\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.453\nYou can see all the different web sites\nthat I've gone out and resolved and\n\n156\n00:07:57.453 --> 00:07:58.395\nhave knowledge of.\n\n157\n00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.542\nAs I go down here,\n\n158\n00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:04.515\nthere's how DNS works right there and\nso we're looking at records for that.\n\n159\n00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:07.486\nTo be able to bring that site up so\nremember I have it loaded right here and\n\n160\n00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:11.100\nhave all the websites we're gonna talk\nabout just kind of teed up as I often do.\n\n161\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.830\nSo we have information about that.\n\n162\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.770\nWe get back, you know,\na record information type, a time to live,\n\n163\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.770\nwe talked about the importance of before.\n\n164\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:24.520\nWe see the host record with the IP address\nthat helps us to resolve this URL or\n\n165\n00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.810\nin this case, this fully qualified\ndomain name, address, how DNS works or\n\n166\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.910\nwhatever it maybe.\n\n167\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.270\nSo we've all that information there.\n\n168\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.740\nThis is step one in the process, right?\n\n169\n00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.970\nSo we would get this information.\n\n170\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.260\nWe could have to clear that\nif we did the flush DNS.\n\n171\n00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.900\nWe're not gonna do that,\nbut just to remind you, and\n\n172\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.900\nI've done this prior episodes,\nbut just to remind you,\n\n173\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.270\nif you're not familiar with any of\nour commands that we're looking at,\n\n174\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.615\nipconfig in this case, whatever the\ncommand maybe, it doesn't really matter.\n\n175\n00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:53.370\nYou don't be afraid to go and look in the\nhelp file as we often talked about, and\n\n176\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.080\nsee what you can do with it,\nand experiment a little bit.\n\n177\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.360\nYou're not gonna hurt your machine\nby flushing the DNS resolver cache.\n\n178\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.000\nYou're just gonna have to go out and\nspend an extra couple of milliseconds.\n\n179\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.660\nDo a name resolution, refresh all that as\nyou go surf the web again after you do it.\n\n180\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.850\nBut if you wanna do it and see what's in\nthere, you'll go out and bring up three or\n\n181\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.850\nfour webpages.\n\n182\n00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.570\nAnd then, do an IP config display DNS,\nso you could see what's there.\n\n183\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.890\nAnd then do a Flush DNS, and you'll\nsee there clearly is a resolver cache.\n\n184\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.700\nYou'll understand how that process works.\n\n185\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.390\nBut you could see those\ncommands right here.\n\n186\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.150\nYou can obviously see those switches\nare used with the command and\n\n187\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.160\nyou could see those options.\n\n188\n00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.940\nSo it would be a good idea for\nyou take a took.\n\n189\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.920\nWe did talk about the fact\nthat you could also go in and\n\n190\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.480\ntake a look at the host file.\n\n191\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.140\nAnd the host file would be available\nto you in the system root or\n\n192\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.290\npercent system root percent.\n\n193\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.260\nSo typically C Windows,\nmore often than not on a Windows machine.\n\n194\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.410\nSystem 32 drivers,\nXE drivers slash ETC directory,\n\n195\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.570\nand you would see the file there.\n\n196\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.390\nIt's a text file, you just bring it up and\nyou can see the information that may or\n\n197\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.540\nmay not be contained there.\n\n198\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.390\nTypically your loop back\nadaptor's the only thing\n\n199\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.870\nyou're gonna find in\nthere that's referenced.\n\n200\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.250\nOther than that, unless,\nCherokee said, maybe you go in and\n\n201\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.160\ntypically modify a configuration\nsetting in lewd of a fix for\n\n202\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.700\nmaybe a few minutes,\nyou may be able to do that.\n\n203\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.290\nYou'll oftentimes, well we mentioned\nMalware does modify these things,\n\n204\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.990\nalthough it's probably not going\nto target modifying the host file.\n\n205\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.380\nA lot of times if you are using software\nand borrowing it without necessarily\n\n206\n00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.540\nowning the rights to it properly,\nyou may find that host file management or\n\n207\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.765\nmanipulation to perhaps\nblock update sites and\n\n208\n00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:31.465\nblock patching and things of that\nnature from a registration prospective.\n\n209\n00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:35.715\nMay actually occur and you may see\nevidence of that if you go take a look.\n\n210\n00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:40.615\nSo when you look at and see modified host\nfiles, you typically are seeing evidence\n\n211\n00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:45.825\nof information management that is taking\nplace to redirect traffic, let's just say.\n\n212\n00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:48.950\nAnd that may or may not be to your\nbenefit depending on what you're doing.\n\n213\n00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.680\nSo step one would traditionally\nbe that we'd be looking locally,\n\n214\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.130\nlooking at this information.\n\n215\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.510\nStep two, we will then, assuming we\ndon't find resolution locally of course,\n\n216\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.340\ncuz as I said if we do when we go out and\nwe then able to use that information\n\n217\n00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.132\nwe would probably stop right there and\njust go resolve site.\n\n218\n00:11:04.132 --> 00:11:07.910\nBut assuming that we are gonna\ncontinue to have to look,\n\n219\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.680\nwe'd engage in what we know,\nor what we often think about,\n\n220\n00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.480\nas recursion, a recursive query,\nis what we would often talk about.\n\n221\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.320\nWe only will look, or rather we will\nlook locally and then use that.\n\n222\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.106\nBut if we don't find the answer locally,\nit's not in our resolver cache,\n\n223\n00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:23.487\nit's not in the host file,\n\n224\n00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:27.053\nwe'll then go out and ask our DNS server,\nas I said kind of in step two.\n\n225\n00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.981\nWe would look for our primary DNS server,\n\n226\n00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.852\nperhaps an alternate depending on which\none is available, which one we can get to.\n\n227\n00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:37.893\nBut we'll go through the list in our IP\nconfiguration by our adaptor interface,\n\n228\n00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:42.950\nand we'll just simply start hitting those\nIP addresses that are listed for DNS.\n\n229\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.459\nAnd we'll be sending out\na series of questions.\n\n230\n00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:49.626\nHey Mr. and Mrs. DNS server, do you have\nknowledge of, are you familiar with,\n\n231\n00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.968\nsimply would say are you\nauthoritative for?\n\n232\n00:11:51.968 --> 00:11:53.360\nDo you understand how to manage?\n\n233\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.080\nDo you have knowledge of this particular\narea that I'm looking to resolve,\n\n234\n00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.860\nin this case how DNS works websites,\nright?\n\n235\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.850\nSo I would look for that, and\nwhat will happen with a recursive query is\n\n236\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.320\nthe DNS server, whichever one\nwe happen to connect with and\n\n237\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.710\nstart the conversation with, will do\nits own look in its own information.\n\n238\n00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.520\nIt will look in the DNS records,\nthe resource records it has in one or\n\n239\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.450\nmore zone files.\n\n240\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.990\nIt will say, I do or\ndon't know about that, and\n\n241\n00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.100\nit will also look locally in\nits own DNS cache, right?\n\n242\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.240\nSo it'll look in its\nown information stores.\n\n243\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.000\nBut again, it will look locally,\nwe always have a preference for\n\n244\n00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.210\nlooking locally before we go out globally.\n\n245\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.860\nThis is the overlying, or\nover arching thought process, we have to\n\n246\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.850\nreally beat into our heads and remember\nat all times about the DNS resolution.\n\n247\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.210\nAlways start locally, if we find\nthat answer, that's what we take.\n\n248\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.260\nOnly go remote if there's no other\noption because that takes extra time and\n\n249\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.590\nit delays the resolution process,\nit slows us down.\n\n250\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.930\nSo we'll look locally on the DNS\nserver through a recursive query.\n\n251\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.300\nIf it tells us that it's\ngonna have that information,\n\n252\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.430\nit's because it understands it,\nhas a record of it, and is aware of it.\n\n253\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.040\nIf not, then the DNS Server\nwe talk to goes out and\n\n254\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.670\nqueries the root name servers.\n\n255\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.170\nThe root name servers will be queried in\nstep three in kind of our walkthrough.\n\n256\n00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.270\nYou may have heard of\nsomething called root hints.\n\n257\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.700\nYou may have heard of that file or\neven seen that file or\n\n258\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.100\noccasionally looked at it.\n\n259\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.630\nMicrosoft puts out updates for\nit every so often all vendors do and\n\n260\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.140\nyou may download as part of an update\nto the root hints occasionally.\n\n261\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.978\nThat's just our list of the root servers\nthat are out on the Internet for DNS or\n\n262\n00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:24.461\nout around the world\nscattered across the globe,\n\n263\n00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:26.489\nthey're based on regional geography.\n\n264\n00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:29.669\nThere's so many in North America,\nthere's a couple in Asia, in Europe,\n\n265\n00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:31.495\nthey're just scattered around, right?\n\n266\n00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:33.273\nThere are 13 core root servers,\n\n267\n00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:37.213\nand then there's a mirror topology and\nadditional servers to back that up.\n\n268\n00:13:37.213 --> 00:13:37.942\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n269\n00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.099\n&gt;&gt; And people with guns, and missiles, and\nall sorts of cool stuff to protect them.\n\n270\n00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:41.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] right?\n\n271\n00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:44.048\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyeah we often joke around about DNS.\n\n272\n00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:47.650\nBut it seem when you think about what\nmay have happened in the last weeks,\n\n273\n00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.410\nmonths, years against the DNS\ninfrastructure globally,\n\n274\n00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.010\na lot of attacks that have occurred.\n\n275\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.170\nYou may be familiar with one or\nmore of them.\n\n276\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.730\nThere have been several\nspectacular ones in recent memory.\n\n277\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.793\nBut when you think about how resilient\nthe actual DNS infrastructure is and\n\n278\n00:14:00.793 --> 00:14:05.307\nhow it's built and the fact that you have\nthis global network which is not that big,\n\n279\n00:14:05.307 --> 00:14:06.163\nit is massive.\n\n280\n00:14:06.163 --> 00:14:09.998\nBut if you think about the fact that\nsitting at the top of this thing,\n\n281\n00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:13.968\nthere are 13 main route servers by\nIP address class broken out to deal\n\n282\n00:14:13.968 --> 00:14:15.800\nwith that infrastructure.\n\n283\n00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.590\nOf course, there are redundant servers,\nyou know there is lots and\n\n284\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.310\nlots of infrastructure that supports that.\n\n285\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.130\nBut as you go down, kind of the hierarchy\nand think about building it out,\n\n286\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.840\nthis is really nothing more than\njust you know a daisy chained\n\n287\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.840\nsystem of multiple servers that\nare providing 411 information.\n\n288\n00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.730\nThis is like the yellow\npages of the world, right?\n\n289\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.200\nBut its the most far long and\nmost widely stretched and deployed and\n\n290\n00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.480\nmost often used lookup\nsystem in the world.\n\n291\n00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.650\nIt has been for decades.\n\n292\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.630\nI mean, this is what all\nmodern information management\n\n293\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.660\nsystems are built on.\n\n294\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.290\nThere would be if you think about\nthis just as startling as it is.\n\n295\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.780\nPeople don't often stop\nto think about this.\n\n296\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.090\nThere would be no modern technology,\nthe way we think of it,\n\n297\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.100\nthe way we use information today,\nDNS didn't exist.\n\n298\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.472\nI mean, Google, forget about it,\nit's gone, it doesn't exist.\n\n299\n00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:02.824\nGod forbid Facebook goes away, right?\n\n300\n00:15:02.824 --> 00:15:05.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Facebook, Twitter you know what I mean.\n\n301\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.600\nAll that stuff is just gone, there's no\nway to leverage and use any of that using\n\n302\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.390\nthe current traditional computing model\nthat we use where we can look things up.\n\n303\n00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.480\nAnd do this resolution either forward or\nreverse through look up zones and\n\n304\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.550\nprovide an address, get an IP and\nprovide an IP and get an address.\n\n305\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.195\nWe would not be able to do any\nof that if DNS didn't exist.\n\n306\n00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:25.800\nForget about like Newton and Calculus.\n\n307\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.640\nI mean that was cool, but\n\n308\n00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.996\nhe was like a loser compared to\nthe DNS infrastructure, right?\n\n309\n00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:30.625\n&gt;&gt; We couldn't live without Facebook.\n\n310\n00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:33.235\n&gt;&gt; I mean just think about that,\nI mean this is all really important stuff,\n\n311\n00:15:33.235 --> 00:15:34.505\ndon't get me wrong, right?\n\n312\n00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:36.215\nAnd for\nanybody out there related to Mr Newton,\n\n313\n00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:38.265\nI apologize cuz he is a really cool guy,\nright?\n\n314\n00:15:38.265 --> 00:15:43.260\nBut if you think about the fact that if\nwe were to do away with this one system,\n\n315\n00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.690\neverything we move on, everything we think\nabout would essentially stop working.\n\n316\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know what's really cool?\n\n317\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.710\nMy favorite part?\n\n318\n00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Now, that was really cool.\n\n319\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.915\nWhat I just said was really cool.\n\n320\n00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:52.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what you have, but\n\n321\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.335\nit's not really cool.\n\n322\n00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:55.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It maybe cool, but it's not as cool.\n\n323\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.415\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so semi-cool.\n\n324\n00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:57.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, semi-cool.\n\n325\n00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.425\nSo yeah, but what else?\n\n326\n00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:03.360\n&gt;&gt; The fact how we see just a good mix of\npeople coming together to manage these\n\n327\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.925\nnodes.\n\n328\n00:16:03.925 --> 00:16:08.296\nYou see like NASA So universities,\ngovernment entities.\n\n329\n00:16:08.296 --> 00:16:11.220\n&gt;&gt; It's like the Benetton\nof name resolution, right?\n\n330\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.810\nThis is the global join hands and\neverybody's happy.\n\n331\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.470\nAnd we all wear really stylish clothes.\n\n332\n00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like that, right?\n\n333\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.065\nSo it is really cool.\n\n334\n00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.215\nI mean, you think about it.\n\n335\n00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:20.975\nWe're joking about it, right,\njust to make light of it.\n\n336\n00:16:20.975 --> 00:16:23.175\nBut you know, it is a global network.\n\n337\n00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:24.834\nIt is managed by more than one entity.\n\n338\n00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:29.175\nNot one entity, one system,\none country controls the whole thing.\n\n339\n00:16:29.175 --> 00:16:30.895\nIt is a partnership, to your point.\n\n340\n00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:33.255\nAnd probably the most successful\none when we think about it,\n\n341\n00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:37.015\nbecause literally it does underline and\nenable everything we think of and do and\n\n342\n00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:38.545\ntake for\ngranted today in the modern world.\n\n343\n00:16:38.545 --> 00:16:41.515\nI mean, just what we're doing right now,\nus talking to you,\n\n344\n00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:45.030\nyou watching us through\nthe ITProTV interface.\n\n345\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.140\nYou could not do this if\nDNS was not functional.\n\n346\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.230\nIt would not work,\n\n347\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.460\nat least not the way we traditionally\nthink of being able to resolve.\n\n348\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.890\nCould you use an IP address to\ndirectly connect without using DNS?\n\n349\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.680\nOf course you could, but how many of us\nknow the IP addresses of every interface\n\n350\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.430\nthat we wanna connect with and\nconsume services from?\n\n351\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.430\nAnd how can we go then and rewrite\nliterally every application on the planet\n\n352\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.030\nthat relies on DNS as primary name\nresolution, for primary name resolution.\n\n353\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.316\nI mean, that would be tremendous\nupheaval if we got rid of DNS.\n\n354\n00:17:13.316 --> 00:17:14.920\nThat would be like a Pinky and\nthe Brain thing.\n\n355\n00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.905\nYou ever see Pinky and the Brain?\n\n356\n00:17:15.905 --> 00:17:16.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n357\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.030\n&gt;&gt; It's like the Pinky and\nthe Brain thing.\n\n358\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.110\nWhat are we gonna do tonight?\n\n359\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.950\nForget about taking over the world,\nwe're just gonna remake the system and\n\n360\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.700\nget rid of DNS.\n\n361\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.490\n&gt;&gt; That'd be evil.\n\n362\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.260\n&gt;&gt; That would be.\n\n363\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.770\nThat would be, yeah.\n\n364\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So sinister, Adam.\n\n365\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.670\n&gt;&gt; That would be kind of wacky,\nkind of cool.\n\n366\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.220\nAll right, so step three, right?\n\n367\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.190\nWe're gonna go out,\nwe're gonna go to our root name servers.\n\n368\n00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.250\nThey're going to exam the query that\ncomes in from one of the DNS servers.\n\n369\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.120\nThey're gonna say hey, where does that go?\n\n370\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.360\nHow do I figure out how to resolve that\nthrough our name resolution hierarchy?\n\n371\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.140\nWe're gonna ask the top\nlevel domain name servers,\n\n372\n00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.680\ncalled the TLD, top level domain\nname servers, in the hierarchy.\n\n373\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.670\nIf you think about DNS,\nyou think about essentially a pyramid,\n\n374\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.450\nif you just get a picture in your mind.\n\n375\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.330\nAt the top of the pyramid kinda at the\napex, we have the root name server, right?\n\n376\n00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.070\nAnd then coming down from that,\n\n377\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.290\nthe root name server, coming down from\nthat, we have our top level domains,\n\n378\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.480\nwe then have our secondary\ndomains that we're gonna resolve.\n\n379\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.202\nSo we have .com, .gov,\n.mil, .org, whatever.\n\n380\n00:18:11.202 --> 00:18:15.914\nAnd then we're gonna have below\nthat something like itpro.tv so\n\n381\n00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:19.521\nITPro would exist below the .tv system,\nright?\n\n382\n00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:21.070\nAnd then below that we\nhave all the other stuff.\n\n383\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.898\nAnd we start resolving\nall the way through, but\n\n384\n00:18:23.898 --> 00:18:28.155\nit is gonna be this graded hierarchy\nthat kinda moves down from the top.\n\n385\n00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:29.187\nAnd the root, we often say,\n\n386\n00:18:29.187 --> 00:18:31.727\nand this is kinda the thought process\nyou gotta wrap your head around.\n\n387\n00:18:31.727 --> 00:18:34.396\nWe talked about the root servers, and\nyou say the word root, you often think,\n\n388\n00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:37.325\nwell, that's at the bottom,\nthat's at the base, right, traditionally.\n\n389\n00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.785\nBut when we think about DNS and\n\n390\n00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:42.105\nwe actually look at it, it actually is\nat the top and we go from the top down.\n\n391\n00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:46.410\nBut the root is the top, so it's\nan inverted thought process for us, yes.\n\n392\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.818\n&gt;&gt; And if you take that pyramid and\nkind of lay it on its side,\n\n393\n00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:53.368\nwhen you're looking at that\nfully qualified domain name,\n\n394\n00:18:53.368 --> 00:18:56.994\nthe top all the way on\nthe right-hand side, the little dot.\n\n395\n00:18:56.994 --> 00:19:00.760\nI didn't even know that dot existed for\nyears, Adam, our little root dot.\n\n396\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:03.759\n&gt;&gt; Our little root dot.\n\n397\n00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:05.499\n&gt;&gt; Our little root dot. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt;\nWe're so proud of our little root dot.\n\n398\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.153\n&gt;&gt; Our little root dot's grown up to be\nsuch a great, just such a great root.\n\n399\n00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:12.660\nAll right, so let's just take a look here.\n\n400\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.397\nI'm just gonna pull up while we\nwere talking cuz you know DNS\n\n401\n00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:20.454\ntraditionally here, and so\nlet me just do this really quickly.\n\n402\n00:19:20.454 --> 00:19:22.840\nCuz I know you showed me this.\n\n403\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.390\nAnd I think it's this one, right?\n\n404\n00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.190\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not that.\n\n405\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.196\nWhat's the other,\nit's this one right here.\n\n406\n00:19:28.196 --> 00:19:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here.\n\n407\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Either way, it doesn't matter.\n\n408\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.760\nSo let's just look at\nhierarchy real quick,\n\n409\n00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.360\nI just want to show\na picture of hierarchy.\n\n410\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.000\nSo when you look at,\nbecause we were talking about the root,\n\n411\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.305\njust to show you quickly what\nthe thought process looks like.\n\n412\n00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:43.090\nSomething like this where it's up at\nthe root and then we go down, and\n\n413\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.200\nwe have our top-level domains.\n\n414\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.940\nAnd then we go down one more.\n\n415\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.170\nWe're just looking at the idea\nof building out this hierarchy.\n\n416\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.140\nThat's all I was suggesting.\n\n417\n00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.800\nJust to give you this thought process,\nright?\n\n418\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.890\nIt's a pyramid, essentially.\n\n419\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.800\nAt least when we represent it in diagram,\nand\n\n420\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.480\nthat's what we often talk about, right?\n\n421\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.840\nIt's logically gonna\nbe displayed that way.\n\n422\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.520\nPhysically it's not set up that way.\n\n423\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.480\nIt's obviously a network and all\nthe machines are gonna be linked together\n\n424\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.120\nbased on wherever they are in\nthe world but just when we think about\n\n425\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.230\nthe thought process of seeing it,\nthat's kind of what we envision.\n\n426\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:16.890\nSo in step three, we're gonna go,\n[LAUGH] we're gonna go now.\n\n427\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.660\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n428\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.240\nAnd we're gonna starting to the root name\nservers, rather, are gonna take a look and\n\n429\n00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.020\nstart to talk down the hierarchy, right?\n\n430\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.660\nIn step four, the authoritative name\nserver, hopefully, we found one\n\n431\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.260\nby going through the root names further\ndown into the top level domains.\n\n432\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.090\nUltimately, we're gonna\nprovide a set of lookups,\n\n433\n00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.290\nkind of walking through\nthe logic of that hierarchy.\n\n434\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.922\nHey, this is the root, we're looking for\nin this case .work, so we've gotta go from\n\n435\n00:20:41.922 --> 00:20:47.423\nthe root down into that first level and\nsee where .works would be, or .tv or .com.\n\n436\n00:20:47.423 --> 00:20:51.547\nThen we gotta drill through that, find\nservers that are gonna be authoritative\n\n437\n00:20:51.547 --> 00:20:53.340\nfor something in that namespace.\n\n438\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.397\nWe're gonna go down several levels\ndepending on what we're doing, one or\n\n439\n00:20:56.397 --> 00:20:57.423\nmore look-ups as we go.\n\n440\n00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.410\nAgain, it's what we call zone files.\n\n441\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.250\nThe zone file is simply gonna be\nthe container in the DNS server\n\n442\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.430\nthat is gonna represent the namespace.\n\n443\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.780\nIn this case,\nhow DNS is the name space .work.\n\n444\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.070\nSo the how DNS zone inside\nthe .work's namespace.\n\n445\n00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.350\nOn a DNS server that has that,\nwe would be looking for that zone.\n\n446\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.610\nThat collection of files inside of,\nwhen you think about and\n\n447\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.440\nlook at a management interface,\ninside of a folder,\n\n448\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.590\ncuz the zone files are literally\njust folders with names on them.\n\n449\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.470\nAnd then all the resource\nrecords that are gonna be listed\n\n450\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.000\nto allow us to do the name resolution.\n\n451\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.590\nWe're gonna be looking there.\n\n452\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.060\nWe could do either a forward or\na reverse lookup zone.\n\n453\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.280\nLookup, forward or\nreverse lookup zone lookup.\n\n454\n00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.550\nYes, if we do a forward lookup or\nreverse zone lookup.\n\n455\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.610\nWhen we do a forward lookup, right,\nwe're providing the address, and\n\n456\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.990\nI want to find http www.whatever,\nright, .whatever.\n\n457\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.290\nAnd we provide that in our DNS query.\n\n458\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.930\nThe DNS resolution engine goes through,\nfigures all that out, comes back and\n\n459\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.030\nprovides to us, ultimately, an IP address\nthat we then use in a separate step\n\n460\n00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.840\nto go out and go to the web server or\nthe resource in question.\n\n461\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.840\nAnd then ultimately get services or\ninformation from.\n\n462\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.410\nThat's a forward lookup\nagainst a name zone.\n\n463\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.980\nCustomer reverse lookup, right, but then\nwe have to set up reverse lookup zones.\n\n464\n00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.480\nWe have to program in the reverse\nlookup zones at the DNS server.\n\n465\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.890\nThe forward lookup zone is created when we\nregister the namespace and we have what\n\n466\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.950\nwe call authority to manage it, or we've\nbeen a copy of it by a primary server.\n\n467\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.330\nAnd we're gonna be a secondary server,\nsome sort of a stub zone or\n\n468\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.241\nsomething like that may be created.\n\n469\n00:22:30.241 --> 00:22:33.099\nWe'll talk about what these\ndifferent kinds of zones and\n\n470\n00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:37.140\nzone management are as we get more into\nthe DNS topic in upcoming episodes.\n\n471\n00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.500\nBut we're gonna have reverse lookup zone\npotentially that lets us provide an IP\n\n472\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.055\naddress and then request ultimately that\nwe get back the fully qualified address or\n\n473\n00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:46.590\nthe URL.\n\n474\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.150\nSo we can do this either way.\n\n475\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.600\nBut out of the box by default,\nforward lookup zones are created as we\n\n476\n00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.790\nregister the zones,\ncreate the authority to manage them.\n\n477\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.770\nBut reverse lookup zones\nhave to be created.\n\n478\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:01.010\nThey're not there by default, although we\noften will have reverse lookup zones to\n\n479\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.700\nfacilitate additional name resolution,\nmake it easier.\n\n480\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.210\nBut remember, when we do that,\nnot only do we have to create them, but\n\n481\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.670\nwe create special resource\nrecords to populate them.\n\n482\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.920\nThose resource records\nare called pointer records.\n\n483\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.460\nAnd we'll go through and\ntalk more about what those records are and\n\n484\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.170\nwhat they look like.\n\n485\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.810\nWe'll actually show them to\nyou in an upcoming episode.\n\n486\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.270\nBut we're gonna be able to look for\nthis name resolution and\n\n487\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.610\ndo either a photo reverse lookup depending\non the nature of the information of\n\n488\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:29.460\nthe client that started this resolution\nprocess in step one has actually provided.\n\n489\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.810\nSo it will then be determined based on\nthe kind of information we start with,\n\n490\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.400\nwhat kind of address, or what kind of\nlookup we ultimately are gonna engage.\n\n491\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.079\nWe find in step five\nthe appropriate resource records,\n\n492\n00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:43.770\nassuming we found the DNS server\nthat's authoritative for our zone.\n\n493\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.590\nThere are many kinds of resource records.\n\n494\n00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.170\nI mentioned pointer records in the reverse\nlookup zone just a minute ago.\n\n495\n00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.850\nWe may have a host record, right?\n\n496\n00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.485\nSo an IPv4 host record.\n\n497\n00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:54.441\nWe may have an IPv6 host record.\n\n498\n00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:58.652\nThey essentially mean the same thing,\nbut they have different designators,\n\n499\n00:23:58.652 --> 00:24:01.880\nan IPv4 host record has an A,\na single A, in parentheses.\n\n500\n00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.757\nAn IPv6 host record has\nfour As in parentheses,\n\n501\n00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:07.291\nsignifying the difference between them.\n\n502\n00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:10.794\nWe also may have a, an s record,\na name server record.\n\n503\n00:24:10.794 --> 00:24:13.506\nWe have an SOA record,\na start of authority record.\n\n504\n00:24:13.506 --> 00:24:19.410\nWe may have a MX record, a mail exchange\nrecord for looking up mail servers.\n\n505\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.950\nWe may have, what else,\nwe have Cname records, right?\n\n506\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.450\nI'm sorry?\n\n507\n00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.980\n&gt;&gt; SOA.\n&gt;&gt; I did say start of authority.\n\n508\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.420\nWe may have Cname records name or\nwhat we commonly call alias records.\n\n509\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:37.430\nWe may have the, what else,\na whole bunch of other reps.\n\n510\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.140\nCan't think of all of them off the top\nof my head, there's a whole bunch.\n\n511\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.750\nThere really are a lot.\n\n512\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.630\nThose are the common ones,\n\n513\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.420\nthe most commonly used ones\nare going to be on that list.\n\n514\n00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.010\nService records as well, if we're\ntalking about Windows specifically and\n\n515\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.040\nusing a LDAP directory to be able to do\nlookups, love service records, right?\n\n516\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.120\nSo, you'll have those as well.\n\n517\n00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.990\nSo, you will have a variety of different\nrecords that may exist there, and\n\n518\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.260\nwe'll go through what those are with you.\n\n519\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.350\nBut ultimately, we would find\nthe appropriate record given the nature of\n\n520\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.520\nthe resolution or the lookup we're trying\nto engage in, we'll get that back,\n\n521\n00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.650\nwe'll then give that ultimately through\nthe process kind of walking back\n\n522\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.660\nthrough the chain to the client to\nstart the resolution in step one.\n\n523\n00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.520\nThe client will then\ntake that information and\n\n524\n00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.780\nwill open up a separate session,\ngo out and resolve that resource.\n\n525\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.650\nWhether it is.\n\n526\n00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.240\nThe website like we did talk here about\nhow DNS works, that little comic book\n\n527\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.750\nwe were looking at, whether it's\nmaybe connecting to a printer.\n\n528\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.730\nSo we want to be able to send\na document using DNS to do a lookup for\n\n529\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.160\nthat because maybe that printer object has\nbeen published in the active directory.\n\n530\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.540\nMaybe we're looking to get to an internal\nserver like a domain controller\n\n531\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.680\nto find resources and\nwe're using DNS to look that up.\n\n532\n00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.230\nUsing a service record in the old\napp directory to do that.\n\n533\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.990\nThere's all sorts of ways that we would\nput that information together, but\n\n534\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.590\nwe would then use that in the final\nstep to go out and actually get to.\n\n535\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.510\nThe application, the service, and consume\nby setting up a session and connecting and\n\n536\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.460\ninteracting with it.\n\n537\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.990\nWhatever we had asked for\nall the way back in step one.\n\n538\n00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.780\nSo by going through all these steps, and\nkind of walking through the logic of them,\n\n539\n00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.320\nwe're able to hopefully have a better\nsense of how DNS actually works.\n\n540\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.380\nNow remember, this has taken I dunno maybe\n10 minutes walking through, give or take,\n\n541\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.550\nfor us to talk about,\n\n542\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.180\nmaybe 15 when we include all\nthe joking around we did about.\n\n543\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.040\nSideways pyramids and root servers and\nthings laying on their side and\n\n544\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.570\nwho knows what.\n\n545\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.780\nBut when we think about all that, right,\nand we think about how long it took\n\n546\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.210\nus to explain it, does it really\ntake that long for it to happen?\n\n547\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.840\nI mean when you think about how,\n\n548\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.400\nassuming everything works\nthe right way of course, right.\n\n549\n00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.670\nEverything's set up, you're asking for\na website that actually exists.\n\n550\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.750\nThere is DNS infrastructure to support it,\n\n551\n00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.200\nyou have DNS servers specified\nin your IP config, right.\n\n552\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.670\nWhether you have it locally,\nwhether you get it remotely,\n\n553\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.140\nthis process may take a few seconds,\nnot going to take very long traditionally\n\n554\n00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.690\nas long as everything as working, so\nalthough it takes a while to explain it,\n\n555\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.810\nit happens almost instantaneously\nwhen you think about it.\n\n556\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.750\nOr when we go out and we load a web page\nI mean it happens almost immediately.\n\n557\n00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.430\nAssuming again, everything is lined up and\nkind of working in line.\n\n558\n00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.390\nIf we go back to our machine that\nwe were looking at here, right,\n\n559\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.040\nour nice little catalog of\nDNS information right here.\n\n560\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.030\nIf we click, you see how quickly\nthe website comes up and now, granted, I\n\n561\n00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:10.025\ndid have that result, we saw the resource\nrecords in the DNS resolver cache.\n\n562\n00:27:10.025 --> 00:27:13.665\nBecause you saw it in populated and seeing\nall the sub pages that we would go to.\n\n563\n00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.645\nBut you could see here, I could bring\nthat up very, very quickly, right?\n\n564\n00:27:16.645 --> 00:27:18.175\nI mean, it does not take very long.\n\n565\n00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:22.085\nIf I just go and load a browser,\nyou'll see it comes up almost immediately.\n\n566\n00:27:22.085 --> 00:27:22.825\nRight?\nAnd if\n\n567\n00:27:22.825 --> 00:27:24.655\nI click on any one of these things,\nshould I go?\n\n568\n00:27:24.655 --> 00:27:25.275\nDare I do it?\n\n569\n00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:26.210\nShould I go to Facebook?\n\n570\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n571\n00:27:26.995 --> 00:27:29.505\nCherokee's almost favorite\nsite in the world.\n\n572\n00:27:29.505 --> 00:27:32.125\nSo when we go here, you'll see,\nthis comes up right away.\n\n573\n00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:33.595\nI mean, this did not take very long.\n\n574\n00:27:33.595 --> 00:27:35.320\nThis is almost instantaneous.\n\n575\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.380\nAnd the idea behind it is that DNS\nis working hard behind the scenes.\n\n576\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.230\nAll the time doing all this for us,\nbeing able to help us do this resolution.\n\n577\n00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.110\nSo it is very important for us, right?\n\n578\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.890\nto be able to be thinking about how DNS\nworks and understanding the logic of DNS.\n\n579\n00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.520\nBecause if we lay that as a foundation,\nkind of down below our conversations, and\n\n580\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.080\nwe build on that to be able to go through\nand then start talking about how we\n\n581\n00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.880\nimplement DNS in Server '16,\nbe doing that in upcoming episodes.\n\n582\n00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.990\nHow we build out the server,\nhow we then use the server to manage and\n\n583\n00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.050\nprovide name resolution services.\n\n584\n00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.800\nHow we become authoritative for one or\n\n585\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.440\nmore zones,\nhow we create reverse lookup zones.\n\n586\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.560\nHow we can then send that information\nout to alternate DNS servers around our\n\n587\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.590\ninfrastructure, either Active Directory\nintegrated, all our DNS servers are in\n\n588\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.090\nthe Active Directory Running on to domain\ncontrollers, replicated and controlled and\n\n589\n00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.950\nsecurely backed up and maintained as\npart of the overall thought process and\n\n590\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.540\nmanaging Active Directory,\nmaking it much more stable and secure.\n\n591\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.160\nIf we do our standalone\nDNS infrastructure,\n\n592\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.460\nmaybe we're going to do what\nwe call split brain DNS.\n\n593\n00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.018\nGoing to put a DNS server in the DMZ.\n\n594\n00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:41.500\nWe're going to keep one or\nmore behind the firewalls in the LAN.\n\n595\n00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.196\nWe're going to have them reference the\ninformation that are going to be called\n\n596\n00:28:45.196 --> 00:28:47.268\nthe same thing in\nreference information but\n\n597\n00:28:47.268 --> 00:28:49.600\nwe're going to split that information up.\n\n598\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.060\nThe internal DNS servers reference\neverything inside the LAN,\n\n599\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.090\ninside the protected network.\n\n600\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.970\nThe DMZ based DNS servers reference\neverything that's going to\n\n601\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.670\ngo outside to the Internet.\n\n602\n00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.330\nAnd so we can actually split\nour DNS infrastructure up,\n\n603\n00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.750\nenabling us to have better name resolution\nbecause we subdivide our jobs up and\n\n604\n00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:11.000\nwe secure the internal resource records,\nnot allowing them to be made available to\n\n605\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.640\nthe outside world, a further step\nthat would help us to lock that down.\n\n606\n00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.660\nAnd by doing that and then maybe adding a\nlittle magic like manipulating a firewall\n\n607\n00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.870\nand setting up a rule that blocks\nall DNS resolution from the DMZ,\n\n608\n00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:27.630\nfrom those servers to the inside\nasking for internal resources.\n\n609\n00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.470\nBy setting that up we've actually\nlocked down our DNS infrastructure,\n\n610\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.400\nsplit it up and sub divided it and\nsecured it in such a way\n\n611\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.130\nthat we could do name resolution\nfrom either side of the divide but\n\n612\n00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.110\nwe're not going to expose\ninformation unnecessarily.\n\n613\n00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.880\nSo there's lots of different things we'll\ntalk about that we can examine here and\n\n614\n00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.670\nunderstand more about with DNS.\n\n615\n00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.440\nBut we have to understand how DNS\nfunctions in order to make all that\n\n616\n00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.110\ndiscussion, all those discussion points,\nthings we talk about\n\n617\n00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.340\nactually are possibly for\nus to understand and ultimately look at.\n\n618\n00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.320\n&gt;&gt; I was just getting excited thinking\nabout all the different possibilities.\n\n619\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.320\nAnd I know you probably don't want to\nget into it now, but even talking about.\n\n620\n00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.530\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou're going to mention them anyway.\n\n621\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.260\nSo that's good, that's okay.\n\n622\n00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.030\n&gt;&gt; I mention going to it, okay.\n\n623\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.410\nSo like even round robining you can\nimplement a, a rudimentary type\n\n624\n00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.820\nof load balancing, sometimes called poor\nman's load balancing, even with just DNS.\n\n625\n00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.970\nThere's just.\n\n626\n00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.450\nA lot of different things you can do.\n\n627\n00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.593\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly round robinning is\na well established thought process,\n\n628\n00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:17.659\nnot just for DNS but for\nmany services, right?\n\n629\n00:30:17.659 --> 00:30:19.950\nWe do that in many, many systems.\n\n630\n00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:24.950\nBut we could certainly load balance and\nthrough DNS round robbining specify\n\n631\n00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.730\nload capacity but we could do a lot,\nand that's yes, that's part of the DNS\n\n632\n00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.350\ncertainly important, but that's actually\nsomething that we maybe take out of level,\n\n633\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.420\nright that would almost be around the\narchitecture network services that are at\n\n634\n00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.645\nhigher level, it is a function of DNS, but\n\n635\n00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:42.660\nit's one of those functions that is not\nnecessarily something we think of right\n\n636\n00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.710\naway, right because what we've to think of\nhow do we set up over architecture, has to\n\n637\n00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.960\nbe filled on how are going to set up and\nmaintain our name resolution system.\n\n638\n00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.840\nHow do we become authorator for\nthose zones?\n\n639\n00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.730\nAnd once we get all that, that's very\nimportant, we definitely want to think\n\n640\n00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.720\nabout how we're going to balance that\nload and make sure we can optimize it.\n\n641\n00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.420\nBut what we got to do first is learn how\nto resolve before we can actually give\n\n642\n00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.820\neverybody the benefit of that.\n\n643\n00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.770\nSo we've got to crawl before\nwe can walk in other words.\n\n644\n00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.580\nAnd what we're going to do is talk about\nas we come back with some future episodes,\n\n645\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.600\ntalk about how we set up all those pieces,\nhow we stand up a global name zone, how we\n\n646\n00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.760\nset up our DNS servers, how we create\nour look up records, how we go ahead and\n\n647\n00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.210\nmake DNS highly available, load balancing\nmaybe part of that conversation through\n\n648\n00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.360\nround robining, so it'll be very important\nto think about that and how we can\n\n649\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.110\nmanipulate some of the settings, not just\nload balancing through round robining, but\n\n650\n00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:34.570\nresolver, time outs, and as I said,\nmaybe the split DNS thought process,\n\n651\n00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.380\nin the DMZ, and how we can manipulate and\nmanage all these settings.\n\n652\n00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.550\nSome brand new to 16,\nmany have been there for a long time.\n\n653\n00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.740\nAnd by putting all this information\ntogether, over the next few episodes,\n\n654\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.040\nhopefully would make it a lot better for\n\n655\n00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.230\nyou in terms of understanding and\ngetting to know your DNS servers and\n\n656\n00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.935\na little bit more of a personal and\ntherefore friendly and operation.\n\n657\n00:31:54.935 --> 00:31:55.575\nAdditional way.\n\n658\n00:31:55.575 --> 00:31:57.575\nWe're going to do that\nas soon as we come back.\n\n659\n00:31:57.575 --> 00:31:59.195\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n660\n00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:00.795\nThank you for\njoining us ladies and gentlemen.\n\n661\n00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:02.815\nBut for this show,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign out.\n\n662\n00:32:02.815 --> 00:32:05.875\nWe'll give you a little bit of time to\nget personal with your DNS servers.\n\n663\n00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:08.925\nBut then come right back,\nbecause we have more DNS headed your way.\n\n664\n00:32:08.925 --> 00:32:11.225\nRemember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n665\n00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:11.925\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n666\n00:32:11.925 --> 00:32:14.789\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here in ITPro.TV\n\n667\n00:32:14.789 -->

00:00:06.767\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.072\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.473\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:20.830\nIn the previous episode we introduced DNS,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.270\ncontinue that conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.430\nThere's a lot to learn.\n\n11\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.361\nAnd I really don't see that as\nbeing a part one kind of topic.\n\n12\n00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.834\nAnd back with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:31.100\nHow you're doing today, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.099\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.588\nHopefully, everybody out\nthere is doing well, also.\n\n16\n00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:36.561\nWe're gonna continue our conversations.\n\n17\n00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.802\nWe're actually gonna jump right in.\n\n18\n00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:40.857\nTake a look at the DNS server,\nMMC, the management console.\n\n19\n00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.870\nI'll spend a little time\nexploring in there.\n\n20\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.254\nWe can go DNS cave exploring, do DNS\nspelunking, as opposed to conversating.\n\n21\n00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:50.699\nCuz we don't want to just talk about it,\nwe want to explore and\n\n22\n00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.980\nactually see what's going on.\n\n23\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.540\nSo let's take a look if\nwe could right here, or\n\n24\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.778\nright there, or actually right over there.\n\n25\n00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:00.340\nAnd you could see that we have our\nDNS management console opened up.\n\n26\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.980\nWe're on our Windows Server 16 server.\n\n27\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.400\nWe happen to be on a domain controller,\n\n28\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.250\nso we're running right now\nActive Directory integrated DNS.\n\n29\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.940\nWe'll take a look at how to\nmanipulate the zone file and\n\n30\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.130\ntake it out of Active Directory\nintegration, put it back in.\n\n31\n00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.790\nWe'll go through all\nthat in just a minute.\n\n32\n00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.930\nBut we just opened up our DNS MMC,\ngot our server here.\n\n33\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.099\nWe can right click at the root here,\nactually we'll go up one more.\n\n34\n00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.683\nRight click right up here,\njust at the very top as we often can, and\n\n35\n00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.866\nconnect out to different DNS services.\n\n36\n00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.460\nWe want to manage more than one.\n\n37\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.560\nThis console could be redirected\nessentially to another server if we\n\n38\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.170\nwant to do that.\n\n39\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.920\nSo you could see that here.\n\n40\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.940\nSince we're on the PLABDC01, the domain\ncontroller, we have that instance here.\n\n41\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.220\nWe right click,\nwe could set up DNS and configure it.\n\n42\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.560\nWe can go in and\ncreate directory partitions.\n\n43\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.935\nWe'll talk about those in\nan upcoming conversation.\n\n44\n00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.954\nWe'll talk about how to create\na new zone here in just a minute.\n\n45\n00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:51.858\nSo we can set up a new zone at this level.\n\n46\n00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:57.000\nWe can set scavenging and or\naging for our zone files here.\n\n47\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.093\nSo we can go in and specify how\nto do a little housekeeping, and\n\n48\n00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:01.710\nkeep track of what's going on.\n\n49\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.400\nAnd ensure that we're up to date\nwith all the current information.\n\n50\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.370\nGet rid of anything that maybe stale or\nmarked for deletion.\n\n51\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.930\nThings like that,\n\n52\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.770\nin order to make sure we have the best\nname resolution information available.\n\n53\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.400\nSo just gonna wanna make\nsure we think about that.\n\n54\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.190\nWe can scavenge and\nget rid of all of those records as well.\n\n55\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.130\nWe could do an update\nto server data files.\n\n56\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.800\nIf we have changes to the zones,\nmay wanna reload that information or\n\n57\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.510\ndo an update to it to refresh it.\n\n58\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.125\nWe talked about the caching of DNS\ninformation and our prior episode,\n\n59\n00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.570\nwe talked about the walk-through\nof DNS and how we do resolution.\n\n60\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.250\nWe mentioned there's a cache locally\non every system that uses DNS,\n\n61\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.050\nthe DNS resolver cache,\nthe DNS servers have that cache as well.\n\n62\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.273\nWe can clear that cache right from\nwithin the management console.\n\n63\n00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:46.167\nIt could also go do an IPConfig and\nflush DNS, and\n\n64\n00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:50.344\nflush the local resolver cache and\nflush the cache for the DNS server.\n\n65\n00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.039\nSo we can do a couple of different things.\n\n66\n00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.354\nWe have some tools,\ncapabilities to manage, troubleshoot,\n\n67\n00:02:55.354 --> 00:02:56.799\nmanipulate information.\n\n68\n00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.909\nDo diagnostics, one of them is MS lookup,\nand we could see MS lookup here.\n\n69\n00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.290\nA command line tool that\nlet's us manage DNS.\n\n70\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.780\nJust like we would in the console but\ndoing it from the command line.\n\n71\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.270\nWe can also use PowerShell to do this.\n\n72\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.210\nWe often talk about PowerShell and\nthe PowerShell cmdlets for DNS,\n\n73\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.880\nthe DNS Server module.\n\n74\n00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.710\nThe DNS Server cmdlets are here.\n\n75\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.380\nRather extensive one, there's quite\na number of them as I scroll down and\n\n76\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.970\nyou can see here the list just\nkeeps going on and on and on.\n\n77\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.800\nThere are many, many of them as I\ngo down towards the bottom here.\n\n78\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.630\nAnd so you could see this is\na pretty extensive module.\n\n79\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.200\nUnlike some of them that\ndon't have a lot of cmdlets.\n\n80\n00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.550\nThere's over 100 cmdlets associated\nwith DNS server management here.\n\n81\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.770\nSo you may wanna take a look at that but\nit is gonna be a very extensive set\n\n82\n00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.380\nof commands that we can use, or\ncmdlets that we can use to manage DNS.\n\n83\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.650\nSo we do have the ability to start and\n\n84\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.955\nstop the DNS service here, pretty\nstandard stuff from that perspective.\n\n85\n00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:50.450\nAgain, go in and\njust do common things here.\n\n86\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.530\nWe can of course delete,\nalthough you probably don't wanna do that\n\n87\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.320\nunless you have a backup\nof your DNS server.\n\n88\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.920\nThat may end poorly for you.\n\n89\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.776\nSo just try to stay away from that.\n\n90\n00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:02.880\nWe do have properties of the server\nthat we can look at the instance here.\n\n91\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.152\nWe can see the interfaces, what IP\naddresses are being used to be able\n\n92\n00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:10.846\nto listen to and\nultimately provide DNS services through.\n\n93\n00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.172\nAnd you'll see we have both\nour IPV6 interfaces here,\n\n94\n00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:16.420\nas well as our IPV4 interfaces.\n\n95\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.850\nSo we do have two IPV4 and\ntwo IPV6 interfaces here so\n\n96\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.790\nwe can see that we have those bound.\n\n97\n00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.630\nNow we could say listen on all IP\naddresses, essentially any IP that's on or\n\n98\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.480\nany interface that's on the system.\n\n99\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.016\nOr we can be specific and\nsay just use this list here.\n\n100\n00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:34.556\nAnd I can make some choices and\neither select or unselect and maybe add or\n\n101\n00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:36.570\nremove interfaces if that was the case.\n\n102\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.353\nSo, I can bind interfaces and\nbe selective.\n\n103\n00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:41.535\nI do have the ability to\ndeal with forwarding.\n\n104\n00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:46.010\nWe talked about the ability for DNS\nserver to forward resolution request or\n\n105\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.120\nqueries out to another server\nthat may be authoritative for\n\n106\n00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.810\nsomething that we're looking for.\n\n107\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.220\nWe can essentially pass\nthat query to the server.\n\n108\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.770\nIt'll do a lookup if it doesn't know\nit can use forwarding if that has been\n\n109\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.510\nspecified and\nset up to pass that query on.\n\n110\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.590\nSo forwarding would be configured here,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.230\nAnd notice we talked about route hints,\nas well.\n\n112\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.515\nUse route hints if no browsers or\nno forwarding, rather, are available.\n\n113\n00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.157\nI spoke about route hints in\nthe last episode as well.\n\n114\n00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:12.815\nTalked about the root servers and\nthe root hints file.\n\n115\n00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:16.926\nAnd you see we can go in here and specify\nthat we want to use route hints to forward\n\n116\n00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:19.345\nif no forwarders are actually available.\n\n117\n00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:22.325\nBut we can add in, you'll see here\na list of forwarding servers and\n\n118\n00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.825\nindicate what we wanna be able to do for\nthat.\n\n119\n00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:28.250\nSo we have the ability here to be able\nto modify the list that's here and\n\n120\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.500\nthen use additional ones as needed.\n\n121\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.320\nWe can specify advanced settings here.\n\n122\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.860\nWe can go in, we can take a look at,\nby checking off, enabling or\n\n123\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.110\ndisabling certain things.\n\n124\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.420\nCherokee, I know you mentioned\nround-robining as one of the options that\n\n125\n00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.460\npotentially would help us to scale DNS,\nin the last episode.\n\n126\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.750\nThat is turned on by default, and you can\nsee it's enabled here on the Advance tab,\n\n127\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.870\nbut notice we could turn it off.\n\n128\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.134\nI think you actually referred to it as\nthe poor man's load balancing, right?\n\n129\n00:05:54.134 --> 00:05:55.331\nIs what you called it.\n\n130\n00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.760\nSo we can enable round-robin,\nand you'll see that here.\n\n131\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.150\nNet mask ordering, we'll be talking\nabout some of these features and\n\n132\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.650\nwhat they are in upcoming conversations.\n\n133\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.360\nWe could secure the cache\nagainst pollution.\n\n134\n00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.045\nI mentioned one of the ways we would be\nconcerned from a security perspective,\n\n135\n00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:11.690\nabout the way security works\nis the idea of the cache being\n\n136\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.580\nmanipulated by a bad actor.\n\n137\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.340\nThat checkbox allows us to\nenable certain protections\n\n138\n00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.710\nthat will prevent the registering\nof DNS records that are not\n\n139\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.750\nseeing this coming from a trusted source.\n\n140\n00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.030\nSo that would help us to prevent\nthe ability for that actor to get in and\n\n141\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.720\nmanipulate the DNS entries\nwithout our knowledge.\n\n142\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.225\nWe could pair that with something\nlike DNSSec, short for DNS Security,\n\n143\n00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.164\nwe'll talk about that in\nan upcoming conversation as well.\n\n144\n00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:39.111\nAnd DNSSec will let us digitally sign our\nresource records and add some new records\n\n145\n00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:43.220\nto the mix, brand new records that\nare part of the DNSSec solution.\n\n146\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.776\nAnd by digitally signing those records,\nvalidating the proof of origin or\n\n147\n00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:50.389\nthe point of origin, telling us they're\ncoming from a trusted source, and\n\n148\n00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.510\nproviding integrity to ensure\nthose records are accurate.\n\n149\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.580\nBy using DNSSec, we're further securing,\nfurther locking down our DNS server.\n\n150\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.760\nEnsuring to the best of our ability,\nnothing's 100% guaranteed, of course,\n\n151\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.400\nbut to the best of our ability overcoming\nmany of the common pitfalls and\n\n152\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.830\ntraps that may occur.\n\n153\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.900\nThat we are likely to be able to say\nthat these records are authoritative.\n\n154\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.726\nThey have not been modified,\nthey are coming from a trusted source.\n\n155\n00:07:13.726 --> 00:07:15.651\nAnd that we can trust\nthe resolution that occurs and\n\n156\n00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.635\ninteract with those individuals or\nthose systems.\n\n157\n00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:20.864\nAnd know they're trustworthy,\nthis provides a higher level of integrity,\n\n158\n00:07:20.864 --> 00:07:22.314\nand a higher level of protection.\n\n159\n00:07:22.314 --> 00:07:24.683\nSo it's gonna be important for\nus to know about that.\n\n160\n00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:28.176\nSo we could set that all up here,\nwe can go in and\n\n161\n00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:31.950\nwe can set up the ability\nto be able to fail unload.\n\n162\n00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.890\nIf a bad zone data information\nis provided, if we have\n\n163\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.210\ndata that looks corrupted, we can fail\nthat load and not resolve that zone.\n\n164\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.753\nSo there's a lot of different\nthings we can do here.\n\n165\n00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:43.493\nOur root hints as you can see,\nthe default root hints directory,\n\n166\n00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:47.165\nthe folder rather, or excuse me,\nthe file there is provided for\n\n167\n00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:50.910\nthe common root servers on\nthe Internet are gonna be listed here.\n\n168\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.666\nRemember, we talked about the fact\nthere are 13 of them out there and\n\n169\n00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:56.623\nyou could see they all start with a letter\ndesignation by going A through M.\n\n170\n00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:58.698\nAnd they have the associated IP addresses.\n\n171\n00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:02.014\nYears ago you would look at this, and\nyou would see all of these would be IPv4.\n\n172\n00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:05.004\nBut now you're seeing a lot of these\nare listed as IPv6 addresses, so\n\n173\n00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.470\njust kind of interesting.\n\n174\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.179\nThat you can see that, and\nyou'll see it's a mixture here.\n\n175\n00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:10.309\nSo we have all that.\n\n176\n00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:13.540\nWe do have our debug\nlogging available to us.\n\n177\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.820\nLogging is such a critical part\nof what we do in any application,\n\n178\n00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.340\nany service, for any reason.\n\n179\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.660\nWe've talked about the value\nof logging in other episodes.\n\n180\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.450\nBut we do have logging\ncapabilities here for DNS.\n\n181\n00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.530\nBut don't confuse general logging,\n\n182\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.780\nwhat we would call event logging\nover here on the other tap.\n\n183\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.520\nDon't confuse this with debug logging.\n\n184\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.310\nThe two are distinctly different,\nthey both are logging.\n\n185\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.900\nIt's a question of what we're logging and\nthe amount of data,\n\n186\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.780\nthe amount of information that\ncomes in as a result of the log.\n\n187\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.900\nDebug logging is you'll see not turned\non unless we enable it, log packets for\n\n188\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.440\ndebugging.\n\n189\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.990\nSo we have to first of all enable that.\n\n190\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.020\nAnd then you have to choose,\n\n191\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.460\nas you can see when I enable it, there are\ncheck boxes that can be turned on or off.\n\n192\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.990\nI have to choose what level of detail\nI want in the packet information,\n\n193\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.610\nhow much information I want to\ngrab as a result of my logging and\n\n194\n00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.070\nwhere I then want to place the log\nfile and how big the log file will be.\n\n195\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.020\nWe do set a maximum because these\nlogs can get very big very quickly.\n\n196\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.280\nDebug logging is essentially\nlogging in verbose mode,\n\n197\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.370\nwe're grabbing almost everything or\neverything you can see by default,\n\n198\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.070\nalmost every check box is selected\nunless we were to go and modify that.\n\n199\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.070\nAnd we're grabbing a great deal of data,\nand\n\n200\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.330\ndoing so for\nwhatever period of time we would specify.\n\n201\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.570\nNormally, now you see we don't\nspecify time period here,\n\n202\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.860\ninstead specify a maximum size that log\nwill go until we either come in here and\n\n203\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.680\nturn this off or we hit the maximum\nsize of which case it would stop.\n\n204\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.560\nSo we do often set up and turn on debug\nlogging when we're troubleshooting,\n\n205\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.630\ntrying to figure out what may be wrong.\n\n206\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.060\nAnd that can be one thing that we wanna\nlook at with regards to troubleshooting,\n\n207\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.850\njust an interesting little aside here.\n\n208\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.770\nWe'll go back to our DNS server\ncommandlet for just a minute.\n\n209\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.720\nWanna show you one in particular,\nyou may or may not be aware of\n\n210\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.250\ncalled Get-DnsServerStatistics, and\nI've actually gonna break it on it, and\n\n211\n00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.330\nwhen just drill down on\nit from the list here.\n\n212\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.305\nBut when you look at DnsServerStatistics,\nyou'll get DnsServer,\n\n213\n00:10:02.305 --> 00:10:07.250\nyou get DnsServerZones,\nServerTrust, Server our ST,\n\n214\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.200\nright there, Get-DnsServerStatistics.\n\n215\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.070\nYou may never have seen this one before,\nbut\n\n216\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.370\nwe're gonna have DnsServerStatistics for\nzone usage, and so\n\n217\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.120\nmaybe an interesting one for\nyou just to play around with.\n\n218\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.038\nGet-DnsServerStatistics help us to gather\ninformation on usage of our zones, and\n\n219\n00:10:23.038 --> 00:10:27.416\nactually gives us information that\nmay be valuable for troubleshooting.\n\n220\n00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:30.724\nSo, one of the commandlets that you may or\nmay not be aware of,\n\n221\n00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:35.369\nmay want to think about using, you would\ndo something like Get-DnsServerStatistics\n\n222\n00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:39.629\nwith a zone name parameter, specify\nthe name of the zone, you know ITPro.TV,\n\n223\n00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:41.947\nPracticeLabs.com, whatever it may be.\n\n224\n00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:44.606\nAnd then you would specify\nthe kind of statistics you want,\n\n225\n00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:48.173\nzone query statistics, zone transfer\nstatistics, zone update statistics,\n\n226\n00:10:48.173 --> 00:10:49.680\nyou have a couple options there.\n\n227\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.140\nAnd you would then be able\nto get information back and\n\n228\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.570\nsee information that can help you\nto understand whether the zone is\n\n229\n00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.390\nbeing optimized or\nwhether it's being managed properly.\n\n230\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.510\nMaybe there's a problem,\nmaybe it failed on load,\n\n231\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.300\nyou know things like\nthat would be helpful so\n\n232\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.610\nit may just be some interesting\ninformation for you to take a look at.\n\n233\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.370\nDNS Logging and Diagnostics in general.\n\n234\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.710\nSince we're here and talking about it\nmay be good for you to think about, and\n\n235\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.440\nthere are some information on how to\nconfigure, set this up and manage this.\n\n236\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.010\nSo, may just be valuable for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n237\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.150\nSo we were just taking a look at the fact\nwe can enable debug logging, we can also\n\n238\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.200\nenable, I'm just gonna go back and turn\nthat off cuz we don't want to enable that.\n\n239\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.700\nWe could also enable event logging, you'll\nsee by default we are logging all events.\n\n240\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.630\nAgain, this will be just the default\nout of the box configuration can\n\n241\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.000\nof course go back and\nmodify this if needed.\n\n242\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.420\nBut we can specify hey don't bother\nlogging at all, maybe just errors,\n\n243\n00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.660\nerrors and warnings or all.\n\n244\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.040\nAnd we would then be able to\nlook at our event viewer.\n\n245\n00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.260\nSo go to the event logs and\n\n246\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.850\nlook at the DNS log and\nwe'd be able to see what's going on there.\n\n247\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.210\nSo we would have that capability.\n\n248\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.780\nNo, have nothing to say.\n\n249\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.500\nOkay, I thought there was\nmaybe something there.\n\n250\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.390\nWe do have monitoring,\nthe ability to go in and\n\n251\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.190\nyou can see here specify a test type.\n\n252\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.920\nThis is nice because this lets us\ndo a little inline troubleshooting\n\n253\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.435\nof the DNS configuration.\n\n254\n00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:03.275\nWe can say, hey,\nrun a simple query against the DNS server,\n\n255\n00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:06.585\nrun a recursive query, and then we can\ngo ahead and test to see whether or\n\n256\n00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:10.115\nnot that resolution is happening and if it\ndoesn't that gives us an indication we may\n\n257\n00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:13.642\nhave something wrong with one or more zone\nfiles or the configuration to the server.\n\n258\n00:12:13.642 --> 00:12:15.952\nMaybe we unbound the IP addresses or\n\n259\n00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:19.552\nthe interfaces where resolution would take\nplace and we're not talking to anybody.\n\n260\n00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:20.732\nMaybe our zones are not loading.\n\n261\n00:12:20.732 --> 00:12:22.512\nThere's different things that could go on.\n\n262\n00:12:22.512 --> 00:12:25.640\nWe'll be able to run this just as\na quick diagnostic, literally enable it,\n\n263\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.240\nyou had test now and boom it comes\nback and tells you what's going on.\n\n264\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.340\nSo it would be valuable for\nyou just to look at the settings in here.\n\n265\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.450\nBy the way, every one of these\nsettings is going to be stuff that you\n\n266\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.950\nwould have seen going back to\nmany generations of DNS servers.\n\n267\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.250\nThis is not anything that is\nradically new, the support for\n\n268\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.290\nIPV6 is obviously a newer feature,\nand some of the newer versions of\n\n269\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.930\nthe Windows operating system, so\ncertainly in server 12, 1202, and\n\n270\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.790\nserver 16 you would see\nIPV6 capable support here.\n\n271\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.380\nBut you're going back to server 2008,\nserver 2003,\n\n272\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.580\nDNS servers would have had these\ntabs it would have looked like this.\n\n273\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.260\nIt would have done and unable many of\nthese features exactly the same way.\n\n274\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.040\nSo this is not gonna be\na bunch of new stuff.\n\n275\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.720\nBut it is gonna be continuing the\nevolution of our ability to manage DNS,\n\n276\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.420\nand so we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n277\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.880\nThat's up with the server itself.\n\n278\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.990\nLet's go in and let's just talk about\ncreating a new zone for a minute.\n\n279\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.180\nLet's just talk about what we can do here.\n\n280\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.830\nBut before I do that,\nI wanna show you what our current\n\n281\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.560\nzone looks like our folder look up\nzone is active directory integrated.\n\n282\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.620\nJust want to show you the settings on\nthat, show you what that looks like.\n\n283\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.730\nWe can take it out of\nActive Directory integration and\n\n284\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.270\nput it back just by\nchanging some settings.\n\n285\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.390\nAnd then we'll create a new zone just\nto show you how that works as well.\n\n286\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.880\nSo we do have our forward lookup zone\nhere, we do have our PracticeLabs.com\n\n287\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.120\nzone, we do have some of those resource\nrecords that you heard me mention and\n\n288\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.080\ntalk about in our last episode.\n\n289\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.840\nWe have our host records here for\n\n290\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.850\nIPv4, you can see them\nlisted here with a single a.\n\n291\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.950\nWe do have our Name Server Record or\nNS Record is here,\n\n292\n00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.940\ngiving us the listing of which DNS server\nor servers, in this case only one, but\n\n293\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.690\nperhaps more than one server\nis gonna be able to manage and\n\n294\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.310\nbe able to interact with information\nthat provide DNS services for us.\n\n295\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.740\nIt's what name server records specify.\n\n296\n00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.040\nWe do have our SOA record,\nyou mentioned that one as well, Cherokee.\n\n297\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.660\nOur SOA record start of\nauthority is our record,\n\n298\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.230\nand we only have one SOA record per zone.\n\n299\n00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.300\nBut that's gonna give us\nthe ability to manage that zone,\n\n300\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.930\nas we mentioned authoritatively.\n\n301\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.060\nLet us speak on behalf of the zone and\nsay, yeah, I do have knowledge of it.\n\n302\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.780\nHere's the resource record, whatever\nrecord it maybe you were looking for\n\n303\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.960\nlet me get that for\nyou because I control it and\n\n304\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.830\nown it and\nI can actually speak to what's in there.\n\n305\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.570\nSo the SOA record registers the authority\nto manage the zone name space in\n\n306\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.300\nthis case.\n\n307\n00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.180\nSo we see that.\n\n308\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.550\nWe don't have any of those other records.\n\n309\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.800\nWe mentioned, but\nit wouldn't be hard to create them.\n\n310\n00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.555\nAll we would have to do\nis right click here.\n\n311\n00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:44.194\nAnd we do have the most common ones,\nthere's two or three we mentioned\n\n312\n00:14:44.194 --> 00:14:47.165\nthe see name, the alias record I\nmentioned, the NX record, they're there.\n\n313\n00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:50.637\nBut if we don't see record types\nthat we want, in other words,\n\n314\n00:14:50.637 --> 00:14:54.650\nyou know these are not the ones we want,\njust other new records, right?\n\n315\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.490\nWe just basically have an option there.\n\n316\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.540\nWe just go in and\nwe hit the pick list here and\n\n317\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.600\nwe can see that there are quite\na number of resource records.\n\n318\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.140\nAs I scroll down I can see all sorts of\ndifferent ones that would be here, and\n\n319\n00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.030\nI just have to choose the appropriate one.\n\n320\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.940\nYou'll see a host record a or\nquadruple a, right?\n\n321\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.210\nFor IPv6, as we talked about,\nwe could provide one of those,\n\n322\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.940\nand if we wanna create a host record,\nI just come here, and\n\n323\n00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.950\nI specify what that is, and I can choose\nhow to do that, it's very straightforward.\n\n324\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:25.570\nSo we can go in and create any kind\nof record including our DNS key and\n\n325\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.740\nsome of the DNS sec records that would\nbe enabled or will be allowed for\n\n326\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.750\nus to be using,\nall of them are here, right?\n\n327\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.200\nSo there are quite a number of them,\nand you can go in and\n\n328\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.640\nspecify what those will be so people\nare right-clicking and choosing new.\n\n329\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.190\nSo we can do that, we can also go in here,\n\n330\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.560\nyou'll see, and right-click\nanywhere in here in the interface.\n\n331\n00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.180\nI'm kinda behind myself there,\nlet me just do it over here.\n\n332\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.990\nBut you'll see if I just go to an empty\nwhite area here that's not gonna\n\n333\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.200\nallow me to select a record or something\njust clean area inside the console.\n\n334\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.260\nI don't have to click, in other words,\nthe zone file, just like any\n\n335\n00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.300\nof these interface, just right click\nanywhere and I get the same menu.\n\n336\n00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.540\nSo I can just go ahead and\ndo that from anywhere.\n\n337\n00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.179\nSo we can go in here, let's just take\na look at the properties of our zone.\n\n338\n00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:07.804\nLet's go here and bring this up And\nwe can see, just move this over and center\n\n339\n00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:12.530\nit just a little bit, that on the general\ntab we do have the status of the zone.\n\n340\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.340\nIt is running, so we could Pause that,\nremove that from active use and\n\n341\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.000\nperhaps stop name resolution for a period\nof time given whatever we may want to do.\n\n342\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.430\nMaybe we're troubleshooting,\nmaybe we have to do something,\n\n343\n00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.450\njust want to take it down for\na little bit of time.\n\n344\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.070\nActive Directory Integrator, I mentioned\nthe zone is Active Directory integrated.\n\n345\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.140\nWe do have different zone types,\n\n346\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.710\nand we'll take a look at it as when\nwe run the wizard in just a minute.\n\n347\n00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.120\nBut you could see here we do have\nPrimary zone, which is what we're using\n\n348\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.180\nto specify that this is the zone\nthat will be authoritative,\n\n349\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.620\ngive us the information for\nthe name space.\n\n350\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.370\nActive Directory integration implies\nthat we're setting this zone up on\n\n351\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.450\nActive Directory domain controllers, ADDS\nsystems, Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n352\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.910\nAnd we're hosting DNS on\nthe Active Directory domain controllers,\n\n353\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.940\nintegrating DNS in other words into\nthe AD space, having to become\n\n354\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.070\npart of the replication cycle, part of\nthe backup cycle of our maintenance and\n\n355\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.971\nmanagement and\ngrooming of the Active Directory overall,\n\n356\n00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:10.310\nmakes it much more reliable,\nhighly available and resilient for us.\n\n357\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.370\nSo that way if every domain\ncontroller is running DNS and I have,\n\n358\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.020\nlet's say, hypothetically ten DNS\nservers in my architecture globally?\n\n359\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.650\nWell, I have ten domain controllers\nthat are running DNS and\n\n360\n00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:24.002\nevery one of them can interact with and\nspeak to this particular information.\n\n361\n00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:28.650\nCuz as I create a new global, or\nexcuse me, a new domain controller, and\n\n362\n00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.770\nI set it up I'm gonna have this DNS\ninformation when I bring DNS up.\n\n363\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.030\nI'll be able to have these zones there and\nevery one of them can speak to\n\n364\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.630\nthis information so it creates that\nreliability And that resiliency for us,\n\n365\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.730\nbuilt in high availability if you wanna\nthink of it that way, right, just by\n\n366\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.760\nspreading our DNS information around and\nputting it onto every domain controller.\n\n367\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.350\nSo we do have that capability, Primary\nzones, store the copy of the zone file\n\n368\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.050\nthat could be updated directly,\nessentially readable, writeable.\n\n369\n00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.570\nSo they are the zone files that could be\nedited and are gonna be the master files\n\n370\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:01.290\nthat will then be able to be used for name\nresolution but can be updated and managed.\n\n371\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.790\nThe secondary zone files,\n\n372\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.110\nthink of them as read only,\nthey're copies of our Primary zone file.\n\n373\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.580\nThey cannot be updated directly but\nthey are copies from the primary.\n\n374\n00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.940\nSo we have a secondary server somewhere\nthat's not gonna directly allow for\n\n375\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.600\nupdates to the zone but needs a copy\nof it to do localname resolution.\n\n376\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.185\nMaybe in the remote office where we're\nnot gonna actually be registering this\n\n377\n00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.940\nsystem and\nbe actually doing any management, but\n\n378\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.380\nsimply want to be able to provide\nresources to those local users,\n\n379\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.000\nthen we would use a secondary zone\nwhich is a copy of the existing zone.\n\n380\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.370\nThis allows us to be able to create\na read only copy that is used simply for\n\n381\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.470\nresolution with new management.\n\n382\n00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.820\nSo that's what a secondary\nzone file would be.\n\n383\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.400\nWe also have our Stub zone.\n\n384\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.120\nStub zones are going to be a slimmed\ndown version of a secondary zone.\n\n385\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.530\nThey are read only, they are like\nsecondary zones in that respect.\n\n386\n00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.250\nBut a secondary zone is a complete and\nfull copy of the Primary zone.\n\n387\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.900\nIt has all the records,\nhas all the information.\n\n388\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.720\nIt is in every way a duplicate with the\none exception of it being a read only and\n\n389\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.210\nnot manageable version\nof our Primary zone.\n\n390\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.030\nBut a stub zone is a condensed down or\nshrinked down,\n\n391\n00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.095\nmodified, filtered version\nof a Secondary zone.\n\n392\n00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:09.955\nIt lists only a very small number\nof these resource records,\n\n393\n00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:14.815\nreally just acts as a sentinel kind of\nhanging out on the periphery somewhere.\n\n394\n00:19:14.815 --> 00:19:19.290\nAnd just points us back through some\nvery basic name resolution records\n\n395\n00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.880\nto where the zone information\ncan actually be found.\n\n396\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.800\nSo we tend to put Stub zones out in\nplaces where we don't want to expose DNS\n\n397\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.300\ninfrastructure directly,\nwhere we don't have the capability and\n\n398\n00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.530\nthe reality or the necessity to\nbe able to do direct management.\n\n399\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.620\nBut we want to direct\nremote users back in and\n\n400\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.980\nallow them to be able to do resolution.\n\n401\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.470\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n402\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.920\nthat Stub zone as you could see here,\ncopy of the zone containing only.\n\n403\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.200\nAnd I know it may be hard to see,\nbut name server SOA and\n\n404\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.150\npossibly what are known as glue A records,\nessentially it's\n\n405\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.140\njust certain host records that point\nback to systems that we have to resolve.\n\n406\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.350\nServer containing the sub zone is not\nauthoritative for this zone, right,\n\n407\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.130\nmeaning that the stub\nzone's not authoritative,\n\n408\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.670\nall it can do is say you know what?\n\n409\n00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.900\nI heard a rumor that if you\ngo over here to this address\n\n410\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.700\nyou'll be able to find\nthat information you want.\n\n411\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.380\nIt's almost like a back alley\nkind of conversation, right?\n\n412\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.985\nYou know dark scary corner,\nyou don't see people's faces, right?\n\n413\n00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:18.460\nAnd they say, hey you want some name\nresolution, hey go to this address, right?\n\n414\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.180\nAnd that's where you can find it.\n\n415\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.660\nAnd that's all a Stub zone does.\n\n416\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.350\nIt really just redirects you, it acts\nlike a proxy, it just say's hey let me\n\n417\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.500\njust give you this piece of information\nand I'm gonna re-direct you over there.\n\n418\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.850\nYou got to talk to the person you find\non the other side of that address and\n\n419\n00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.590\nthey're gonna be authority.\n\n420\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.370\nThey can answer your questions, right?\n\n421\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.230\nBut I can't tell you what the story is.\n\n422\n00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.050\nI just tell you where to\ngo to get the information.\n\n423\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.500\nThat's what a Stub zone does.\n\n424\n00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.480\nYou ever do that with your kids?\n\n425\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.090\nI can't tell you,\nyou gotta go talk to somebody else.\n\n426\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.140\n&gt;&gt; I do that with Alexa.\n\n427\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.980\n&gt;&gt; You do that with your daughter?\n\n428\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.080\nYou do, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.\n\n429\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.330\n&gt;&gt; No?\n&gt;&gt; Alexa the Amazon device.\n\n430\n00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.110\n&gt;&gt; With Alexa, with Alexa.\n\n431\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.240\n&gt;&gt; If there's a question I don't know,\nI'm like, I don't know but I'll ask Alexa.\n\n432\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.142\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you make Alexa the\nauthoritative source or voice of reason.\n\n433\n00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:55.648\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right.\n\n434\n00:20:55.648 --> 00:20:57.658\nSo you got another reason why technology\n\n435\n00:20:57.658 --> 00:20:59.283\nis insidious, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:20:59.283 --> 00:21:00.158\n&gt;&gt; All right, cuz if Alexa\n\n437\n00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:04.490\nis having a bad day that day and she's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah she has no answer column.\n\n438\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.490\n&gt;&gt; When I go talk to Cherokee you\nhave a vicious circle going on right?\n\n439\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.614\n&gt;&gt; And so out of also this\nscreen that we're on right here,\n\n440\n00:21:10.614 --> 00:21:14.740\nif you already have a, let's say you\nalready have a DNS infrastructure.\n\n441\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.460\nSometimes you don't see see that\nPrimary zone option, right?\n\n442\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.480\nSo when you're creating your zone\nif there's already a pre-existing?\n\n443\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.350\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe'll take a look at that in a sec.\n\n444\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.530\nWe're gonna run the wizard.\n\n445\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.216\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk\n\n446\n00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:24.830\nabout that in just a second.\n\n447\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.120\nJust wanna point something out.\n\n448\n00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.960\nWe talked about the fact that this\nis Active Directory integrated but\n\n449\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.470\nwhat we do to specify that,\njust a checkbox at the bottom.\n\n450\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.030\nI just didn't get to mention that one, how\nwe create an active directory integrated\n\n451\n00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.870\nzone, assuming DNS is on\nthe domain controller,\n\n452\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.415\nwhich it is as we talked about,\nis this checkbox right here.\n\n453\n00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:43.910\nCuz it's not an option where\nit says by the way, third or\n\n454\n00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.120\nfourth radio button active\ndirectory integrated.\n\n455\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.050\nIt's just a checkbox that takes your\nPrimary zone and allows you then to\n\n456\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.820\nspecify that you will active directory\nintegrate that primary zone.\n\n457\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.440\nSo this check box right\nhere is essentially what\n\n458\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.420\ncreates that after directory integration.\n\n459\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.290\nJust so that we know that.\n\n460\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.490\nSo we've talked about those, right?\n\n461\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.220\nBefore we do anything else let's just\nmake sure we're just good on this\n\n462\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.100\ntab right here.\n\n463\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.070\nI know you want to bring\nin another thought process.\n\n464\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.128\nSo give me a second before we\ncloud the issue with craziness.\n\n465\n00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:12.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna just clarify what\n\n466\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.860\nwe're doing here and then we'll be\nhappy to deal with, and I'm gonna be-\n\n467\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.995\n&gt;&gt; What's the deal with you?\n\n468\n00:22:15.995 --> 00:22:17.160\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm clairvoyant.\n\n469\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.180\nI'm gonna say you're gonna\n\n470\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.590\nask about something like read\nonly domain controllers.\n\n471\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.400\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guess.\n\n472\n00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.170\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not?\n\n473\n00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:22.782\n&gt;&gt; That's not it.\n\n474\n00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:23.295\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n475\n00:22:23.295 --> 00:22:24.750\n&gt;&gt; I would have asked that if I was you.\n\n476\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.635\nBut let me just give me one second.\n\n477\n00:22:26.635 --> 00:22:27.275\nWe'll talk, we'll take\n\n478\n00:22:27.275 --> 00:22:28.505\ncare of whatever you want to talk about.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n479\n00:22:28.505 --> 00:22:29.505\n&gt;&gt; So all DNS servers,\n\n480\n00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:30.740\nwhere are we replicating to?\n\n481\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.210\nThis is the other part of\nActive Directory integration.\n\n482\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.340\nOr at least what we have to think, right,\nwhen we're dealing with Active Directory.\n\n483\n00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.510\nWhen we do a zone file,\nwe set it up, right?\n\n484\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.100\nWe're gonna make a copy of it, especially\nif it's Active Directory Integrator,\n\n485\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.365\nwe're gonna send it out.\n\n486\n00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:47.815\nFrom our primary source to other\nActive Directory enabled domain controller\n\n487\n00:22:47.815 --> 00:22:50.875\nDNS servers, or if it's a secondary\nzone we're gonna create,\n\n488\n00:22:50.875 --> 00:22:52.595\nwe have to replicate that and\ncopy that off.\n\n489\n00:22:52.595 --> 00:22:55.835\nSo we have to take a look here,\nall DNS servers in the domain.\n\n490\n00:22:55.835 --> 00:22:59.025\nYou'll see here when we're doing\nActive Directory integration for\n\n491\n00:22:59.025 --> 00:23:02.265\nour replication scope and we see this\nwhen we run the New Zone Wizard,\n\n492\n00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:03.580\nyou're gonna see this\nis one of the options.\n\n493\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.050\nWe'll take a look, but\n\n494\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.220\nchoose how you want that zone\ndata to be replicated out, right.\n\n495\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.590\nTo all DNS servers running,\nthe domain controllers are on,\n\n496\n00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.990\ndomain controllers in the forest,\nso at the forest level, right.\n\n497\n00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.790\nIt's all DNS servers running on\ndomain controller in this domain,\n\n498\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.560\nlimited to this domain, and or\n\n499\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.140\nthat all domain controllers in this\ndomain for Windows 2000 compatibility.\n\n500\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.470\nDon't see that very often, right?\n\n501\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.770\nBut essentially backwards compatible for\nolder systems, right?\n\n502\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.840\nSo we have a few options here.\n\n503\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.340\nWe can replicate at the forest\nlevel to all of the information,\n\n504\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.540\ngo out to all the domain\ncontrollers in the forest.\n\n505\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.785\nSo that every other name space\nthat would make up the forest,\n\n506\n00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:41.435\nmeaning the other trees and or\nthe other hierarchical child domains and\n\n507\n00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:43.605\nparent domains would be aware of this.\n\n508\n00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:47.105\nOr limit this to just our little\nslice of the forest, our name space,\n\n509\n00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:49.285\njust our domain, and replicate there.\n\n510\n00:23:49.285 --> 00:23:52.895\nSo we have options to consider depending\non what it is that we wanna do, right?\n\n511\n00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:54.205\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n512\n00:23:54.205 --> 00:23:58.327\nNow you're asking a question about-\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, yeah I think it's\n\n513\n00:23:58.327 --> 00:24:01.903\npretty cool, how if we take that\npre-existing active directory database,\n\n514\n00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:04.983\nand we can just kind of Merge it and\nmesh it together with the other,\n\n515\n00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:06.319\nwhen you think about zones.\n\n516\n00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:11.100\nI kind of relate them in my mind as a DNS\ndatabase, so you're pushing them together.\n\n517\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.830\nBut I did have a question.\n\n518\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.890\n&gt;&gt; That was the one I was talking\nabout that you were gonna ask.\n\n519\n00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.730\n&gt;&gt; Someone in the chat said does read-only\ndomain controller have a secondary or\n\n520\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.659\nis it still considered a primary zone?\n\n521\n00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:21.316\n&gt;&gt; That's what I said,\n\n522\n00:24:21.316 --> 00:24:23.575\nI thought you were going to ask about\nread-only domain, I did say that.\n\n523\n00:24:23.575 --> 00:24:25.740\nI'm on my tape,\nyou can actually go back and listen.\n\n524\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.880\nI said that I thought you\nwere going to ask about that.\n\n525\n00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.910\nSo read-only domain controller.\n\n526\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.770\nSo one more time?\n\n527\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.062\nThe question is about\nread-only domain controllers.\n\n528\n00:24:31.062 --> 00:24:33.757\n&gt;&gt; Does a read-only domain\ncontroller have a secondary or\n\n529\n00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:35.820\nis it still considered a primary zone?\n\n530\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.680\n&gt;&gt; It's actually an ozone according\nto what they wrote there almost.\n\n531\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're just reading in between the lines.\n\n532\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.309\n&gt;&gt; So if we have a read-only domain\ncontroller, the question is.\n\n533\n00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:45.655\nLet's actually step back and talk about\nwhat a read-only domain controller is for\n\n534\n00:24:45.655 --> 00:24:46.323\njust a minute for\n\n535\n00:24:46.323 --> 00:24:49.655\nthose of you that may or may not know\nwhat read-only domain controllers are.\n\n536\n00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:53.825\nThey're just what the name implies,\nthey're a copy, a replicated copy of\n\n537\n00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:59.245\nthe domain partition information for\nActive Directory.\n\n538\n00:24:59.245 --> 00:25:03.290\nAnd they're setup typically, we may\nput them in, again, a situation, maybe\n\n539\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.650\na remote office somewhere, where we're not\ngonna have oversight and maybe capability\n\n540\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.870\nto manage, but we do need to provide\nthe DNS, as part of that potentially.\n\n541\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.460\nWe do have to provide\ndomain look up services and\n\n542\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.040\ndomain services that allows us to\nauthenticate things like that.\n\n543\n00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.910\nBut we're not going to be\nable to create changes or\n\n544\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.180\nin any way modify the information\nin the domain controller there.\n\n545\n00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.510\nSo it’s a read only copy.\n\n546\n00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.496\nGo back to the concepts in\nNT4 of a PDC and a BDC,\n\n547\n00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:30.357\nif you are familiar with\ngoing back that far.\n\n548\n00:25:30.357 --> 00:25:33.891\nPrimary domain controllers, readable\nwritable, backup domain controllers,\n\n549\n00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:35.682\nback in the day would've been read only,\n\n550\n00:25:35.682 --> 00:25:38.375\nthey would've been read\nonly copies of the primary.\n\n551\n00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:42.463\nAnd so, it's the same general thought\nprocess, a read only domain controller\n\n552\n00:25:42.463 --> 00:25:45.881\nbecomes literally just a copy of\nthe main domain information, but\n\n553\n00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:47.545\nin a form that's not editable.\n\n554\n00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:51.920\nUsed only for us to be able to provide\nservices on point in that space, but\n\n555\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.230\nnot allow us to make any changes,\nmodify, edit, or manage there.\n\n556\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.860\nWe are going to be able to have\nfrom a push, we push down to\n\n557\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.850\nthat server from the primary down to\nthe read-only copy the information, but\n\n558\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.970\nthere's no communication\ncoming the other way back.\n\n559\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.860\nAnd as a result, we don't have\nany capability to work with that.\n\n560\n00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.634\nSo when we think about that and then we\nthink about whether we will have a copy of\n\n561\n00:26:14.634 --> 00:26:18.609\nthat information, we would have\ninformation for the DNS zone.\n\n562\n00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:21.530\nBut remember, it can't be a primary\nbecause there is no way for\n\n563\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.280\nus to make any changes, right?\n\n564\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.989\nOn a read-only domain controller we don't\nhave the ability to do any editing.\n\n565\n00:26:25.989 --> 00:26:30.296\nThere is no way for us to do anything cuz\nno updates can flow back out of that box,\n\n566\n00:26:30.296 --> 00:26:32.910\nbackup into the other domain controllers.\n\n567\n00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.180\nWe're purposely setting it up so\n\n568\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.752\nit's only a one way flow\ncoming down from the primary.\n\n569\n00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:39.520\nSo read-only domain controllers\nliterally are read only.\n\n570\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.960\nAnd as a result of that anything we have\nthere has to be a copy of the original,\n\n571\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.270\nbut not modifiable.\n\n572\n00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.920\nSo just want to keep that in mind.\n\n573\n00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.019\nSo secondary zones are what we would\nsee as opposed to primary zones,\n\n574\n00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:51.057\nif that specifically answers our question.\n\n575\n00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:51.860\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n576\n00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.810\nwelcome to the New Zone Wizard.\n\n577\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.790\nSo let's just click Next here.\n\n578\n00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.870\nWe're talking about that.\n\n579\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.150\nSo primary zones, you could see when\nwe create and/or secondary zones or\n\n580\n00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.630\nstub zones and of course Active Directory\nintegration, if we're doing that.\n\n581\n00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.140\nSo let's just create a primary\nzone here real quick.\n\n582\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.620\nGo ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n583\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.920\nThis is where that choice about\nreplication we were just taking a look at\n\n584\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.100\non the tab there.\n\n585\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.450\nWe looked at the properties comes in.\n\n586\n00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.690\nDo you want to replicate\nto just the domain?\n\n587\n00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.420\nDo you want to replicate to the forest?\n\n588\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.100\nWhat do we want to do?\n\n589\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.480\nSo let's just leave it as replicating\nto the domain, default choice.\n\n590\n00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.112\nNow, this is we're we get our ability to\ndo either a forward lookup zone, which is\n\n591\n00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:28.710\nwhat been looking up until now, or the\nreverse look up zone, which is down here.\n\n592\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.320\nReverse lookup zone are not\ncreated by default,\n\n593\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.327\nas I suggested in the first episode, but\nrather have to be created as part of\n\n594\n00:27:35.327 --> 00:27:38.300\nthe process whether we do it right now or\ndo it later.\n\n595\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.558\nJust right click on the reverse\nlookup zone folder and\n\n596\n00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:42.274\nsay I wanna create reverse lookup zone.\n\n597\n00:27:42.274 --> 00:27:45.677\nBut when we do initialize and\ncreate our lookup zone,\n\n598\n00:27:45.677 --> 00:27:48.180\nour forward lookup zone is our choice.\n\n599\n00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.470\nThat doesn't mean we can't choose\nto create a reverse lookup zone,\n\n600\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.740\nbut reverse lookup zones\nhave to be created.\n\n601\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.430\nThey are going to be manufactured, if you\nwill, just like forward lookup zones are.\n\n602\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.463\nSo we'll make our choice.\n\n603\n00:27:57.463 --> 00:28:00.480\nHere, I'll do a forward lookup\nzone just so we can see that.\n\n604\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.910\nWe'll give it a zone name,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n605\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.610\nSo let's just call this itpro.tv or\nwhatever it's gonna be,\n\n606\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.200\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n607\n00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.310\nAnd then are we going to allow\nonly secure dynamic updates?\n\n608\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.875\nThis is recommended if you're\ndoing Active Directory Integrated.\n\n609\n00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:19.447\nWhat this means is that when we do\nActive Directory Integrated Zones,\n\n610\n00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:20.462\nwe can do this.\n\n611\n00:28:20.462 --> 00:28:24.992\nAnd we're only gonna be able to register\nand allowed for updates if machine,\n\n612\n00:28:24.992 --> 00:28:27.710\ncomes online,\ngets its IP address from DHCP,\n\n613\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.940\nhas to create a host record to support its\nuse and its management into the domain.\n\n614\n00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.610\nIt can go to DNS and automatically\nregister or the DHCP server and\n\n615\n00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.430\nDNS server can talk and they can\nupdate information back and forth.\n\n616\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:45.115\nWill only allow objects that can validate\nwhat they are by having computer accounts.\n\n617\n00:28:45.115 --> 00:28:48.550\nIn this case, that are in the Active\nDirectory and validated only allow dynamic\n\n618\n00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.310\nupdates to occur from objects\nthat we trust and we know.\n\n619\n00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.360\nSo a stranger that's not in the Active\nDirectory, we don't have knowledge of,\n\n620\n00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.690\nwould not be able to register and\ncreate a record here.\n\n621\n00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.870\nThat's what this does,\nfurther locking down the DNS zones and\n\n622\n00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.580\nfurther securing ultimately\nour DNS infrastructure.\n\n623\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.350\nAllow both non-secure and\nsecure dynamic updates, right?\n\n624\n00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.110\nThis would allow us to open up updates, so\n\n625\n00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.680\nthat we can have clients that are not\nin the Active Directory, or not capable\n\n626\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.400\nof using Dynamic Update still in a secure\nway, rather, still be able to register.\n\n627\n00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.240\nAnd so this is important, because if\nyou're running mixed infrastructure.\n\n628\n00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.936\nIf you're running, for\ninstance, Linux web servers,\n\n629\n00:29:24.936 --> 00:29:28.715\nif you're running Apple desktops,\nMacintosh clients.\n\n630\n00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:31.991\nWhatever you may be doing that's\nnot Microsoft centric, but\n\n631\n00:29:31.991 --> 00:29:34.826\nyou need that information to\nshow up as host records or\n\n632\n00:29:34.826 --> 00:29:37.680\nadditional records in\nyour DNS infrastructure.\n\n633\n00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.990\nYou can't just simply do allow\nonly secure dynamic updates or\n\n634\n00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.280\nyou're not gonna get registrations for\nthose clients, they won't show up.\n\n635\n00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.980\nSo you have to understand that\nyou may have to use this choice\n\n636\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.620\nbecause you may have to allow these\nclients to be able to register.\n\n637\n00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.842\nOr you may create DNS infrastructure\nthat's not Active Directory integrated and\n\n638\n00:29:56.842 --> 00:29:58.689\nmanager it in that separate space.\n\n639\n00:29:58.689 --> 00:30:02.908\nThere's ways to do this, but if you're\ngoing to use Active Directory Integration,\n\n640\n00:30:02.908 --> 00:30:06.263\nyou may have to drop down the security\nsettings to accomplish that.\n\n641\n00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:09.540\nWe do say hey by the way, significant\nsecurity vulnerability because updates can\n\n642\n00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.280\nbe accepted from untrusted sources.\n\n643\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.650\nAs I was suggesting, that is the balancing\nact you have to weigh here and\n\n644\n00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.900\njust think about that very logically or\ndo not allow dynamic updates.\n\n645\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.460\nDon't allow dynamic updates of resource\nrecords, you must update them manually.\n\n646\n00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.100\nYou can just lock down the zone and\nsay, hey, I'll do the updates,\n\n647\n00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.790\nI'll go in there as the DNS admin.\n\n648\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.670\nI'll type in those records, but\nI'm gonna do it on my own or\n\n649\n00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.220\nsomebody's gonna do it on my behalf.\n\n650\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.830\nWe're not going to allow clients\nto auto register and populate,\n\n651\n00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.040\nwe're just going to do at control.\n\n652\n00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.330\nAnd that is traditionally with a lot of\ncompanies will do when they have these\n\n653\n00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.080\nconcerns because they're worried about\nthe liability of this middle choice here.\n\n654\n00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.070\nUnrestricted clients that may be\nup to no good, a rogue system,\n\n655\n00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.630\nsomebody brings one online and we may\nnot be able to stop it from registering,\n\n656\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.040\nwe may not realize it's there.\n\n657\n00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.300\nWe may want to manually control and\nlock down the zone files.\n\n658\n00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.540\nIt would be up to us to decide.\n\n659\n00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.010\nSo we'll just leave that as\nallow dynamic update securely.\n\n660\n00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:57.720\nNo big deal there.\n\n661\n00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.860\nClick Finish.\n\n662\n00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.330\nJust go ahead and finish that out.\n\n663\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.910\nLittle ITPro.TV folder gets created there.\n\n664\n00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.528\nAnd notice by the default the only two\nresource records that get created until we\n\n665\n00:31:07.528 --> 00:31:11.040\nstart populating either dynamically or\nwe start creating them on their own or\n\n666\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.786\na combination will be our SLA record.\n\n667\n00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:13.618\nWe always need that,\n\n668\n00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:17.030\nthat's the record that gives us authority\nto manage the zone we just created.\n\n669\n00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.640\nAnd the NS record that tells us what\nname server or name servers if we have\n\n670\n00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.415\nmore than one, are gonna be able to\nprovide resolution services for this zone.\n\n671\n00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:26.745\nThat's where we list all the DNS\nservers that would be available, right?\n\n672\n00:31:26.745 --> 00:31:28.415\nSo we're gonna have all that.\n\n673\n00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:29.945\nNow we can have a reverse lookup zone.\n\n674\n00:31:29.945 --> 00:31:33.305\nNotice, I don't have any\ncreated by default, as I said.\n\n675\n00:31:33.305 --> 00:31:36.695\nWhen we populate and set up our zone\nfiles, we're doing forward lookup zones,\n\n676\n00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:38.375\ntraditionally, so we have those.\n\n677\n00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.565\nIf we wanna create a reverse lookup zone,\ncan either run the wizard again or\n\n678\n00:31:41.565 --> 00:31:43.815\nwe can just right click here,\nessentially, and just do New Zone.\n\n679\n00:31:43.815 --> 00:31:45.585\nIt would be the same thing.\n\n680\n00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:50.438\nWhat we'd have to do is provide as\nyou can see here again the options,\n\n681\n00:31:50.438 --> 00:31:54.670\nPrimary, Secondary, Stub, and\nor Active Directory Integrated.\n\n682\n00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:03.096\nWe then would provide for our replication\noptions, Forest Level, Domain Level, etc.\n\n683\n00:32:03.096 --> 00:32:04.364\nAll that looks the same.\n\n684\n00:32:04.364 --> 00:32:07.519\nInstead of them saying\nhey name the zone for me.\n\n685\n00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:08.903\nTell me what I want to name it.\n\n686\n00:32:08.903 --> 00:32:11.470\nWe have to provide when\nwe do reverse lookups.\n\n687\n00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.330\nThe name but remember we're not providing\nthe name, we're providing the IP address.\n\n688\n00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.180\nCuz we're gonna provide the IP in reverse\nlookup, expect and get back the name.\n\n689\n00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.970\nAnd in forward lookup we provide the name,\nexpecting to get back the IP address.\n\n690\n00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.670\nThose IP addresses are all the host\nrecords of the various records and\n\n691\n00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.850\nthe resolution of those IP addresses\nin those resource records.\n\n692\n00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:33.112\nHere we're gonna start out by providing\nthe IP and then we'll obviously then be\n\n693\n00:32:33.112 --> 00:32:37.439\nable to provide what we call PTR, pointer\nrecords, which are the reverse lookup\n\n694\n00:32:37.439 --> 00:32:41.404\nrecords that we use, where we map\nthe IP address, either IPv4 or IPv6.\n\n695\n00:32:41.404 --> 00:32:42.405\nAs you can see,\n\n696\n00:32:42.405 --> 00:32:46.430\nwe map that to the associated\nname that we wanna resolve it to.\n\n697\n00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.250\nWhat ever that may be.\n\n698\n00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.620\nSo we would go through here.\n\n699\n00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.509\nEither IPv4, as you can see,\nprovide the network ID and or IPv6.\n\n700\n00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:56.930\nAnd you'll see,\nwe then just provide the address prefix.\n\n701\n00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.880\nYou guys, hopefully have gone through and\nwatched our IPv4 and\n\n702\n00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.620\nIPv6 overview episodes.\n\n703\n00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.740\nSo we talked about\nthe differences in the addresses.\n\n704\n00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:09.520\nThe IPv6 prefix is the first 64\nbits of the 128 bit address block.\n\n705\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.080\nThat's the equivalent of the network ID\nfor and IPv4 address, the network portion.\n\n706\n00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.610\nAnd an IPv4, that would just be\nthe network portion of the address.\n\n707\n00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.480\nWhatever that is, based on your subnet.\n\n708\n00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.900\nSo you would provide one of those.\n\n709\n00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.400\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe'd have our reverse lookup zone.\n\n710\n00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.470\nWe could also come in here as I talked\nabout with resource records, right?\n\n711\n00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.210\nAnd we can go in, and\nwe can as we talked about.\n\n712\n00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.929\nWe just come back here to other\nresource records, just to show you.\n\n713\n00:33:38.388 --> 00:33:41.753\nRight here, right, we have our\npointer record, our PTR record,\n\n714\n00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:44.589\nthose are the reverse lookup\nrecords that are created.\n\n715\n00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:47.490\nAnd when you create a resource record,\na PTR record,\n\n716\n00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.793\nyou're providing the host IP address,\nas we talked about.\n\n717\n00:33:50.793 --> 00:33:52.967\nAnd then mapping that to the host name.\n\n718\n00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:57.160\nAnd that gives us the ability to answer\na resolution request either from a forward\n\n719\n00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.830\nor a reverse process and\nwe can do that either way.\n\n720\n00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.560\nSo we can provide point of records\ninside the forward lookup zone,\n\n721\n00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.780\nfacilitating a lookup without having to\nhave a reverse lookup zone to do that.\n\n722\n00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.610\nOr we can create a whole reverse lookup\nzone with all the supporting records.\n\n723\n00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:12.660\nIt's up to us how to do that.\n\n724\n00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.687\nWe can actually just put PTR records into\nour forward lookup zone if necessary.\n\n725\n00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:19.483\nSo we can do all that,\ncreate those records or\n\n726\n00:34:19.483 --> 00:34:23.097\nthose resource record options\nalong with our zone types.\n\n727\n00:34:23.097 --> 00:34:27.777\nI did mention, just comeback here and\njust go to our properties here really\n\n728\n00:34:27.777 --> 00:34:32.233\nquickly that, [COUGH] we could go in and\nonce we specify Active Directory\n\n729\n00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:37.010\nintegrated as our option, let's just\nassume we had just created our zone.\n\n730\n00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.030\nActually, you know what I'll do,\nI'll do it on the IT Pro TV zone\n\n731\n00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.290\ncuz we already did it here, so\nlet's just stay with that one.\n\n732\n00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.120\nWe'll just go to Properties and do the\nsame thing here I mentioned that we could\n\n733\n00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.630\nchange the zone integration\ntype if we wanted to.\n\n734\n00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.320\nJust come back here to where we were.\n\n735\n00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.960\nWe can go to Properties, go to Type and\nchange this and so you know what?\n\n736\n00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.870\nI don't want it to be\nActive Directory integrated,\n\n737\n00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.030\njust uncheck that box, click OK.\n\n738\n00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.670\nDo you no longer want this to\nbe Active Directory integrated?\n\n739\n00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.660\nYes, I no longer want that to\nbe Active Directory integrated.\n\n740\n00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.120\nAnd then, I think you were mentioning cuz\nyou asked me back in the beginning of hey,\n\n741\n00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.990\nwhen we do that,\nwe don't see our zone file.\n\n742\n00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.430\nRight under his own file name,\nyou asked about that.\n\n743\n00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.070\nI said we're gonna get to that, but we\njust have to make sure we just go through\n\n744\n00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.860\nthe logic of how we create the zone.\n\n745\n00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.340\nAnd you could see once I\nunchecked that box and\n\n746\n00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.570\ntake it out of Active Directory\nintegration mode and\n\n747\n00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.480\ncreate just a standard primary zone but\nnot in the Active Directory, hosted only\n\n748\n00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.750\non this local DNS server, is what we would\nsay this zone file is set up to do now.\n\n749\n00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.388\nWe actually get a change here,\nand we see the zone file name.\n\n750\n00:35:31.388 --> 00:35:33.710\nIt's gonna be whatever\nthe name of the zone is .dns.\n\n751\n00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.970\nWe would then go to the DNS\nstructure inside the directory.\n\n752\n00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.969\nSo go in, you know, drill in,\nsee Windows System 32 etcetera.\n\n753\n00:35:39.969 --> 00:35:41.222\nGo all the way through and\n\n754\n00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:45.550\nwe would see that there's actually a file\nthere called IT Pro in this case .TV.DNS.\n\n755\n00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.140\nIt's a text file we could\nactually open that up and\n\n756\n00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.290\nwe could actually see what's going on.\n\n757\n00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.150\nAnd by the way,\npeople don't often know this,\n\n758\n00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.160\nyou could actually edit that\nzone file if you wanted to.\n\n759\n00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.660\nNot recommended by the way, but could\nedit that zone file to create records,\n\n760\n00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.370\nif you chose to and just save it back.\n\n761\n00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.320\nAnd you would actually be able to\npopulate those records from the notepad\n\n762\n00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.840\nfiles as opposed to creating\nthem that we did here, right?\n\n763\n00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.850\nAnd that's I think if I'm not mistaken you\nwere asking about that earlier, correct?\n\n764\n00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.140\n&gt;&gt; No, I was just thinking,\nyou know that's kind of how they,\n\n765\n00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.370\nhow like other Linux Nix based\nDNS solutions just kinda work.\n\n766\n00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.940\nIts you see that command line type\ninterface there, so we're searching-\n\n767\n00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.010\n&gt;&gt; When they're not in Active Directory\n\n768\n00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.110\nbecause they don't have Active Directory\nintegration, absolutely, all right.\n\n769\n00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.580\nSo, let's put this back just to\nshow you that we can do that.\n\n770\n00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.940\nSo, if we wanna change it again.\n\n771\n00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.030\nYou'll see here just go back, right?\n\n772\n00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.800\nJust simply check off the box.\n\n773\n00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.720\nClick OK.\nAre you sure you want to do that?\n\n774\n00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.950\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n775\n00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.150\nPut it back, right?\n\n776\n00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.700\nAnd then data stored in Active Directory.\n\n777\n00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.370\nIt's back where it was.\n\n778\n00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.300\nAnd so we can easily go back and forth.\n\n779\n00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.810\nVery, very simple to do that.\n\n780\n00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.620\nWe do have our start of\nauthority information.\n\n781\n00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.900\nRemember we have the record, but\n\n782\n00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.760\nthen we actually have the start\nof authority information.\n\n783\n00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.430\nThe serial number that gives\nus the ability to manage\n\n784\n00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.130\nour primary server\nresponsible information.\n\n785\n00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.760\nIn terms of a responsible person.\n\n786\n00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.070\nOther refresh intervals.\n\n787\n00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.150\nThe TTL for the record.\n\n788\n00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.540\nJust general information.\n\n789\n00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.580\nWe have our name server list.\n\n790\n00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.470\nSo this mirrors what our NS records are.\n\n791\n00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.610\nWe could add name servers here.\n\n792\n00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:07.260\nWe do have our wins integration, if we're\ngoing to use wins to do forward lookups,\n\n793\n00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.230\nwe can integrate DHCP in wins with DNS and\n\n794\n00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.780\nprovide for\ninformation sharing among them.\n\n795\n00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.930\nSo we can do that if necessary.\n\n796\n00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.840\nWe do have our zone transfers here.\n\n797\n00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.880\nAnd we do not allow zone\ntransfers by default.\n\n798\n00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.500\nThis, again,\nis a security thought process.\n\n799\n00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.730\nDepending on which version of\nWindows you would have been using,\n\n800\n00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.670\nat certain points,\nwe actually did allow zone transfers.\n\n801\n00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.630\nAnd we did allow them, unfortunately, to\nsystems that we did not necessarily know,\n\n802\n00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.540\nwhich was very insecure,\nled to a lot of problems with security.\n\n803\n00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.370\nWe fixed that, but\nyou go back to NT4, 2000,\n\n804\n00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.360\nearly on, we were talking to strangers.\n\n805\n00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.660\nThat wasn't a good idea.\n\n806\n00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:46.100\nNow we don't allow zone transfers which\nmeans we're not gonna use the ability for\n\n807\n00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.200\na, either command line tool like\nnslookup or another system,\n\n808\n00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.910\nanother server somewhere.\n\n809\n00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.871\nSay request the copy of the zone file and\n\n810\n00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:56.266\nget one unless they're on the name\nserver list and authoritative.\n\n811\n00:37:56.266 --> 00:37:59.323\nAnd then we have said, yeah we wanna\nbe able to do business with you and\n\n812\n00:37:59.323 --> 00:38:00.549\nextend this information.\n\n813\n00:38:00.549 --> 00:38:05.271\nThis prevents us from able to get out all\nthe information that would be in the zone\n\n814\n00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:09.784\nfile, prevents hackers, bad hackers,\nfrom getting that information and\n\n815\n00:38:09.784 --> 00:38:10.928\nusing it against.\n\n816\n00:38:10.928 --> 00:38:13.856\nSo just want to make sure we\nare aware of that, if we did for\n\n817\n00:38:13.856 --> 00:38:17.680\nsome other reason you might want\nto do this, check off the box.\n\n818\n00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.050\nWe could then go ahead to specify\nwhatever server we want and\n\n819\n00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.810\nthen we would be able to\ntransfer it necessary.\n\n820\n00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:24.510\nNot a good idea.\n\n821\n00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.080\nAnd then as always we always\nhave security in there as well.\n\n822\n00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.552\nWe could specify who gets rights to and\ninteracts here.\n\n823\n00:38:30.552 --> 00:38:33.360\nJust the normal Windows security model,\nwe could do that also.\n\n824\n00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.450\nSo, just an overview on the interface\nhere, overview on the generalities around\n\n825\n00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.440\nthe DNS server, overview on how we would\ncreate zone files and interact with them.\n\n826\n00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.780\nObviously still a lot to do this.\n\n827\n00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.149\nA lot of stuff we just kinda pointed\nout and said hey, that's cool,\n\n828\n00:38:46.149 --> 00:38:47.075\nlet's come back to that.\n\n829\n00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:50.117\nHaving really got and everything yet,\nbut we're certainly gone and\n\n830\n00:38:50.117 --> 00:38:53.850\nfeel back of the layer on the DNS service\ninfrastructure, how we're managing it?\n\n831\n00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:54.720\nHow we use it?\n\n832\n00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.840\nAnd what we can do in order to\nbe able to interact with it.\n\n833\n00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this wasn't gonna\nbe a one episode kinda topic.\n\n834\n00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.320\nAnd I don't think it's really a two\nepisode kind of topic either.\n\n835\n00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.440\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n836\n00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.130\nWe have more information,\nDNS information headed your way.\n\n837\n00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.180\nBut for this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n838\n00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.230\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n839\n00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm

DNS\nquite a bit but we're not finished yet.\n\n9\n00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.221\nAnd back with us today in\nstudio we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:26.090\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.812\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.\nGlad\n\n12\n00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:29.940\nto be back spending time\nwith you talking about DNS.\n\n13\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.420\nWe're gonna continue our conversations.\n\n14\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.263\nWe've left off in our last\nepisode we've talked about and\n\n15\n00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.537\nwalk through most of\nthe areas of the console.\n\n16\n00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.025\nGave you a high level of thought\nprocess of what's going on there.\n\n17\n00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:42.654\nTalked about different zone types,\nour primary zone or secondary zone,\n\n18\n00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:45.413\nour stub zone,\nour Active Directory integrated zone.\n\n19\n00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:48.620\nWe talked about how zones are going to\nbe managed, took a look at the settings,\n\n20\n00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.490\nproperties, did all sorts of stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.030\nMentioned some troubleshooting tools, took\na look at some PowerShell commandlets,\n\n22\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.190\ntalked about various ways we can manage.\n\n23\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.890\nJust thought we'd review a couple\nof those quickly just to remind you\n\n24\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.900\nof where we're coming from and\nget back into the console.\n\n25\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.238\nWe did talk about, take a look with\nme here, we can quickly see and\n\n26\n00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:08.753\nwe'll go into the console\nhere in just a minute.\n\n27\n00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:13.663\nBut we did talk about the need for\nbeing able to go.\n\n28\n00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:17.043\nAnd looking at our PowerShell commandlets,\nshowed you where to find those.\n\n29\n00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:21.105\nBut I did mention the DNS server\nstatistics commandlet inparticular.\n\n30\n00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.460\nWe had talked about that,\nthe way we could use that.\n\n31\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.330\nWe drilled down and just took\na look at some of the commands or\n\n32\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.060\nthe parameters that would be available.\n\n33\n00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.210\nWe spoke about logging and diagnostics and\nbeing able to use debug logging.\n\n34\n00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.570\nI showed you how to set that up,\nevent logging.\n\n35\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.390\nWent through, we spoke about those things.\n\n36\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.318\nWe took a look at and talked about\nthe NS Lookup tool a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:40.685\nShowed you could right click and\n\n38\n00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:44.250\nopen up a command prompt that essentially\nis dedicated to the NS Lookup tool.\n\n39\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.230\nLike Netsh would be, we've demoed it,\nNetsh and talked about using it for\n\n40\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.310\nvarious things.\n\n41\n00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.760\nAnd we can go in and manage the DNS\nserver from the command prompt.\n\n42\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.290\nNow, you know, a lot of times these days,\nNS Lookup will, it's a command line tool.\n\n43\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.240\nIt's dedicated to DNS and\nsupports the management of it.\n\n44\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.003\nMore and more people are migrating\ntowards PowerShell with all the different\n\n45\n00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:04.334\ncommandlet's that are available.\n\n46\n00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:08.728\nAnd we can achieve the same end result\nby either looking at or using NS lookup,\n\n47\n00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.848\nby using PowerShell with\nthe DNS cammandlet support.\n\n48\n00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.540\nSo it's up to us to decide\nhow we want to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.220\nBut you may or may not have heard of\na tool called DNSLint, the utility for DNS\n\n50\n00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.141\nmanagement and diagnosis of configuration\nissues if something is gone wrong.\n\n51\n00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:25.790\nSo I thought I would just\nbring this one up here.\n\n52\n00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.984\nYou can see that we have\na little Microsoft Windows or,\n\n53\n00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:31.632\nexcuse me,\nMicrosoft web page you can go to.\n\n54\n00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:33.260\nAnd you see it's a Windows-based utility.\n\n55\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.680\nGot a little download\nlink right from here.\n\n56\n00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.900\nTells you how to get and\nuse the tool so you can go out and\n\n57\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.090\ntake a look at it,\nvery simple command line structure.\n\n58\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.545\nSome of the switches are right down here,\nDNSLint minus or rather slash D.\n\n59\n00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:48.665\nSlash AD, right?\n\n60\n00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:49.965\nSo different things.\n\n61\n00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:54.325\nSo we can go in and diagnose lame\ndelegations of the related DNS problems,\n\n62\n00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:58.175\nwe can look at user defined records on\nmultiple servers, get a list of them, so\n\n63\n00:02:58.175 --> 00:02:59.175\nquery for the list.\n\n64\n00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:03.415\nWe can go ahead and look at active\ndirectory based replication DNSLint AD.\n\n65\n00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.058\nWhich, you know I do use sometimes to\ntroubleshoot depending on what the nature\n\n66\n00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:06.816\nof what we're doing.\n\n67\n00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:10.156\nThey got some little syntax down here\nshowing you how the tool may be deployed,\n\n68\n00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:11.180\nwhat you may use it for.\n\n69\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.930\nSo you may wanna think about that.\n\n70\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.990\nI'll just go ahead and take a look.\n\n71\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.384\nWe've talked about the importance of\nipconfig, /displaydns, /flushdns,\n\n72\n00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:22.430\n/registerdns, switches, and\nfunctionality we can look to there.\n\n73\n00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.140\nSo we've talked about those as\ntroubleshooting tools or options.\n\n74\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.704\nWe've talked about monitoring on\nthe DNS server and looking at logging.\n\n75\n00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:32.567\nSo we've been through a lot of the\ndifferent areas where we would often go in\n\n76\n00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.710\nand think about being able to\ntroubleshoot and/or manage.\n\n77\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.300\nJust wanted to remind you about some\nof those as we're getting started.\n\n78\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.980\nWe do have on our DNS server, and\nI've got a little demo set up for\n\n79\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.490\nus here with two DNS servers.\n\n80\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.290\nTwo different domains that we can go\nahead and setup conditional forwarding,\n\n81\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.420\nwe'll take a look at that,\ntalk about how that works.\n\n82\n00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.970\nBut we have the ability on any server,\n\n83\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.840\njust to remind you of where we are,\nto go in on the server.\n\n84\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.140\nIn this case the Plaid SA 01 server,\nRight-click and remember,\n\n85\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.170\nwe can go in and\nwe can go to the properties, and\n\n86\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800\nwe can see a lot of the things\nwe were just talking about.\n\n87\n00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.660\nWe do have our forwards here, we have on\nthe advanced area the ability to enable\n\n88\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.185\nsome of the advance\nsecurity protections and\n\n89\n00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.905\nitems that may be valuable to us,\nset up automatic scavenging.\n\n90\n00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.635\nWe have the ability to deal with root\nhints we will be talking about that.\n\n91\n00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:21.395\nWe have debug logging and\nevent logging, monitoring.\n\n92\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:22.485\nRemember we have gone through and\n\n93\n00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:25.532\ntaken a look at how these things work in\nour prior episode and talked about them.\n\n94\n00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.801\nSo it is important just to remember\nthat we have these capabilities.\n\n95\n00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:32.112\nAnd these are some of the things that\nI was suggesting we may want to do in\n\n96\n00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:34.652\nsetting up logging in\nparticular would be valuable.\n\n97\n00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:37.230\nWe talked about why that could be so\nimportant.\n\n98\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.360\nAging and scavenging good to\nknow about that as well and\n\n99\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.340\nwe spoke about that fact that,\nthat would get rid of for\n\n100\n00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.160\nus the records that may have aged\nout that are no longer valid.\n\n101\n00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.090\nWe talked about integration of DHCP and\nWins with DNS in the last episode also and\n\n102\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.456\nsaid that as we went through the tabs.\n\n103\n00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:58.752\nWe talked about the various things\nwe could do on one of the zones,\n\n104\n00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.401\nas we looked at our zone.\n\n105\n00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:04.068\nLet's just go here, let's say to our\npractice IT zone and right-click and\n\n106\n00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:06.070\ngo to the properties of the zone.\n\n107\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.980\nWe saw that, remember, we have\nthe ability to integrate wins here,\n\n108\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.790\nwe talked about dynamic updates of\nrecords when we created the zone.\n\n109\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.790\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n110\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.120\nAre we trusting those clients and\nallowing them to dynamically update?\n\n111\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.720\nOr are we saying hey,\nmay or may not trust you?\n\n112\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.420\nMaybe want to lock the zone down,\ndo manual updates, not allow DNS to\n\n113\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.950\nbe able to do updates, rather have updates\ncoming in from DHCP as clients register.\n\n114\n00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.011\nSo you know we can be doing\nthose kind of things.\n\n115\n00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:32.560\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n116\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.040\nRemember that when we're doing all\nthat clients will come and go.\n\n117\n00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.700\nWe've talked about DHCP and\n\n118\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.650\nthe TTL on the lease, maybe our\nlease is set to a very small number.\n\n119\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.150\nMaybe it's a five hour,\neight hour lease, something like that.\n\n120\n00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.106\nAnd it's gonna get renewed and\nwe're gonna have clients coming and going.\n\n121\n00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:50.814\nSo imagine hypothetically we're in\na business where people come in but\n\n122\n00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:54.456\nmaybe only spend a few hours working\non a system and then they leave, so\n\n123\n00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:58.200\nlike a training facility,\nhypothetically or college, university.\n\n124\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.110\nAnywhere where you gonna have a lot\nof transitory people coming and\n\n125\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.517\ngoing, logging on to a site, maybe\nthrough wireless and or plugging into\n\n126\n00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:09.380\na classroom spending a couple of hours\ngetting an address and then leaving.\n\n127\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.510\nIf we're not refreshing those\nregistrations, through DHCP,\n\n128\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.360\nand getting them out of there and\ndoing the same thing in DNS.\n\n129\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.980\nWe've got a back log of information that\nbuilds up, that is accurate maybe earlier\n\n130\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.110\nin the day, but it's not accurate\nlet's say the next day or\n\n131\n00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.900\n12 hours later or whatever the case may be\nbecause those people have come and gone.\n\n132\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.980\nSo this is why scavenging and\ngoing through and\n\n133\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.810\nsetting that up will be important because\nit will remove those records that have\n\n134\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.550\ntimed out even if we don't\ndynamically remove them on our own.\n\n135\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.080\nWe can set the scavenging to do that for\nus.\n\n136\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.130\nSo, it is important just to think\nabout some of these settings\n\n137\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.350\nthat we've been reminding ourselves about.\n\n138\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.542\nWe will want to make sure,\n\n139\n00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.482\nwe've talked about backing up\nthe database as well for DNS.\n\n140\n00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:50.860\nAnd let's go back up here real quick and\nlet's go to All Tasks, right?\n\n141\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.060\nSo Scavenging Skill Resource Records.\n\n142\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.360\nWe talked about this and\nwhy this is important.\n\n143\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.218\nI'm making sure we know\nthat we can do that.\n\n144\n00:06:57.218 --> 00:07:00.178\nBut we've also talked about\nthe need to be able to go in and\n\n145\n00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:03.449\nensure that if we're doing\nActive Directory integrated DNS,\n\n146\n00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.800\nremember our backups are happening\nthrough Active Directory.\n\n147\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.810\nWe're essentially just\nbacking up the system state.\n\n148\n00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.750\nWe're getting all the Active Directory\ninformation associated with that.\n\n149\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.980\nBut if we're going to be storing our\nzone files locally on the DNS server,\n\n150\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.550\nthen we have to back them up separately\nbecause we're not having that automatic\n\n151\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.390\nbackup capability.\n\n152\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.660\nSo just want to remember that a lot\nof these things are going on.\n\n153\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.818\nWe did show you in the last episode\nhow to take a zone and remove it from\n\n154\n00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:29.830\nActive Directory intergration, creating\nthe option to see the local zone file\n\n155\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.690\nin the system root so again,\nwe see Windows/System32 DNS folder.\n\n156\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.069\nWe would then see our zone\nfiles by the name of the zone.\n\n157\n00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:41.765\nAnd then once we have done that, we could\nthen go in and backup the DNS server and\n\n158\n00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:45.750\nyou will interact around that to make\nsure we have all of that information.\n\n159\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.140\nJust keeping that in mind.\n\n160\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.410\nWe did talk about zone types.\n\n161\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.720\nBut correct me, Cherokee, if I'm wrong.\n\n162\n00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.697\nWe didn't talk about zone transfers,\ndid we?\n\n163\n00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:53.687\n&gt;&gt; No, we did talk about zones.\n\n164\n00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:54.587\nSo that's probably something we need\nto talk about or just for refreshing.\n\n165\n00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:55.088\nYou mentioned that.\n\n166\n00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:59.105\nYou said back in the day that that was\navailable and it's not recommended for\n\n167\n00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.568\nsecurity purposes today.\n\n168\n00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:01.775\nBut I think that was about it.\n\n169\n00:08:01.775 --> 00:08:03.687\n&gt;&gt; We didn't talk about the zone\ntransfer types though, I think.\n\n170\n00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:05.178\nWe did mention it from\na security standpoint.\n\n171\n00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:07.789\nBut there are some different types\nof zone transfers that occur.\n\n172\n00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:11.220\nWe do have a full zone transfer if we\nallow zone transfers to take place.\n\n173\n00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.776\nWe may have an incremental zone transfer.\n\n174\n00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:17.880\nWe also have something known as a fast\nzone transfer in Server 16 using DNS.\n\n175\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.610\nTraditional full zone transfers,\nliterally,\n\n176\n00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.870\nyou can imagine all of the information for\nthe zone gets transferred.\n\n177\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.680\nThat's how we would initially set up or\nreplicate out a zone.\n\n178\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.370\nIf we're gonna be able to\ncreate a secondary zone,\n\n179\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.560\nwe'll copy the entire zone file from one\nDNS server to another full zone transfers\n\n180\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.880\noften referred to as AXFR, all A, AXFR.\n\n181\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.550\nSo all transfer, xfr, short for transfer.\n\n182\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.810\nSo I did that, just kinda cool, right?\n\n183\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.630\nWe're truncating that, but\ntraditionally, for years now,\n\n184\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.082\nwe've just referred to full zone transfers\nas AXFR events for all zone transfers.\n\n185\n00:08:48.082 --> 00:08:51.007\nIncremental zone transfers,\njust essentially change blocks, right.\n\n186\n00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:52.830\nWe're just doing the delta replication.\n\n187\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.130\nAnd we're doing an IXFR event,\nI for incremental.\n\n188\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.141\nSo just incremental zone transfer or the\nability to just transfer out changes after\n\n189\n00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:03.193\nwe set up our baseline,\ndifferent kind of zone transfer type.\n\n190\n00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:07.729\nAnd then fast zone transfer, as I said,\nis gonna batch multiple zone records or\n\n191\n00:09:07.729 --> 00:09:11.270\nmultiple resource records\ntogether with compression.\n\n192\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.870\nIt's really just sending that\nincremental zone transfer but\n\n193\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.978\ncompressing the data to make it a little\nbit quicker and easier to manage.\n\n194\n00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:20.940\nThat's what we call a fast,\nexcuse me, zone transfer.\n\n195\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.380\nDo keep in mind that depending on\nthe nature of the DNS servers we use,\n\n196\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.300\nwe may not support all\nthree zone transfer types.\n\n197\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.920\nFor instance, if we are using or thinking\nabout using fast zone transfers, we may or\n\n198\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.370\nmay not have a problem doing that if we\nhook up our Server 16 server with mixed\n\n199\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.810\nDNS, meaning a bind server, let's say,\n\n200\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.880\nUNIX Linux based directory server or\nDNS server, not directory server.\n\n201\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.690\nI'm thinking NIS, as opposed to DNS.\n\n202\n00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.760\nAnd when we're thinking about\nAlternate DNS server relationships and\n\n203\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.461\nconnecting to a bind server and having\nintegrated or hybrid DNS, which we can do.\n\n204\n00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.119\nAnd I think we've talked about\nin at least one of the episode.\n\n205\n00:09:57.119 --> 00:09:58.910\nWe mentioned the fact we could do that.\n\n206\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.710\nI think you had some stuff you had\nmentioned about the fact you've seen or\n\n207\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.330\nworked with Alternate DNS servers.\n\n208\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.520\nIn fact, that would often see them\nin Linux and UNIX environments.\n\n209\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.960\nWeb hosting environments are very heavily\nslated towards Linux hosting these days,\n\n210\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.990\nso you may see Alternate DNS\nservers running there.\n\n211\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.140\nWhen we integrate that,\nwe or may not necessarily,\n\n212\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.810\nbased on the bind features that are\nsupported, based on the bind build that\n\n213\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.540\nwe're using, have the capability to\ndo all of these zone transfer types,\n\n214\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.280\nbind us natively support a full\nzone transfer or AXFR events.\n\n215\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.850\nBut some bind versions depending on how\nnew or old they are do or do not have\n\n216\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.760\nsupport for incremental and do or do not\nhave support for fast zone transfers.\n\n217\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.555\nSo that's just something\nto think about that.\n\n218\n00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.000\nIt's just obviously one of those,\n\n219\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.260\nhey, you gotta do your due diligence,\ngotta check it out kind of things.\n\n220\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.900\nCuz you may or may not know when\nyou actually try to configure it\n\n221\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.780\nbased on the version of bind that\nyou're working with as to whether or\n\n222\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.900\nnot that would actually be the case.\n\n223\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.180\nSo that is something just to consider,\nand just obviously be aware of that.\n\n224\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.250\nWe did talk about zone transfers and\nhow we could set those up.\n\n225\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.110\nWent through and showed you that we\nhave the opportunity to go ahead and\n\n226\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.219\nspecify that we will allow zone\ntransfers into witch servers.\n\n227\n00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:06.850\nIn fact that by default, we don't do that,\n\n228\n00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.060\nbut we could set that up and kind of\ntruncate that list if we wanted to.\n\n229\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.557\nIt'd be up to us to decide\nhow to configure that.\n\n230\n00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:14.615\nI think we also talked\nabout server caching and\n\n231\n00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:18.120\nthe fact that it's important to understand\nthat we do have DNS server caches.\n\n232\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.020\nI showed you that you can go in,\nand you can, right here, go in and\n\n233\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.240\nclear the DNS cache right from here.\n\n234\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.860\nSo we did mention that last time as well.\n\n235\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.930\nAnd we did talk about the fact that\nwe may wanna clear that cache.\n\n236\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.860\nIf we ever name resolution issues,\nthat could be something for\n\n237\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.070\nus to think about and something for\nus to be concerned about.\n\n238\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.480\nSo it is just something that we would\nhave on our minds, so to speak, right,\n\n239\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.720\nthat we wanna be aware of.\n\n240\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.290\nAll right, when we're talking about\nforwarding, let's just go in here real\n\n241\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.450\nquick and just remind ourselves of\nwhere we are and what we're doing here.\n\n242\n00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.930\nSo at the server level right here,\nif we're talking about forwarding, right?\n\n243\n00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.194\nRemember, we can go under this tab.\n\n244\n00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:55.675\nWe could set up our ability to be\nable to specify forwarding here.\n\n245\n00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:58.509\nEdit and we have our forwarding list here.\n\n246\n00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.494\nAnd the idea is in, by the way,\nwe could edit a forward,\n\n247\n00:12:00.494 --> 00:12:02.121\nadd a forward right in there,\nyou could see.\n\n248\n00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.628\nForwarding is the idea of being\nable to say, you know what,\n\n249\n00:12:05.628 --> 00:12:09.766\nif I get a [COUGH] question or a query\ncoming in as a DNS server from a client\n\n250\n00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:13.836\nthat wants to resolve some information and\nI don't know the answer,\n\n251\n00:12:13.836 --> 00:12:16.810\nI can't give them an answer,\nI've two options.\n\n252\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.730\nI can essentially say, I'm sorry,\nI'm not authoritative, I don't know.\n\n253\n00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.940\nOr I could say, hey,\n\n254\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.510\nhold on a minute, let me see if I can send\nthat request to somebody else, right.\n\n255\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.740\nKind of upstream or downstream, depending\non how you wanna think about that, right.\n\n256\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.200\nBut I could send it off to another DNS\nserver that may have the answer and\n\n257\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.040\nI can see if I can get them\nto give us the answer.\n\n258\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.240\nThat would be forwarding.\n\n259\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.990\nSo I can pass along that query on behalf\nof the requester and see if, then,\n\n260\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.510\nI can get a resolution.\n\n261\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.290\nBecause remember,\nwe're not gonna know everything, right.\n\n262\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.594\nI mean, the reality is unless we\nare the primary DNS server in a,\n\n263\n00:12:48.594 --> 00:12:52.200\nlet's say, fully qualified domain, right.\n\n264\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.326\nSo inside a LAN, in an Active Directory\nbased domain behind the firewall and\n\n265\n00:12:56.326 --> 00:12:58.076\nwe're never gonna go outside.\n\n266\n00:12:58.076 --> 00:13:01.210\nAll we're gonna do is essentially\ndo resolution for that name space,\n\n267\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.040\nand we're not gonna recognize anything\nthat does not exist in that name space.\n\n268\n00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.099\nThen I would literally and\nlegitimately be authoritative and\n\n269\n00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.862\nbe the single point of knowledge for\n\n270\n00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:13.563\neverything, as long as the resources\nhad register and I was aware of them or\n\n271\n00:13:13.563 --> 00:13:17.355\nI manually created records of them,\nI would have knowledge of all, right.\n\n272\n00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:18.572\nI essentially would know everything.\n\n273\n00:13:18.572 --> 00:13:21.381\nAnd there would be nothing that I\nwould have to go resolve from another\n\n274\n00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:22.554\nDNS server somewhere else.\n\n275\n00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:24.724\nSo I could say,\neither I know the answer or\n\n276\n00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:28.506\nif I don't know the answer,\nit's because the answer doesn't exist and\n\n277\n00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:31.970\nyou don't get to see that\nresource cuz it's not available.\n\n278\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.507\nBut it's very rare that we have that kind\nof a service set up where we have just\n\n279\n00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:39.213\na limited window or a limited ability to\ndo name resolution inside of a domain and\n\n280\n00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:41.288\nthat we're never, ever gonna go outside.\n\n281\n00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:45.427\nBecause if we think about it logically,\nunless we're in an isolated domain for\n\n282\n00:13:45.427 --> 00:13:49.131\na security reason, or some sort of\nregulatory reason, or we're in a,\n\n283\n00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:52.713\nmaybe a QA environment or a hosting or\nstaging or a demo environment,\n\n284\n00:13:52.713 --> 00:13:55.246\nwe're not gonna worry\nabout the outside world,\n\n285\n00:13:55.246 --> 00:13:58.390\nwe really are limited in that respect,\nright, normally.\n\n286\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.230\nWhen we are traditionally\nin an enterprise,\n\n287\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.140\nan organization, any of your companies,\nanything you would do on a regular basis.\n\n288\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.840\nI mean, when was the last time,\nif you think about this right,\n\n289\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.820\nlogically, that you didn't want to go out\nto the internet to find something at some\n\n290\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.550\npoint during the course of a business day?\n\n291\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.648\nI mean, that's usually something\nmost of us have to do, right?\n\n292\n00:14:11.648 --> 00:14:12.682\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n293\n00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:15.746\n&gt;&gt; You may not set out saying, I'm gonna\ngo sit down and find that website.\n\n294\n00:14:15.746 --> 00:14:18.230\nBut normally, just during\nthe course of what you're doing,\n\n295\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.008\nyou're gonna think of something you need.\n\n296\n00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:22.720\nYou wanna send an email,\nyou wanna be able to look something up.\n\n297\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.490\nAll those things require external DNS name\nresolution to other systems outside of\n\n298\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.220\nyour namespace, outside of your\nlittle corner of the world.\n\n299\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.070\nAnd so forwarding becomes very important.\n\n300\n00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.385\nBecause we do need to understand that\nwe have to be able to reach out to\n\n301\n00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:40.224\nsystems beyond the border or the boundary\nof not only our infrastructure, but\n\n302\n00:14:40.224 --> 00:14:43.913\nour knowledge of infrastructure,\nwhich is what the DNS zones represent.\n\n303\n00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:46.090\nAnd so\nforwarding is the way we're gonna do this.\n\n304\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.030\nSo wanted to walk you through the logic\nof being able to set up a forwarder.\n\n305\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.550\nBut not just enabling forwarding, that we\ncould just do by going up here and saying,\n\n306\n00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.440\nokay, hey, forward to that server.\n\n307\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.240\nWhat about something called\nconditional forwarding, right?\n\n308\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.063\nWhat if we wanna be able to resolve the\nnames of other resources on maybe other\n\n309\n00:15:01.063 --> 00:15:04.768\nnetworks without having queried\nthe Internet DNS servers to do that, but\n\n310\n00:15:04.768 --> 00:15:07.397\nto query somewhere else in\nour infrastructure, and\n\n311\n00:15:07.397 --> 00:15:09.155\nthis is conditional forwarding.\n\n312\n00:15:09.155 --> 00:15:11.585\nPrimarily what we think of\nconditional forwarding as being,\n\n313\n00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:14.365\nwe're forwarding out to another namespace.\n\n314\n00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:17.885\nMaybe we're in a forest with multiple\ndomains and different trees, so\n\n315\n00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:20.244\ndifferent namespaces\nunderneath the forest.\n\n316\n00:15:20.244 --> 00:15:24.113\nThink of different companies or companies\nrather I should say that have global\n\n317\n00:15:24.113 --> 00:15:28.270\nfootprints but have different names that\nthey operate under around the world.\n\n318\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.530\nThey're all part of maybe conglomerate,\nan umbrella organization\n\n319\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.030\ntheoretically let say, your Megacorp or\nsomething like that, right?\n\n320\n00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.301\nAnd underneath Megacorp, I may have\ndifferent lines of businesses with\n\n321\n00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:41.842\ndifferent names, but the common\ninfrastructures setting at highest level,\n\n322\n00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:43.410\nis gonna be provided by Megacorp.\n\n323\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:48.339\nAnd so name resolution from ABC\ncomputers and WXYZ web servers,\n\n324\n00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:53.999\nboth companies under the MegaCorp\numbrella, may have to flow through and\n\n325\n00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:59.769\ninto and out of DNS servers that are out\nbeyond any one of those namespaces.\n\n326\n00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:02.327\nAnd so conditional forwarding\nmay help us to figure this out.\n\n327\n00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:03.160\nSo I wanted to show you,\n\n328\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.510\nto walk through the logic of how\nto set up conditional forwarding.\n\n329\n00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.016\nBecause it's usually a skill that\nwe do need to be aware of and\n\n330\n00:16:08.016 --> 00:16:10.537\nsomething you want to make sure\nthat you're familiar with.\n\n331\n00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:14.099\nThis allows us to essentially create\na direct point of contact between two\n\n332\n00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.196\nnetwork DNS servers.\n\n333\n00:16:15.196 --> 00:16:17.261\nReducing the need for recursive queries.\n\n334\n00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:19.704\nBecause we're creating essentially,\na dedicated path.\n\n335\n00:16:19.704 --> 00:16:22.445\nThat says, hey when this comes in and\nit's addressed to this,\n\n336\n00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:24.190\nmake sure you send it over there.\n\n337\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.645\nLet's not guess, let's just send it there\nbecause that's what's gonna be able to\n\n338\n00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:27.485\ngive us the answer, right?\n\n339\n00:16:27.485 --> 00:16:29.471\nThat's what conditional\nforwarding is gonna do.\n\n340\n00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:32.755\nSo normal forwarding,\njust setup right there on the server.\n\n341\n00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:36.049\nBut conditional forwarding,\nwe come down here to this folder,\n\n342\n00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:39.410\njust coincidentally labeled\nconditional forwarding.\n\n343\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.720\nGreat how that works out.\n\n344\n00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.370\nAnd conditional forward so\nwe go here in the server and\n\n345\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.300\nwe're going to set this up, right?\n\n346\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.656\nSo we're gonna right click and\ncreate a new conditional forward.\n\n347\n00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:47.108\nSo let's take a look at how to do this.\n\n348\n00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:49.160\nWe're going to go ahead and\nset this up real quick.\n\n349\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.910\nSo I'm going to do this, click here.\n\n350\n00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.040\nOur little DNS domain new\nconditional forward wizard screen,\n\n351\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.550\nnot too involved though only one screen,\nnot too much we can do there.\n\n352\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.190\nWe are gonna put in our DNS domain,\nso let's do this.\n\n353\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.452\nThis is gonna be practicelabs.com.\n\n354\n00:17:03.452 --> 00:17:05.546\nNow, just to note here,\nwhile I'm doing this.\n\n355\n00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:08.619\nIf you take a look at our forward\nlookup zone, this is in, or\n\n356\n00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.159\nI'm on the server right now.\n\n357\n00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:13.920\nThat's servicing in this\ndomain PRACTICEIT.CO.UK.\n\n358\n00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.444\nSo you can see I'm in a different\nnamespace than practicelabs.com,\n\n359\n00:17:17.444 --> 00:17:21.219\nwhich is where I'm setting up\nthe conditional folder to point to, right?\n\n360\n00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:24.984\nSo I'm on the PRACTICEIT.CO.UK DNS.\n\n361\n00:17:24.984 --> 00:17:28.801\nAnd in this case, domain server for\nthe DNS, cuz this is our domain server and\n\n362\n00:17:28.801 --> 00:17:30.109\nour DNS server all in one.\n\n363\n00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:34.861\nIn this name space PRACTICEIT.CO.UK,\nI'm setting up a conditional forward.\n\n364\n00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:38.558\nAnd it's essentially going to say when\nsomething comes in from PracticeLabs.com\n\n365\n00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.783\nhere's where you send it.\n\n366\n00:17:39.783 --> 00:17:43.121\nAnd we're gonna program that in and\nput that in here.\n\n367\n00:17:43.121 --> 00:17:45.790\nOf course on the other side we could\nsend stuff going the other way\n\n368\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.938\nfrom PracticeLabs.com.\n\n369\n00:17:46.938 --> 00:17:50.560\nWe can set up a conditional\nforward over to PracticeIT.co.uk.\n\n370\n00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.002\nSo that's what we're gonna specify,\nso we need the name of the domain.\n\n371\n00:17:54.002 --> 00:18:00.180\nWe also need to then be able to go in and\nspecify right here, Click to Add.\n\n372\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.586\nWe're gonna put in our IP address,\nwhich is gonna be the IP address of\n\n373\n00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:06.607\nthe PracticeLabs.com DNS server\nthat we wanna forward to.\n\n374\n00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.754\nSo we have to know what\nthat IP address is.\n\n375\n00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.844\nJust gonna program that in right here,\nit's gonna be 0.1 so\n\n376\n00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:13.440\nlet's just type that in.\n\n377\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.507\nSo we have that 192.168.0.1.\n\n378\n00:18:15.507 --> 00:18:20.400\nNow notice if I had more than one\nof these servers here, right?\n\n379\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.100\nI'll be able to move up and down, you\ncould see here I'll be able to move up,\n\n380\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.970\nmove down.\n\n381\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.590\nDelete if something was\nnot going to be there.\n\n382\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.190\nRight, so I can go ahead and\ndo all of that.\n\n383\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.178\nI could then go ahead and\n\n384\n00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:35.249\nsay select the conditional forwarding\ninformation in Active Directory.\n\n385\n00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:37.388\nSo I'll just go ahead and\ncheck that off if I want to.\n\n386\n00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:41.173\nAnd you'll see here, I can replicate or\nspecify how replication takes place.\n\n387\n00:18:41.173 --> 00:18:43.440\nRemember we talked about how\nreplication takes place.\n\n388\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.614\nSo the options for replication in the\nActive Directory integrated zones before\n\n389\n00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:49.866\nwe set it to replicate\nat the forest level.\n\n390\n00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:53.443\nIt replicates all the domains in all\nthe forest, replicate our domain and\n\n391\n00:18:53.443 --> 00:18:54.259\nour namespace.\n\n392\n00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo we have different options here.\n\n393\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.270\nWe'd have to think about\nlogically what we wanna do.\n\n394\n00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.100\nSo we can specify this.\n\n395\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.630\nAnd we'll make sure that\nwe do all DNS servers in\n\n396\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.400\nthe domain instead of in the forest.\n\n397\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.478\nCuz we're not replicating this\nout to the entire forest.\n\n398\n00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:12.225\nWe just want all the DNS servers in\nthe domain for PRACTICE.IT.CO.UK.\n\n399\n00:19:12.225 --> 00:19:15.574\nTo know that this is where we're\ngonna send this information for\n\n400\n00:19:15.574 --> 00:19:18.095\npracticelabs.com if we get a request in.\n\n401\n00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:20.930\nSo we just want limit this to\nthe knowledge of our media domain.\n\n402\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.535\nCuz this is where this\nforwarder becomes important so\n\n403\n00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:25.197\nonly when we're in this name space.\n\n404\n00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.585\nWe wanna find the other name space\nthat we have to know how to get there.\n\n405\n00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:29.530\nWe don't want the entire\nforest to know about this.\n\n406\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.714\nWe just want our name space to know about\nit, that's why we're limiting it there.\n\n407\n00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:35.540\nSo number of seconds before\nforward queries timeout.\n\n408\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.750\nWe can specify a time value here\nif we need to, be up to us.\n\n409\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.870\nThis is just essentially managing and\nmanipulating that for us.\n\n410\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.860\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n411\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.220\nWe'll specify that, we'll click OK here.\n\n412\n00:19:47.175 --> 00:19:50.164\nAll right so\nwe have our conditional folder set up,\n\n413\n00:19:50.164 --> 00:19:52.747\nreally not very complicated\nas you can see.\n\n414\n00:19:52.747 --> 00:19:57.075\nWhat we're then gonna be able to do\nis go in here and let's just go in.\n\n415\n00:19:57.075 --> 00:20:00.028\nAnd let's do a ping real quick and\nsee if we can actually ping and\n\n416\n00:20:00.028 --> 00:20:01.211\nfind that information.\n\n417\n00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:04.748\nSo let's just open up a command line,\nkind of should do it from,\n\n418\n00:20:04.748 --> 00:20:08.169\nI have enough PowerShell open so\nwe just do it right from here.\n\n419\n00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:11.247\nSo let's just go in here real quick,\nand let's just ping.\n\n420\n00:20:11.247 --> 00:20:13.964\nAnd we're gonna ping, what is that,\nthe domain controller, right.\n\n421\n00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:17.535\nSo plabdc1.practicelabs.com.\n\n422\n00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:24.653\nSo let's go in, all right, so, let's just\nsee, just pull this down just a touch.\n\n423\n00:20:24.653 --> 00:20:27.910\nSo you can see what I typed there\nbecause it's kind of obscured by that.\n\n424\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.580\nSo let's just go in.\n\n425\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.685\nLet's take a look, and you can see when\nI do that, we're getting our ping back.\n\n426\n00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:36.008\nIt is replying four times so we are able\nto resolve the domain controller,\n\n427\n00:20:36.008 --> 00:20:37.484\nwhich is the DNS server.\n\n428\n00:20:37.484 --> 00:20:40.490\nCuz it's hosting the DNS for\nus in the practicelabs.com domain.\n\n429\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.640\nSo you can see I'm able to successfully\nping there, so that's good news, right?\n\n430\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.208\nSo what we have to do now\nis go to the other side.\n\n431\n00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:50.230\nIf we wanted to complete this going\nthe other way we'd want to go over to\n\n432\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.550\nthat server,\nwhich is what we're going to do right now.\n\n433\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.003\nThe practice labs, lab BC1 machine I\ndon't know if it's [INAUDIBLE] for\n\n434\n00:20:57.003 --> 00:20:59.220\npracticelabs.com for other name space.\n\n435\n00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.185\nWe're gonna go over there.\n\n436\n00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:01.195\nWe'll be able to go ahead and\n\n437\n00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:03.899\nset up a conditional forwarder on that\nside coming over to here, all right?\n\n438\n00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:05.182\nBecause we have to complete the circuit.\n\n439\n00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:07.568\nIn other words we want to be able\nto resolve going either way.\n\n440\n00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.399\nWe need conditional\nforwards on both sides.\n\n441\n00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:10.524\nWe're doing the same thing,\n\n442\n00:21:10.524 --> 00:21:13.099\nthe only difference is we're going\nto substitute the domain name.\n\n443\n00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:17.180\nInstead of PracticeLabs.com\nit'll be PracticeIT.co.uk.\n\n444\n00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.020\nAnd instead of 192.168.0.1 it'll\n\n445\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.200\nbe whatever the IP address is\nthat's gonna represent this.\n\n446\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.738\nSo we're just gonna switch over here,\nso let's go over to here.\n\n447\n00:21:26.738 --> 00:21:30.930\nThere's our Plab DC 1 machine, there's\nour conditional forwarder right there,\n\n448\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.790\nour folder where we're gonna create this.\n\n449\n00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.350\nWe'll create a new conditional forwarder.\n\n450\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.420\nLet me just get the IP address that we\nneed right there 0.4 so let's go ahead and\n\n451\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.670\ncreate our conditional forwarder here.\n\n452\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.872\nWizard is the same right,\nthere's no difference,\n\n453\n00:21:42.872 --> 00:21:45.235\nit's a matter of the name\nspaces being swapped around.\n\n454\n00:21:45.235 --> 00:21:51.638\nSo, let's do practiceIT.co.uk and\n\n455\n00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:55.130\nlet's click here and\n\n456\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.790\n192.168.0.4.\n\n457\n00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.870\nGo ahead we'll put that in.\n\n458\n00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.080\nLet's go ahead and let's make sure\nthat we are replicating that.\n\n459\n00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.190\nWe're just gonna specify that goes to\nthe domain, just like we did there.\n\n460\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.483\nGet all that set up as well.\n\n461\n00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:13.906\nLet's click OK.\n\n462\n00:22:13.906 --> 00:22:15.440\nAll right, so we have that.\n\n463\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.320\nAnd by the way, I didn't show\nyou the last time when I did it.\n\n464\n00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.670\nBut you see, we have a little item there.\n\n465\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.990\nYou can see, we have our folder, right?\n\n466\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.890\nThis represents the record\nthat specifies for us but\n\n467\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.230\nthe IP address is as\nwe're setting that up.\n\n468\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.270\nAnd so we should be able to ping going\nthe other way where we establish.\n\n469\n00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.710\nSo we can ping,\nwe should be able to go in.\n\n470\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.080\nAnd we should be able to ping from\nhere over to the practiceitcode.uk.\n\n471\n00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.560\nSo let's just take a look to make sure we\nhave that part of this working as well.\n\n472\n00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.920\nAgain I'm just gonna go to PowerShell,\nI already have it opened here on the box.\n\n473\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.750\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\njust clear the screen so we can see that.\n\n474\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.360\nAnd let's just reverse the ping going the\nother way, make sure that's also working.\n\n475\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.830\nSo plab, and this is the sa01 machine\nwe want to ping right, so sa01..\n\n476\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:02.319\nAnd what we're gonna do is the following,\n\n477\n00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:07.366\nlet's do practiceIT, whoops,\n\n478\n00:23:07.366 --> 00:23:10.983\npracticeIT.co.uk.\n\n479\n00:23:10.983 --> 00:23:15.520\nAnd just make sure we spell\nthat correctly plabsa01,\n\n480\n00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.521\npracticeit that should be correct.\n\n481\n00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:22.682\nYou could see now we could be able to\nmy ping going to the other DNS server,\n\n482\n00:23:22.682 --> 00:23:25.430\nin other words over in\nthe other namespace.\n\n483\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.491\nI'm able to resolve and\n\n484\n00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:29.527\nthrough conditional forwarding\nsend that traffic back and forth.\n\n485\n00:23:29.527 --> 00:23:32.252\nAnd so when we use conditional\nforwarding we're able now to say.\n\n486\n00:23:32.252 --> 00:23:36.207\nHey, when this comes in or request for\nthis name resolution comes in,\n\n487\n00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:38.010\nhey I don't know about it.\n\n488\n00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.950\nLet me make sure it's gonna be sent\nover to divide and hard code that path.\n\n489\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.567\nThis is what conditional forwarding\ndoes for you, for us, magic.\n\n490\n00:23:44.567 --> 00:23:45.587\n&gt;&gt; Whoo-hoo!\n\n491\n00:23:45.587 --> 00:23:47.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what I wanted,\n\n492\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.820\nthat sound effect right there.\n\n493\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.670\n&gt;&gt; I wish I had a soundboard here,\n\n494\n00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.855\nunfortunately they don't let me\nplay with the sharp scissors, so.\n\n495\n00:23:53.855 --> 00:23:56.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's probably not a bad idea for\n\n496\n00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:58.113\nlots and lots and lots of reasons.\n\n497\n00:23:58.113 --> 00:24:00.047\nAll right, so\nwe did talk about forwarding and\n\n498\n00:24:00.047 --> 00:24:02.188\ngoing in and\nobviously setting up our forwarding.\n\n499\n00:24:02.188 --> 00:24:05.199\nHere with conditional towards who\nwanted edit our forwarding tab.\n\n500\n00:24:05.199 --> 00:24:06.997\nI showed you where we can go in and\ndo that already.\n\n501\n00:24:06.997 --> 00:24:09.610\nWe could go in and take a look and\nobviously play around there.\n\n502\n00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.080\nI did mention a rude hints a well.\n\n503\n00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.825\nI just wanted to go in here real quick and\njust show you one other thing.\n\n504\n00:24:15.825 --> 00:24:18.705\nWe did take a look at and\ntalk about how to create zones.\n\n505\n00:24:18.705 --> 00:24:23.579\nWhat I wanted to do was just talk\nabout one of one other thing,\n\n506\n00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:27.222\nwhich was right here,\nlet me just minimize.\n\n507\n00:24:27.222 --> 00:24:29.536\nWe don't need either one\nwho doesn't really matter.\n\n508\n00:24:29.536 --> 00:24:33.877\nLet's just go in here on\nour DC on PracticeLabs.com.\n\n509\n00:24:33.877 --> 00:24:36.957\nWe had talked about the fact that we\ndo have all of our resource records,\n\n510\n00:24:36.957 --> 00:24:37.837\nour zones.\n\n511\n00:24:37.837 --> 00:24:41.297\nWe even talked about creating reversal of\nzones, pointer records and all of that.\n\n512\n00:24:41.297 --> 00:24:44.527\nBut if we decide just to remind\nourselves here we do new zone.\n\n513\n00:24:45.967 --> 00:24:50.780\nIf we decide, let's pull this over and\ndown to create a new zone and\n\n514\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.140\nwould choose our primary zone.\n\n515\n00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.760\nWe've been through that and\ntalked about that.\n\n516\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.840\nBut let's say for just a minute that\nwe wanted to create a secondary zone.\n\n517\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.170\nYou'll notice when we secondary zones,\n\n518\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.240\nI didn't actually show you this\nwhen we did this last time.\n\n519\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.960\nI just explained the concept\nthat a secondary zone\n\n520\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.710\nis a copy of the primary zone.\n\n521\n00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.460\nAnd as a result,\n\n522\n00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.830\nyou'll notice we're not making the choice\nto store in the Active Directory, because\n\n523\n00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.440\nthe secondary zone's a copy of one that's\nalready been created already stored.\n\n524\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.680\nSo we're unselecting there,\nI just wanted to show you that.\n\n525\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.420\nIf we do a stub zone, remember,\nwe can make a choice for\n\n526\n00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.680\nthe Active Directory to use and\nto provide storage for our stub zone,\n\n527\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.415\ncuz a stub zone is essentially\na stripped down version.\n\n528\n00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:31.629\nIt's a pointer zone, really that\ntells us how to resolve this NS and\n\n529\n00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:32.700\nthe SOA records if you remember.\n\n530\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.990\nAnd maybe what we call glue\nhost records probably for\n\n531\n00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:41.550\nthe main controller or something like\nthat, as a host just to find that machine.\n\n532\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.670\nBut that's really going to have\na very limited amount of information.\n\n533\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.680\nSo we have options here but\nwhen we do our secondary zone,\n\n534\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.140\nyou'll see that I specify forward or\nreverse lookup.\n\n535\n00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.570\nAnd then you'll see I've\ngotta give it a zone name,\n\n536\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.710\nspecify the portion of the name space that\nwe're gonna specify that this is gonna be,\n\n537\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.650\nand we'll just finish out our wizard here.\n\n538\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.850\nBut when we create that we're\nnot storing the secondary zone\n\n539\n00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.720\nin the Active Directory the way\nwe do the primary zone.\n\n540\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.220\nI just wanted to make sure you\ngot a chance to see that and\n\n541\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.510\nthat made sense based on our conversation\nabout how zones are formed and\n\n542\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.610\nwhat they represent earlier cuz\nwe had been through that but\n\n543\n00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.930\nhadn't really spent time\nspecifically on that one piece.\n\n544\n00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.830\nAll right, so\nwe took a look at how to create,\n\n545\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.250\nreviewed all our trouble shooting options.\n\n546\n00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.140\nTalked about making sure we\nknow our zone transfer types.\n\n547\n00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.970\nBut we also talked about\nconditional forwarding,\n\n548\n00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.930\ndid a quick demonstration set that up for\nyou, show you how that's gonna work.\n\n549\n00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.660\nI'm thinking we're just about out of time,\nright?\n\n550\n00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what's the plan,\nare we going back for more DNS here?\n\n551\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.300\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go dig up some more DNS.\n\n552\n00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's dig up some more DNS\nbut for this show we'll go ahead and\n\n553\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.970\nsign out.\n\n554\n00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.785\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n555\n00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:44.871\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV\n\n556\n00:26:44.871 --> 00:26:50.654\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:26:50.654 -->

00:00:23.327\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:24.497\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:25.328\nHow are you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:26.109\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n12\n00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.520\nI'm feeling almost like I need to\nsplit myself into multiple pieces and\n\n13\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.987\ncreate partitions,\nin order to be truly, truly good.\n\n14\n00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:35.636\n&gt;&gt; So is that what we're going to\nbe looking at in this episode?\n\n15\n00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:40.192\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just saying, that would be a\nreally cool trick if I could do that, but\n\n16\n00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:43.592\nsince I can't do that what about\nif we could do that in DNS?\n\n17\n00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:46.792\nAnd in fact we actually can, and that is\nwhat we're gonna start talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.290\nYou may or may not have heard about\nsomething called application partitions in\n\n19\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.516\nthe Active Directory, but\nthey are important for\n\n20\n00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.856\nus to be aware of cuz we can\nuse that thought process.\n\n21\n00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:58.082\nWe actually have been talking about them,\nwe've actually tripped over them several\n\n22\n00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.207\ntimes without necessarily\nreferring to them that way.\n\n23\n00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:03.669\nBut I'm gonna tie back in some knowledge\nthat we've explained to you in some prior\n\n24\n00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:04.975\nwalk-throughs in episodes,\n\n25\n00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.653\nbring in a couple tools that help\nyou understand how we do this.\n\n26\n00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:11.072\nThis is something done in the Active\nDirectory but that we leverage with DNS.\n\n27\n00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.854\nIf you remember when we spoke about\nreplication of our zones, our forward\n\n28\n00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:19.185\nlookup zones, we said as we go through and\nset them up, our primary Active Directory\n\n29\n00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:23.167\nintegrated zones specifically,\nthat we have two options for replication.\n\n30\n00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:25.603\nWe have three, but two of them\nare essentially the same thing.\n\n31\n00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:28.135\nOne is replicated at the forest level,\n\n32\n00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:32.985\none is replicated at the DNS namespace or\nthe domain namespace level only.\n\n33\n00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:36.475\nAnd when we're thinking about that, we're\nactually talking about the idea of how we\n\n34\n00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:39.886\nreplicate or what the containers are that\nwe're gonna put that information into.\n\n35\n00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:43.859\nWe actually think about the application\npartitions in the Active Directory as\n\n36\n00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.340\na result of that,\nwhen we set up DNS and install.\n\n37\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.741\nWe actually create two default application\npartitions in Active Directory, the domain\n\n38\n00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:56.794\nDNS zones application partition and the\nforest DNS zones application partition.\n\n39\n00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:59.502\nAnd if you begin to see the map and\nthe logic on this\n\n40\n00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:03.087\nforest DNS zones replicate at\nthe forest level for everything.\n\n41\n00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:07.148\nApplication level, or specifically the\ndomain DNS zones application partition,\n\n42\n00:02:07.148 --> 00:02:09.507\nreplicate just the DNS namespace for\nthat zone.\n\n43\n00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:12.235\nSo we're putting our replication\ninformation into one or\n\n44\n00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:14.134\nmore of these application partitions.\n\n45\n00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.439\nThat's where we're storing it, and\n\n46\n00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.103\nthat's what we're talking about when\nwe actually talk about replication.\n\n47\n00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:21.314\nSo all domain controllers within\nthe forest that are set up and\n\n48\n00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:25.266\nhave DNS installed receive a copy of\nthe forest DNS application partition,\n\n49\n00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:28.374\nbecause obviously they're\ngonna be aware of everything.\n\n50\n00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:33.071\nBut the ones that are specific\nto just that DNS zone.\n\n51\n00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.990\nSo in other words if we are in\na forest called Forest1,\n\n52\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.620\nwe have knowledge of that cuz we get\na copy of that forest partition.\n\n53\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.964\nBut if we are in not just the forest,\nas we always will be,\n\n54\n00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:47.386\nbut we're a domain controller in this\nspecific domain within the forest.\n\n55\n00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:52.250\nThen the domain controller within that\ndomain gets a secondary partition,\n\n56\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.670\nthe application partition for\nthat DNS domain zone,\n\n57\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.726\nas well as the forest level one.\n\n58\n00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:01.629\nSo we have knowledge of everything in the\nforest through, or at least the ability to\n\n59\n00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.425\nsee everything in the forest potentially\nthrough that forest level partition,\n\n60\n00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:07.747\nbut we also have the one\nspecific to our DNS zone.\n\n61\n00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:09.991\nOr specifically in this case, our domain.\n\n62\n00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:13.116\nSo we actually have two, and\nwe have knowledge of both,\n\n63\n00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:15.382\ndepending on where we are and what we do.\n\n64\n00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:19.283\nSo if I'm in domain 1 and Cherokee is in\ndomain 2, we would each have a domain or\n\n65\n00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:23.446\napplication, or access to the application\npartition for our respective domains.\n\n66\n00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:25.676\nDomain 1, domain 2.\n\n67\n00:03:25.676 --> 00:03:28.546\nBut I would not see domain\n2's application partition,\n\n68\n00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:32.552\nyou would not see domain 1's application\npartition by default and by design,\n\n69\n00:03:32.552 --> 00:03:35.807\nbut we would both see the forest\nlevel application partitions.\n\n70\n00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:38.178\nSo just wanna make sure we're\naware of that, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:40.876\nSo that's kind of interesting, that's\nwhat application partitions are used for.\n\n72\n00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:42.779\nNow we can obviously\ncreate additional ones,\n\n73\n00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.348\nup to us to decide how we wanna do that.\n\n74\n00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.699\nThere are two ways to do that.\n\n75\n00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.395\nIf you join me here quickly, we'll just\ntake a look here at what we can do.\n\n76\n00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:53.092\nAn oldie but a goodie, DNS command is\nin a command line tool for DNS, and\n\n77\n00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:54.987\nDOS shell with DNS overlay.\n\n78\n00:03:54.987 --> 00:03:58.300\nThis is essentially what we use,\nit's been around as you could see, going\n\n79\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.151\nall the way back to Server 2003, it's just\na tool that's been around for awhile.\n\n80\n00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:06.120\nAnd we can use DNS command with our\nserver name and our commands here.\n\n81\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.384\nAnd one of the things that we can do, and\nthere's quite a long list of things as you\n\n82\n00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:13.772\ncan see here, but create our\ndirectory partitions, create and\n\n83\n00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:17.186\nyou'll see delete them and\nmodify them and interact with them.\n\n84\n00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:21.032\nThis is where we can go in using these\nswitches to actually be able to create\n\n85\n00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:22.905\nthe partitions using DNS command.\n\n86\n00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:27.587\nWe also, as if one wasn't good enough\nwe have two different options for you.\n\n87\n00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:29.809\nYou can also Ntdsutil.\n\n88\n00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.005\nAnother oldie, it's been around forever.\n\n89\n00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.253\nNtdsutil also goes back to Server 2003.\n\n90\n00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:39.945\nAnd Ntdsutil is not a DNS command tool\nspecifically, it is actually a tool\n\n91\n00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:44.723\nspecifically designed as a command\nline tool to manage Active Directory.\n\n92\n00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:48.908\nBut it does give us the ability because\nthese partitions are in Active Directory\n\n93\n00:04:48.908 --> 00:04:51.856\nto actually create the partitions\nwhen we use the tool.\n\n94\n00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:54.986\nSo remember, these partitions,\nalthough we leveraged them for DNS,\n\n95\n00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:57.137\nour Active Directory\nobjects are created in AD.\n\n96\n00:04:57.137 --> 00:05:00.383\nAnd we'll tell you about Active Directory\nintegrated zones that are going to be\n\n97\n00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.629\nusing our Active Directory integrated DNS,\nthat are gonna be leveraging these\n\n98\n00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.216\nActive Directory application partitions,\njust so you know.\n\n99\n00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:09.820\nSo you could use either one,\nNtdsutil and/or DNS Command,\n\n100\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.594\nit will be up to you to decide.\n\n101\n00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:15.194\n&gt;&gt; So, I know this is, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not gonna know what it is,\n\n102\n00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:19.234\nI'm just gonna say the answer is\neither four, no or two-thirds,\n\n103\n00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:23.943\ndepending on whether you want a fraction,\na full number, and/or a letter.\n\n104\n00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:24.529\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n105\n00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:25.129\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n106\n00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.299\nDid I get the answer right?\n\n107\n00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.308\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:30.450\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so what was your question?\n\n109\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.076\n&gt;&gt; So\nI know you said we have not by default but\n\n110\n00:05:33.076 --> 00:05:37.740\nwe have the ability to go ahead and\nhave access to these other partitions.\n\n111\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.639\n&gt;&gt; We can create additional\nones if need be.\n\n112\n00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.287\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n113\n00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:43.306\nOkay, so\nI was thinking you have access here.\n\n114\n00:05:43.306 --> 00:05:45.884\nSo that would be considered our trusts?\n\n115\n00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:47.011\n&gt;&gt; Well, in other words remember that,\nno, no, no.\n\n116\n00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.609\nWhat we're saying is that for\ninstance domain 1, domain 2,\n\n117\n00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:51.139\nlike we were talking about, right?\n\n118\n00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.778\nI suddenly got really small, I'm gonna\ntalk about DNS, just, I don't know.\n\n119\n00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:56.166\nEither that or the room grew,\none or the other.\n\n120\n00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.537\nMaybe there's just more room up there.\n\n121\n00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:58.354\n&gt;&gt; Haunted mansion.\n\n122\n00:05:58.354 --> 00:05:59.406\n&gt;&gt; And now look, I got big again.\n\n123\n00:05:59.406 --> 00:06:00.897\nYeah, it is like the Haunted Mansion.\n\n124\n00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:02.953\nDid that freak out your kids the first\ntime that you did that with them?\n\n125\n00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:05.999\nI took my daughters in there,\nthe first time, my little one?\n\n126\n00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.308\nShe almost clawed her way out of the room,\nshe was so scared.\n\n127\n00:06:10.308 --> 00:06:12.671\nI didn't mean to do that to her\nbecause we just didn't think about it.\n\n128\n00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.571\nShe freaked out something fierce.\n\n129\n00:06:15.571 --> 00:06:18.240\nWe could not, she had-\n&gt;&gt; One of my best childhood memories is\n\n130\n00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.956\nthat growing room in the Haunted Mansion.\n\n131\n00:06:19.956 --> 00:06:24.276\n&gt;&gt; She went from having a magical day to\nhaving the absolute anti-magic day after\n\n132\n00:06:24.276 --> 00:06:25.003\nwe did that.\n\n133\n00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:27.386\nThere was not any amount of magic.\n\n134\n00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.068\nThat put a smile back on that kid's face,\nI believe.\n\n135\n00:06:29.068 --> 00:06:29.783\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n136\n00:06:29.783 --> 00:06:30.503\n&gt;&gt; For years after,\n\n137\n00:06:30.503 --> 00:06:33.436\nshe, she to this day does not like\ngoing to the Haunted Mansion, right?\n\n138\n00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:35.299\nThat's how hard, how badly it scarred her.\n\n139\n00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:35.988\n&gt;&gt; Traumatized.\n\n140\n00:06:35.988 --> 00:06:38.086\n&gt;&gt; That's all random aside for\nthe episode, by the way.\n\n141\n00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:39.816\nNothing to do with Cherokee's answer.\n\n142\n00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:40.951\nBut let's get back to what you're asking.\n\n143\n00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:45.708\nSo you, what I was suggesting is just\nsimply that by default, by design,\n\n144\n00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:48.493\nwe see our own domain partitions, right?\n\n145\n00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:50.642\nThat's what we're associated with,\nis the DNS server.\n\n146\n00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:54.815\nIn Domain 1, I would have knowledge\nmy application partition for\n\n147\n00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.238\nthe DNS zone, right?\n\n148\n00:06:56.238 --> 00:06:57.192\nThe domain DNS zone,\n\n149\n00:06:57.192 --> 00:07:00.062\ncuz that's the namespace that\nI'm gonna be interacting with.\n\n150\n00:07:00.062 --> 00:07:03.809\nThat's where my thorough lookup\nzones are gonna be associated with.\n\n151\n00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:05.372\nThat's what I need to have knowledge of.\n\n152\n00:07:05.372 --> 00:07:08.625\nIf you are in your zone or\nrather in your domain in Domain 2,\n\n153\n00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:10.458\nyou don't need to know about me.\n\n154\n00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:11.654\nYou need to know about you.\n\n155\n00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:15.139\nNow when we set up forwarding,\nwe set up conditional forwarding,\n\n156\n00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.638\nwe have to do other stuff however\nwe're gonna get that knowledge.\n\n157\n00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:22.207\nWe may then be creating connections\nthat will either hardcode records or\n\n158\n00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.029\ntell us there's ways to find stuff.\n\n159\n00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:28.378\nBut we, out of the box, get knowledge\nof our own domain partition or\n\n160\n00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:31.449\nDNS domain,\nDNS zone application partition.\n\n161\n00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:35.824\nBut remember everybody gets knowledge of\nthe forest DNS zones application partition\n\n162\n00:07:35.824 --> 00:07:37.049\nreceive a copy of that.\n\n163\n00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:40.323\nThat gives us the ability to understand\nhow to talk to other systems,\n\n164\n00:07:40.323 --> 00:07:41.291\nfind other things.\n\n165\n00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:43.374\nWhen we do things like\nconditional forwarding,\n\n166\n00:07:43.374 --> 00:07:46.232\nwe program all that stuff in as we\ntalked about in another episode.\n\n167\n00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:49.672\nWe actually then can make those\nconnections work cuz we can reference that\n\n168\n00:07:49.672 --> 00:07:52.177\nknowledge in the forest\nlevel DNS application zone.\n\n169\n00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:53.413\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If we have that stored in your\n\n170\n00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:53.993\nother stuff there.\n\n171\n00:07:53.993 --> 00:07:55.225\nSo yeah, we would see that, but\n\n172\n00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.883\nit's at the forest level that we\nwould potentially see everything.\n\n173\n00:07:57.883 --> 00:08:00.239\nSo we do have Ntdsutil and/or DNS command,\n\n174\n00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:03.374\njust reminding you of the fact\nthat we can use these tools.\n\n175\n00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:06.453\nAnd if you haven't used Ntdsutil\nbefore Boy is it a hoot and a half.\n\n176\n00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:09.925\nLet me tell you what, some of my best\nhorror stories about having to manage\n\n177\n00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:13.621\nactive directory come from trying to do\nrecoveries with this tool at strange,\n\n178\n00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:16.520\nodd hours in data centers\nwhen things are not working.\n\n179\n00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.080\nI'm kidding.\nActually,\n\n180\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.670\nthe tool is not very hard to use at all.\n\n181\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.350\nBut it is important for you, and I would\nrecommend, seriously, all kidding aside,\n\n182\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.120\nif you have not used the tool before, then\nI would recommend that you take a look,\n\n183\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.140\njust down here there's some straight\nforward syntax, not very complicated.\n\n184\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.235\nAnd you could see here, and\nwe do have all the commands.\n\n185\n00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:36.090\nJust like every one of\nthese web pages does.\n\n186\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.110\nIt always gives you the information.\n\n187\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.060\nBut the nice thing about it is that you\nclick through here, and for instance,\n\n188\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.090\none of the most common uses of\nthe tool like into DS ITIL,\n\n189\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.660\nis to do an authoritative restore right\nafter restoring the Active Directory.\n\n190\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.120\nAnd back fill records that have to be put\nin that are not replicated back out again\n\n191\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.930\nbecause of problems.\n\n192\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.770\nAnd mark them as being authoritative.\n\n193\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.880\nSo things like that happen with this tool.\n\n194\n00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.740\nSo you wanna go through and\n\n195\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.660\nlook at the specifics of how to\ndo any one of these activities.\n\n196\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.240\nAnd they're listed here, just so\nyou can drill through and take a look.\n\n197\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.760\nJust so you know,\nthat's what's going on in there.\n\n198\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.460\nRemember we do have the ability to use\neither one of these to be able to go in\n\n199\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.850\nand to set up and\ncreate our partitions if need be.\n\n200\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.500\nWe've been through and talked about\nquite a bit of other stuff in here, but\n\n201\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.295\nI thought one of the other things that\nwill be interesting just to talk about\n\n202\n00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:23.500\nquickly, before we go in,\nbefore we set up our delegation,\n\n203\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.650\nI'm going to show you how to do\na delegated zone here, in just a minute.\n\n204\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.720\nBut before we do that, I thought it would\nbe interesting to talk about one other\n\n205\n00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.920\nthing, which is new to 16,\nthis is our GlobalName Zone.\n\n206\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.540\nCould we get a full screen while I'm\ntalking so we can see all the steps?\n\n207\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.810\nThe idea behind the GlobalName Zone,\nkind of interesting as well.\n\n208\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.950\nWe talked about the ability to be able\nto provide support through Win, so\n\n209\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.900\nwe kind of joked about the fact\nthat Wins is still there, and we\n\n210\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.240\nhave net BIOS space name resolution, and\nmaybe we need it, maybe we don't, right?\n\n211\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.550\nBut the reality is we have applications\nthat require it, we still have a need to\n\n212\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.600\nbe able to provide this stuff, and Global\nName Zones help us be able to do this.\n\n213\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.970\nThey're, essentially,\nwhat we call a single labeled name, right?\n\n214\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.500\nObjects.\n\n215\n00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.480\nSo we're creating a zone that represents\na single labeled name or an entity.\n\n216\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.460\nIt's gonna be unique\nacross an entire forest.\n\n217\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.910\nMeaning, hey I need an application\ncalled application X.\n\n218\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.580\nI wanna refer to the same way\nacross the entire forest.\n\n219\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.160\nI wanna be able to resolve it way,\nset it up and\n\n220\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.920\nbe able to interact with it that way.\n\n221\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.910\nI need to be able to use a Global Name\nZone in order to be able to do this,\n\n222\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.600\nbecause that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n223\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.410\nAnd so what we do is we\nprovide this name resolution.\n\n224\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.280\nTypically large enterprise\nnetworks is where we see this kind\n\n225\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.070\nof a thought process,\nthat are not going to deploy Wins.\n\n226\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.670\nSo in other words,\nwe're getting away from Wins.\n\n227\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.030\nBut we have multiple DNS environments\nthat need to have a single name\n\n228\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.250\nresolution capability across all of them.\n\n229\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.500\nBut we're no longer using the old\nstyle name resolution systems that\n\n230\n00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.450\nwould provide that.\n\n231\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.680\nWant to essentially transfer\nthat capability into DNS and\n\n232\n00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.110\nleverage this idea and\nthat's what we're getting here.\n\n233\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.250\nSo we have to set this up manually, they\ndon't exist by default, we have to go and\n\n234\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.250\nfigure them out.\n\n235\n00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.690\nWe do have to make sure that we\nare familiar with how to set them up, so\n\n236\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.390\nI put the steps up here, we're going to\nwalk through them for you really quickly.\n\n237\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.100\nIt's obviously PowerShell based,\nas you can see.\n\n238\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.120\nBut, before we talk about that, keep in\nmind because this is manually created,\n\n239\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.930\nno dynamic record\nregistration support here.\n\n240\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.440\nYou want to put a record in,\nyou've got to put it in manually.\n\n241\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.990\nIn other words we're not gonna be able to\ndo dynamic updates to the global name zone\n\n242\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.200\nthe way we do to other zones.\n\n243\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.262\nJust want to make sure we're familiar\nwith that, we have sense of that,\n\n244\n00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:25.381\nwe understand that,\nbecause that is important.\n\n245\n00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.885\nYou know we would say,\nhey it's a zone in theory,\n\n246\n00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:30.392\nwell it must support\ndynamic name resolution, or\n\n247\n00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:33.990\ndynamic name updates rather,\nunless we go in and say no, manual only.\n\n248\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.310\nWe don't have an option,\nit's only manual updates.\n\n249\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.050\nSo we want to create a record once we\nestablish a zone, we do it manually.\n\n250\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.860\nSo this is all driven, as you can see,\nby Ron as the main controller.\n\n251\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.205\nRight?\nWe're gonna create an active\n\n252\n00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.710\nDirectory-Intergrated forward lookup zone,\nI just named my ITPRO.tv for\n\n253\n00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.700\nthe example here.\n\n254\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.270\nWe're gonna be using PowerShell so,\nAdd-DnsServerPrimaryZone specify the name\n\n255\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:59.270\nparameter, specify the value,\nReplicationScope Forest, specify that.\n\n256\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.020\nJust making sure that we're\nthinking about the fact\n\n257\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.955\nthat we're gonna be using PowerShell, let\nme just step out here for just one second,\n\n258\n00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:10.930\nremind you of the fact that we do\nhave our PowerShell commands here.\n\n259\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.240\nSo we have all sorts of\nstuff going on here.\n\n260\n00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.408\nAnd if we go back up to the top\nwhere we're doing our global zones.\n\n261\n00:12:27.449 --> 00:12:32.560\nWe are going to, what am I looking for,\nI think I have it on this list.\n\n262\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.640\nI may or\nmay not be on this particular one.\n\n263\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.050\nI don't think I have it on this one.\n\n264\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.210\nAnyway, it's here somewhere.\n\n265\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.830\nI'm just not seeing it right\nnow as I scroll through quick.\n\n266\n00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.810\nCuz I'm not really seeing,\nI'm just looking quickly.\n\n267\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.420\nI'm not actually looking for it,\nper se, but you get the idea.\n\n268\n00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.800\nYou would look here for\nyour DnsServer Module command,\n\n269\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.960\nthat's just to remind you\nof what we're doing, okay.\n\n270\n00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.250\nI just wanted to show you,\nwe do have the reference for it.\n\n271\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.560\nSo Add-DNSServerPrimaryZone, and that\nwas in the list, I just didn't see it.\n\n272\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.660\nSo we have it there.\n\n273\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.700\nThen back to full screen,\nyou gotta be able to see the commands,\n\n274\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.680\nthank you very much.\n\n275\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.780\nSo we've done this.\n\n276\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.200\nThen, run the following command\nonce we set up our zone.\n\n277\n00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.160\nSo we have that set up,\n\n278\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.300\nback to Directory-integrated forward\nlookup zone, step number one.\n\n279\n00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.410\nStep number two,\nSet-DnsServerFlobalNameZone,\n\n280\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.240\nthat's gonna be the one that makes\nthis into a GlobalNameZone for\n\n281\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.960\nus after we set the initial one.\n\n282\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.140\nAlwaysQueryServer true.\n\n283\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.930\nSo, we are going to say,\nyes set the global name zone up,\n\n284\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.620\nalways query the server,\ncreate an active directory-integrated\n\n285\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.290\nforward lookup zone named ITPROGlobalNames\nby running the following command.\n\n286\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.460\nSo, we did that already.\n\n287\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.840\nReplicationScope again at the Forest.\n\n288\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.880\nThen, if we do all this,\njust scroll down, and\n\n289\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.250\nthen open our console,\nwe can then manually go in, right?\n\n290\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.260\nAnd this is where we add in the records,\n\n291\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.940\nwe manually go in and we add in whatever\nthe records are, that we need to have.\n\n292\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.490\nSo, we're adding a host\nrecord there as you can see.\n\n293\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.870\nWith whatever the name is,\n\n294\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.940\nbecause the GlobalNames zone\nat that point will show up.\n\n295\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.350\nWe'll be able to see it once we create it.\n\n296\n00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.260\nSo creating it is a process from\nthe command line with PowerShell,\n\n297\n00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.620\nthen the MMC can be used to actually\nadd the records in after the fact,\n\n298\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.260\nand then the GlobalNames zone.\n\n299\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.810\nYou then have your alias.\n\n300\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.020\nThat's gonna be whatever\nwe're gonna resolve against.\n\n301\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.840\nIn this case I called it ITPROApp1.\n\n302\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.120\nWhatever you it would be,\nwhatever you decide you want it to be.\n\n303\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.470\nBut I would put that in and that's gonna\nthen give us the ability to have that name\n\n304\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.630\nresolution consistently across the entire\nforest, that's what we're gonna be seeing.\n\n305\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.760\nSo just make sure that you're familiar\nwith the logic, lookup the commands,\n\n306\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.910\nthe Add-DNSServerPrimaryZone, and\nset-DnsGlobalServiceNameZone to\n\n307\n00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.810\nbe able to find those down in\nthe list that I was just showing you,\n\n308\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.290\nand you'll be able to then go in and setup\nyour Global Name Zone if you need to.\n\n309\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.720\nYou look like you may have had a question,\nyoung lady.\n\n310\n00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n\n311\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.115\n&gt;&gt; Not yet.\n&gt;&gt; There may be one coming.\n\n312\n00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:41.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am all aflutter with anticipation.\n\n313\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.310\nI can hardly wait.\n\n314\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.270\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure you are.\n\n315\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:43.790\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n\n316\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.060\nI fear the question, but I will go\nbravely into the rest of my dialogue,\n\n317\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.170\nhoping that the question does\nnot come back to bite us.\n\n318\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.720\nSo you'll ask whenever you have a need,\nis what you're saying?\n\n319\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, absolutely so\n\n320\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.850\nyou feel free to interrupt me any time.\n\n321\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Or, I'll do this.\n\n322\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.430\nHey.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n323\n00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.240\nSo when I see that,\n\n324\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.770\nI'm gonna run the other way and\npretend that I don't see you.\n\n325\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.450\nWe talked about how to set up\na global name, so it's important for\n\n326\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:04.970\nyou to be aware of.\n\n327\n00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.570\nThis is something, again, that you may or\nmay not have done before.\n\n328\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.060\nI'm guessing, most likely,\n\n329\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.810\nsomething you probably have not\ndone all that often if at all.\n\n330\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.970\nSo it may be good for you just to have\nknowledge of how to use global name zones,\n\n331\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.410\nbut do keep in mind the thought\nprocess about when we would use this.\n\n332\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.650\nThis is a relatively limited thought\nprocess in terms of use case.\n\n333\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.150\nThis is where we need universal name\nresolution that's gonna come out the same\n\n334\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.930\nway consistently in every area of the\nforest and we're no longer using something\n\n335\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.970\nlike Wins to drive that, and we're gonna\nsubstitute that functionality into DNS.\n\n336\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:39.190\nBecause that is a globally forest wide\nuniversal name resolution system for us,\n\n337\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.190\nbut we're gonna trick DNS into essentially\noperating the way Win solution would,\n\n338\n00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:43.857\nwithout using Wins.\n\n339\n00:15:43.857 --> 00:15:46.505\nThat's really what global name zones\nare for, and you may or may not\n\n340\n00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:49.731\nhave a need to do that, it's one of those\nthings that's nice to know it's there.\n\n341\n00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:52.755\nYou may never actually have a need to\ndo that, it'll be up to you to decide.\n\n342\n00:15:52.755 --> 00:15:56.325\nBut I promise you that if you get asked\nabout it at some point in the future,\n\n343\n00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:58.225\nperhaps, who knows, you never know,\n\n344\n00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:02.104\nwhen you are trying to accomplish a bunch\nof questions in a short amount of time.\n\n345\n00:16:02.104 --> 00:16:04.227\nWould be good to know,\nthat you can do this.\n\n346\n00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:06.046\nAnd if you didn't know how to do it,\nI bet you,\n\n347\n00:16:06.046 --> 00:16:09.930\nyou would actually be that much closer to\nfinishing all those questions positively.\n\n348\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.170\nSo what about split DNS, and\ntalk about split DNS as well.\n\n349\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.670\nAnd that was mentioned in a prior episode,\n\n350\n00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.300\njust thought I'd bring back\nthe conversation to quickly remind you of\n\n351\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.380\nwhat we do with this before we do our\ndelegation, I'm going to go in and\n\n352\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.980\nshow you how to do a delegation\nhere in just one second.\n\n353\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.350\nBut remember split DNS, the idea\nwith split DNS is the ability to set\n\n354\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.111\nup two distinctly different DNS systems,\n\n355\n00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:34.173\none inside the network in the LAN behind\nthe firewall, one traditionally more\n\n356\n00:16:34.173 --> 00:16:38.948\noft than not sitting the in DNZ outside\nof the firewall that backs the DMZ.\n\n357\n00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:42.843\nSo the difference between\nthe semi-protected and the DMZ network and\n\n358\n00:16:42.843 --> 00:16:46.803\nthe totally internal network, the LAN,\nhave DNS service involved but\n\n359\n00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:50.829\nhave them specifically designed in\ntasks with doing resolution just for\n\n360\n00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:52.610\nresources in that area.\n\n361\n00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.480\nAnd I mentioned this is a security\nissue back when we were just doing\n\n362\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.080\nthe high level overview.\n\n363\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.260\nInternal clients are configured with\nthe IP address of the Active Directory\n\n364\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.260\nintegrated Unix servers on the LAN.\n\n365\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.890\nThey do their resolution there.\n\n366\n00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.570\nAnything that has to go out will go\nto the DMZ based DNS service for\n\n367\n00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.970\nexternal resolution.\n\n368\n00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.620\nThe trick here would be that you don't\nwant the external DNS servers and\n\n369\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.460\nthe DMZ being able to query and\nask for information from inside.\n\n370\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.500\nSo I mention you may setup a firewall\nrule on the inside firewall,\n\n371\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.040\nthe back end of the DMC that\nit's between these two systems.\n\n372\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.560\nYou would manipulate the firewall there\nand prevent inbound DNS resolution from\n\n373\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.900\nthose DMC base DNS servers\nrejecting all the DNS.\n\n374\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.560\nUDP base port 20,\nUDP base port 53, excuse me.\n\n375\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.560\nQueries coming in to the internal\nnetwork from the parameter\n\n376\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.810\npreventing those DMZ based DNS servers\nfrom requesting information and\n\n377\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.960\nexposing DNS records outside.\n\n378\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.730\nMaybe a zone transfer.\n\n379\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.580\nMaybe somebody trying to manipulate and\nmap or go out and\n\n380\n00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.650\nfind our DNS infrastructure,\ndump all the DNS records and\n\n381\n00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.900\nget a map as to what's going on\non the inside of the network.\n\n382\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.440\nWe can use split DNS to\nprevent this from happening\n\n383\n00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.340\nif we're smart about how we set this up.\n\n384\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.920\nSo it is important for\nus to think about that.\n\n385\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.300\nJust have that thought process in mind.\n\n386\n00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.780\nThis is part of from my\nperspective I would at\n\n387\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.360\nleast define us the larger conversation\non our enterprise security architecture.\n\n388\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.030\nYou ever saw and\ntry to bring that conversation back in\n\n389\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:21.220\naround some of these network services\nthat are vital to our health and success.\n\n390\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.930\nIn terms of running networks\nespecially these days.\n\n391\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.220\nIn Microsoft World everything\nis DNS integrated.\n\n392\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.350\nI made jokes in one of the earlier\nepisodes about doing away with DNS and\n\n393\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.370\nif we did that how the world would\nliterally change, and it would.\n\n394\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.640\nI mean, if you imagine, there's no\ninfrastructure that we run today,\n\n395\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.790\nalmost without exception that\ndoesn't touch the NS at some point.\n\n396\n00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.650\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n397\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:44.660\nif we were exposing that unnecessarily,\nwe may actually lead our systems\n\n398\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.260\nmuch much closer to being compromised\nwithout necessarily meaning to do so.\n\n399\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.610\nIt is something just to be aware of and\nto think about.\n\n400\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.700\nAll right, having said that,\nwhat I want to do is I want to jump in.\n\n401\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.810\nI want to extend our lab timer\nwhile I'm getting ready to do this.\n\n402\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.610\nWant to jump in and\n\n403\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.170\nI want to show you how to do this\ndelegation that I was talking about.\n\n404\n00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.910\nThis is an important thought process.\n\n405\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.110\nWe're gonna take a zone that\nwe've already created and\n\n406\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.280\ndelegate out the information and\nthe management around it, so\n\n407\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.880\nwe can have it managed and\nseen from different locations.\n\n408\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.060\nSo let's go in and take a look.\n\n409\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.290\nI'm just gonna bring up\nour domain controller.\n\n410\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.413\nLet me just look for the right machine.\n\n411\n00:19:17.413 --> 00:19:19.840\nOur DCs are there we go!\n\n412\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.710\nI got smart, I put them all up on the\nconsole, so I can see the names as I go\n\n413\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.110\nthrough instead of remembering\nwhat order their in.\n\n414\n00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.990\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna start\nover here, I'm on the practicelabs.com\n\n415\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:34.490\ndomain or rather in the practicelab.com\ndomain on the practicelab.com zone\n\n416\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.190\nis you could see in the DNS server,\nlet's come and deal with this.\n\n417\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.293\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndelegate this out.\n\n418\n00:19:39.293 --> 00:19:42.395\nSo what I'm gonna do is the following.\n\n419\n00:19:42.395 --> 00:19:46.204\nLet me come here, let me come here,\nlet's go in and click on this side of\n\n420\n00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:50.713\nNew Delegation right here, and we're gonna\ngo ahead and run a little New Delegation\n\n421\n00:19:50.713 --> 00:19:55.010\nwizard, I'm just gonna bring this\ndown here in center so you can see.\n\n422\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.660\nClick Next.\n\n423\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.120\nPull that up just a smidge.\n\n424\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.570\nSo what's the delegated zone gonna\nbe within practicelabs.com, so\n\n425\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.830\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'm gonna put in the zone now.\n\n426\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.255\nBefore I do this or while I'm doing this,\nlet me switch over here for one second.\n\n427\n00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:16.106\nAnd what I've done is right\nhere on my DM1 server.\n\n428\n00:20:16.106 --> 00:20:19.937\nThis is just another server I've\nadded DNS to, you'll see I have\n\n429\n00:20:19.937 --> 00:20:24.550\nAPAC.PracticeLabs.com already set up\nas a forward lookup zone right here.\n\n430\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.600\nIt's been setup and registered\nas being hosted on this machine.\n\n431\n00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.745\nI'm creating a delegation for this zone\non the Practice practicelabs.com server.\n\n432\n00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:33.625\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n433\n00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:38.305\nSo just wanted you to see that the name\na p a c, APAC, is the subzone or\n\n434\n00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.745\nthe delegation for\nthis is actually already created.\n\n435\n00:20:40.745 --> 00:20:41.675\nWe're just referencing it.\n\n436\n00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:43.045\nThat's what we're going to pull in.\n\n437\n00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:45.225\nSo just wanted you to see\nwhere that's coming from.\n\n438\n00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:46.825\nSo let me come back over here, right?\n\n439\n00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:49.155\nSo we're going to do\nAPAC.practicelabs.com, so\n\n440\n00:20:49.155 --> 00:20:51.480\nyou could see we have that there.\n\n441\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.830\nJust click Next, right?\n\n442\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.010\nSo now what we're gonna do\nis add in the DNS server or\n\n443\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.890\nthe name server that's\ngonna host that zone, well,\n\n444\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.970\nI already showed you where it was, it's\non the lab, in this case DM01 machine.\n\n445\n00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.480\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nadd this in, so I'm gonna grab this,\n\n446\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.425\nwe'll go ahead and type this in here,\nlabdm01.practicelabs.\n\n447\n00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:16.770\n.com, resolve.\n\n448\n00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.040\nYou could see it comes up,\nknows the IP address.\n\n449\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.280\nGreen is always good,\n1026802, validation, OK.\n\n450\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.480\nAgain, if we had more than one server\nhere IP address of DNS record,\n\n451\n00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.510\nif we had more than one DNS server\nthat was going to host this zone.\n\n452\n00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.420\nWe have multiple name servers there.\n\n453\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.700\nI may have more than one\nIP address listed here.\n\n454\n00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.720\nI can move up and\ndown the we talked about this.\n\n455\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.030\nClick OK, we have got that.\n\n456\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.510\nWe obviously are going\nto have just the one.\n\n457\n00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.520\nWe will click Next there.\n\n458\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.110\nWe will click Finish.\n\n459\n00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.320\nGive that just a second notice\nnow under practicelabs.com.\n\n460\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.730\nI now have a folder down here for A pack.\n\n461\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.190\nJust click there, you can see we\nnow have the nameserver record,\n\n462\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.550\nthe references where it is\nhosted on the other server.\n\n463\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.410\nAnd I know it's hard to see,\nlet me just kinda click up one so\n\n464\n00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.660\nyou maybe able to see.\n\n465\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.650\nIf we go full screen, it may be easier for\nyou to tell for just a second.\n\n466\n00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.390\nBut I'm just highlighting above it, so you\ncan see there is a difference in the icon.\n\n467\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.910\nA lot of these are just standard,\nnormal folders.\n\n468\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.710\nBut if you look carefully you can see\nthat this one is a gray background.\n\n469\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.186\nIt's got I guess what would be\nmaybe just a piece of paper or\n\n470\n00:22:17.186 --> 00:22:19.011\nsomething that's sitting in the middle.\n\n471\n00:22:19.011 --> 00:22:23.133\nIt's the same icon as the _msdcs zone.\n\n472\n00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.907\nAnd you can see here the delegated\nzone underneath here.\n\n473\n00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:28.020\nSo you could see the icon looks the same.\n\n474\n00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.330\nBut that's the icon,\nit does look different.\n\n475\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.140\nAnd so once we've done this, once we've\nset this up and we've registered this,\n\n476\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.870\nand it's all set and ready to go.\n\n477\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.170\nWe then can see, right as you can see\nhere, that we have this all set up.\n\n478\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.410\nThat's all we need to do for\nour delegation, but\n\n479\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.540\nwhat this allows us to do it to reference,\nfor anybody who comes here and\n\n480\n00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.830\nsays, practicelabs.com,\nI need to find information about that.\n\n481\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.240\nI want to find specifically\napac.practicelabs.com or\n\n482\n00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.720\nwhatever the zone is that we've\ncreated the delegation for.\n\n483\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.150\nI now can actually give out a NS\nrecord reference right here and\n\n484\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:08.010\nI can say you, no, right,\npLAB DC 01 practicelabs.com, right?\n\n485\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.540\nI, I'm sorry, whoops.\n\n486\n00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.240\nWrong one.\n\n487\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.600\nClick on the right one here.\n\n488\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.540\nThat pLAB DM 01 is actually where you\nwant to go to find that information.\n\n489\n00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.400\nSo this is essentially just,\nit's not forwarding, I want to be\n\n490\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.680\ncareful what I say because we're not\nforwarding in the traditional sense.\n\n491\n00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.430\nWe're creating a delegation that gives us\nthe ability to give out information and\n\n492\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.370\nsay, yeah, I actually can help you\nto understand where that is and\n\n493\n00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.810\nresolve that for you, right?\n\n494\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.690\nSo that's gonna give us the ability\nto provide additional information for\n\n495\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.830\nusers that need to resolve this.\n\n496\n00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.280\nAnd so that way when they go and say, hey,\n\n497\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.620\nI need to find out apack.practicelabs.com,\nwhat they really ultimately winding up\n\n498\n00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.620\ndoing is they're coming over to this\nmachine as you can see and seeing this.\n\n499\n00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.140\nWe're able to direct them to that machine\nwhen they resolve or they query us,\n\n500\n00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.240\nbecause we now have the name server\nrecord that tell us where it is.\n\n501\n00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.360\nSo we're actually able to find it.\n\n502\n00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.730\nThat's what a delegation will do for us.\n\n503\n00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.230\n&gt;&gt; So they're essentially\njust reading that record.\n\n504\n00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.300\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're providing it.\n\n505\n00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.860\nRemember, the DNS server providing\nanswers to queries when you come in and\n\n506\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.380\nask questions.\n\n507\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.740\nSo we're able to provide it to them and\nsay, by the way,\n\n508\n00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.830\nwe really need to go here or\nwe're able to get that information.\n\n509\n00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.960\nEither we go get it or\nthe system is told to go get it,\n\n510\n00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.530\nit's a question as to what kind of queries\nwe're asking, what can it do, but yeah.\n\n511\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.409\nEssentially, indirectly they're\nbeing made aware of it.\n\n512\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.400\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; That one.\n\n513\n00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n514\n00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.040\n&gt;&gt; Did you have that question?\n\n515\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.040\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; Did we come up on that question?\n\n516\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.840\nIt's almost like playing Mine Sweeper\nwhere, you know I'm clicking on the box.\n\n517\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Trying\nto see if there's a mine there.\n\n518\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.320\nI'm waiting for\nthe flag to come up that says wait,\n\n519\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.590\nthere's a question right off\nto the left or the right.\n\n520\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.505\nWithin one square.\n\n521\n00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:36.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So do we have a question?\n\n522\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.260\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I kind of ask these\nquestions because it seems like someone\n\n523\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.410\nelse might have these other questions and\nit might help them.\n\n524\n00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Of course, absolutely.\n\n525\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.912\n&gt;&gt; It would.\n\n526\n00:24:43.912 --> 00:24:47.530\n&gt;&gt; No, the only other question was look\nwe've been talking about DNS for awhile,\n\n527\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.090\nis there anything else we need to know\nabout DNS for this particular exam?\n\n528\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.155\n&gt;&gt; There's always additional stuff for\nDNS.\n\n529\n00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:54.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We\n\n530\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.480\ndo have some interesting topics\nstill to come believe it or not.\n\n531\n00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.750\nThey are gonna be in another episode,\nwe don't have time for\n\n532\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.780\nthem here but DNS policy,\nvery important to think about those.\n\n533\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.750\nGonna do a little hands on demo for\nyou For DNS policies,\n\n534\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.270\nhe'll probably want to say\na few words about that.\n\n535\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.275\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And there may be\n\n536\n00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:11.871\nsome other small things there as well,\nthat I'm sure we can think of reporting.\n\n537\n00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:13.900\n&gt;&gt; LIke extra prizes?\n\n538\n00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.724\nLike having two prizes\nin the Cracker Jack box?\n\n539\n00:25:14.724 --> 00:25:18.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah! Absolutely. I think that\nwould be totally an apropos way\n\n540\n00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:20.623\nof thinking about that.\n\n541\n00:25:20.623 --> 00:25:21.695\nSo take a Cracker Jack analogy,\nthat'll be good.\n\n542\n00:25:21.695 --> 00:25:22.871\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthat sounds like a good deal.\n\n543\n00:25:22.871 --> 00:25:24.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n544\n00:25:24.158 --> 00:25:27.524\n&gt;&gt; So ladies and gentlemen stay tuned,\nbecause we have some cracker jacks headed\n\n545\n00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:30.340\nyour way, but for this show we're\ngonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n546\n00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.130\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n547\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.440\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n548\n00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.374\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n549\n00:25:37.374 --> 00:25:43.532\n[MUSIC]\n\n550\n00:25:43.532 --> 00:25:46.124\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 Series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.880\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.290\nWe've been digging in DNS for\n\n9\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.800\na while, and we're gonna continue to do so\nwithin this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.900\nSpecifically we'll be taking\na look at DNS policies.\n\n11\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.060\nAnd back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.750\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.\n\n14\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.850\nHope you're all doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.540\nWe're going to jump right in and\ntalk about DNS policies.\n\n16\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.438\nThis is a new feature in server 2016 for\nDNS.\n\n17\n00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.648\nIt's actually a really cool one,\nby the way.\n\n18\n00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:44.582\nSo what if I was to tell you that we\ncould show you, all of you and of course,\n\n19\n00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.605\nby extension, you.\n\n20\n00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:49.720\nShow everybody, a way in which\nwe could use DNS to be able to,\n\n21\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.670\nand DNS policies kind\nof speak to the idea.\n\n22\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.470\nProbably in your mind,\nyou are already thinking well,\n\n23\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.470\nsome sort of management capability,\nmaybe we can apply some sort of standard,\n\n24\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.200\nmaybe of conditions,\ndo something associated with that.\n\n25\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.120\nDefinitely all of that, but\n\n26\n00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.640\nbasically the idea is things like\ngeolocation based traffic management,\n\n27\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.005\nintelligent DNS responses based\non conditions like time of day.\n\n28\n00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.470\nAnd/or making sure, we talked\nabout that split brain concept for\n\n29\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.320\nDNS in the prior episode, making sure\nwe're able to go ahead and manage\n\n30\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.350\nthe configuration of that so we know which\nsystem we're responding to and from.\n\n31\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.030\nIf we're internal,\nwe get DNS from the internal servers.\n\n32\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.260\nExternal, we get them from the external,\nfilter DNS queries,\n\n33\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.440\nall sorts of stuff that we can do.\n\n34\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.662\nSo let's take a look real quick\nat the overview on DNS policies.\n\n35\n00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:34.900\nI'm gonna set this up and show you how\nto walk through the logic of using\n\n36\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.380\nPowerShell to configure this\ncuz that's how we do this.\n\n37\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.290\nAnd then of course, from there, we just\nput it to the test and see whether or\n\n38\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.165\nnot the conditions actually are working.\n\n39\n00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.990\nBut we got a nice little brief\noverview here for you on DNS policies.\n\n40\n00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.140\nSo I mentioned application load balancing,\nbeing able to ensure, as you can see here,\n\n41\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.320\nthat we have multiple instances of\napplications, different locations.\n\n42\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.950\nDNS policies can balance traffic so\nthat we understand how to\n\n43\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.720\nbe able to dynamically allocate\ntraffic load for the application.\n\n44\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880\nWe could use DNS to be able to do that.\n\n45\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.910\nGeolocation based traffic management,\nprimary and secondary DNS Service respond\n\n46\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.540\nto queries based on geographic\nlocation of the resource.\n\n47\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.240\nSo we could say, hey,\n\n48\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.410\nif you're in the Latin American region, we\nshould be giving you DNS from this area.\n\n49\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.440\nIf you're in the Europe or Asian region,\nwe should be giving it to you from here.\n\n50\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.600\nAnd policies can do that\nbased on where we are and\n\n51\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.370\nspecify what server should respond.\n\n52\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.660\nAgain, owning the global infrastructure,\n\n53\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.260\nbeing within that thought process\nacross the entire organization.\n\n54\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.360\nWe could use something like that.\n\n55\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.700\nWe talked about split DNS,\nand the Split Brain concept.\n\n56\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.020\nTalked about filtering, I love this one.\n\n57\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.340\nAnd I love the way they\ndescribed it as well.\n\n58\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.910\nBut I love this.\n\n59\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.300\nI just think this is so cool.\n\n60\n00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.085\nSo anyway, here, forensics, right,\n\n61\n00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:45.443\nyou can use DNS policy to redirect\nmalicious DNS clients to non-existent IP\n\n62\n00:02:45.443 --> 00:02:49.131\naddress instead of directing them to the\ncomputers that they're trying to reach.\n\n63\n00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:52.765\nIn other words, you could essentially you\ncan take somebody inbound that's trying to\n\n64\n00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:56.299\nfind a legitimate server or a legitimate\nresource knowing that they're coming in,\n\n65\n00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.210\nessentially from a place they're\nnot supposed to come up to no good.\n\n66\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.294\nAnd we can just send them off\ninto a black hole and say, hey,\n\n67\n00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:03.040\nyou know what you don't belong here.\n\n68\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.310\nAnd just send them over to somebody\nelse's network, let them bother them.\n\n69\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.670\n&gt;&gt; So I actually listened\nto a podcast last night.\n\n70\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.470\nI don't know if you know.\n\n71\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.557\nDon does a lot of podcasts for\nSecurity Weekly.\n\n72\n00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:12.268\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n73\n00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:15.502\n&gt;&gt; And that was one of their,\nthe entire preface was-\n\n74\n00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:16.581\n&gt;&gt; The idea of what we just talked about.\n\n75\n00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:17.800\n&gt;&gt; Deceptive technologies.\n\n76\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.562\nAnd they said that that coupled with,\nobvious traditional\n\n77\n00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:27.713\nsecurity methodologies, and\nit was a really beneficial tool.\n\n78\n00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:30.588\nA lot of large companies are really\nbenefitting from that today, so\n\n79\n00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:31.650\nit's pretty cool.\n\n80\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.053\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's part of the broader thought\nprocess about threat mitigation, right?\n\n81\n00:03:35.053 --> 00:03:38.120\nThis idea of just dealing with threats\nin near real-time or real-time.\n\n82\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.472\nAnd the idea of being able to\nuse a variety of technologies.\n\n83\n00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:41.800\nI didn't hear the podcast, so\n\n84\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.410\nI'm not sure what it's\nspecifically designed to address.\n\n85\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.850\nBut I was talking about this to one of\nmy other students last night as well.\n\n86\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.040\nWe had a long conversation\nabout the fact that\n\n87\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.330\nhe's looking to kind of get into research.\n\n88\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.400\nHe was going back to college,\nwants to get a degree in Computer and\n\n89\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.600\nIT Sciences, and things like that.\n\n90\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.000\nUltimately, wants to go into research and\ndevelop all sorts of crazy things.\n\n91\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.890\n&gt;&gt; Pretty awesome.\n\n92\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.870\n&gt;&gt; It is very awesome.\n\n93\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.600\nIt's very, very cool.\n\n94\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.732\nAnd we were talking about just different\noptions, what programs are out there,\n\n95\n00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:09.711\nwhat's good to look at.\n\n96\n00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:12.823\nAnd one of the things he's really\ninterested in is looking at\n\n97\n00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:17.035\nhow we can use artificial intelligence\nconsfigurestic systems to be able to drive\n\n98\n00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:21.001\nthreat response using realtime or\nalmost realtime aggregated data feeds for\n\n99\n00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.238\nthreat intelligence.\n\n100\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:25.838\nAnd be able to then design systems\nthat can essentially morph and-\n\n101\n00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:26.360\n&gt;&gt; Respond to that way.\n\n102\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.550\n&gt;&gt; Redefine themselves and respond in real\ntime to threats that are either perceived\n\n103\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.190\nor are coming in, in real times.\n\n104\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.220\nSo you're talking about some\nreally incredibly complicated,\n\n105\n00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.480\nbut very cool capabilities.\n\n106\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.200\nSo yeah, it is a pretty neat\nway of looking at the world.\n\n107\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.330\nAll right, so having said that, let's take\na look at how DNS policies actually work.\n\n108\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.335\nThis is a pretty cool technology, right?\n\n109\n00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:46.680\nSo what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n110\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.140\nWe're sitting on our DNS server here.\n\n111\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.720\nLet me just show you quickly where we are.\n\n112\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.930\nYou'll probably recognize this box.\n\n113\n00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.483\nThis is our domain controller,\nas you can see here.\n\n114\n00:04:54.483 --> 00:04:56.900\nAnd what we're gonna do\nis just walk through.\n\n115\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.350\nAnd we're going to use a bunch\nof PowerShell commands,\n\n116\n00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.230\ngot them teed up and\nstart entering them in.\n\n117\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.275\nBut I'm smart this time.\n\n118\n00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:05.713\nTyped them all out ahead of time.\n\n119\n00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:06.830\nGonna paste them all in for you,\n\n120\n00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.792\nso you don't have to worry about all those\nlittle typos that occur from time to time.\n\n121\n00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.422\nWe're gonna do that,\nwalk through about seven or\n\n122\n00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:15.360\neight different commands we have to use\nto specify various aspects of the set up.\n\n123\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.030\nOnce we've done that we have our\nzone here already, PLtest.com, so\n\n124\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.520\nyou can see we've got that set up.\n\n125\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.730\nSo we're going to be able to use that.\n\n126\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.810\nAnd then we'll switch over to our Windows\n10 client, and do a little IP config and\n\n127\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.659\ndo a little flush DNS and pull down some\ninformation, attempt connections and\n\n128\n00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.724\nsee whether we violate the policy or not.\n\n129\n00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:34.940\nAnd you'll just verify what's happening\nbased on whether the policy should or\n\n130\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.720\nshould not allow us to\nbe able to see things.\n\n131\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.611\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat that in just a moment.\n\n132\n00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.790\nAll right, so first command is here.\n\n133\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.720\nAdd dns server client subnet.\n\n134\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.380\nSo we're going to add a client subnet\nhere called DMEA, IPv4 subnet.\n\n135\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.010\nYou'll see what that's set up to do.\n\n136\n00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.280\nLet me just hit Enter there.\n\n137\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.950\nWe'll put that one in real quick.\n\n138\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.068\nAs I said, I've got a series of\nthese commands already set up here.\n\n139\n00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:57.710\nI'm just gonna walk through one at a time\nand go ahead and paste them in and\n\n140\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.970\nthat way, we have them all set and\nready to go.\n\n141\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.930\nI don't have to worry about any typos or\nanything like that.\n\n142\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.410\nSo I'm gonna just add that one in there.\n\n143\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.475\nYou can see that I've got that one there.\n\n144\n00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:10.386\nI will just go ahead and we'll click\nhere real quick cuz when I paste,\n\n145\n00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:14.230\nI have to click in order to activate and\njust replace that last one and\n\n146\n00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.320\nthat way it works.\n\n147\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.070\nSo I've just added two client subnets,\none called DMEA, one called APAC.\n\n148\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.520\nRemember, I said we could use one of the\nthings we could use is through geologic or\n\n149\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.690\ngeolocation for management, right?\n\n150\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.690\nSo we can create these subnets in theory,\nspecify a label for them,\n\n151\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.862\npretend they're in different parts\nof the world, that kind of thing.\n\n152\n00:06:31.862 --> 00:06:34.878\nAll right, so now we'll go ahead and\nwe'll create our server zone scope.\n\n153\n00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:36.152\nWe're gonna have the zone there.\n\n154\n00:06:36.152 --> 00:06:38.940\nAs you could see, we've already got it,\ncalled pltest.com.\n\n155\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.530\nI'm gonna add to it and I'm gonna add\nan DMEA zone scope and an APAC zone scope.\n\n156\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.840\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n157\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.468\nLet me just grab this real quick and\njust copy.\n\n158\n00:06:50.468 --> 00:06:53.710\nAnd we'll go ahead,\nwe'll put this one in over here.\n\n159\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.920\nAnd I did show you that the pltest.com\nzone is already set up on the server.\n\n160\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.580\nThe only thing I did ahead of time\nwas just put that in already, so\n\n161\n00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.920\nI didn't have to bother to go ahead and\ncreate that.\n\n162\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.612\nSo that's there.\n\n163\n00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:07.685\nAll right, so let's just put that in,\nand we've got that.\n\n164\n00:07:07.685 --> 00:07:11.198\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll add our other one in here as well.\n\n165\n00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:17.811\nSo we're gonna add in our one for\nAPAC, so let's just go ahead and\n\n166\n00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.753\ndo that real quick, and,\nput that one in there.\n\n167\n00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:27.570\nClick there, there, and do that.\n\n168\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.320\nAdd our APACZoneScope, and remember,\nwhile we have that open real quick,\n\n169\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.270\nwe can come over here.\n\n170\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.114\nAnd remember, sometimes, right, we do need\nto refresh just to see what's going on,\n\n171\n00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:41.411\nright, make sure that\neverything is up to date.\n\n172\n00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:43.802\nSo we're not normally\ngonna have this open and\n\n173\n00:07:43.802 --> 00:07:47.799\nwork with this whole thing while we're\nin here going through it in real time.\n\n174\n00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:52.230\nI'm just refreshing just to make\nsure that a server is available.\n\n175\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.235\nSo everything is good there.\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\n\n176\n00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:57.205\nlet us grab our next one.\n\n177\n00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:00.587\nLet's add our DNS server\nresource record to the zone.\n\n178\n00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:04.362\nGonna add one,\nas you can see there, right?\n\n179\n00:08:04.362 --> 00:08:07.069\nWith a zone scope for EMEA.\n\n180\n00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:11.780\nSo we've already got a host\nrecord called www world wide web,\n\n181\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.142\nin other words, in that zone.\n\n182\n00:08:14.142 --> 00:08:15.919\nJust show you that real\nquick before I add.\n\n183\n00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.384\nI've already got one there,\nas you can see, right?\n\n184\n00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:22.312\nSo I'm gonna add in, whoops!\n\n185\n00:08:22.312 --> 00:08:24.005\nAdd in another one.\n\n186\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.949\nAlright, so I've got that one there,\nso let's go ahead.\n\n187\n00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:31.850\nLet's go back in to PowerShell, or\nlet's copy and then go to PowerShell, and\n\n188\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.348\nlet's add that one in.\n\n189\n00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:38.346\nSo I'm going to go grab that here,\nput that there,\n\n190\n00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:41.497\nclick here, do that, do that.\n\n191\n00:08:41.497 --> 00:08:42.863\nDo that, all right.\n\n192\n00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:46.564\nAnd so now in the pltest.com zone, right?\n\n193\n00:08:46.564 --> 00:08:50.655\nWe've added in another host, record IPv\naddress are added to the host record, but\n\n194\n00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.234\nwe've said we wanna put that and\nscope it for the zone, the media scope.\n\n195\n00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.400\nOur media zone scope, one or APAC,\nwe'll do the same thing essentially.\n\n196\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.560\nJust modify that for APAC.\n\n197\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.755\nSo we're just adding in, stepping\nthrough one at a time and just going in.\n\n198\n00:09:02.755 --> 00:09:08.083\nYou'll see that the APEC zone is gonna\nbe 1.1 as opposed to 0.1, right?\n\n199\n00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:09.978\nSo we're gonna add that one in as well.\n\n200\n00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:14.954\nBecause remember that our two subnets\nup there, one was 1.1, one was 1.0, so\n\n201\n00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.647\nwe're just adding as we go.\n\n202\n00:09:16.647 --> 00:09:21.923\nSo let's just copy there and\njust paste here.\n\n203\n00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:28.509\nDo that, let's go there,\ndo that and do that, do that.\n\n204\n00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:32.532\nSo now we're gonna get in and\nactually set the query resolution policy.\n\n205\n00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:35.288\nAll that stuff we did up until now\nwas just setting up the zones,\n\n206\n00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:38.408\nsetting up the subnets, the client subnet,\nall that stuff, all the,\n\n207\n00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:40.553\njust the backend architecture,\nall the logic.\n\n208\n00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:42.369\nAnd the structure we would need.\n\n209\n00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:46.269\nNow these last two commands,\nadd DNS server query resolution policy,\n\n210\n00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:48.416\nprobably tell what that does, right?\n\n211\n00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:50.473\nWe're gonna give it a name,\nEMEA and or APAC.\n\n212\n00:09:50.473 --> 00:09:54.906\nAction will be set to Allow, what are we\nallowing client subnet called whatever\n\n213\n00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.968\nequal to, in this case EMEA or APAC.\n\n214\n00:09:56.968 --> 00:10:01.283\nAnd then the zone scope for\nwhatever we specify, zone name pltest.com.\n\n215\n00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:05.289\nWe're gonna allow this information\nto be seen and or used.\n\n216\n00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:09.416\nAnd so we're setting a query resolution\npolicy, specifically to control what kind\n\n217\n00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.553\nof information will come back based\non factors that we provide or\n\n218\n00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:16.058\ninformation we provide from the client\nwhen we're trying to use that.\n\n219\n00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:19.034\nSo we're gonna choose Copy here.\n\n220\n00:10:19.034 --> 00:10:20.832\nLet's go over here.\n\n221\n00:10:20.832 --> 00:10:22.595\nPaste that in.\n\n222\n00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:24.306\nDo that, let's do that.\n\n223\n00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:26.092\nDo that, let's do that.\n\n224\n00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:29.199\nWe've got our first one in there,\nI'm just gonna do the last one right now.\n\n225\n00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:32.593\nSo add the other one in for\nthe APAC Policy.\n\n226\n00:10:32.593 --> 00:10:34.540\nWe just did the EMEA Policy.\n\n227\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.286\nJust do the APAC Policy.\n\n228\n00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:40.802\nAnd let's grab that one.\n\n229\n00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:42.880\nGrab one that there.\n\n230\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.074\nLet's go over here,\nlet's just do that and do that.\n\n231\n00:10:46.074 --> 00:10:47.373\nDo that, give out a second.\n\n232\n00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:49.974\nAll right, so\nwhat we've done essentially there, right?\n\n233\n00:10:49.974 --> 00:10:52.465\nIs gone through about eight\nsteps approximately, right?\n\n234\n00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:53.677\nAdd everything in, and\n\n235\n00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:57.442\nnow what we're gonna do is I'm gonna\nswitch over to the Windows 10 box.\n\n236\n00:10:57.442 --> 00:11:00.855\nAnd based on the subnet I'm coming from,\nwe're gonna see whether this policy does\n\n237\n00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:03.095\nor does not work and\nthen we can modify it a little bit and\n\n238\n00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.453\nplay around with it to see what\nthe effect of that will be.\n\n239\n00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:08.309\nRemember we've essentially\ndeclared two subnets, so\n\n240\n00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:13.669\nthe idea is whether we're connecting from\n192.68.0 or 192.168.1 network, right?\n\n241\n00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:17.332\nSlash 24, three octets of the four being\nused for the network, so we have two\n\n242\n00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:21.293\ndistinctly different networks or subnets,\nwe're gonna be able to play with here.\n\n243\n00:11:21.293 --> 00:11:24.211\nSo we're gonna just see if from a Windows\n10 perspective what happens when we're\n\n244\n00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:24.718\nconnecting.\n\n245\n00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:29.109\nSo let's switch over to the Windows 10\nbox, got that already set up right here.\n\n246\n00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:31.515\nMade sure I have my hostname there so\nI don't get confused and\n\n247\n00:11:31.515 --> 00:11:34.878\nknow which machine we're connecting to,\ncuz mama didn't raise no fools, right?\n\n248\n00:11:34.878 --> 00:11:36.100\nYou do that once in a demo.\n\n249\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You learn the hard way,\n\n250\n00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:38.644\nyou don't do it again.\n\n251\n00:11:38.644 --> 00:11:40.254\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna do is just go in here and\n\n252\n00:11:40.254 --> 00:11:41.549\nlet me just move\nthe command line over here.\n\n253\n00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:43.659\nJust a little bit, that way you\ncould see this a little bit easier.\n\n254\n00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:47.284\nAll right, so\nlet's do our ipconfig in here real quick.\n\n255\n00:11:47.284 --> 00:11:52.966\nAnd we'll do a flush DNS just to clear\nout whatever may be in there right now.\n\n256\n00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:54.446\nSo let's just do that.\n\n257\n00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:55.086\nYou know what?\n\n258\n00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:56.051\nI'm not in as an administrator.\n\n259\n00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:57.091\nHold on one second.\n\n260\n00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:02.791\nI forgot to load that as an administrator,\nso let me go in and\n\n261\n00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:07.354\njust run the command\nline as an administrator.\n\n262\n00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.928\nForgot to set that up.\n\n263\n00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:13.518\nLet's go in there and, where am I?\n\n264\n00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:14.795\nHere.\n\n265\n00:12:14.795 --> 00:12:16.120\nAdministrative.\n\n266\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.224\nNo, administrative tools, it should under,\nup under Accessories, right?\n\n267\n00:12:19.224 --> 00:12:24.258\nCommand.\n\n268\n00:12:24.258 --> 00:12:26.070\nDid I mention how much I love Windows 10?\n\n269\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Just, yeah, If you do it run line.\n\n270\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.983\n&gt;&gt; Windows system.\n\n271\n00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.071\nNo, it's just Windows system.\n\n272\n00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:33.536\nI just moved it, I forgot where it was.\n\n273\n00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:39.309\nLet me just scroll down here, and\nthere we go, run as Administrator.\n\n274\n00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:40.617\nI just wanna get it and\nrun it as Administrator,\n\n275\n00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:41.445\nit's what I was looking for.\n\n276\n00:12:41.445 --> 00:12:42.572\nThere we go right there, all right.\n\n277\n00:12:42.572 --> 00:12:45.010\nSo let me just open that\nup as an administrator, so\n\n278\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.703\nI have rights to be able to do that.\n\n279\n00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:49.126\nI'm just gonna make it a little bigger so\nyou guys can see what I'm doing.\n\n280\n00:12:49.126 --> 00:12:52.490\nSo I'm just gonna make that 18 point,\nso you can see that.\n\n281\n00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.568\nLet's just make that large, right there.\n\n282\n00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:57.750\nAnd let's just make that\nscreen text yellow.\n\n283\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.768\nThat way you guys can see\nthat a little bit easier.\n\n284\n00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:02.793\nIt's probably to keep track of what\nwe're doing when we do it that way.\n\n285\n00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:05.164\nAll right, so now we can go ahead.\n\n286\n00:13:05.164 --> 00:13:12.129\nLet's do our ipconfig and\nlet's do our flushdns.\n\n287\n00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:13.610\nAll right, so we're able to do that.\n\n288\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.413\nNow let me do an nslook up.\n\n289\n00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:19.617\nRemember we talked about using NS lookup.\n\n290\n00:13:19.617 --> 00:13:24.249\nAnd NS lookup is just that command line\ntool that lets us do a variety of things.\n\n291\n00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:27.865\nWe can manage DNS servers with it,\nwe can also it for basic name resolution,\n\n292\n00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.854\nwe could do a lookup like I'm about to do.\n\n293\n00:13:29.854 --> 00:13:33.920\nSo if I do www.pltest.com, right?\n\n294\n00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:37.457\nWait for that to come back.\n\n295\n00:13:37.457 --> 00:13:41.431\nYou'll see it comes back and\ntells me right there,\n\n296\n00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:46.431\nthat our server for\naddress 192.168.0.1, right?\n\n297\n00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:47.942\nIs giving me that information.\n\n298\n00:13:47.942 --> 00:13:51.032\nThat's our DNS server that's coming back,\nserving that up to us, and\n\n299\n00:13:51.032 --> 00:13:55.071\nthat's actually coming, Right out\n\n300\n00:13:55.071 --> 00:14:00.544\nof, Right?\n\n301\n00:14:00.544 --> 00:14:03.839\nRight here, because remember\npltest 192.168.0.1, right?\n\n302\n00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.261\nThat's coming from right here,\n\n303\n00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.574\nfrom our domain controller that's\nserving up our DNS Information, right?\n\n304\n00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:11.996\nSo that's where we're actually seeing that\nresponse coming from when we do that.\n\n305\n00:14:11.996 --> 00:14:13.555\nSo we've got that working, right?\n\n306\n00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:14.599\nThat's all good.\n\n307\n00:14:14.599 --> 00:14:19.172\nAnd you'll see that we return that,\nthat's discovering our information for us.\n\n308\n00:14:19.172 --> 00:14:21.440\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's do the following.\n\n309\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.510\nLet me open up from PowerShell here,\ngive me just one second.\n\n310\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.020\nAnd let me go in, and\nlet me load PowerShell,\n\n311\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.362\ncuz I wanna add a command in here.\n\n312\n00:14:35.362 --> 00:14:39.428\nSo let me run PowerShell\nas an administrator.\n\n313\n00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:43.480\nOpen that up, and just make that\na little bit bigger for you also,\n\n314\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.994\nyou guys can see that, Lucida Console.\n\n315\n00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:47.816\nThat would be great there,\nwe go right there.\n\n316\n00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:51.402\nAll right, so I am gonna add another DNS.\n\n317\n00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:55.900\nThis one, I am gonna type it.\n\n318\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.538\nI am not gonna actually have a preloaded\nDNS server query resolution policy.\n\n319\n00:15:01.538 --> 00:15:02.900\nSo let's do the following.\n\n320\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.243\nJust give me half\na second here to do this.\n\n321\n00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:13.578\nAll right and actually I'm gonna do this,\nhold on one second.\n\n322\n00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:17.529\nI'm thinking about doing this, but\nI'm doing it on the wrong machine.\n\n323\n00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:19.045\nSwitched over, I wanna do it here.\n\n324\n00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:20.178\nThat's where I wanna be.\n\n325\n00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:26.785\nOkay, so let's add it in here,\nadd-dnsserverqueryresolution.\n\n326\n00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:34.398\nSo serverquery, whoops, resolutionpolicy.\n\n327\n00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:39.900\nJust hit the tab there,\ndo a quick autocomplete.\n\n328\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:46.089\nWait for that, that's why,\ncuz I do not spell resolutionpol.\n\n329\n00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:49.149\nThat should pick it up.\n\n330\n00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:50.982\n&gt;&gt; DNS-\n&gt;&gt; Query.\n\n331\n00:15:50.982 --> 00:15:51.998\n&gt;&gt; Server query.\n\n332\n00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:52.999\n&gt;&gt; Query.\n\n333\n00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:54.577\nNope, I spelled that incorrectly, too.\n\n334\n00:15:54.577 --> 00:15:55.614\nThis is why I don't type.\n\n335\n00:15:55.614 --> 00:15:57.176\n&gt;&gt; It's okay. You know- &gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; We've been going at it for\n\n336\n00:15:57.176 --> 00:16:00.114\na while here and, someone even\nhad mentioned in chat just that\n\n337\n00:16:00.114 --> 00:16:02.164\nsimple right-click there on that Start.\n\n338\n00:16:02.164 --> 00:16:04.486\nThe window icon-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n339\n00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:05.055\nYes, all right.\n\n340\n00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:05.859\n&gt;&gt; The command prompt.\n\n341\n00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:08.739\nAll right, so name,\nthat's why I don't type.\n\n342\n00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:09.739\nThis is why pre-load all my scripts.\n\n343\n00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:12.267\nAll right, so name, we call this block,\njust give me one second.\n\n344\n00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Look at it.\n\n345\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.820\n&gt;&gt; So, block list.\n\n346\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:23.840\nAnd let's do,\nOur action we're gonna specify ignore.\n\n347\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.484\nDo that and then we'll specify ignore.\n\n348\n00:16:27.484 --> 00:16:32.538\nAnd let's do our FQDNs so\nthat we know what we're gonna ignore.\n\n349\n00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:36.458\nAnd we're gonna ignore,\nso that's equal to,\n\n350\n00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:40.389\nwhat am I doing with\nthat equal to pltest.com.\n\n351\n00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:42.528\nAnd put that in there.\n\n352\n00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:45.373\nSo anything coming from pltest.com, right.\n\n353\n00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:47.445\nAsterisk, I didn't do the asterisk,\nI did a period.\n\n354\n00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:49.669\nHold on a second.\n\n355\n00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:51.520\nOf course without the backspace.\n\n356\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.133\nThere we go.\n\n357\n00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:56.820\n*.pltest.com because we have\nto have a wild card for that.\n\n358\n00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.061\nThat means anything coming from pltest.com\nand then we're gonna do pass through.\n\n359\n00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:05.583\nOkay, so let's specify pass through.\n\n360\n00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:07.372\nAll right, let's add that in.\n\n361\n00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:11.450\nAll right, you can see there, block\nlist one, processing order enabled true.\n\n362\n00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.563\nRight, action, ignore.\n\n363\n00:17:12.563 --> 00:17:16.928\nSo I got that new resolution policy that\nI just put in there, I've gone ahead and\n\n364\n00:17:16.928 --> 00:17:21.400\nI've created that successfully so\nwe could see that we actually did that.\n\n365\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.589\nSo now, let's go ahead and\nlet's do the following\n\n366\n00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.944\non our Windows 10 box, get out of there.\n\n367\n00:17:30.944 --> 00:17:34.950\nAnd let me just go back\nover to where we were.\n\n368\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.450\nLet's do our ipconfig\nflush DNS one more time.\n\n369\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.980\nGet rid of what was there.\n\n370\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.130\nLet's do an nslookup one more time on,\ndo we have that there or no?\n\n371\n00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.142\nThere it is right there.\n\n372\n00:17:48.142 --> 00:17:49.048\nThought it was there, yeah.\n\n373\n00:17:49.048 --> 00:17:51.868\nLet's do an nslookup up on pltest.com.\n\n374\n00:17:54.634 --> 00:17:57.373\n&gt;&gt; And so what are we trying to\naccomplish with our nslookup here,\n\n375\n00:17:57.373 --> 00:18:02.253\nare we trying to check on,\n&gt;&gt; Well you'll see that now unlike\n\n376\n00:18:02.253 --> 00:18:04.260\nthe first time we did it,\nwhat did we get back?\n\n377\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.510\nYou'll see here it's timing out now.\n\n378\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.929\n&gt;&gt; It's timed out.\n&gt;&gt; Right, because we set up the policy-\n\n379\n00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:08.647\n&gt;&gt; To prevent them.\n\n380\n00:18:08.647 --> 00:18:12.150\n&gt;&gt; That said that essentially hey,\nwhen you come from there, right?\n\n381\n00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.436\nLooking for this, we can't resolve\nbecause of the DNS query policies.\n\n382\n00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:16.094\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n&gt;&gt; Said,\n\n383\n00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.320\nhey we are not gonna ignore,\nwe're not gonna let you do that, right.\n\n384\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.900\nSo, we've gone ahead and we block it, so\n\n385\n00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.290\nthat we are now getting\na different response.\n\n386\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.612\nAnd we're not able to\nget what we did before,\n\n387\n00:18:25.612 --> 00:18:28.241\nwhich wasm remember you saw\nme doing the first one,\n\n388\n00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:32.550\nright back up here, where I was able to\nsuccessfully respond and resolve, right?\n\n389\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.026\nI can get it right there and\nI did get pltest.com.\n\n390\n00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:40.079\nBut once I've put it in this other policy,\nwhen you and I just add it,\n\n391\n00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:46.070\nright, name blocklist, right, fqdn,\npltest.com whatever, right so.\n\n392\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.422\nI'm actually specifying there, right,\n\n393\n00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:51.107\nthat I will not allow that to take place,\nright?\n\n394\n00:18:51.107 --> 00:18:55.336\nI'm gonna block that or prevent that, so\nI'm actually stopping that resolution,\n\n395\n00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:58.750\nthat's what I just did with\nthat policy by putting that in.\n\n396\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.830\nNow when I do that, if I want to go\nahead and just remove it, say okay hey,\n\n397\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.490\nlet me turn that off,\nwell I can do that as well.\n\n398\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.840\nPretty simple to do.\n\n399\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.960\nWe can add a DNS Server\nquery resolution policy.\n\n400\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.860\nBut I can also remove one.\n\n401\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.550\nSo I'm just gonna use\nthe remove as opposed to add.\n\n402\n00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.004\nSo if I do remove-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n403\n00:19:16.004 --> 00:19:19.497\nthis will be great in like a temporary\nrelationship with any kind of business\n\n404\n00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:22.771\npartner that you need to give access\nto for a certain period of time, and\n\n405\n00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:25.400\nthey needed to revoke that or vice versa.\n\n406\n00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.510\n&gt;&gt; This would be great in,\ncertainly for that, no problem.\n\n407\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.220\nLet me add two Ss there,\ncuz I think I only added one.\n\n408\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.160\nIt would be good for that absolutely,\nthere we go, DNS query resolution policy,\n\n409\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.030\njust specify a name.\n\n410\n00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.008\nSo yeah, when you think about,\nfor instance, maybe merger and\n\n411\n00:19:42.008 --> 00:19:45.758\nacquisition activity, like an M&amp;A kind\nof thought process, where we go out and\n\n412\n00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:47.705\nacquire something, that kind of thing.\n\n413\n00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:50.396\nYeah, we would be able to go ahead and\nsay hey,\n\n414\n00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:54.881\nlet me quickly set up some DNS allow or\ndeny policy, so that way I could allow or\n\n415\n00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:59.770\nblock certain traffic sent to certain\nplaces during the transition period.\n\n416\n00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.633\nAnd then maybe afterwards, I could turn\nthem off or prevent them from happening.\n\n417\n00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:05.828\nSo if I wanna remove this after I\nset it up, let's just go in and\n\n418\n00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:06.879\nremove block list.\n\n419\n00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:09.247\nWe'll just call it what we did before.\n\n420\n00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:10.510\nSo we called the block list.\n\n421\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.339\nLet's just remove it.\n\n422\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.140\nNow we are prompted on this one.\n\n423\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.709\nJust scroll down just a little bit so you\ncould see this, cuz it's kind of behind.\n\n424\n00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:19.718\nWhoops, a little too far, there we go.\n\n425\n00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:22.071\nYou'll see that we\nare prompted on this one.\n\n426\n00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:23.945\nIt's not just adding it automatically.\n\n427\n00:20:23.945 --> 00:20:25.393\nYou saw add happens without a prompt.\n\n428\n00:20:25.393 --> 00:20:29.290\nBut remove, cuz we're actually removing\nthis and now opening back up again.\n\n429\n00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.030\nIt does prompt us and say,\nare you really sure you wanna do this?\n\n430\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.410\nSo, we do wanna hit Yes just to\nmake sure that is the case, and\n\n431\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:40.000\nonce we've done that, we should\nnow obviously be able to go back.\n\n432\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.681\nAnd once we do an ipconfig, flush DNS and\nping again, or rather, nslookup again,\n\n433\n00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:47.067\nwe should be able to respond and\nget that resolution coming back in, right?\n\n434\n00:20:47.067 --> 00:20:50.090\nSo we've added, but\nalso now removed the block.\n\n435\n00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:54.339\nSo this is what we're talking about when\nwe talk about using DNS policies because\n\n436\n00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:57.963\nwe can manipulate or modify resolution\nbehavior, what we give out,\n\n437\n00:20:57.963 --> 00:20:59.978\nwhere we give it to, who we give it to.\n\n438\n00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:02.789\nAll sorts of different options\nwould be available here.\n\n439\n00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:04.891\nRemember this is new to Server 2016.\n\n440\n00:21:04.891 --> 00:21:07.449\nSo getting used to using this\nfeature clearly have to be\n\n441\n00:21:07.449 --> 00:21:10.241\ncomfortable with PowerShell in\norder to be able to do this.\n\n442\n00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:13.083\nYou have to also remember how to open up\na command prompt with admin privileges.\n\n443\n00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:16.155\nSo it's always good to make sure you\npractice those things before you go live\n\n444\n00:21:16.155 --> 00:21:18.110\nand actually have to do them for real.\n\n445\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.370\nIt does show, listen,\nlike literally all kidding aside.\n\n446\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.024\nWe do this stuff for\nyou, we do it live and\n\n447\n00:21:22.024 --> 00:21:25.163\nsometimes you just have to keep\n20,000 things straight in your head.\n\n448\n00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:28.171\nAnd it's the most obvious and the most\nbasic things that you get out of the way\n\n449\n00:21:28.171 --> 00:21:30.245\nthere to keep this really\ncomplicated stuff there.\n\n450\n00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:31.342\nAnd what can I tell you, I'm human.\n\n451\n00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:34.077\n&gt;&gt; But you were successful there Adam so-\n&gt;&gt; We were, we were but\n\n452\n00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:37.202\nwe don't cover up our\nfables here at IT Pro TV.\n\n453\n00:21:37.202 --> 00:21:39.900\nSo when we do make a mistake,\nwell we blame it on Cherokee or\n\n454\n00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.784\nwhoever maybe around and we keep going.\n\n455\n00:21:41.784 --> 00:21:47.078\nSo there you go, but it is really cool in\nterms of being able to use these policies.\n\n456\n00:21:47.078 --> 00:21:49.367\nIt is a new feature in 16\nas I suggested to you.\n\n457\n00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:52.015\nSo, it's something you most likely\nhave not come across before,\n\n458\n00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:55.042\nespecially if you're getting used to\nServer 16 and watching some of these\n\n459\n00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:58.717\nepisodes get a a better feeling for what's\nin there and better understanding of them.\n\n460\n00:21:58.717 --> 00:21:59.434\nSo maybe brand new to you.\n\n461\n00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:01.927\nSo definitely something you want\nto go out and take a look at.\n\n462\n00:22:01.927 --> 00:22:02.947\nMake sure you read up on.\n\n463\n00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.562\nI can see it's definitely being something\nthat could become the focus of some\n\n464\n00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:08.737\nquestions at some point in the future.\n\n465\n00:22:08.737 --> 00:22:11.858\nA new feature like this especially\nones that are gonna be used for\n\n466\n00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:15.939\nmanagement especially in a core\nnetworking service like DNS are gonna,\n\n467\n00:22:15.939 --> 00:22:18.218\nas Cherokee said,\nmost likely be the focal point or\n\n468\n00:22:18.218 --> 00:22:21.238\nhighlight of certain things that we would\nwanna make sure you're comfortable with.\n\n469\n00:22:21.238 --> 00:22:23.024\nSo it would be helpful for\nyou to take a look and\n\n470\n00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:25.002\njust make sure you know what's going on,\nright.\n\n471\n00:22:25.002 --> 00:22:27.111\nSo that's why we're spending time\nshowing you how to do it, and\n\n472\n00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:28.564\nmaking sure you understand\nhow to set it up.\n\n473\n00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:30.935\n&gt;&gt; Well I appreciate that, Adam,\nit's some really great stuff here.\n\n474\n00:22:30.935 --> 00:22:33.943\nAnd I had never seen that in action\nbefore, so thank you for that.\n\n475\n00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:35.680\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n476\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.660\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n477\n00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.130\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n478\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.340\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n479\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.550\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.226\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:11.857\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.378\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to you're networking\nwith Windows Sever 2016 series,\n\n6\n00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:15.730\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.550\nWe've been talking about DNS for\na little while but\n\n8\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.850\nthis episode we're really gonna be\nfocusing on DNS Sec, DNS Security.\n\n9\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.970\nAnd back in studios with\nus today we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.370\nAdam Gordon, thank you for\njoining us today Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Thank you and\n\n12\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.730\nyou'll notice without planning, you're\nwearing obnoxiously bright clothing.\n\n13\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.430\nThis is to keep you awake while\nwe're actually going through.\n\n14\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.210\nAnd talking about DNS security.\n\n15\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.590\nNot because DNS security or\nany kind of security can be boring, but\n\n16\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.560\nit is gonna require a lot\nof steps to set things up.\n\n17\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.520\nWe're gonna have to go through some\ntechnicality on some commands, so\n\n18\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.780\nwe're gonna walk you through the dos and\ndon'ts of how to ensure that you're\n\n19\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.620\nlocking down and\nsecuring your DNS infrastructure.\n\n20\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.480\nSo you wanna be bright, awake,\nvibrant, and either electric blue or\n\n21\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.960\nwhatever the heck this thing is\nto make sure you pay attention.\n\n22\n00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.510\nSo let's get started.\n\n23\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.120\nWe have talked, as Cherokee was saying,\nextensively about DNS up until this point.\n\n24\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.770\nIf you haven't seen\na lot of those episodes,\n\n25\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.300\nthere is a lot of information there\nthat can be valuable for you.\n\n26\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.670\nWe've taken DNS apart,\nreally started at the top.\n\n27\n00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.722\nWatch, pay attention, so I'm gonna\nintegrate that whole pyramid, side view,\n\n28\n00:01:21.722 --> 00:01:23.021\ndata hadron thing you were doing.\n\n29\n00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I thought we we're passed that.\n\n30\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.285\n&gt;&gt; No, that was so\ngood we got to come back to that.\n\n31\n00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:32.504\nSo we're gonna really just start at the\ntop of DNS as we did in prior episode and\n\n32\n00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:37.801\nwe're gonna take a look at from top to\nbottom as we walk you through what DNS is,\n\n33\n00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.792\nhow it works.\n\n34\n00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.300\nWhat are some of the new bells,\nwhistles and features in 2016.\n\n35\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.901\nWe're going to show you more of\nthose with regards to security and\n\n36\n00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.699\nmanagement behind the scenes here,\nthings like DNS cache locking,\n\n37\n00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:52.830\nthings like socket pools,\ntalk about some of those cool features.\n\n38\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.700\nDane, RRL, some things you may or\nmay not have heard of yet,\n\n39\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.430\nso we'll take a look at some of that.\n\n40\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.550\nBut, we've already been through quite a\nbit of information about how you care for,\n\n41\n00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.950\nmanage, maintain.\n\n42\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.110\nAnd optimize your DNS server, and\nso want to remind you of all that,\n\n43\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.030\nmake sure you're comfortable with that,\nbefore you go and\n\n44\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.940\ntake a look at this episode or\nthis group of episodes with us,\n\n45\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.580\nwith regards these techniques,\nthis technology area focusing on security.\n\n46\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.260\nBecause you really have to understand\nthe basics of administration and\n\n47\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.970\nhow DNS is structured, how it works,\nto really take advantage of fully\n\n48\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.720\nthe information we're\ngonna share with you here.\n\n49\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.030\nSo having said that let's get started.\n\n50\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.220\nLet's talk about some of\nthe ways we implement DNS.\n\n51\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.560\nWe're not gonna jump right\nin to DNS sec over all.\n\n52\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.850\nWe're gonna talk about and\nlook at some of the other technologies\n\n53\n00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.600\nthat we can implement around the DNS\nserver, through it and in support of it.\n\n54\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600\nWe'll use the DNS command\ntool called DNS command\n\n55\n00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.340\nthat I talked about in a prior episode.\n\n56\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.700\nI was gonna demo a couple\nof the things in there for\n\n57\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.370\nyou to show you how to\nlook at some information.\n\n58\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.940\nSo we're gonna get started with that.\n\n59\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.320\nLet's take a look, if we can right there.\n\n60\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.060\nI'm on one of my DNS servers,\n\n61\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.880\nmy domain controller that you've\nseen me demoing with before.\n\n62\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.230\nWe're gonna go back in to\nDNS in a few minutes here.\n\n63\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.071\nBehind the scenes you'll kind of see.\n\n64\n00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.730\nBut behind the command line\nI have DNS already set up.\n\n65\n00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.350\nGot another zone in there for\nus to work with and\n\n66\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.040\nwe'll be enabling DNS sec on that zone.\n\n67\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.950\nSigning our resource records.\n\n68\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.330\nChecking out our trust anchors.\n\n69\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.507\nDoing all the cool stuff we\ngotta do to ensure it's working.\n\n70\n00:03:21.507 --> 00:03:25.407\nBefore we do that what we're gonna\ndo is just talk a little bit about\n\n71\n00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:26.900\nDNS cache locking.\n\n72\n00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.790\nHow we set that up?\n\n73\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.870\nWhat that is?\n\n74\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.150\nAlso as I said a DNS socket pool and\nsome of the other stuff that's in here.\n\n75\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.680\nAnd actually by way of getting started.\n\n76\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.690\nI gonna go into the command\nline here in a minute.\n\n77\n00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.360\nBut I thought it would be good if we\njust took a look at this website.\n\n78\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.160\nIf we can go full screen for\n\n79\n00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.420\na minute, maybe it would be easier for\nyou guys to see this.\n\n80\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.460\nWhat's new in DNS Server in 2016.\n\n81\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.110\nThis is gonna help us to understand some\nof the technologies I'm gonna show you.\n\n82\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.530\nWe've actually talked about\nDNS policies already.\n\n83\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.160\nWe get a whole episode on that.\n\n84\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.640\nI'm gonna mention Response Rate Limiting,\nand\n\n85\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.130\nDNS based off indicational named entities.\n\n86\n00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.650\nDane, I mentioned them just now.\n\n87\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.840\nBut let's talk about what they are.\n\n88\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.680\nWe'll go through, we'll take\na look at this in just a moment,\n\n89\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.690\nwe did talk about or I will mention\nagain unknown record support.\n\n90\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.930\nWe've talked about IPv6\nroot hints certainly,\n\n91\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.940\nwe know we've got extensive\nPowerShell support here.\n\n92\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.030\nBut this is a nice area, this page and\nall the stuff that it talks about.\n\n93\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.020\nIt gives us a really good\noverview of all the technologies,\n\n94\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.400\nsome of which we're actually gonna\nbe delving into in more detail here.\n\n95\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.870\nResponse rate limiting is one of those\nnew features that we can look at.\n\n96\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.730\nJust spend a moment on this real quick.\n\n97\n00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.660\nYeah, we enable response rate\nlimiting on the DNS Server.\n\n98\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.760\nWe'll talk about that and\nwe do this essentially in order to avoid,\n\n99\n00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.770\nas you can see there,\nthe possibility of malicious systems\n\n100\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.290\nusing DNS to initiate DOS\nattacks on our clients.\n\n101\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.140\nIn other words,\nthink of this as throttling,\n\n102\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.790\nthis is the ability to be able to\ncontrol the amount of outbound traffic\n\n103\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.050\nthat we're sending in response to DNS\nqueries coming back from the server.\n\n104\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.130\nSomebody is a bad actor attempts\nto take over the server and\n\n105\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.250\nattempts to flood clients and\ntake them off line.\n\n106\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.480\nWith DOS or DDOS solutions response rate\nlimiting is gonna prevent us from doing\n\n107\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.780\nthat so or at least help us to prevent\nthe server from becoming unwittingly\n\n108\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.510\ninvolved in taking out clients that\nare seemingly looking for information.\n\n109\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.642\nSo this is nice, it's a new feature.\n\n110\n00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:19.030\n&gt;&gt; It's a pretty cool technique.\n\n111\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.220\n&gt;&gt; Pretty important, right?\n\n112\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.590\nThink about the prevalence of DOS and\nDDOS attacks today.\n\n113\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.690\nIt is good to know we can throttle and\ncontrol the amount of bandwidth or\n\n114\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.450\nthe amount of, in this case,\ninformation coming out.\n\n115\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.530\nAnother new feature,\nanother new area, another new item.\n\n116\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.140\nNot new overall but\nnew to us in Server 16.\n\n117\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.080\nThe idea of DNS based\nauthentication of name entities.\n\n118\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.470\nIf you search either for Dane or for that\nfull name, you'll find that this is been\n\n119\n00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.570\naround for a bit reason transport layer\nsecurity authentication here to provide or\n\n120\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.050\nrecords associated with that to\nprovide DNS clients that state.\n\n121\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.560\nOr excuse me, that provide DNS clients\n\n122\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.550\ninformation about what CA they should\nbe expecting to see certificates from.\n\n123\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.360\nIn other words, we're giving them\nadditional information about\n\n124\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.650\nthe trust chain and the information\nabout how we're certifying our identity.\n\n125\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.190\nAnd proving to them that\nwe are trustworthy and\n\n126\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.810\nthat we have the credentials\nto validate that.\n\n127\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.810\nThis prevents man in middle attacks.\n\n128\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.040\nBy doing this, we're essentially saying\nhey, you should expect to see information\n\n129\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.990\ncoming from the server\nwhen we go to authenticate\n\n130\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.540\nthat says ABC.EnterpriseRoot.ca\nif that's the name of the ca.\n\n131\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.380\nIf you don't see that on the certificates,\n\n132\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.910\nor if that information is\nnot provided guess what?\n\n133\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.740\nSomebody's probably getting in\nthe way of our conversations and\n\n134\n00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.580\nthere's a man in the middle or masquerade\nor spoof attack of some kind taking place.\n\n135\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.280\nAnd therefore,\nyou should drop the connection and\n\n136\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.350\nnot trust the stranger that\nyou're talking to, right.\n\n137\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.280\nBecause that is also very prevalent.\n\n138\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.060\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's what our mother told us to do.\n\n139\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.120\n&gt;&gt; Never talk to strangers.\n\n140\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.960\nRemember stranger danger.\n\n141\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.110\nStranger danger, right.\n\n142\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.860\nVery important to know that.\n\n143\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.110\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthese are some new technologies new\n\n144\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.750\nthings associated with us\nin Server 16 with DNS.\n\n145\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.380\nWe also have unknown record support here.\n\n146\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.330\nWe can add record which are not explicitly\nsupported by DNS in other words we can add\n\n147\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.960\nalternate records that are not on that\nhit list of I don't know, 20, 30 whatever\n\n148\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.370\nthe number is that we've looked at for\nresource records that are in there.\n\n149\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.140\nRemember we right clicked, new resource\nrecord got that whole pick list of stuff.\n\n150\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.310\nYou know there are alternate records\nthat we may in prior versions\n\n151\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.180\nhave not provided support for,\nand, or perhaps we're not using,\n\n152\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.260\nbecause we didn't use the technologies\nthat would require them.\n\n153\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.420\nBut they're always there and\n\n154\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.490\nyou know maybe we do have a need to\nprovide an alternate record of some kind.\n\n155\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.770\nWell, now we have unknown record\nsupport that would help us to do this.\n\n156\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.110\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n157\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.924\nWe've mentioned some of the other\nareas and items that are on this list\n\n158\n00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:51.429\nas I said that an extensive expression or\nexpensive expression.\n\n159\n00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.630\nWe did an extensive discussion and\na whole episode on DNS policies.\n\n160\n00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.380\nWe actually showed you how to set them up,\nwalked through, did a demo on that.\n\n161\n00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.061\nAnd then use the DNS lookup tool to\nbe able to validate the policies\n\n162\n00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:02.802\nwe're working.\n\n163\n00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:06.090\nIf you haven't seen that, definitely\nencourage you as I said as one of\n\n164\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.280\nthat group of system discussions\naround DNS we've been through.\n\n165\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.940\nLet's go back and take a look,\nit would help you.\n\n166\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.101\nAll right, so we talked about some of\nthe high levels things you could see there\n\n167\n00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:17.889\nwith regards to some new features for\nDNS security.\n\n168\n00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.316\nLet's talk about where we get\naccess to some of this stuff and\n\n169\n00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:21.610\nhow we can configure some of it.\n\n170\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.680\nAnd then we'll go in, we'll do\na deep dive around DNS specifically,\n\n171\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.330\ndigitally signing our zone files to be\nable to, or records I should say with\n\n172\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.075\nthe DNS zone to be able to now add another\nlayer of security associated with our\n\n173\n00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:39.005\nzones to further authenticate and provide\nintegrity as well as proof of origin,\n\n174\n00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:41.745\nnon repediation around\nthe authenticity of the zone.\n\n175\n00:08:41.745 --> 00:08:44.422\nThat's what dnssec does,\nbeen around for a while.\n\n176\n00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:46.162\nIt's important for\nyou to know how to do that.\n\n177\n00:08:46.162 --> 00:08:47.782\nWe are gonna walk you\nthrough the logic of that.\n\n178\n00:08:47.782 --> 00:08:50.912\nBut, before we do that,\nI've mentioned DNS command before.\n\n179\n00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:54.152\nYou could see I just pulled up\na command shell with the DNS command\n\n180\n00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:55.012\ntool with our /?\n\n181\n00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:56.274\nto get a help file.\nTo start,\n\n182\n00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:59.352\nI point out a couple of things here.\n\n183\n00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:02.982\nSo, the switch is associated\nwith DNS command.\n\n184\n00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:04.632\nMove that over just a little touch there.\n\n185\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.020\nThere are quite a few of them\nwhen you pull up the help file.\n\n186\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.710\nAnd you can see, as I'm scrolling down,\nthat a lot of them deal with the zone.\n\n187\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.180\nThere's quite a number\nthat deal with zone there.\n\n188\n00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.610\nThere's some for enumeration of records.\n\n189\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.690\nThere's a whole bunch of different stuff.\n\n190\n00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.840\nWhat we really would be interested\nin is the config command.\n\n191\n00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.610\nDNS command /config and\nthen what is it that we wanna config.\n\n192\n00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.460\nBecause that's where we control\nthe configuration of the server.\n\n193\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.916\nWhat DNS config instead of our DNS command\nconfig does is the equivalent of going and\n\n194\n00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:40.000\nright-clicking on the server in the DNS,\nMMC and the GUI.\n\n195\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.640\nAnd starting to hack away those\nproperties and making changes to stuff.\n\n196\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.550\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n197\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.560\nBut remember,\nwe're doing it from the command-line.\n\n198\n00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.810\nAnd so\nwhat I did is I just drill down into\n\n199\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.940\nthe DNS command config\ncommand a little bit more.\n\n200\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.090\nYou could see I just did that here.\n\n201\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.620\nSo I just did dns command config help and\nnow you could see there is a bunch of\n\n202\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.260\ndifferent stuff that we can\ntake a look at in here.\n\n203\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.010\nRPC protocol, log level,\nevent log level, network cursion,\n\n204\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.430\nboot method, all sorts of stuff.\n\n205\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.000\nAnd we would be doing or taking a look at.\n\n206\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.190\nAnd one thing I don't like about this,\n\n207\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.510\nunfortunately just the way it displays,\nit's not alphabetized, right.\n\n208\n00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.450\nSo the problem is, you've got commands\nall over the place, you've got\n\n209\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.060\nboot method here, you've got isSlave\nthere, global here, are at the top.\n\n210\n00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.560\nThere's no rhyme or reason to how\nthe commands show up when you do this.\n\n211\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.110\nSo you've just gotta go searching through.\n\n212\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.930\nBut what we're looking for\nis the ability to be able to\n\n213\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.410\ngo in and to be able to work\nwith cache locking percent.\n\n214\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.920\nFirst, what I wanna talk about,\nlet me just highlight it right down there.\n\n215\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.860\nWhat cache locking percent is,\nis how we set up DNS cache locking.\n\n216\n00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.410\nThis is how we configure it.\n\n217\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.118\nAnd DNS cache locking,\nit's actually very simple.\n\n218\n00:10:54.118 --> 00:10:56.816\nAnd when you think about the logic\nof what it does, you're surprised\n\n219\n00:10:56.816 --> 00:10:59.810\nthat they haven't done this before and\nwe haven't provided this support.\n\n220\n00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.230\nAnd we do have this capability,\nand do have this support.\n\n221\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.060\nBut it essentially lets us\nlock out the period of time\n\n222\n00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.570\nthat information in the cache is gonna\nbe stored for, and control it so\n\n223\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.050\nit can't be overwritten or modified.\n\n224\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.450\nSo we're setting a TTL that's hard coded,\nessentially, on information.\n\n225\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.200\nAnd preventing, and\n\n226\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.640\nif you think about why we would do this,\nwe're preventing a bad actor.\n\n227\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.940\nWe talked about cash poisoning attacks,\n\n228\n00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.270\nwe've talked about manipulation\nof information by understanding\n\n229\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.665\nthe resolution chain, and the mechanisms\ninvolved with how DNS helps us to resolve.\n\n230\n00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:34.663\nWe went through and had a pretty thorough\ndiscussion in our very first episode about\n\n231\n00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:37.075\nthe six steps involved\nwith DNS name resolution.\n\n232\n00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:39.735\nHow we always start locally\nbefore we go globally, right?\n\n233\n00:11:39.735 --> 00:11:43.421\nAnd we always have a preference,\na requirement, to look at what we own\n\n234\n00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:47.360\nourselves and what we acknowledge\nof locally, meaning in our cache.\n\n235\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.510\nSo the IP config display, DNS cache,\nright, would show us what's there.\n\n236\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.390\nThe DNS resolver cache.\n\n237\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.420\nThe server has its own cache,\nevery machine that uses DNS does.\n\n238\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.110\nWe have a host file,\n\n239\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.105\nwe've talked about that and\npotentially building to manipulate that.\n\n240\n00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:04.310\nWhile we said that we wouldn't probably\nsee a lot of attacks that would go after\n\n241\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.100\nhost files, we did say that we\nsee a lot of capability and\n\n242\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.260\npossibility around cache poisoning,\ncache manipulation.\n\n243\n00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.710\nBecause if we can get bad\nentries into that cache, and\n\n244\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.780\nremind the server of the fact that,\nsince we look locally, that in theory\n\n245\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.070\nis the authoritative information,\nserver has no way of knowing that.\n\n246\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.730\nAll it knows is, that hey I spoke to\nsomebody and they told me that I should\n\n247\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.970\ntell you that that's where you go to\nfind abc.megacorp.com or whatever it is.\n\n248\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:39.060\nAnd if that's what you give out, and\nit's not really where ABCMegacorp.com is.\n\n249\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.760\nBut rather it's where the bad actor that\nwants you to think ABCMegacorp.com is.\n\n250\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.490\nSo they redirect you to their website and\nthen they can, through a iFrame attack,\n\n251\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.910\nthrough a cross site scripting attack,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n252\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.630\nThey can get you to click on something or\njust by showing up on the page and\n\n253\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.290\nloading it,\nthey can load malware into your system.\n\n254\n00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.860\nJust the amount of stuff we can do today\nis just unbelievable when we get you\n\n255\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.250\nconnecting to a machine and we control it.\n\n256\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.920\nSo your cache locking\npercent lets us set or\n\n257\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.780\nspecify what this cache\nlocking value will be.\n\n258\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.250\nTo prevent overwrite of the cache and\nlock it down.\n\n259\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.940\nSo we configure this by using DNS command,\nwe go in here.\n\n260\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.150\nKeep in mind you gotta be running\nan elevated command prompt,\n\n261\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.710\nyou'll see I am set up here,\nright, as administrator.\n\n262\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.960\nSo just make sure you remember, you\nneed rights to be able to manipulate and\n\n263\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.620\nmodify these settings.\n\n264\n00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.540\nDon't just open up\na normal command prompt.\n\n265\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.180\nWe'll get an error.\n\n266\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.260\nWe'll work and you may or may not\nknow why, so just keep that in mind.\n\n267\n00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.380\nDNS command/config/cachelockingpercentage\nand\n\n268\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.840\nthen you specify the percent as\na number at the end of that.\n\n269\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.890\nAnd that's how you actually set that up.\n\n270\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.189\nThe other thing to note, restart\nthe DNS servers to apply the changes.\n\n271\n00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:52.910\nThese changes require you to stop\nconstructing the DNS Server Service.\n\n272\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.760\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n273\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.670\nWe prohibit records from\nbeing overwritten for\n\n274\n00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.150\nthe duration of the TTL value\nthat we set here as a percentage.\n\n275\n00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.605\nSo that just keep that in mind.\n\n276\n00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:05.625\nAnd we can also set this from PowerShell,\nright?\n\n277\n00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:09.335\nAnything we can do in DNS Command\ncan be done from PowerShell.\n\n278\n00:14:09.335 --> 00:14:13.575\nBut just like any other kind\nof thought process here,\n\n279\n00:14:13.575 --> 00:14:15.645\nlots of different ways to\ncome at this knowledge.\n\n280\n00:14:15.645 --> 00:14:19.065\nPotentially lots of different\ninformation we wanna be aware of.\n\n281\n00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:21.315\nMay ask questions from\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n282\n00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:25.275\nIf there's more than one tool, there's\nmore than one way to ask a question, and\n\n283\n00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:28.310\nmore than one piece of information\nyou may need to be aware of.\n\n284\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.310\nGenerically I often tell my students,\nI've told them for\n\n285\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.650\nyears, tell my customers the same thing.\n\n286\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.350\nWhen you're dealing with Microsoft,\nthere's probably at least three\n\n287\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.760\nways to do anything you wannna do if you\nthink about the logic of that, right.\n\n288\n00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.670\nThere's always at least one or more ways\nin the GUI, there's always at least one or\n\n289\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.620\nmore command line options\nfrom different tools, right.\n\n290\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.690\nSo think about the fact that that could\nbe the case because we probably have,\n\n291\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.530\nin this case as I said, PowerShell.\n\n292\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.980\nWe have DNS command.\n\n293\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.450\nAnd for a lot of these,\nthey could be set from the GUI as well.\n\n294\n00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.950\nSo you just wanna keep that in mind.\n\n295\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.210\nMeaning you could script this.\n\n296\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.310\nYou could automate this.\n\n297\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.430\nYou could do all sorts of stuff with it.\n\n298\n00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:07.670\nIn PowerShell, set DNS server cache\ncommand with the locking percent parameter\n\n299\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.600\nwould be the way to go.\n\n300\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.290\nAnd then just put a value\nthere at the end.\n\n301\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.980\nThe value is the numerical value for\nthe percentage.\n\n302\n00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.140\nWould be the same thing.\n\n303\n00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.870\nAll of that's in the show notes,\nby the way, the PowerShell commands.\n\n304\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.030\nAs well as the DNS command commands,\nare listed in the show notes for you.\n\n305\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.400\nSo I've put the details in there,\nso you know what they are.\n\n306\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.380\nThe other one we wanna talk about\nis setting up the socket pool.\n\n307\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.920\nThe socket pool, we'll go down and\nwe'll take a look out there.\n\n308\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.460\nIt's right there.\n\n309\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.260\nSocket pool, no, not socket pool exclude.\n\n310\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.075\nWe want socket pool size.\n\n311\n00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:34.890\nWe'll find the socket pool\none there in a minute.\n\n312\n00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.800\nI'll just scroll down and\nwe'll take a look.\n\n313\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.360\nBut before we get to it,\nwhat is DNS Socket pool?\n\n314\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.720\nThis lets us set up the idea\nof source port randomization.\n\n315\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.560\nThe socket pool is the number of ports\nthat are available to us that we use to be\n\n316\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.701\nable to communicate.\n\n317\n00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:50.141\nWhat we again is another\nway of doing security,\n\n318\n00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:54.533\nanother way of thinking about hey how do I\nlock down, how do I prevent contamination,\n\n319\n00:15:54.533 --> 00:15:56.427\nwhat we call pollution of the cache.\n\n320\n00:15:56.427 --> 00:15:59.058\nHow do I prevent\nmanipulation of information?\n\n321\n00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:03.378\nThings like DANE can help us to do that\nby further authenticating and validating\n\n322\n00:16:03.378 --> 00:16:07.567\ninformation from the PKI perspective\nabout what we should expect to see, but\n\n323\n00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:11.120\nwe can also control the ports that\nare being used to communicate.\n\n324\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.470\nBut we can randomize those ports and\nspecify that they will change and\n\n325\n00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.700\nthen that way we could control\nthe communication that takes place,\n\n326\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.810\nis somebody pretending to be us or\nsomebody trying to communicate with us,\n\n327\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.928\nwould have to have that\ninformation to be aware of them.\n\n328\n00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:27.750\nSo what the socket pool does,\nallows us to use source port randomization\n\n329\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.550\nwhen we issuse DNS queries,\nagain this is kind of cool.\n\n330\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.513\nThe server chooses a source\nport when we power up and\n\n331\n00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:37.840\nessentially start the server service\nfrom a pool of sockets available that\n\n332\n00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.980\nyou're gonna set, or specify here with\nthis command to issue queries against, and\n\n333\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:47.130\nas a result of that this makes cache\ntampering very difficult because\n\n334\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:52.970\nwe're not using the traditional port\nto specify communication with DNS.\n\n335\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.330\nWe're randomizing that port out of a pool,\nand the attacker that looks to cache\n\n336\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:03.060\npoison would have to not only know\nthe DNS server information, so the IP,\n\n337\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.240\nright, and the way to connect, they'd have\nto specify the port as part of that to be\n\n338\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.390\nable to connect and actually then get in,\non top of all the other things,\n\n339\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.850\nhave a credential and\nall the stuff we talk about.\n\n340\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.290\nThey don't know the port,\n\n341\n00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.358\nif you've ever done any work where you've\nrandomized ports to connect something,\n\n342\n00:17:17.358 --> 00:17:24.000\nyou know www.website.com,\nPort 80, right, by default.\n\n343\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.440\nBut if we do port 5015, colon,\nwhatever the port number is, and\n\n344\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.790\nyou don't know that port number, that\nwebsites not coming up in your browser\n\n345\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.700\nbecause you're not fully\ncreating that path, that address,\n\n346\n00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.660\nthat specifies the connection\nstring properly.\n\n347\n00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.520\nSame thing when we\nrandomize the ports here.\n\n348\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.910\nSo DNS socket pool allows us to go in and\n\n349\n00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.270\nmodify our control which ports\nare available, how many.\n\n350\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.210\nThe DNS socket pool size is 2,500.\n\n351\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.104\nWe can specify a value from\n0 through 10,000, right.\n\n352\n00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:56.456\nIt's 2500 by default,\nbut we can modify that.\n\n353\n00:17:56.456 --> 00:17:59.411\nRemember, we're talking about the number\nof ports that are available here,\n\n354\n00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.830\nspecifically for a service.\n\n355\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.089\nHow many ports are available overall,\nin a machine anywhere in the world?\n\n356\n00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:07.360\n&gt;&gt; 65,535?\n\n357\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n358\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.900\nyou should say that with authority because\nyou know what the answer is, right?\n\n359\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.490\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we have 65,535 ports we\n\n360\n00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.930\ncan actually use on any machine that runs\na networking stack, regardless of vendor.\n\n361\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.230\nThis is not a Microsoft thing,\nnot a Linux thing.\n\n362\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.670\nThis is a, hey, you run TCPIP,\nyou run networking?\n\n363\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.996\nThis is the standard,\nthis is how it works, kind of thing.\n\n364\n00:18:25.996 --> 00:18:29.000\nSo it's 65,535.\n\n365\n00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.990\nWe actually can manipulate the number,\nand specify, I want a pool of so many.\n\n366\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.580\nAnd I wanna be able to use those, right?\n\n367\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.460\nLarger the value, the greater the\nprotection you have against DNS spoofing\n\n368\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.500\nattacks, obviously, bigger the pool,\nmore randomization,\n\n369\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.880\nmore likely to be able to pick\na port that nobody's gonna guess.\n\n370\n00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.850\nNow could somebody, in theory,\nwalk that DNS server\n\n371\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.110\ntrying every port in a connection string\nautomated to be able to figure it out?\n\n372\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.900\nYeah, for every defense we put up, there\nis an attack that's equally devastating,\n\n373\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.080\nin terms of its ability to\nbe able to break through.\n\n374\n00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.830\nBut not everybody understands the logic.\n\n375\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.460\nNot everybody will use\nthose kind of attacks, and\n\n376\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.780\nnot everybody's gonna allow repetitive\ninbound traffic request walking through\n\n377\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.520\na port list, into their servers\nwithout challenging them, right?\n\n378\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.500\nThis is where the idea of being able\nto be offensive in your defense becomes\n\n379\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.980\nimportant cuz you have to look at that\ninbound traffic, your gateway servers,\n\n380\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.700\nyour gateway devices have to look at\nthat and go, somebody's port walking.\n\n381\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.970\nAnd that's probably a protection profile\nthat we have to be aware of, and\n\n382\n00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.810\nwe have to stop inbound\ntraffic when we see that.\n\n383\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.750\nInbound traffic from the same IP address\niterating through ports one at a time\n\n384\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.240\nis the biggest red flag warning sign\nyou could possibly imagine, right.\n\n385\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.000\nAnd so when you see that on your\ninbound traffic monitoring,\n\n386\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.920\nyou should clamp down on that and\ncut that off.\n\n387\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.700\nThat's how you prevent an attack\nthat would ultimately break\n\n388\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.600\nthis thought process.\n\n389\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.890\nSo just want to make sure\nyou're thinking about that.\n\n390\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:52.810\nThis is actually going to be available\nto us starting in 2012, right?\n\n391\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.110\nSo we do have this capability\ngoing back a little bit.\n\n392\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.830\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n393\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.370\nWe can actually set up a pool exclusion\nlist, meaning, hey I want these ports cuz\n\n394\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.520\na lot of times we talk about this\nwhen people say, well that's great,\n\n395\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.430\nbut what if you start choosing\nports that everybody else is using?\n\n396\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.130\nHow does that work?\n\n397\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.100\nWell, no big deal.\n\n398\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.310\nSet up a pool exclusion list, and\nby doing that we'll be able to, and\n\n399\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.020\nyou could see the command for the port\nexclusion, or excluded port ranges right\n\n400\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.640\nbelow there, socket pools, right,\nexclude port or exclude port ranges.\n\n401\n00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.050\nSo you'd be able to set that up\nwith no trouble starting in 2012,\n\n402\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.260\n12 R2 and now 16 can actually exclude\nthe ports that are part of the pool.\n\n403\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.290\nSo we have the capability\nto be able to do this.\n\n404\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.700\nWe're looking for socket pool size.\n\n405\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.470\nI think I may have passed it already, but\nlet's just take a quick look down here.\n\n406\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.799\nMaybe down here as well\nbecause you never know.\n\n407\n00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:42.600\nI don't remember seeing it up above,\nbut let me see.\n\n408\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.640\nNope, I don't see it there.\n\n409\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.480\nIt's probably up above.\n\n410\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.800\nBut we're looking for socket pool size.\n\n411\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.449\nThat's the parameter we would use.\n\n412\n00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:51.740\nLet's see if we could just find it real\nquick for you, and we'll highlight it.\n\n413\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.449\nKeep your eyes open there, Cherokee.\n\n414\n00:20:52.449 --> 00:20:53.102\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying, yes.\n\n415\n00:20:53.102 --> 00:20:56.660\n&gt;&gt; In case I run past it\nwithout paying attention.\n\n416\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.100\nThis is, again,\nwhy you want the list to be.\n\n417\n00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.011\n&gt;&gt; In alphabetical order?\n\n418\n00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:00.553\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so\nlet me see, this is-\n\n419\n00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:02.194\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't see it.\n\n420\n00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:05.170\n&gt;&gt; Or actually no, I know,\nyeah, it should be there.\n\n421\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.310\nLet me just see cuz we should\nhave the ability under\n\n422\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.280\nconfig to do socket pool size.\n\n423\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.130\nSo just while we're looking for that-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n424\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.744\n&gt;&gt; For studying you might even wanna just\n\n425\n00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:19.714\nkind of copy and paste this into Notepad.\n\n426\n00:21:19.714 --> 00:21:20.314\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n427\n00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:21.875\n&gt;&gt; And then rearrange it that way.\n\n428\n00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:26.597\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's socket pool excludes,\nthat's your secondary.\n\n429\n00:21:26.597 --> 00:21:32.170\nThat's the zone properties secure,\n&gt;&gt; Do we have it in our notes?\n\n430\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.000\nLet's see.\n\n431\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.390\n&gt;&gt; I have the information\nin the notes here.\n\n432\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:35.770\nI do have the command in the notes.\n\n433\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.230\nDNS command forward slash\nconfig socket pool size,\n\n434\n00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.190\nI'm just not seeing the item listed.\n\n435\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.430\nBut it would just simply\nbe socket pool size.\n\n436\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.720\nIt's just DNS command, config,\nsocket pool size, specify the value.\n\n437\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.780\nAgain, restart and you'll have it there.\n\n438\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.080\nJust keep that in mind so\nyou know how to set that up.\n\n439\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.720\nBut that's gonna be a good one as well.\n\n440\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.080\nWe talked about DANE a little bit.\n\n441\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.380\nI explained that, we talked about RRL,\nwe talked about unknown record support,\n\n442\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.890\nI just wanna make sure that we\nremind you of those things.\n\n443\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.140\nLets take a look, just minimize here.\n\n444\n00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.540\nLet's take a look, or begin to think\nabout the thought process of the NSF.\n\n445\n00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.820\nLet's just sketch out at a high level what\nDNSSEC is gonna do for us actually to\n\n446\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.325\nstart that process before we go in there\nand we take a look at what to click on.\n\n447\n00:22:15.325 --> 00:22:19.300\nLet's just go right here and,\nwhere was, there we go, right there.\n\n448\n00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.810\nSo DNSSEC, right, if you're thinking about\nDNSSEC, I mentioned we always try to show\n\n449\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.820\nyou those overview pages on TechNet or\nwhere to go to find more information.\n\n450\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.498\nI mentioned that DNSSEC's been around for\na little bit.\n\n451\n00:22:30.498 --> 00:22:35.110\nIt is gonna allow us to digitally sign\nour zone files using some additional new\n\n452\n00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.260\nresource records.\n\n453\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.480\nThat's gonna then give us the capability\nto provide nonrepudiation,\n\n454\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.295\nproof of origin integrity,\nfurther securing, further locking down and\n\n455\n00:22:44.295 --> 00:22:46.745\ncontrolling the identity and\ntrust chains so\n\n456\n00:22:46.745 --> 00:22:50.505\nthat people understand where our zones are\ncoming from and that they are authentic.\n\n457\n00:22:50.505 --> 00:22:53.475\nAnd as a result, they're not worried\nabout masquerading, spoofing,\n\n458\n00:22:53.475 --> 00:22:56.135\nman in the middle,\nthese kind of things that can occur.\n\n459\n00:22:56.135 --> 00:22:58.355\nSo DNSSEC is really important.\n\n460\n00:22:58.355 --> 00:23:02.450\nIt's been around, I wanna say probably for\n\n461\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.360\nat least three, four years now,\nmaybe longer in the Windows world.\n\n462\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.960\nThe update on this one,\nyou could see, is February of 2014.\n\n463\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.300\nApplies to Server 12 and 12 R2.\n\n464\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.280\nSo it's going back several versions in\nterms of its ability to work for us.\n\n465\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.680\nWe're in Server 16 now.\n\n466\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.700\nWe've had that capability for a while.\n\n467\n00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.580\nA little bit late to the game in\nthe sense that it was working and\n\n468\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.720\nout there before we decided to really\nstart working with it in Windows.\n\n469\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.820\nDNSSEC had been around for\nawhile before that in alternate platforms.\n\n470\n00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.570\nWe talked about the use\nof non-Windows DNS, BIND,\n\n471\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.310\nas Cherokee has talked about before,\nand so we may or\n\n472\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:42.980\nmay not have seen DNSSEC prior to actually\nstarting to work with it here, but\n\n473\n00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.010\nit's really nothing that's complicated.\n\n474\n00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.029\nIt's just a matter of\nunderstanding the logic.\n\n475\n00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:51.800\nThe idea of DNSSEC is really just using\nthe ability to provide authenticity and\n\n476\n00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.211\nintegrity controls around our DNS\nresources, specifically our zone,\n\n477\n00:23:56.211 --> 00:24:00.858\nour zone files, and the resource\nrecords that validate that information.\n\n478\n00:24:00.858 --> 00:24:04.305\nNothing more than that, we make it sound\nlike it's pretty impressive it does\n\n479\n00:24:04.305 --> 00:24:06.680\na whole bunch of stuff and\nit does by the way.\n\n480\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.550\nDon't get me wrong, I wanna make sure you\nunderstand incredibly valuable technology.\n\n481\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.000\nBut the reality is it's not\noverly complicated, right?\n\n482\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.920\nSo what we're gonna do is go in and\n\n483\n00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.470\nyou'll see, just to set this up and\ngive you a quick high level idea,\n\n484\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.370\nwant to explain a couple of the key\nconcepts here before we get going.\n\n485\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.250\nAnd then, I think we're gonna ultimately\nwind up having a part two and\n\n486\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.430\nactually do the hands on\npiece cuz DNS second and\n\n487\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.710\ntakes about 20 to 30 minutes to demo for\nyou, and\n\n488\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.420\nwe're not going to have enough time to run\nthrough the whole thing in this episode.\n\n489\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.030\nBut we will definitely go through,\ntalk about the logic of it, and\n\n490\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.530\nthen we'll come back and actually\nrun through setting it up for you.\n\n491\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.010\nSo we'll go back to our machine there,\nthank you very much.\n\n492\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.660\nWhat we'll see is we have,\nor I've just created a zone,\n\n493\n00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.325\nnothing special about the zone,\nActive Directory integrated primary zone.\n\n494\n00:24:51.325 --> 00:24:54.337\nIt's called secure.practicelabs.com,\nwe'll be using that.\n\n495\n00:24:54.337 --> 00:24:56.485\nYou'll see that when we come\nback in the next episode and\n\n496\n00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:57.900\nwe'll start working with it.\n\n497\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.740\nBut what we're basically gonna do,\nis we'll be able to come in here,\n\n498\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.860\nwe'll be able to go to our DNS Sec menu,\nto right there.\n\n499\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.040\nAnd the first step's gonna\nbe ultimately sign the zone,\n\n500\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.290\nand it's probably a good idea quickly,\nmaybe right now, for us to chat for\n\n501\n00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.710\na moment about what signing something,\ndigitally signing something, really means.\n\n502\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.600\nYou know, we haven't done the whole,\nhey, this is cryptography and\n\n503\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.320\nthis is how you do it conversation.\n\n504\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.290\nCuz that's not really what the focus\nof networking in Windows for\n\n505\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.860\nServer 16 is all about.\n\n506\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.540\nBut it is one of those underlying items,\nthose knowledge items,\n\n507\n00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.730\nthat is really important to\nunderstand the technology.\n\n508\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.830\nAnd so, we're going to give you two-minute\nprimer on how this works really quickly\n\n509\n00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.192\njust so you understand that.\n\n510\n00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:36.600\nCherokee is super excited about this cuz\nI didn't tell ahead of time that we're\n\n511\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.550\ngonna do this.\n\n512\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.010\nShe's like, if you would have told me.\n\n513\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.980\n&gt;&gt; But you know what, that's okay Adam,\nbecause I hosted with you for\n\n514\n00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.320\nseveral other cryptography\ncryptanalysis series.\n\n515\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.550\n&gt;&gt; Which is why I'm gonna let\nyou drive this conversation and\n\n516\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.740\nactually let you do this part.\n\n517\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.070\nAll right, so we have talked,\nwe have talked about this.\n\n518\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.000\nLet's talk about signing,\nwithout putting Cherokee on the spot.\n\n519\n00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.770\nI'm gonna actually have\na conversation with you.\n\n520\n00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.040\nI'm not gonna make you have\nthe conversation by yourself.\n\n521\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.690\nBut you let's think about\nthe logic of what signing means.\n\n522\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; For those of you who may not have seen\n\n523\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.970\nthose episodes in other shoes around\nsecurity and stuff we've done, it's very,\n\n524\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.630\nvery simple technology,\nvery, very simple process.\n\n525\n00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.520\nWhen we wanna digitally sign something,\n\n526\n00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.540\nwhat we're essentially doing is providing\nproof of our identity as the owner,\n\n527\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.120\nthe signer, the signature, the originator\nof that content, whatever it is.\n\n528\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.330\nCould be an email, could be a file that\nwe wanna represent integrity around and\n\n529\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.960\nhash in order to provide that capability.\n\n530\n00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.230\nCould be all sorts of different things,\nbut\n\n531\n00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.010\nwhat we're doing with digital signing\nis we're using a hashing algorithm.\n\n532\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.500\nAnd there's lots of different\nhashing algorithms, right?\n\n533\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.370\nYou got a favorite?\n\n534\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you liked\nthe one I said the other day for-\n\n535\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:42.919\n&gt;&gt; Which one?\n\n536\n00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:44.247\nYou said SHA.\n&gt;&gt; SHA-256.\n\n537\n00:26:44.247 --> 00:26:44.774\n&gt;&gt; 256 or something, right?\n\n538\n00:26:44.774 --> 00:26:46.437\n&gt;&gt; And then you said, what about MD5?\n\n539\n00:26:46.437 --> 00:26:47.819\nAnd yes, what about MD5?\n\n540\n00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:50.019\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, well I said, but\nthere were other SHA ones.\n\n541\n00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:55.170\nI said 160, SHA-512,\nthere's Ripe and D160, right?\n\n542\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.930\nThere's all sorts of different ones.\n\n543\n00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.590\nThere's hundreds of them\nout there potentially,\n\n544\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.720\ndepending on what you wanna do.\n\n545\n00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.310\nBut the cognitive ones are ones like\nCherokee and I were mentioning.\n\n546\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.730\nThere's MD5, MD for Message Digest.\n\n547\n00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.070\nSo the Message Digest series.\n\n548\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.450\nMD5 probably the most common and\nwell-known of them.\n\n549\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.840\nThere's the SHA algorithm set.\n\n550\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.814\nSHA, S-H-A, stands for\nSecure Hashing Algorithm.\n\n551\n00:27:14.814 --> 00:27:19.520\nSHA-1, 160, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.\n\n552\n00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.320\nNow, the thing about hashing, about\ndigitally signing, is that we are not\n\n553\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.180\ntrying to provide cryptography\nprotection in the traditional sense.\n\n554\n00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.590\nWe are not providing what we\ncould call confidentiality.\n\n555\n00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.780\nMeaning, we're not trying to hide\nthe data, we're not trying to encrypt it,\n\n556\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.910\nwhich is what we often say and\n\n557\n00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.630\nwhat we refer to when we think of\ntraditional cryptography protections or\n\n558\n00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.200\nconfidentiality protections,\nso with security.\n\n559\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.190\nSo, when we digitally sign our zone file,\nwhat we don't\n\n560\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.010\nwant you to think is gonna happen is that\nwe're gonna encrypt that zone and in so\n\n561\n00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.030\ndoing not allow people to see it unless\nthey understand how to decrypt it.\n\n562\n00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.370\nThat's not what we're\nlooking to ultimately do.\n\n563\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.370\nWhat we're looking to\ndo is we're looking to-\n\n564\n00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.970\n&gt;&gt; Maintain integrity?\n\n565\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.820\n&gt;&gt; Sign, maintain integrity.\n\n566\n00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.660\nNow what confuses people is we say well,\nwe're signing cryptographically.\n\n567\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.900\nAnd people get confused\nby that because they say,\n\n568\n00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.030\nwell, you're saying cryptography,\nyou are encrypting something when you do\n\n569\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.680\nthat traditionally, so\nmaybe are encrypting.\n\n570\n00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.330\nWell, what we're really doing\nis we're providing integrity\n\n571\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.640\nas Cherokee was saying.\n\n572\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.620\nAnd we are providing a mechanism that\nallows us to validate that the person,\n\n573\n00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.220\nor the entity whoever or whatever it is,\nthat provided the signature did so\n\n574\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.610\nin a way that could be\nauthoritatively trace back to them.\n\n575\n00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:38.520\nAnd assuming nobody manipulates,\nmodifies the system, gets up to no good,\n\n576\n00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.020\nviolates very important precedent or\nvery important precept of what we talked\n\n577\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.000\nabout in cryptography, something known\nas Kerckhoffs' principle, right?\n\n578\n00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.820\nKerckhoffs said, Auguste Kerckhoffs,\n\n579\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.310\nthe gentlemen whose principle we are\ntalking about and who this is named after.\n\n580\n00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:56.020\nVery famous figure in\nthe history of cryptography.\n\n581\n00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.610\nBut cryptography and the thought\nprocess behind it is essentially, hey,\n\n582\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.090\nlet's keep information secret.\n\n583\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.560\nLet's keep it secure, let's provide a way\nfor people to see it if we want them too,\n\n584\n00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.200\nbut let's keep the good\ninformation away from bad people.\n\n585\n00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.250\nThat's generically what we say, right?\n\n586\n00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.070\nSo Kerckhoffs comes along and says,\nhey yeah, that's great, but you know what?\n\n587\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.400\nThere's all these moving parts and\n\n588\n00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.810\npieces that go into something that we\nnow commonly call the crypto system,\n\n589\n00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.310\nall the tools, and all the things\nassociated with how we do cryptography.\n\n590\n00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.077\nThere is the algorithm or algorithms\nwe've talked about some of those.\n\n591\n00:29:26.077 --> 00:29:27.634\nThere's what we call plain text,\n\n592\n00:29:27.634 --> 00:29:30.810\nthe data that's going into the system\nthat has not been modified yet.\n\n593\n00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.295\nThere's what we call cypher text, the\nencrypted data that comes out the backside\n\n594\n00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:39.325\nthat's been modified, the dog is\nblue becomes AB 12579 think hex,\n\n595\n00:29:39.325 --> 00:29:43.210\nthink IPv6 addressing,\nthink all that crazy stuff we looked at.\n\n596\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.540\nImagine you take a sentence\ncalled the dog is blue,\n\n597\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.850\ntranslate it into an IPv6 address,\nthat's encryption, right?\n\n598\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.970\nAnd the theory that we have transformed\nthat data into an unusable,\n\n599\n00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:56.420\nunreadable format for anybody who\ndoesn't understand what we did, and\n\n600\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.800\nhow to use that tool that will\nlet them walk it backwards\n\n601\n00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.430\nto essentially recreate\nthe data in a usable form.\n\n602\n00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.320\nThat's really what\ncryptography's all about.\n\n603\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.910\nSo this whole process is\nreferred to as the crypto system.\n\n604\n00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.090\nKerckhoffs has the brilliant insight and\nsays,\n\n605\n00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.460\nthere's all these moving parts and pieces.\n\n606\n00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.540\nAnd the attacker, the bad actor,\nis looking to get into that system and\n\n607\n00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.260\nultimately wants to be able\nto read not just one message.\n\n608\n00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.970\nBut any or all messages created with the\ncrypted system, all the encrypted text,\n\n609\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.230\nall the encrypted data,\n\n610\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.100\ncuz that's the goal of somebody\nwho wants to break encryption.\n\n611\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.282\n&gt;&gt; So there is one key component.\n\n612\n00:30:29.282 --> 00:30:31.698\n&gt;&gt; That was good,\nthat was very subtle, I like that.\n\n613\n00:30:31.698 --> 00:30:32.935\n&gt;&gt; Believe me, I remember,\nI remember all of this.\n\n614\n00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:36.879\n&gt;&gt; There is one key component, so there is\none special thing, Kerckhoffs says, you\n\n615\n00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:41.170\nknow what out of all the movement, parts\nand pieces, you can give away everything.\n\n616\n00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.300\nTell the bad actor what\nalgorithms you're using.\n\n617\n00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.260\nTell them what the cipher data is,\nthe cipher text.\n\n618\n00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.100\nTell them how you set the system up.\n\n619\n00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.650\nTell them anything they want to know,\nwith one exception.\n\n620\n00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.980\nKeep what we call the private key.\n\n621\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.780\nThe special key given to each individual\nuser in the system, unique to them.\n\n622\n00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.920\nKeep that private key secure.\n\n623\n00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.020\nAnd of you keep that key secure and\nyou expose everything else and\n\n624\n00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.920\nthe system is structurally\nsound architected well,\n\n625\n00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.370\nbuilt to the proper best\npractice standards of the day.\n\n626\n00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.320\nMeaning, incredibly large\namounts of keys you use, so\n\n627\n00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.200\nyou hide the possibility\nof finding the key.\n\n628\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.360\nWe call that the key space,\nkey space has to be incredibly big.\n\n629\n00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.520\nWe talked about work factor,\nthe measure of time it takes to break\n\n630\n00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.310\nthe crypto system,\nthat's got to also be very large.\n\n631\n00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.730\nThe larger or\nthe more difficult the system is,\n\n632\n00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.110\nthe bigger the amount of time and the\nlarger the pool of keys we could possibly\n\n633\n00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.230\nchoose from, the harder it is to break.\n\n634\n00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.150\nSo, Kerckhoffs says, hey,\nmake sure you do all that stuff.\n\n635\n00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.468\nKeep everything that you have to know\nabout the system readily at hand.\n\n636\n00:31:38.468 --> 00:31:43.640\nUse it only one thing you gotta keep\nsecure, keep the private key secure.\n\n637\n00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.420\nDon't ever give that away.\n\n638\n00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.423\nIf you do that, the system should be and\nindeed will be secured.\n\n639\n00:31:47.423 --> 00:31:50.757\nAnd so what we focus on, what we did\ntruly signed is not this idea of,\n\n640\n00:31:50.757 --> 00:31:53.506\nhey let's keep the private key secure,\nlets go ahead,\n\n641\n00:31:53.506 --> 00:31:56.105\nlet's make sure nobody knows it,\nlet's encrypt.\n\n642\n00:31:56.105 --> 00:32:00.348\nBut rather We're focusing on, let's\nrepresent the data in an authoritative way\n\n643\n00:32:00.348 --> 00:32:04.036\nto make sure everybody knows that\nit's not been changed or modified and\n\n644\n00:32:04.036 --> 00:32:05.870\nknows where it came from.\n\n645\n00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.230\nThis is like change control.\n\n646\n00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.530\nThis is change management for\ndata inside of our systems.\n\n647\n00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.740\nThat's what really, ultimately,\ndigital signing is all about.\n\n648\n00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.080\nIt's about change control of\ndata to ensure integrity,\n\n649\n00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.810\nto ensure data has not been modified.\n\n650\n00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.570\nAnd so what we do is we\ndigitally sign the records.\n\n651\n00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.210\nNow in order to do that,\nwe have to use a hashing algorithm.\n\n652\n00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.390\nAnd we have to use unique\nvaluable identifier\n\n653\n00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.410\nthat only one person would\nhave control of and know.\n\n654\n00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.300\nWe go back to principle, right?\n\n655\n00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.520\nWe have our private key.\n\n656\n00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.190\nEvery individual in a system that uses\nPKI, Public Key Infrastructure, has or\n\n657\n00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.390\nwill be issued a private key.\n\n658\n00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.870\nTypically a public-private key pair.\n\n659\n00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.110\nWhat we call asymmetric cryptography.\n\n660\n00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.670\nPublic, private key pair.\n\n661\n00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.430\nAnd as a result, right?\n\n662\n00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.640\nIf we go ahead and\n\n663\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.680\nwe say I'm gonna use my private key,\nlet's say I wanna sign something, right?\n\n664\n00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.280\nAnd I want Cherokee to\nvalidate that I signed it.\n\n665\n00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.600\nIf I used my private key,\nknown only to me in theory.\n\n666\n00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.900\nAnd I use that to create the signature,\nright.\n\n667\n00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.480\nAnd then validate it.\n\n668\n00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.900\nWell the logic is that there's only one\nperson that could've done that unless\n\n669\n00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.610\nsomebody impersonates me.\n\n670\n00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:15.200\nAnd the system is not perfect,\nbut what the system provides for\n\n671\n00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.560\nis the logic that as long as I control my\nkey and I don't let anybody have it or\n\n672\n00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.450\nhave access to it, then the other side\nof that key, the pair or the public key.\n\n673\n00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.130\nThe other part of the key\npair can be used to\n\n674\n00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.810\nvalidate that the private key was used and\nthat they match.\n\n675\n00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.990\nThey're cryptographically related.\n\n676\n00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.050\nWhat we call mathematically related.\n\n677\n00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.070\nSo two keys, part of the same hole,\nbroken in half.\n\n678\n00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.130\nOne key can either encrypt or sign,\nthe other key can either decrypt or\n\n679\n00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.500\nvalidate the signature, right?\n\n680\n00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.870\nUse one key for one thing,\nthe other key is automatically used to do\n\n681\n00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.630\nthe exact opposite,\nto drive that representation.\n\n682\n00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:50.860\nAnd therefore that relationship.\n\n683\n00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.010\nHow am I doing so far?\n\n684\n00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n685\n00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.975\nSo feel free to jump in here.\n\n686\n00:33:54.975 --> 00:33:59.022\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Someone that may be studying,\n\n687\n00:33:59.022 --> 00:34:01.230\nthey might have come across\nthe term nonrepudiation.\n\n688\n00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.965\nYou hear that a lot and that's\nexactly what we're talking about here.\n\n689\n00:34:03.965 --> 00:34:06.780\nWhen we're talking about digitally\nsighting components like if\n\n690\n00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.920\nI were to send you a message,\n\n691\n00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.020\nI can't refute or repudiate the fact\nthat I had originated that message.\n\n692\n00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.940\nThat's the concept here, right?\n\n693\n00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.690\n&gt;&gt; That along with proof of origin, right?\n\n694\n00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.260\nWe're doing both.\n\n695\n00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.820\nBecause proof of origin is I\ndefinitely did send this, right,\n\n696\n00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:27.740\nthat was me, I used my key, and I can't\ndeny having done it is non-repudiation.\n\n697\n00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.760\nAnd so the two together,\n\n698\n00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.960\nproof of origin and non-repudiation,\nare what we ultimately establish.\n\n699\n00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.350\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely correct.\n\n700\n00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.440\nSo just keep in mind,\nwhen we come back and\n\n701\n00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.870\nstart to do the demo\nhere in the next episode.\n\n702\n00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.830\nAnd we go in and we start signing\nthe zone, and we do all this.\n\n703\n00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.080\nA little primer on just what\nsigning the zone's gonna mean.\n\n704\n00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.420\nBut ultimately,\nwe're gonna provide, hopefully,\n\n705\n00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.040\nirrefutable proof that whoever\nsigned the zone legitimately did so.\n\n706\n00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.210\nNow there is one possibility that helps us\nto understand that this is not fool proof.\n\n707\n00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.060\nI mentioned that normally, under normal\nconditions, this works, everything's fine,\n\n708\n00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.590\nno big deal, I signed it, I can validate I\nsigned it because anybody that looks at my\n\n709\n00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.890\nsignature can use the public key to figure\nout that my private key was used and\n\n710\n00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.370\ntherefore that my signature is valid.\n\n711\n00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.370\nNot that I'm exposing my private key but\n\n712\n00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.990\njust that I'm representing it\ncryptographically through the hash\n\n713\n00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.830\nin a way that lets it be\nvalidated without exposing it.\n\n714\n00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.710\nBut having said that,\nthere is one possibility here.\n\n715\n00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.600\nNot so much specific to DNS sec and\n\n716\n00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.930\nsigning of the zone but\nbroadly around digital signatures.\n\n717\n00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.270\nSo we just have to at least throw out and\nbe aware of.\n\n718\n00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.890\nThe idea that, and I hinted at this\nactually, it came right out and\n\n719\n00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.820\nsaid it through our conversation as well.\n\n720\n00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.010\nIf somebody were to impersonate me and\npretend to be me,\n\n721\n00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.750\nget my credential,\nmeaning ultimately they could log on,\n\n722\n00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.650\nvalidate their identity\nessentially as my own and\n\n723\n00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:46.490\nas a result get access to my private\nkey because it is tied to my identity.\n\n724\n00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.850\nPrivate keys are stored, for instance,\nin Windows right in the active directory.\n\n725\n00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.730\nThey're mapped to our user\naccounts traditionally.\n\n726\n00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.140\nThey're part of the LDAP\nproperties we store or\n\n727\n00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.052\ncertificates that represent those keys\nare usually mapped to user accounts and\n\n728\n00:35:58.052 --> 00:36:01.150\ntherefore are available\nto us when we log on.\n\n729\n00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:06.220\nIf that happens, if in theory,\nCherokee were to log on as me,\n\n730\n00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.060\nfind my username, my password,\npretend to be, get in.\n\n731\n00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:13.512\nAnd as far as the system knows,\nit is me and Cherokee goes and\n\n732\n00:36:13.512 --> 00:36:16.374\ndoes something using my credential.\n\n733\n00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:19.412\nEverybody will think it was me and\nthey would be legitimately,\n\n734\n00:36:19.412 --> 00:36:22.641\npartially right to say that because yes,\nmy credential was used.\n\n735\n00:36:22.641 --> 00:36:25.388\nBut the problem is it may not\nbe my fingers on the keyboard,\n\n736\n00:36:25.388 --> 00:36:26.914\nliterally may not have been me.\n\n737\n00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:30.279\nAnd this is why we talk about not just\ndoing, what we call single factor\n\n738\n00:36:30.279 --> 00:36:33.873\nauthentication, just log you in as\na user name and a password, right, but\n\n739\n00:36:33.873 --> 00:36:37.811\nwe actually talk to you about in security\nclasses and in episodes that Cherokee and\n\n740\n00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:40.810\nI've done, and\nyou've heard me say this many, many times.\n\n741\n00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.117\nYou've seen those episodes,\nnever use single factor authentication for\n\n742\n00:36:44.117 --> 00:36:47.476\nanything you wanna protect fully,\nbecause somebody can impersonate you,\n\n743\n00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:50.260\nthey can masquerade or\nspoof as you relatively easily.\n\n744\n00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.238\nWhat you need is what we call\nmulti-factor authentication, right?\n\n745\n00:36:53.238 --> 00:36:56.500\nThe ability to provide and\nprove identity beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n746\n00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.400\nwith more than just one form of identity\nand we talked about three forms,\n\n747\n00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.260\nyou remember what they are?\n\n748\n00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.820\n&gt;&gt; I sure do.\n\n749\n00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.650\n&gt;&gt; What are they?\n\n750\n00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Something you are,\nsomething you know and something you have?\n\n751\n00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.240\n&gt;&gt; Something you have,\n\n752\n00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.660\nno order to them, no priority, they're all\nthe same but yeah we would wanna mix and\n\n753\n00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.170\nmatch those factors together to provide\na stronger level of authentication.\n\n754\n00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.530\nSo instead of me just letting\nCherokee potentially impersonate me,\n\n755\n00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.070\nlog on with my username and\n\n756\n00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.600\nmy password, maybe I also use biometrics\nin order to further validate my identity.\n\n757\n00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.660\nAnd she would have to actually not just\nhave my username and my password, but\n\n758\n00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.430\nmaybe an iris scan, a retina scan,\nsomething unique to me.\n\n759\n00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.090\nMaybe, she would have to have\nKnowledge not just of that, but\n\n760\n00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.520\nmaybe there's a PIN\nassociated with my account.\n\n761\n00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.550\nSo something I have.\n\n762\n00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.170\nSomething I know.\n\n763\n00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.380\nSomething I am, right?\n\n764\n00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.050\nAnd maybe in addition to all that,\n\n765\n00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.920\nshe needs a smart card with identity\ninformation embedded in it, right?\n\n766\n00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.720\nWe may call this a cat card depending\non where you come from, what you know.\n\n767\n00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.580\nWhatever it is, if she has to put a card\nwith a chip in it with certificates,\n\n768\n00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.890\nthings like that, and a reader.\n\n769\n00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.710\nProviding user name and\na password and a biometric scan.\n\n770\n00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.430\nHighly unlikely, she's gonna be able\nto impersonate me and as a result\n\n771\n00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:06.200\nthe level of authenticity and trust in\nthat signature goes way up, because\n\n772\n00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.620\nit's highly unlikely, that somebody\nis gonna be able to impersonate that.\n\n773\n00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.058\nJust keep all those things in mind as\nwe wrap up our initial discussion here.\n\n774\n00:38:13.058 --> 00:38:17.500\nA lot more information probably than you\nwere ever expecting to hear discussed\n\n775\n00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:22.559\naround networking in Windows 2016,\neven security around DNS in Windows 2016.\n\n776\n00:38:22.559 --> 00:38:25.912\nBut that underlying knowledge we just\nshared with you is really critical to help\n\n777\n00:38:25.912 --> 00:38:29.080\nyou understand what we're about to show\nyou how to do in the upcoming demo.\n\n778\n00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.700\nAnd if you don't understand the logic\nof signatures, while you watch us and\n\n779\n00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.870\ngo yeah I get the theory, you don't really\nunderstand why it works the way it does.\n\n780\n00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.300\nNow at least you understand\nthe logic of what we're about to do.\n\n781\n00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah you can tell we're adding\nadditional layers of security and\n\n782\n00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.660\nthat's what we're talking about right\nhere because if I take that advice and\n\n783\n00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.090\nuse that multi-factor authentication,\nI'm a user,\n\n784\n00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.370\nI log in to my work station,\nI'm connected to the domain.\n\n785\n00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.300\nThen I've authenticated\nto have that DNS service.\n\n786\n00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.430\nAnd then now,\nthat DNS server has to authenticate, so\n\n787\n00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.940\nwe have mutual authentication.\n\n788\n00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.810\nAnd that's just, we're adding the layers\nto our security environment here, right,\n\n789\n00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.430\nso that's something we\nshould be thinking about.\n\n790\n00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.970\n&gt;&gt; We should be, absolutely.\n\n791\n00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n792\n00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:09.982\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n793\n00:39:09.982 --> 00:39:13.620\nBut, stay tuned,\nwe have more DNSSEC headed your way.\n\n794\n00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.000\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n795\n00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n796\n00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.815\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n797\n00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:24.535\n[MUSIC]\n\n798\n00:39:24.535 -->

00:00:08.356\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:11.961\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.178\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:17.359\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.215\nIn the previous episode, Adam showed us\nsome really cool new DNSSEC features, and\n\n8\n00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:22.937\nthen we talked about security a bit.\n\n9\n00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:25.116\nBut we're gonna go ahead and continue and\n\n10\n00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:29.423\nround off that conversation as well as\na demonstration with Mr Adam Gordon today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:30.564\nHow are you doing today, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:31.983\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, very good.\n\n13\n00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:35.440\nHopefully everybody is doing as well.\n\n14\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.464\nLet us continue.\n\n15\n00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:39.569\nWe left off in our prior episode kinda\nsetting up, setting the stage for\n\n16\n00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.020\nexplaining the background of and\n\n17\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.686\npreviewing where we're gonna\ngo to actually set up DNSSEC.\n\n18\n00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:46.846\nBut we hadn't really done anything other\nthan show you that we could right-click\n\n19\n00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.062\nand in theory,\nclick on a button that said Sign the zone.\n\n20\n00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.138\nBut we're gonna actually go through and\nstart that process right now.\n\n21\n00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:52.689\nSo if you join me in the console,\n\n22\n00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:55.110\nwhat we're gonna do is just\npick up where we were.\n\n23\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.441\nWe're on our domain controller plat DC01\nwith our Active Directory integrated DNS,\n\n24\n00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:03.251\nwe've got our practicelabs.com zone file,\n\n25\n00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:06.363\nthe one you've been seeing\nus work with on and off.\n\n26\n00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:09.847\nWe've had another one created as I\nmentioned to you, I went ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:13.094\ncreated something called\nsecure.practicelabs.com just for\n\n28\n00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.148\npurposes of our DNSSEC demonstration.\n\n29\n00:01:15.148 --> 00:01:16.720\nSo we'll use this zone.\n\n30\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.400\nI got a couple of resource records in\nhere, a couple of host records over here.\n\n31\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.438\nWe'll get to those at some point.\n\n32\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:23.344\nSo we're ready to go.\n\n33\n00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:24.656\nSo we're just gonna right-click.\n\n34\n00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.686\nAnd we're gonna start,\ncome down here to DNSSEC in our menu.\n\n35\n00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.727\nAnd right now the only thing that's\navailable to us, cuz we haven't done\n\n36\n00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:33.392\nanything yet other than get ready\nto use this, is sign the zone.\n\n37\n00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:37.772\nYou'll see in theory once we sign it\nwe would be able to unsign it, if for\n\n38\n00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:42.322\nsome reason we wanted to remove DNSSEC or\ndecide to turn it off if you will.\n\n39\n00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:44.343\nWe can look at Properties of\ncourse once we do that, but\n\n40\n00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:45.520\nthose are grayed out for the moment.\n\n41\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.099\nSo we're going to sign the zone.\n\n42\n00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:51.152\nWe'll just bring up our DNS\nsecurity extensions Wizard here.\n\n43\n00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.235\nGives us a little overview\nof what DNSSEC is.\n\n44\n00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:57.190\nObviously based on a conversation\nwe've already talked about that.\n\n45\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.954\nAlso like the fact that for many years\nnow Microsoft has integrated there hey,\n\n46\n00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.284\nclick here if you want more information\nkind of things in the Wizard.\n\n47\n00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:06.947\nYou can click there and\nit will take you out to the web,\n\n48\n00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:11.023\nassuming you're connected to the web\nof course, and will show you a link for\n\n49\n00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:15.184\nsome information, just to help you to\nbetter understand what the DNSSEC is.\n\n50\n00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:18.200\nSo if you need a little primer there,\nobviously click there,\n\n51\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.275\nwe're gonna click Next,\ncustomize zone sign in parameters.\n\n52\n00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.134\nSign zone parameters from\nan existing zone, and\n\n53\n00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:28.816\nI'll use the default settings to sign\nthe zone, yet we have some options here.\n\n54\n00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:32.901\nDefault would obviously streamline and\nminimize the interaction we have,\n\n55\n00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.230\nthen we just decide to get a bunch\nof pre-made choices for us.\n\n56\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.209\nCustomize we'll be able to go in and\nspecify the zone or set it up with a new\n\n57\n00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.272\nset of properties and we'll be able to\ngo on and figure out what those are.\n\n58\n00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:46.864\nSo it's really up to us to\ndecide what to do, right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:49.147\nIt'll be up to you to decide\nhow you wanna do that.\n\n60\n00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:52.059\nIf I do use default,\nthen basically, boom I'm done.\n\n61\n00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.211\nEverything is done for me.\n\n62\n00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.430\nSo let me just show you what\ncustomizing would look like.\n\n63\n00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.215\nWe're just gonna use the defaults for\npurposes of the demonstration.\n\n64\n00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.806\nBut let me just show you quickly so\nyou have an idea.\n\n65\n00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.203\nSo Customize, right?\n\n66\n00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:06.174\nWe will then go in, use this or, excuse\nme, the DNS server on the Key Master,\n\n67\n00:03:06.174 --> 00:03:09.808\nthe one we're talking about the,\nin this case, domain controller.\n\n68\n00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:12.315\nThe Key Master is gonna be\nthe one that starts the issue.\n\n69\n00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:14.896\nThe keys manages them,\ntakes care of them and tracks them.\n\n70\n00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:17.596\nRemember we're gonna be digitally signing,\nwe're gonna need keys,\n\n71\n00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:20.476\nwe're gonna be able to use though to\nvalidate our identity as we were talking\n\n72\n00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:22.022\nabout through this integrity process.\n\n73\n00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:25.576\nOr select another primary\nserver as the Key Master,\n\n74\n00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:30.438\nmeaning we can use and domain-based\nDNS server that we have access to.\n\n75\n00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.676\nAnd say hey I'd rather use\nDNS server five or something,\n\n76\n00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:35.440\nif I wanna go ahead and do that.\n\n77\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.195\nBut when I use the default choices,\nthe defaults to the machine I'm on.\n\n78\n00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.499\nAnd so just so you're aware of\nthe fact that that will be the machine\n\n79\n00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.571\nthat becomes the Key Master for the zone.\n\n80\n00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:47.456\nSo, when you run this and\nyou wanna sign the zone,\n\n81\n00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:51.323\nyou gonna default the machine\nyou're on by specifying that role.\n\n82\n00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:52.795\nIt's up to you to decide, right?\n\n83\n00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:56.590\nIt's just a matter of how you choose to\ndo this, let's just assume we leave that\n\n84\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.400\nthere for one second, then you'll see\nkey signing, key which is called k as k.\n\n85\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.427\nJust bring this down a little bit, and\nkind of center a little bit more so\n\n86\n00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:05.494\nyou can maybe see that\na little bit more clearly,\n\n87\n00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:07.227\nright there in the middle of the screen.\n\n88\n00:04:07.227 --> 00:04:12.144\nSo the KSK, the key signing key,\nis the key that's used to sign other keys.\n\n89\n00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:15.227\nEssentially this is what we will\ncall the master key, right?\n\n90\n00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:16.985\nThe key that is used to create and\n\n91\n00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:20.635\nmake available other keys that can\nthen be used based on this key and\n\n92\n00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:25.147\nknowledge of this key to validate, in\nthis case, zone records or whatever else.\n\n93\n00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:27.926\nSo think of this as the private\nkey that we have to secure and\n\n94\n00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.360\nkeep confidential, right?\n\n95\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.062\nBecause that's with the KSK, or\nthe key signing key represents.\n\n96\n00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:36.119\nI don't know if you ever heard\nthe term skeleton key or master key,\n\n97\n00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:39.568\nthink about those keys that in theory\ncould be used to generate other keys.\n\n98\n00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.578\nAnd maybe when you change the way\nthe key is setup in the lock,\n\n99\n00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:45.072\nit can only open certain doors but\nnot all of them.\n\n100\n00:04:45.072 --> 00:04:47.686\nThat kinda thing is what we\nwould be thinking about here.\n\n101\n00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:50.982\nSo you'll see we have this capability.\n\n102\n00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:55.564\nWe then would specify the KSK's key\nsigning keys one or more of them.\n\n103\n00:04:55.564 --> 00:05:00.072\nYou'll notice we would have to add in\nhere the parameters to set these up so\n\n104\n00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:04.312\nwe can go in and specify three KSKs,\nthe three key signing keys here.\n\n105\n00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:08.706\nFor each of the available cryptographic\nalgorithms, multiple ones per algorithm so\n\n106\n00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:10.299\nI would go in, you hit Add here.\n\n107\n00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.726\nLet's give this a second we've\ngot a new key signing key form.\n\n108\n00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:18.901\nLet's move that up just a touch,\nyou can see that we have our glid or\n\n109\n00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.767\nunique identifier for the key system\ngenerated, generate new sign in keys.\n\n110\n00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.547\nWe use a pre-generated set of keys,\nwe can provide those key properties,\n\n111\n00:05:27.547 --> 00:05:30.971\nwhat's the cryptographic algorithm,\nremember we talked about.\n\n112\n00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:35.565\nIn fact we have a different algorithms,\nyou'll see Cherokee said shy,\n\n113\n00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:39.195\nyou're one of the shy algorithms,\nshy 256 is there.\n\n114\n00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:44.057\nBy default you'll see I can pull\nthat down, I could use shy 512,\n\n115\n00:05:44.057 --> 00:05:47.227\nshy one, shy one with any sec and\nsec three.\n\n116\n00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:49.350\nSome of the newer updated versions here.\n\n117\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.504\nSo I have a bunch of\ndifferent ones I can use.\n\n118\n00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:55.012\nThere's no right and wrong here, it's\na question of which algorithm you want,\n\n119\n00:05:55.012 --> 00:05:57.025\nbased on the properties of the algorithm,\nand\n\n120\n00:05:57.025 --> 00:06:00.187\nwhat you're looking to do based on\nthe level of protection you provide.\n\n121\n00:06:00.187 --> 00:06:04.394\nYou want to read up on the different\nalgorithms, just go out and Google: KSK,\n\n122\n00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:07.344\nKey Property Algorithms or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n123\n00:06:07.344 --> 00:06:08.791\nYou'll find the list about six or\n\n124\n00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:11.899\nseven that are currently supported\nin Microsoft's implementation.\n\n125\n00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:15.796\nRemember this could change over time,\nwe're looking at Server 16 right now,\n\n126\n00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:16.828\nkinda freeze frame,\n\n127\n00:06:16.828 --> 00:06:20.859\nfrozen in this particular moment as we're\nputting this content together for you.\n\n128\n00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:25.169\nFast forward six months, a year, who knows\nhow far down the road as updates and\n\n129\n00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.649\nservice packs and additional\nthings are done to the platform.\n\n130\n00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.860\nAnd Microsoft may introduce\nnewer algorithm support, right?\n\n131\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.538\nEventually we did get rid of DES and\ntriple DES, and\n\n132\n00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.655\ndid swap it out for other algorithms,\nand it's likely to happen here as well.\n\n133\n00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:42.326\nSo while that list is authoritative when\nwe pull it down and show it to you now,\n\n134\n00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:43.519\nit could easily change.\n\n135\n00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.804\nWhich is why it's better for you to\nlook at that information in real time\n\n136\n00:06:46.804 --> 00:06:49.897\nwhen you're watching this episode and\nyou're interested in it.\n\n137\n00:06:49.897 --> 00:06:52.809\nGo out and Google it, you'll get\nthe most up-to-date information.\n\n138\n00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:56.319\nAnd as a result of that, you'll have\na sense of what's supposed to be there.\n\n139\n00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.772\nWe've talked about the key length,\nhow long the key is.\n\n140\n00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:02.644\nRemember the simple rule, the longer the\nkey, the stronger the protection, right?\n\n141\n00:07:02.644 --> 00:07:07.114\nSo, a key length of 2048 bits is\ngonna be significantly longer and\n\n142\n00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:12.063\ntherefore significantly stronger than\na key with a 128-bit key length.\n\n143\n00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:13.865\nBut notice the list here, right?\n\n144\n00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:18.091\nAnd as I scroll up, I can go from\n1,024 bits, I know it's real small,\n\n145\n00:07:18.091 --> 00:07:19.647\nit's really tough to see.\n\n146\n00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:24.063\nBut I can go all the way\ndown to 4,096 here, right?\n\n147\n00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:26.943\nSo I go from 1,024 to 4,096.\n\n148\n00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:30.691\nThe bigger the number,\nthe longer the protection that that key in\n\n149\n00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:34.032\ntheory should provide based\non modern computing power and\n\n150\n00:07:34.032 --> 00:07:38.900\ncapabilities to break that encryption by\nfinding every possible key combination.\n\n151\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.071\nThat is that big, so it could certainly\ntake quite a long amount of time.\n\n152\n00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:46.463\nWe'll call that a computational\ninfeasible amount of time,\n\n153\n00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:50.704\nmeaning it's unrealistic that anybody\nalive watching this episode would be\n\n154\n00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:54.111\nable to break that encryption\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n155\n00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:58.611\n&gt;&gt; But we don't just wanna run around\nselecting the highest key length.\n\n156\n00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.713\n&gt;&gt; No no, we do, cuz we want things to\nslow down to a crawl and not work at all.\n\n157\n00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:04.387\nWe might [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; If you really wanna have some fun,\n\n158\n00:08:04.387 --> 00:08:06.183\nchoose the absolute largest number.\n\n159\n00:08:06.183 --> 00:08:09.011\nAnd then sit back and wait like a year for\nyour encryption to be applied.\n\n160\n00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:11.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, Cherokee makes a good point.\n\n161\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.288\nThe bigger that number,\nclearly the stronger the protection.\n\n162\n00:08:13.288 --> 00:08:17.366\nBut the flip side of that is, the bigger\nthat number the more computing power, more\n\n163\n00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:21.340\ntime it takes to apply the encryption and\nto use it either forwards or backwards.\n\n164\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.670\nEncrypt, decrypt,\nit doesn't matter which but\n\n165\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.070\nultimately the point is we would have\nto know that and be aware of that.\n\n166\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.910\nAnd as a result, we do have to\nmake a really important choice or\n\n167\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.530\na thought process as\nyou were pointing out.\n\n168\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.530\nIt's a very,\nvery important point that you are raising.\n\n169\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.380\nWhich is while we just wanna don't\nnecessarily wanna rush to the end of that\n\n170\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.470\nlist and say, ultimate protection.\n\n171\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.636\nWithout understanding, ultimate protection\nequals significant impact on performance.\n\n172\n00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:47.293\nAnd that's just the rule\nwe wanna think about and\n\n173\n00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.530\nkind of balance, so\nyou're absolutely right to point that out.\n\n174\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.273\nAll right, so\nthen we have our DNS key, our RR set.\n\n175\n00:08:53.273 --> 00:08:58.189\nOur RR set is our resource record set,\njust again one of the terms we use for\n\n176\n00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:58.832\nDNSSEC.\n\n177\n00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:03.470\nSo our DNS key resource record set\nsignature validity period in hours.\n\n178\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.170\nAlways important to note\nwhat that time is there.\n\n179\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.749\nA lot of times,\nyou'll see these interfaces.\n\n180\n00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:11.290\nI will say look, that's in milliseconds,\nso make sure you know.\n\n181\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.510\nThis one's an hours,\nso make sure you know.\n\n182\n00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.526\nSo 168 hours, so 7 days by default.\n\n183\n00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:18.325\nWouldn't be just easier if they said yeah-\n\n184\n00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:19.177\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's good for week.\n\n185\n00:09:19.177 --> 00:09:22.270\nBut no, they got to do that in hours and\nspecify that.\n\n186\n00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.828\nBut that's good for\nseven days just so you know.\n\n187\n00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:28.587\nReplace this private key to all DNS\nservice authoritative for the zone.\n\n188\n00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:31.840\nIt says applicable only\nto AV integrated zones.\n\n189\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.311\nMeaning replace, I'm sorry,\nreplicate is what I meant to say.\n\n190\n00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.402\nI'm thinking replicate,\nbut I said replace.\n\n191\n00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:41.422\nSo it's important to know that when\nwe're doing Active Directory integrator,\n\n192\n00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:43.441\nremember we take advantage of the fact.\n\n193\n00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:46.321\nThen we're gonna replicate\nthis key to every member,\n\n194\n00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.840\nevery DNS server that's in AD\nthat's seen the zone information.\n\n195\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.555\nCuz if it's Active Directory integrated,\n\n196\n00:09:51.555 --> 00:09:53.929\nit's shared by all the DNS\nservers that are connected to AD.\n\n197\n00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:58.221\nSo that's gonna provide our mechanism\nsecurely, transmit that key and\n\n198\n00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:00.272\nget it out there, so we have that.\n\n199\n00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:05.105\nAnd then key role, enable automatic key\nroll over, roll over frequency in days,\n\n200\n00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.926\nthe others default rating there of 7 and\n55.\n\n201\n00:10:07.926 --> 00:10:12.160\nThat's something like two years and\nwhatever, a little bit over two years.\n\n202\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.110\nSo we have those capabilities, so\nwe would specify whatever we want here or\n\n203\n00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.420\nI do okay, put that in,\nstart stacking those up.\n\n204\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.000\nHowever many you wanna put in there,\nremember it's up to three for\n\n205\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.700\neach of the available cryptographic\nalgorithms which is about\n\n206\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.610\nseven algorithms on that list.\n\n207\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.700\nWe could provide and program in up to\nthree combinations of the settings for\n\n208\n00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.040\neach key signing key, that would be\nthree keys signing keys per algorithm.\n\n209\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.340\nSo you could have to about 20 some\nodd algorithm combinations here.\n\n210\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.215\nAnd key combinations here on this list,\nto be able to generate and\n\n211\n00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:46.533\nsetup a bunch of different keys signing\nkeys just so you're aware of that.\n\n212\n00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:50.306\nAll right, then zone signing key,\nwhat's called the ZSK.\n\n213\n00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:54.730\nThe zone signing key is the authentication\nkey used to sign the zone data.\n\n214\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.470\nRemember the key signing key is\nthe master key that creates and signs and\n\n215\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.950\ncertifies other keys.\n\n216\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.170\nThe zone signing key is\nthe individual instance key,\n\n217\n00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.440\nthe key that's used specifically\nused to sign the zone.\n\n218\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.920\nSo we have a KSK we have a ZSK, so wanna\nmake sure we understand the logic of that.\n\n219\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.869\nSo this is the authentication key\ncorresponding to a private key used as we\n\n220\n00:11:14.869 --> 00:11:16.599\nsay here to sign this zone data.\n\n221\n00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:19.539\nTypically ZSKs are rolled over\nmore frequently than KSKs,\n\n222\n00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:21.440\nit's important to know that.\n\n223\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.310\nWe wanna change the zone signing keys\n\n224\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.400\nmore frequently as what\nwe're saying with roll over.\n\n225\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.190\nThe reason for that is they're in use\nall the time, they are out there,\n\n226\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.770\nthere are always available people\nmay potentially trip over them.\n\n227\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.960\nThey could be compromised whereas\nthe key signing key, the KSK,\n\n228\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.360\nthe key we just looked at\nin the prior wizard screen.\n\n229\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.370\nThat is,\nremember that ultimate private key,\n\n230\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.290\nthat's that Kerckhoffs principle\nkey that we talked about.\n\n231\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.540\nThe key we gotta keep secret, don't give\nto people, don't tell them about it,\n\n232\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.130\ndon't let them know.\n\n233\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.620\nHide it, so the idea is that key is\nprobably not exposed very often.\n\n234\n00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.220\nSo you think about what that key does,\n\n235\n00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.070\nit's really just to use to\ngenerate these zone signing keys.\n\n236\n00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.080\nAnd then it's kinda off on it's own,\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n237\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.970\nWe don't use it, we don't exchange it,\nwe don't reference it.\n\n238\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:06.140\nSo it could stick around for longer\nthat's 750 day roll over by default.\n\n239\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.930\nIt means that key signing key has to\nbe regenerated every twoish years.\n\n240\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.984\nBut a ZSK, zone signing key probably\nwanna regenerate those roll\n\n241\n00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:16.884\nthose over have new keys created,\na little more frequently.\n\n242\n00:12:16.884 --> 00:12:21.210\nBecause that's obviously gonna\npotentially add to our security.\n\n243\n00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.750\nCuz the other part of that, a whole\nthought processes, hey, if the key sticks\n\n244\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.440\naround a really long time, yeah,\nmaybe it's gotta strong enough key space.\n\n245\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.601\nIt's really, really big,\nmaybe the work factor's really long.\n\n246\n00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:35.150\nMaybe it'll be okay, but\nalso maybe it won't be.\n\n247\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.530\nEvery second that key\nis out there exposed,\n\n248\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.550\nbad actors tend to chip in a way at it,\nmaybe trying to break it.\n\n249\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.080\nThe longer you leave it out there, the\nmore likely that somebody's gonna come and\n\n250\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.170\ntake it away from you, so\nwe just gotta be aware of that.\n\n251\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.330\nSo the guidance here that\nI'm just pointing out and\n\n252\n00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.995\nspending a little bit of time\nis number one important.\n\n253\n00:12:49.995 --> 00:12:52.810\nCuz let's be honest most of us don't\never read what's on their screens.\n\n254\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.891\nWe just go look a button and we click\nNext and like all good IT Administrators,\n\n255\n00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:58.617\nyou worry about it after the fact.\n\n256\n00:12:58.617 --> 00:12:59.701\nSo you always wanna stop and\n\n257\n00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:02.100\nread always important to pay\nattention to what is going on.\n\n258\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.390\nBut this is actually really\ncritical as a thought process,\n\n259\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.980\nbecause we have to specify\nwhat that value is gonna be or\n\n260\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.020\nthink about what those\nrollover values are.\n\n261\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.972\nAnd they signify how often\ndo we regenerate the keys?\n\n262\n00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:11.634\nSo that's important.\n\n263\n00:13:11.634 --> 00:13:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, I mean you look at it and\nyeah, it might be more administrative work\n\n264\n00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.121\nto have to go ahead and\nbe doing more work, more often.\n\n265\n00:13:17.121 --> 00:13:20.106\nBut when we talk about security,\nthere usually is that tradeoff.\n\n266\n00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:22.590\nLike we saw there with the queue length,\nright?\n\n267\n00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:28.875\nSo sometimes, to have more security, you\nsometimes have to give something up there.\n\n268\n00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:31.255\n&gt;&gt; I prefer to think of it as getting\nsomething more valuable in return.\n\n269\n00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:32.000\n&gt;&gt; I like it, okay.\n\n270\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.776\n&gt;&gt; Peace of mind as-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Opposed to, a little bit extra work,\n\n272\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.014\nbut I think either way is good\nin terms of looking at that, so\n\n273\n00:13:38.014 --> 00:13:39.770\nwell that looks kind of familiar.\n\n274\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.980\nAnother window where we go and\nprogram another key.\n\n275\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.704\nThis is the same exact thing we just did,\n\n276\n00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:45.690\nexcept now it's gonna\nsay ZSK instead of KSK.\n\n277\n00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.440\nAnd we're probably gonna have\na lower roll over value, but\n\n278\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.040\nessentially it's the same idea.\n\n279\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.909\nSo you know what we would do here,\nyou have a sense of that.\n\n280\n00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:53.350\nSo let's just click Add here.\n\n281\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.330\nAgain we have our unique identifier,\nyou'll see here we go in,\n\n282\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.380\nwe got our algorithm,\nwe go our key length.\n\n283\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:06.915\nNotice it's smaller by default, 1024-bit\nas opposed to 2048-bit out of the box.\n\n284\n00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:10.668\nSo we have all this, specify whatever\nit is here, validity period in hours,\n\n285\n00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:13.310\ncenter validity period,\nzone record validity.\n\n286\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.340\nThese are new values because this is\nspecific to the zone as opposed to the KSK\n\n287\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.550\nwhich is just looking at key\nvalidity period overall.\n\n288\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.490\nAnd then it's just looking at how long\nwe're gonna keep the key around for.\n\n289\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.220\nAnd notice there is a significant\n\n290\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.080\nrollback on the frequency here\nin terms of rollover frequency.\n\n291\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.120\nWe were at 755 for the KSK,\nwe're at 90 days by default for the ZSK.\n\n292\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.315\nMeaning in theory, the default\nsettings here say every 90 days,\n\n293\n00:14:38.315 --> 00:14:41.070\nlet's change out and roll over that key.\n\n294\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.830\nSo we really go down the road\npretty far to ensuring, or\n\n295\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.459\nat least attempting to ensure.\n\n296\n00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:49.435\nThat we're gonna make it really difficult\nfor somebody to hack away at that key, and\n\n297\n00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:50.530\ntry to guess it.\n\n298\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.140\nEven if they did it 24 hours a day,\nnon stop for 90 days highly improbably.\n\n299\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.020\nWe would say computationally\ninfeasible with modern technology\n\n300\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.890\nthat they would catch that key and\nget it and guess it.\n\n301\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.890\nBecause the number of keys is so\nbig, the key space is so\n\n302\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.300\nlarge, unless they got incredibly lucky,\nwould just not work.\n\n303\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.781\nAnd so by shorting that roll\nover period dramatically,\n\n304\n00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:13.643\nwe're further enhancing the security.\n\n305\n00:15:13.643 --> 00:15:15.716\nNow again, can you modify those values?\n\n306\n00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:17.340\nYeah, you notice you can change that.\n\n307\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.801\nIf you wanna make that 755 like the KSK,\ngo ahead and do that, not recommended,\n\n308\n00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.606\nlet me be clear, not a good idea.\n\n309\n00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:27.716\nWould definitely not be the right answer\nto choose if you're asked about it in\n\n310\n00:15:27.716 --> 00:15:29.055\nthe exam for any reason.\n\n311\n00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:31.795\nCuz you wanna know that\nyou shouldn't go and\n\n312\n00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:36.955\nset a hard code at high limit like that,\nunless you have some really set\n\n313\n00:15:36.955 --> 00:15:41.615\nspecific kind of recommendation as\na policy inside of your business.\n\n314\n00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:44.124\nThat's speaks to how you do\nthis from a regulatory or\n\n315\n00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:45.727\nstatutory compliance concern.\n\n316\n00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:48.991\nBut I can promise you there's no\nregulatory statutory compliance\n\n317\n00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:52.019\nregulation that I'm aware of\nanywhere that would say, hey,\n\n318\n00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:54.890\nmake that so big that it's\nmore likely to be compromised.\n\n319\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.638\nSo that's probably not something you're\ngonna see, so just keep that in mind.\n\n320\n00:15:58.638 --> 00:16:01.980\nSo we would click OK again, just put\none in there, whatever the case may be.\n\n321\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.009\nThen Zone Signing Wizard, right?\n\n322\n00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:08.050\nNext screen NextSECure what's called NSEC.\n\n323\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.355\nYou saw that as one of the differences\non some of the algorithms, right?\n\n324\n00:16:11.355 --> 00:16:14.675\nNSEC and the newer version, NSEC3,\nwhich is what I referred to,\n\n325\n00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:18.608\nthese are resource records that provide\nauthenticated denial of existence.\n\n326\n00:16:18.608 --> 00:16:20.960\nThis is just the newest\nversion of those records.\n\n327\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.948\nNSEC3 is the newer version of them.\n\n328\n00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:27.584\nSo the UN-SEC3 records are gonna\nprovide authoritative proof,\n\n329\n00:16:27.584 --> 00:16:30.157\nauthenticated proof of existence.\n\n330\n00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:34.066\nRight, or excuse me, authenticated denial\nof existence essentially the same idea.\n\n331\n00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.140\nIt means, yes you're out there right.\n\n332\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.659\nAnd so the idea is essentially like\ntapping somebody on the shoulder,\n\n333\n00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:40.034\nhey Cherokee you really exist right?\n\n334\n00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.674\nAnd Cherokee would say, but\nof course I do and then I'd say okay so\n\n335\n00:16:42.674 --> 00:16:44.070\nnow we know you're real, right?\n\n336\n00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.259\nSo it's kinda like what\nan NSEC record does, so\n\n337\n00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:52.454\nyou'll see here we would specify and\nset up our values for the NSEC3 record.\n\n338\n00:16:52.454 --> 00:16:55.404\nNotice we go out of order to\nmake sure you're using NSEC3,\n\n339\n00:16:55.404 --> 00:16:57.890\nwe kind of put NSEC down\nhere the earlier version.\n\n340\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.661\nYou can't choose that but our best\npractice, our preference are guidance as\n\n341\n00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:05.735\nyou could see here would be to use NSEC3\nto provide some additional capabilities.\n\n342\n00:17:05.735 --> 00:17:07.900\nJust wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n343\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.880\nAnd then here trust anchors,\nanother interesting part of this process.\n\n344\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.040\nRemember I'm walking through the,\nhey let's go ahead and\n\n345\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.830\nlet's choose to show you\nevery screen just to show you\n\n346\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.710\nwhat's here instead of going back to\nthe wizard at the very beginning and\n\n347\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.930\njust saying, yeah,\nuse the defaults and boom, I'm done.\n\n348\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.050\nI am gonna use the defaults\nonce I'm finished.\n\n349\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.700\nJust create the zone file so\nwe can work with it in a standard way, but\n\n350\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.070\nI wanna walk you through this so\nyou can see all these moving parts and\n\n351\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.900\nunderstand them cuz this is obviously\nwhere the magic happens, right?\n\n352\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.910\nYou wanna know what's going on here.\n\n353\n00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.608\nAll right, so trust anchors, right this is\nwhere we configure the distribution of our\n\n354\n00:17:42.608 --> 00:17:44.242\ntrust anchors and our rollover keys.\n\n355\n00:17:44.242 --> 00:17:47.451\nSo it says here, Enable the distribution\nof trust anchors for the zone,\n\n356\n00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:48.989\nwe'll check that off in a second.\n\n357\n00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:52.413\nEnable anchor updates of trust\nanchors on key rollover,\n\n358\n00:17:52.413 --> 00:17:54.493\nnotice it references an RFC here.\n\n359\n00:17:54.493 --> 00:17:58.098\nMaybe a little hard to see but\nyou could see it's RFC 5011.\n\n360\n00:17:58.098 --> 00:18:01.992\nIf you wanna read up on DNS SEC,\nwanna learn a little bit more about it,\n\n361\n00:18:01.992 --> 00:18:05.094\nwanna understand more about\nwhat we're doing here with\n\n362\n00:18:05.094 --> 00:18:10.220\nTrust Anchors with our key rollover, etc,\nyou could go out, you could refer to that.\n\n363\n00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.050\nOur trust anchor is the DNS key and\nthe DNS resource records\n\n364\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.960\nare just simply called trust anchors,\nthat's what we refer to them as, right.\n\n365\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.340\nSo we're simply talking about these\nrecords that are gonna be available to us.\n\n366\n00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.950\nWe call them trust anchors cuz they\nliterally anchor the trust in the zone and\n\n367\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.170\nmake it structurally so sound and\n\n368\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.230\nkind of attached in a way that it's\ngonna be impossible to separate the two.\n\n369\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.165\nThat we can authoritatively say, yeah,\nthat must definitely be what it is.\n\n370\n00:18:33.165 --> 00:18:36.949\nCuz those things are bound together in\na way that it's gonna impossible to deny.\n\n371\n00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:37.825\nSo, just go ahead and\n\n372\n00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:41.110\nread up on the RFC if you wanna learn more\nabout what we're talking about right?\n\n373\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.035\nSo enable the distribution of\ntrust anchors for this zone.\n\n374\n00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:47.322\nNow, if we go back to full screen size I\"m\nnot gonna read this whole thing to you I\n\n375\n00:18:47.322 --> 00:18:49.810\nwant to let you see while\nwe're just talking about it.\n\n376\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.382\nBut this is important to know here so\nlet's just take a look, right.\n\n377\n00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:55.129\nIf this is also in the main\ncontroller trust anchors for\n\n378\n00:18:55.129 --> 00:18:58.294\nthe zone will be distributed to\nall other DNS servers running on\n\n379\n00:18:58.294 --> 00:19:00.280\nthe domain controllers in the forest.\n\n380\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.940\nMeaning remember we talked about the DNS\nzone, the application partition one for\n\n381\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.350\nthe DNS zone specific to the domain\nthen the forest level one.\n\n382\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.961\nIn fact we have two by default and that we\nget knowledge of the one in the forest,\n\n383\n00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:14.700\nand then only the knowledge of\nthe domain specific one comes\n\n384\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.645\nto each individual member of the domain.\n\n385\n00:19:16.645 --> 00:19:18.470\nBut everybody sees the one at the far.\n\n386\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.127\nSo just reminding you that\nwe're referencing this so\n\n387\n00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:25.032\nwe understand that we're gonna be\nleveraging this at the forest level right?\n\n388\n00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:28.020\nIf it's not a domain controller it\nsets trust anchors for the zone.\n\n389\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.160\nWill be added only to the local\ntrust anchor store meaning they're\n\n390\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.120\nonly gonna be available\nin the domain itself.\n\n391\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.828\nWhich is gonna be essentially or rather\nhave a reference on the local machine as\n\n392\n00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:40.539\nopposed to forest wide so\neverybody knows what they are.\n\n393\n00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:42.097\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n394\n00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:45.127\nSelecting this option enables\nDNS SEC validation for\n\n395\n00:19:45.127 --> 00:19:49.560\nthe zone on all servers where trust\nanchors are distributed meaning.\n\n396\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.670\nAny DNS server that has the trust\nanchor can validate against\n\n397\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.600\nthis when we enable this.\n\n398\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.614\nSo it is important to just\nbe aware of that right.\n\n399\n00:19:55.614 --> 00:19:57.155\nWe would have this available.\n\n400\n00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.485\nYou'll then see here signing in,\npolling parameters,\n\n401\n00:20:00.485 --> 00:20:02.500\nconfigure the values\nassociated with signing and\n\n402\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.130\npolling, what is the record generation\nalgorithm for signing the records.\n\n403\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.547\nThis is where we get into\nthe hashing that we talked about.\n\n404\n00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:11.730\nAgain you will see some of\nthe algorithms Cherokee mentioned here.\n\n405\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.240\nRemember the other choices for\nthe keys, the KSK and the ZSK.\n\n406\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.990\nThose are simply choices we\nmake to generate those keys.\n\n407\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.930\nThat will then be used, right.\n\n408\n00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:25.210\nTo be able to generate other keys or\nto start to do some other things.\n\n409\n00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:31.160\nBut we also have to specify additional\ninformation for our DS record here.\n\n410\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.190\nRight, for our, [COUGH] Records or\nrecord, in this case or records.\n\n411\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.202\nThat will allow us to complete\nthe process for the signing.\n\n412\n00:20:39.202 --> 00:20:41.463\nSo we have SHA-1.\n\n413\n00:20:41.463 --> 00:20:44.520\nYou'll see here we have SHA-1 and SHA-256.\n\n414\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.993\nGot a whole bunch of different ones.\n\n415\n00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:48.175\nBut notice, they're all SHA.\n\n416\n00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:50.340\nSecure hashing algorithm, right, so\n\n417\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.677\nwe're using that algorithm as our basis\ndepending on the strength involved.\n\n418\n00:20:54.677 --> 00:20:58.728\nThe number at the end, by the way,\nrepresents the length of the hash,\n\n419\n00:20:58.728 --> 00:21:01.542\nthe number of bits in\nthe output of a hash string or\n\n420\n00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:05.685\nthe digest, that's what that is so\na SHA-1 algorithm is SHA 160.\n\n421\n00:21:05.685 --> 00:21:10.595\nIt puts out a 160 bit output or 160 bit\ndigital signature or message digest or\n\n422\n00:21:10.595 --> 00:21:13.625\nhash value it's all\nreferring to the same thing.\n\n423\n00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:15.848\nSHI-256, 256 bits in the output so\n\n424\n00:21:15.848 --> 00:21:20.060\nthat number is important cuz it tells you\nwhat the bit output will be for the hash.\n\n425\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.495\n&gt;&gt; Which is pretty cool because it's\nregardless of the original variable length\n\n426\n00:21:24.495 --> 00:21:28.404\ninput that's always gonna be the same\nwhich is pretty interesting.\n\n427\n00:21:28.404 --> 00:21:31.630\n&gt;&gt; Regardless of the amount of data\nwe use as the input that number or\n\n428\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.241\nthat output for the string is\nconsistent absolutely correct, right.\n\n429\n00:21:35.241 --> 00:21:38.527\nSo we do have our DNS key record,\nTTL values here.\n\n430\n00:21:38.527 --> 00:21:42.490\nRemember TTL time to leave okay so\nwe have those specified.\n\n431\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.392\nSo we got all of that\ndifferent stuff here.\n\n432\n00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:48.854\nAnd then you'll see we're done right so we\ngo through it we would have to program all\n\n433\n00:21:48.854 --> 00:21:53.210\nthat information to be able to actually\nprovide the answers to these questions.\n\n434\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.720\nNow what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna use\nthose properties that we just chose or\n\n435\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.699\ntalked about right.\n\n436\n00:21:57.699 --> 00:22:01.165\nI'm just gonna go ahead I'm gonna\nright click just to run through one\n\n437\n00:22:01.165 --> 00:22:03.694\nmore time but\nI'm gonna just choose the default.\n\n438\n00:22:03.694 --> 00:22:05.305\nSo I'm gonna click Next here quickly.\n\n439\n00:22:05.305 --> 00:22:06.819\nUse default signing.\n\n440\n00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.804\nBoom, notice how quick that was right.\n\n441\n00:22:08.804 --> 00:22:10.930\nGot right there, it's all done right.\n\n442\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.749\nSo all those choices have been named.\n\n443\n00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:16.455\nNow, everything is essentially probably\ngonna be identical to what I would've\n\n444\n00:22:16.455 --> 00:22:18.860\nchosen had I gone through and\nselected the way I did.\n\n445\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.472\nBut in case I just modified something\nwithout necessarily remembering I did,\n\n446\n00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:24.507\nthat's why I just went back and\nchose this.\n\n447\n00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:27.208\nJust to make sure that all\nthe default values are there,\n\n448\n00:22:27.208 --> 00:22:29.286\nthey're not gonna be modified in any way.\n\n449\n00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:33.282\nDon't get any crazy outputs, and therefore\nmay impact our ability to work with this\n\n450\n00:22:33.282 --> 00:22:35.035\nat some point while we're demoing.\n\n451\n00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:37.085\nBut you can see,\nI can scroll down here, and\n\n452\n00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:39.320\nI can see all the choices\nthat I would have made.\n\n453\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.090\nOur zone signing key is there right?\n\n454\n00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:49.280\nOur authenticated denial of existence is\nthere, our NSEC, three records are there,\n\n455\n00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.550\nour trust anchors, all that kind of stuff,\neverything that we looked at is there.\n\n456\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.840\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n457\n00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.190\nNow we're just gonna sign the zone.\n\n458\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.530\nIt says,\nhey successful your zone was signed.\n\n459\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.420\nWould be great if they had a thumbs\nup that came out or an at a boy or\n\n460\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.119\nsomething like that.\n\n461\n00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:03.025\n&gt;&gt; I almost feel like that was so\nphilosophical,\n\n462\n00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:07.510\nit's like to be or not to be with\nthe denial of existence but not so much.\n\n463\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.092\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go.\n\n464\n00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:12.857\nAll right and this is why we don't let\nyou have more than one cup of coffee in\n\n465\n00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:13.490\nthe morning.\n\n466\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.390\nAll right, so let's click Finish.\n\n467\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.640\nAll right, so\nwe have digitally signed our zone.\n\n468\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.060\nWe've gone ahead and\ncarried out the first part of this.\n\n469\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:27.110\nNow what we've done we've actually created\na file called trustanchors.dns that is\n\n470\n00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.100\ngonna store the trust\nanchors that we talked about.\n\n471\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.182\nThe DNS server.\n\n472\n00:23:31.182 --> 00:23:34.190\nWe'll have that as part of what\nwe're doing for signing the zone.\n\n473\n00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.580\nSo that's just kind of interesting,\n\n474\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.730\na little extra added information there for\nyou.\n\n475\n00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.060\nAll right, so\nwe've gone how we've done all that.\n\n476\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.372\nNow what we're gonna do\nis just go ahead and\n\n477\n00:23:42.372 --> 00:23:45.275\nlet's take a look at where\nour resource records are.\n\n478\n00:23:45.275 --> 00:23:46.661\nWe don't seem to see\nanything in there now.\n\n479\n00:23:46.661 --> 00:23:49.992\nI've told you before that a lot of times\nwhen you have the console up when you do\n\n480\n00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:50.854\nsomething-\n&gt;&gt; Refresh.\n\n481\n00:23:50.854 --> 00:23:53.810\n&gt;&gt; Standard rule of thumb is, right,\ngotta refresh because it's there.\n\n482\n00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.020\nIt's just hiding from us,\n\n483\n00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.970\nbecause we just don't see the fact\nthat it's there even though it is.\n\n484\n00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.711\nSo let's just go ahead,\nlet's just refresh, and\n\n485\n00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.336\nlook at all that stuff\nthat just popped in there.\n\n486\n00:24:03.336 --> 00:24:05.500\nGot a whole bunch of stuff\nthat just showed up.\n\n487\n00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.232\nLet's just extend this out a little bit,\nso we can kind of take a look here,\n\n488\n00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:12.930\nmove this over, and we'll just move\nthat back just enough so you can see.\n\n489\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:18.024\nSo we went from having, I don't know,\nfour records, I think, right,\n\n490\n00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:23.304\nwe have an S, an NS, an SOA,\na couple of host records, www, www2 there.\n\n491\n00:24:23.304 --> 00:24:25.372\nAnd you'll see those\nare still there by the way.\n\n492\n00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:27.094\nThere is my host record,\n\n493\n00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:31.858\nthere are my host records that I had\ncreated prior down there in blue.\n\n494\n00:24:31.858 --> 00:24:36.210\nAnd there is my start of authority.\n\n495\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:42.150\nThere is my name server\nrecord right there.\n\n496\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:47.550\nBut you'll see that everything else that\nI have there has suddenly been created,\n\n497\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.290\nand there's a lot of stuff going on.\n\n498\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.790\nCan we go full screen just so\nwe can see the types of these records and\n\n499\n00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.960\ntake a look at them a little more closely?\n\n500\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.560\nI've created a very large number of\nrecords, including, if you'll notice,\n\n501\n00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.050\nby the way, down below.\n\n502\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.380\nI've recreated the two host records, but\ninstead of calling them host records now,\n\n503\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.910\nthey're RR signatures.\n\n504\n00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.580\nResource record signatures, I've digitally\nsigned those resource records that exist.\n\n505\n00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.850\nAnd notice I have resource record\nsignatures are our sigs and next secure 3,\n\n506\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.997\nNSEC 3 records,\nwith a bunch of crazy identifiers on them.\n\n507\n00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:24.157\nAnd I also have a whole\nbunch same as parent folder,\n\n508\n00:25:24.157 --> 00:25:28.500\nalong with DNS keys, right,\nmy DNS key records are here as well.\n\n509\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.890\nAnd my resource record signatures,\nmy RR sig records are here.\n\n510\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.070\nAnd we talked about these, right,\nthis is what we walked through, and\n\n511\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.930\nwe took a look at.\n\n512\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.070\nLet me extend that out, cuz we don't\nreally care about our time stamp,\n\n513\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.398\nbut we do care about being\nable to see all of this.\n\n514\n00:25:44.398 --> 00:25:48.920\nAnd you could see that this\nstring goes on, and on, and on.\n\n515\n00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.690\nWhat I wanted to show you was that\n\n516\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.720\nSHA 160 bit output is actually,\nwe've got that as part of our record here.\n\n517\n00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.750\nYou can see all of this.\n\n518\n00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.040\nAnd so this is what we get when\nwe actually are creating DNS set.\n\n519\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.920\nWe get all these additional records\nthat are gonna become now part of\n\n520\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.440\nour zone, right?\n\n521\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.030\nAnd as a result, or part of the symmetry\nthat we put on the zone, and\n\n522\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.320\ntherefore the security.\n\n523\n00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.710\nAnd as a result, we're now gonna have\na lot more capabilities to validate and\n\n524\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.680\nauthenticate and\nprovide proof as to who we are.\n\n525\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.730\nNotice also, it's hard to see,\nlet me click over here,\n\n526\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.200\njust click away for a minute.\n\n527\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.980\nSo you could see that there is an icon\nchange on the folder, the icon for\n\n528\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.410\nthe securepracticelabs.com folder for\nthe zone.\n\n529\n00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.430\nNotice it has a kind of a gold padlock,\n\n530\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.450\nupper left-hand corner\nof the zone file folder.\n\n531\n00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.230\nI'm kinda pointing to it right there.\n\n532\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.650\nYou may not even pick up on it or\n\n533\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.180\nsee it unless you know that\nyou have to look for it.\n\n534\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.590\nThat is proof that we have\ndigitally signed, right?\n\n535\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.740\nThat's what actually indicates to\nus that we have gone through and\n\n536\n00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.155\ndone the digital signature.\n\n537\n00:26:51.155 --> 00:26:57.634\nSo all that to set up and\nget our zone file signed and ready to go.\n\n538\n00:26:57.634 --> 00:27:00.886\nWhat we're gonna do, or at least\nwhat we'll talk about doing next is,\n\n539\n00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:03.273\nwe're gonna distribute the trust anchor,\nright,\n\n540\n00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:06.165\nwe talked about the trust anchors and\nwhy they're important.\n\n541\n00:27:06.165 --> 00:27:09.307\nWe're gonna distribute that out to\na non-authoritative DNS server.\n\n542\n00:27:09.307 --> 00:27:13.103\nI have another DNS server set\nup that is non-authoritative,\n\n543\n00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:17.191\nmeaning it's not gonna have\nthe proper rights and information and\n\n544\n00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:22.110\naccess to manage a zone authoritatively,\nlike secure.practicelabs.com.\n\n545\n00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.297\nWe're gonna transfer the trust anchor or\ndistribute the trust anchor over to it.\n\n546\n00:27:26.297 --> 00:27:29.180\nCuz this is an important step,\nand you may need to do this.\n\n547\n00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.600\nI wanna walk you through\nthe logic of this.\n\n548\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.800\nSo let's take a look.\n\n549\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.210\nI need to go over to my, and\n\n550\n00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:40.070\nlet me just make sure I have the right\nmachine here, give me just one second.\n\n551\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.470\nGonna go over to my other machine,\nbefore I do this,\n\n552\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.010\nI'm gonna just show you one\nquick thing that we have here.\n\n553\n00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:49.910\nThis is our DNS folder sitting on\nthe domain server we just created.\n\n554\n00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.700\nYeah, well,\nI see Windows System 32, right?\n\n555\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:59.510\nAnd so just open this up,\nso you can see this here.\n\n556\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.206\nSo we have our zone information here,\nright?\n\n557\n00:28:02.206 --> 00:28:04.723\nWe have our back up in there, DNS, etc,\n\n558\n00:28:04.723 --> 00:28:07.830\nnot a lot going on in there right now,\nright?\n\n559\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.540\nBut this is what we are going\nto be referencing, this,\n\n560\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.640\nour practicelabs.com,\nDNS information, etc, right?\n\n561\n00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.600\nSo we have our standard DNS folder, right?\n\n562\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.612\nNothing fancy, nothing crazy, I've just\ngone ahead and I've shared that, just so\n\n563\n00:28:22.612 --> 00:28:24.350\nyou know what I'm about to do.\n\n564\n00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.880\nI've just gone ahead and I've shared it,\nI shared it ahead of time.\n\n565\n00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.474\nBut I shared it, you see it's already set\nup, and it is shared as just PLABDC01DNS.\n\n566\n00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:35.817\nAnd I've gone in and I've set it up and\nshared it, so that way,\n\n567\n00:28:35.817 --> 00:28:36.936\nwe can connect to it, right?\n\n568\n00:28:36.936 --> 00:28:38.900\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n569\n00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.690\nSo gonna go ahead, gonna do that.\n\n570\n00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:48.105\nLet's just minimize that for\njust one second, just come up here for\n\n571\n00:28:48.105 --> 00:28:53.906\nhalf a second, and let me just stop and\nstart the DNS service real quick.\n\n572\n00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:01.030\nMake sure everything is up to date.\n\n573\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.020\nGot all our stuff in there,\nthat's all good.\n\n574\n00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.646\nAll right, so we've got that, that's all\nbeen set up, ready to go, that's shared.\n\n575\n00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:13.480\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do\nis come over here, and we're gonna go\n\n576\n00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.180\nto our DM machine, this is the other\nmachine that we're gonna go into.\n\n577\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.106\nAnd we are going to use our additional DNS\nserver, and when we look, just bring up\n\n578\n00:29:23.106 --> 00:29:27.898\nour forward lookup zones, we'll see we\ndon't have any zones set up in there.\n\n579\n00:29:27.898 --> 00:29:30.880\nThere is nothing configured\nin there right now.\n\n580\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.360\nWe're gonna go over here\nto our Trust Points folder.\n\n581\n00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.948\nOur trust points folder is\nwhere we're gonna see, and\n\n582\n00:29:36.948 --> 00:29:39.140\nactually I didn't show this to you.\n\n583\n00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.520\nShould have shown this to you,\n\n584\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.870\nI apologize, our Trust Points folder,\nright, over here.\n\n585\n00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.300\nHave one of these on every DNS server,\nright?\n\n586\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.710\nSo our Trust Points folder is where we're\ngonna go on the DM machine right here,\n\n587\n00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.551\nthe other DNS server we wanna connect to.\n\n588\n00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:59.020\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and we're\ngonna import the DNS key from the domain\n\n589\n00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.388\ncontroller integrated DNS server we\njust created the zone that signed on.\n\n590\n00:30:03.388 --> 00:30:05.980\nAnd the DNS key is gonna then\nallow us to understand and\n\n591\n00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.420\naccess and\nwork with information about the zone.\n\n592\n00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.760\nSo we're gonna go into our Trust Points\nfolder, gonna right click and\n\n593\n00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.351\nyou'll see we can go ahead here.\n\n594\n00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:16.497\nAnd we can add a key if we already\nhave access to it, or if we need to,\n\n595\n00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:19.836\nwe can import a key to bring it in,\nright, we have different options.\n\n596\n00:30:19.836 --> 00:30:24.898\nWe're gonna import our DNS key,\nwe have to specify our file here, so\n\n597\n00:30:24.898 --> 00:30:30.720\nwhat we're gonna do is go over here,\nand I'm just gonna put in our key set.\n\n598\n00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.420\nAnd out key set was one of\nthe files that was sitting\n\n599\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.630\nin the DNS folder on the other machine.\n\n600\n00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.230\nLet me show it to you.\n\n601\n00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:43.510\nI went into the folder, but\nI didn't actually point out the DNS key.\n\n602\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.697\nYou'll see here our key set secure\npractice lab's right there.\n\n603\n00:30:47.697 --> 00:30:50.073\nThat is the file that we're gonna import,\n\n604\n00:30:50.073 --> 00:30:53.376\nthat is our DNS key that we\ncreated as part the zone signing.\n\n605\n00:30:53.376 --> 00:30:58.677\nWe're gonna bring that in, and\nwe are going to use that to import and\n\n606\n00:30:58.677 --> 00:31:03.880\ngive us knowledge of the DNS key\nin the zone on the other server.\n\n607\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.394\nSo we're gonna come over here,\ngonna go to File to Import.\n\n608\n00:31:06.394 --> 00:31:11.565\nLet me just type in the path here,\n\n609\n00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:14.893\nPLABDC01 and DNS.\n\n610\n00:31:14.893 --> 00:31:22.031\nAnd then our key sets,\nwhich were spelled out correctly,\n\n611\n00:31:22.031 --> 00:31:27.422\nkeyset-secure.practicelabs.com, so\n\n612\n00:31:27.422 --> 00:31:30.926\nwe're gonna specify that.\n\n613\n00:31:30.926 --> 00:31:36.110\nLet's click OK, and you'll see I'm\nable to bring that in, all right?\n\n614\n00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.388\nSo we then have a little\nplaceholder that shows up there.\n\n615\n00:31:39.388 --> 00:31:41.450\nAgain, obviously, you gotta make\nsure you have the right path,\n\n616\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.520\ngotta make sure the DNS folder is shared,\nas I showed you.\n\n617\n00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.472\nAnd you gotta make sure you know how\nto get to and find the file, but\n\n618\n00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:49.693\nwe're just assuming obviously that\nall that is available to you in your\n\n619\n00:31:49.693 --> 00:31:50.659\nlocal environment,\n\n620\n00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:54.165\nmeaning you would translate the name\nspace into whatever you've called it.\n\n621\n00:31:54.165 --> 00:31:57.263\nAnd provide the appropriate name and the\npath to wherever you've shared it from, so\n\n622\n00:31:57.263 --> 00:31:59.151\nyou can pull in the file,\nright, just so you know.\n\n623\n00:31:59.151 --> 00:32:03.095\nAll right, so we've done that, and\nyou'll see that under Trust Points,\n\n624\n00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:06.304\nwe have com under there,\nwe have practice labs under there.\n\n625\n00:32:06.304 --> 00:32:10.160\nWe have secure and notice,\njust move this over here,\n\n626\n00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.140\nsame as parent, valid, notice we\nhave our DNS key references here.\n\n627\n00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.847\nWe just brought those in,\nimported them over, or\n\n628\n00:32:19.847 --> 00:32:23.893\nplaced the trust anchor onto this system.\n\n629\n00:32:23.893 --> 00:32:28.292\nNow that we've done that,\nrather I should say, we'll now have\n\n630\n00:32:28.292 --> 00:32:33.350\nknowledge of the other zone and the\nability to be able to interact with it.\n\n631\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.725\nNow we have to validate this of course.\n\n632\n00:32:34.725 --> 00:32:38.190\nAnd we have to understand that\nthe DNS trust or the DNS keys and\n\n633\n00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.518\nthe trust anchors are there,\nwe know they're there.\n\n634\n00:32:40.518 --> 00:32:44.260\nWe're seeing them look good, but we gotta\ngive it the old litmus test, as we say.\n\n635\n00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.183\nRight, we gotta actually go through,\nand we gotta connect to it.\n\n636\n00:32:46.183 --> 00:32:48.650\nAnd we gotta make sure they're there.\n\n637\n00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.340\nWe're gonna come back and\ndo that in our next episode.\n\n638\n00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.025\nBecause as I look across at the clock, and\n\n639\n00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:57.109\nI see that we are all out of time,\nit looks like.\n\n640\n00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:00.660\nAll right, so we've laid down\nthe foundation, got all the stuff set up.\n\n641\n00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.161\nWalked through the logic of how to\nset up the zone, how to sign it,\n\n642\n00:33:03.161 --> 00:33:05.130\ngot a lot of the heavy\nlifting out of the way.\n\n643\n00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.150\nNow, the really cool fun stuff happens\nwhen you come back and you join us for\n\n644\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.140\npart three.\n\n645\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.053\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, for part three,\n\n646\n00:33:10.053 --> 00:33:12.393\nwe're gonna actually show you how\nto verify those trust anchors,\n\n647\n00:33:12.393 --> 00:33:13.580\nmake sure they're working.\n\n648\n00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.587\nAnd we're gonna play around with\nsome other stuff in there and\n\n649\n00:33:15.587 --> 00:33:17.956\nshow you how to make sure everything\nis exactly as you would like it to be.\n\n650\n00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:20.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe always gotta check our work, right?\n\n651\n00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.139\nOr we don't get credit for it,\nlike they would say in elementary school.\n\n652\n00:33:23.139 --> 00:33:27.640\nBut that's true, so let's go ahead and\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n653\n00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.860\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n654\n00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n655\n00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.527\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n656\n00:33:32.527 --> 00:33:39.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n657\n00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.387\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.349\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.940\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.532\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.005\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.780\nWe're continuing with our DNS journey,\nwe've been speaking about DNSSEC.\n\n8\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.590\nWe even started a demonstration\nin a previous episode.\n\n9\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.640\nSo back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.160\nThank you for joining today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.126\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nalways a pleasure to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:33.702\nSo we're gonna continue our\nconversations around DNSSEC.\n\n13\n00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.490\nWe're gonna jump back\nin where we left off.\n\n14\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.097\nJust to remind you, this is one of those\nthings that if you haven't seen the prior\n\n15\n00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:41.448\nepisode, you're really\ngonna literally be lost.\n\n16\n00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:42.800\nYou're not gonna know what we are doing.\n\n17\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.096\nSo encourage you to go back and\ntake a look.\n\n18\n00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:46.407\nWe're in the middle of setting up DNSSEC.\n\n19\n00:00:46.407 --> 00:00:50.037\nWe've take in our zone file on our\noriginal DNS domain controller\n\n20\n00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:52.480\nActive Directory integrated server.\n\n21\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.020\nWe've created a separate zone file to\nwork with, secure.practicelabs.com.\n\n22\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.780\nGone ahead, walked through\nthe extensive explanation process of\n\n23\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.800\nactually creating a signed zone.\n\n24\n00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.550\nWe've done that,\nwe've shared out our DNS file.\n\n25\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.955\nWe've imported the DNS key\nonto a secondary DNS server,\n\n26\n00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.990\nnon-authoritative for the zone.\n\n27\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.000\nSet that up, and allowed the trust\nanchor points to be established.\n\n28\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.474\nWe've done all that in\nthe prior conversation.\n\n29\n00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.425\nNow we're about to go to a client, totally\nunrelated to either of these servers,\n\n30\n00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:23.757\nour Windows 10 machine.\n\n31\n00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:25.940\nAnd we're gonna validate that\nthose trust anchors are working.\n\n32\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.725\nSo if you join me here,\nyou'll see I've already set up PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:30.210\nWe've already got it loaded, ready to go.\n\n34\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.100\nThis part of the demonstration is\nliterally five seconds cuz we're about to\n\n35\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.860\ngo back into our servers and\nstart doing some other stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.950\nBut just wanna validate what we've done,\nand let me move this over.\n\n37\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.876\nI didn't realize I was cutting\noff the edge of the screen there.\n\n38\n00:01:40.876 --> 00:01:43.211\nBut you can see that I've gone and\n\n39\n00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:47.640\nissued a very straightforward command,\nResolve-DnsName.\n\n40\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.990\nThe name parameters,\nsecure.practicelabs.com.trustanchors.\n\n41\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.490\nSo we're using our trust anchors\nthat we just established.\n\n42\n00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.786\nYou'll see the DNS keys right down here.\n\n43\n00:01:56.786 --> 00:02:00.230\nType, DNSKEY, server, and\nwe specify the name of the server.\n\n44\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.550\nThis is the non-authoritative server,\n\n45\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.580\nthe secondary DNS server that we\nimported the trust anchor points onto.\n\n46\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.380\nSo we just set them up, establish them.\n\n47\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.060\nWe're validating from a client\nthat they are there and active.\n\n48\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.280\nAnd that we can access them and\nthat they're working.\n\n49\n00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.970\nAnd we know they are cuz we\nsaw the import was successful.\n\n50\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.086\nBut I suggested right at the end of\nthe last episode that trust, but verify.\n\n51\n00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:26.338\nCherokee kinda said the same thing, right?\n\n52\n00:02:26.338 --> 00:02:29.880\nWe have to trust our work, get our\ngold star for work well done, right?\n\n53\n00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.230\nThat we have to trust and\nknow what we did.\n\n54\n00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.360\nBut it's always good to verify\nwhat we did just to make sure.\n\n55\n00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.623\nSo we're doing that right now.\n\n56\n00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:39.090\nAnd this is how we would verify that those\ntrust anchors are established and working.\n\n57\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.450\nSo we're able to do this.\n\n58\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.870\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna flip over or go back to,\n\n59\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.118\nI should say, our domain\ncontroller where we were working.\n\n60\n00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:51.436\nSo let me just bring up our domain\ncontroller machine where our zone\n\n61\n00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:55.226\nis originating from,\nour secure.practicelabs.com.\n\n62\n00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.115\nAnd what we're gonna\ndo is go back in here.\n\n63\n00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:01.400\nAnd we're gonna distribute out our trust\nanchors to another domain controller.\n\n64\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.210\nBut do so in a slight different way.\n\n65\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.560\nSo we're gonna go here, gonna right-click\non our secure.practicelabs.com.\n\n66\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.648\nZone file, go back to our DNSSEC menu.\n\n67\n00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:15.178\nAnd I pointed out as we did\nthe walkthrough that the part\n\n68\n00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:18.368\nabout signing the zone with the active,\nwhen we did this initially,\n\n69\n00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:20.192\nthe other two options were grayed out.\n\n70\n00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:22.610\nI showed you, or\nat least told you, what they were.\n\n71\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.505\nShowed you now, or I'm showing you now,\nthat we can unsign the zone.\n\n72\n00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.670\nCuz obviously if you sign, you can unsign.\n\n73\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.170\nWe're not gonna do that,\nwe are gonna go into Properties.\n\n74\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.495\nAnd now that is optional, and\nactive, and available for\n\n75\n00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:35.510\nus cuz we've created a sign zone.\n\n76\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.250\nLet me just move this over here,\n\n77\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.700\nkind of away from some of the distractions\nof all the stuff going on behind us.\n\n78\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.560\nNow let's just take a moment\nto look at the properties of\n\n79\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.300\nthe zone file that's been signed.\n\n80\n00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.165\nAll those choices we made,\n\n81\n00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:51.961\nall those options we saw in the zone\nsigning wizard as we went through.\n\n82\n00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:56.970\nThe KSK, the ZSK, the NSEC,\nrecords, the trust anchors.\n\n83\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.780\nAll that stuff's here, all the choices\nwe made, all the options we have.\n\n84\n00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.830\nThey're gonna be available to us.\n\n85\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.464\nSo we can go through and, obviously,\ntake a look at what we have.\n\n86\n00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:04.963\nWe'll go into the trust anchor and\n\n87\n00:04:04.963 --> 00:04:08.179\nthen talk about how we can distribute\nour trust anchors to other servers.\n\n88\n00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.430\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n89\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.732\nBut the key master is specified here,\nthe machine that acts as our key master.\n\n90\n00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:15.530\nWe talked about this as\nwe did our walkthrough.\n\n91\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.229\nWe have the option to change this.\n\n92\n00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.522\nOur signing key is specified here\nwith all the choices we made.\n\n93\n00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:25.365\nOur zone signing key, specified\nhere with all the choices we made.\n\n94\n00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:31.232\nOur NSEC3 information or NSEC, depending\non what we're doing, specified here.\n\n95\n00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:35.375\nOur trust anchor, and I showed you\nthis when I was doing the wizard, but\n\n96\n00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.697\nI did not check it off.\n\n97\n00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:40.025\nAnd select, remember, we went back,\nkinda walked through all the options.\n\n98\n00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:41.371\nCanceled out of the wizard,\n\n99\n00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:44.570\njust accepted the default just\nto set up the zone initially.\n\n100\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.210\nAnd the default choice is not\nto distribute the trust anchors.\n\n101\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.320\nSo it's one of the reasons I\nwent through and reset it.\n\n102\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.155\nTo ensure that I had not made any choices\nthat would then not have it set up and\n\n103\n00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:57.615\nready to go here for us.\n\n104\n00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:00.195\nAnd you see that I can go ahead,\nand I can check this box off.\n\n105\n00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.795\nAnd indeed, that's what we're\ngonna do to set this up and\n\n106\n00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:04.767\nsend it out to another domain controller.\n\n107\n00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:06.629\nI'm gonna demo this for\nyou in just a second.\n\n108\n00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.329\nBefore we do that,\nlet's just come over here to Advanced.\n\n109\n00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:12.877\nAnd you'll see the other part of that\nconversation around our TTL values and\n\n110\n00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.517\nour algorithm for signing.\n\n111\n00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:16.477\nAll of the stuff we saw in\nthe wizard is all right here.\n\n112\n00:05:16.477 --> 00:05:18.537\nSo walking through with you and\n\n113\n00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:21.497\nchoosing to manually provide\nthose parameters in the wizard.\n\n114\n00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:26.077\nYou see all we're doing is essentially\npopulating every tab in every area here\n\n115\n00:05:26.077 --> 00:05:28.387\non the properties of the sign zone.\n\n116\n00:05:28.387 --> 00:05:30.047\nThat's what we're doing with the wizard.\n\n117\n00:05:30.047 --> 00:05:33.390\nSo we're gonna enable this right here,\ncheck that off.\n\n118\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.580\nWe're then gonna go ahead,\nand we're gonna click OK.\n\n119\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.580\nNow remember, I told you,\nwhen I showed you this in the wizard,\n\n120\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.140\nthat this would allow us to\nreplicate out the trust anchors\n\n121\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.555\nto all the domain controllers that\nare Active Directory integrated.\n\n122\n00:05:43.555 --> 00:05:44.980\nWe talked about this, right?\n\n123\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.330\nSo it says here the following\nis the summary of changes made\n\n124\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.050\non the zone secure.practicelabs.com,\nwhatever our signing zone is.\n\n125\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.550\nThe DNSSEC parameters for\nthe zone have been modified.\n\n126\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.700\nClick Yes to proceed, No to abort, right?\n\n127\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.520\nSo it's just telling us, hey,\nwe're modifying them, great.\n\n128\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.600\nConfiguration, DNSSEC\nupdate was successful.\n\n129\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.600\nSo we see we do have a,\nhey, we're updating.\n\n130\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.120\nHey, by the way, we're successful,\ngood to know, right?\n\n131\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.320\nClick OK, so we've been able to now\nsend that out and make that available.\n\n132\n00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.530\nAnd we're now able to go in,\nand we're gonna go check that.\n\n133\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.770\nGonna go to another domain\ncontroller that has DNS running,\n\n134\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.336\nour PlabSA01 machine, and\nsee whether or not that's shown up.\n\n135\n00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:28.360\nSo what we're gonna do is just\nbring up another server here.\n\n136\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.030\nThat should be this one right?\n\n137\n00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.510\nNope, that's the DM one,\nthat should be this one, right here.\n\n138\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n139\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.761\nI haven't loaded the DNS console on this\njust cuz I didn't want to have it open,\n\n140\n00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:39.731\nhave this setup.\n\n141\n00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.422\nAnd then have to worry\nabout whether it showed up.\n\n142\n00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.530\nAnd refreshing, stopping,\nstarting, things like that.\n\n143\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.160\nSo we're just gonna open the DNS console\nnow, but this is yet another machine.\n\n144\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.730\nYou'll notice it is\nan Active Directory Domain Controller.\n\n145\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.210\nNotice it is running DNS, right?\n\n146\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.383\nSo we're gonna go in, let's go to Tools,\nlet's go to DNS, right there.\n\n147\n00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:03.927\nAll right, so we have our PlabSA01,\nlet's just minimize this.\n\n148\n00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:08.903\nExtend that out there, let's open this up.\n\n149\n00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:13.615\nYou'll see that we do have, Our\n\n150\n00:07:13.615 --> 00:07:18.000\nsecure.practicelabs.com zone, right?\n\n151\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.230\nSo we can see that there,\nwe can see our trust points are there.\n\n152\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.374\nCuz remember, we just said, hey, replicate\nthem out, make sure they're available,\n\n153\n00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:29.307\nour trust anchor, right?\n\n154\n00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Checking our work, yeah.\n\n155\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Checking our work,\nyou better have those gold stars handy.\n\n156\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna need a bunch of them by the\n\n157\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.822\ntime we're done cuz I got some wickedly\ncool stuff we're doing here, all right?\n\n158\n00:07:37.822 --> 00:07:38.930\nSo practicelabs.com,\n\n159\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.390\nI'm just walking through\nthe hierarchy the way we did before.\n\n160\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.650\nAnd you can see, our DNS keys\nhave been replicated out, right?\n\n161\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.224\nSo by enabling that check box on\nthe properties of the original zone that\n\n162\n00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:53.506\nwas signed from our main controller,\nthe master key controller.\n\n163\n00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.504\nWhere we've established the zone,\nsigned it, have control of everything.\n\n164\n00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:59.636\nWe've said, hey, go replicate that\nto any and all domain controllers.\n\n165\n00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:03.221\nThat are set up,\nthat are active directory integrated, and\n\n166\n00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:05.208\nnow we have access to those keys.\n\n167\n00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.710\nAnd you could see them here and\nwe're be able to see them, right?\n\n168\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.040\nSo now we could query a sign zone\n\n169\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.200\nnow that we've established\nthat this is all working.\n\n170\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.730\nOne of the things that we would then\ntypically do is, we can go ahead and\n\n171\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.680\nquery a sign zone without DNS\nsec validation required, so\n\n172\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.372\nyou know what's going on with or\nwithout it.\n\n173\n00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:24.280\nThen you kinda validate it, there's\nlots of ways we could go in and do this.\n\n174\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.700\nWe could for instance go in, so\nif I go back to my Windows 10 system and\n\n175\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.000\nI'll do this right now.\n\n176\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.050\nAnd we go ahead and\n\n177\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.870\nwe specify some commands to resolve\nthe DNS name and see what happens.\n\n178\n00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.420\nLet's see what kind of\ninformation we get back.\n\n179\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.710\nSo let's go over to Windows 10,\nthat should be right there, and\n\n180\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.489\nlet's go ahead and\ndo the following let's do our resolve DNS\n\n181\n00:08:47.489 --> 00:08:53.625\nname let's put that in there.\n\n182\n00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:58.026\nwww.secure.practicelabs.com, oops\n\n183\n00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:04.260\nThey always make it look so\nsimple on that commercial.\n\n184\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.660\nWe talked about Dragon, naturally\nspeak Dragon type or whatever, yeah.\n\n185\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.570\nIf you've ever seen those infomercials for\nit, there's the woman or the man,\n\n186\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.030\nwhoever's doing it, it's like a five or\nten minute commercial.\n\n187\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.190\nThey're on there with the headset and\nthey're just talking.\n\n188\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.180\nAs they're talking stuff's\nhappening on the screen.\n\n189\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.410\nAll over the place,\nthey make it look so simple.\n\n190\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.747\nLike it would be so cool,\nif it actually worked that way and\n\n191\n00:09:21.747 --> 00:09:22.760\nI could just stand here.\n\n192\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not real life.\n\n193\n00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.575\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way, right?\n\n194\n00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:26.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If that's somebody underneath that\n\n195\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.170\nwhere you don't see them that's like\non the screen that's typing, right?\n\n196\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.500\nThat's just making stuff appear there,\nright?\n\n197\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.710\nBecause it's not them,\nyou know it doesn't work that way.\n\n198\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.408\nIf I tried it, it would be typing\nlike hey, let's go for coffee or\n\n199\n00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:40.781\nsomething crazy and nothing would work.\n\n200\n00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:42.820\nI'm just jealous and\nbitter what can I can say.\n\n201\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.767\nAll right so server and\nthen we're gonna specify our server name\n\n202\n00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:51.530\nhere plabdm01,\nmake sure I got that correct.\n\n203\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.235\nAll right now we're gonna do an extra\nlittle switch here DNS sec okay,\n\n204\n00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:57.843\nat the end there right.\n\n205\n00:09:57.843 --> 00:10:01.582\nAnd so let's see what happens here,\nand look at what we get back, right.\n\n206\n00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:05.650\nSo let's just take a look at\nsome of that information.\n\n207\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:11.440\nThis shows us that we are successful,\nright, and we get back our information.\n\n208\n00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.239\nAnd just move that over cuz I know it\nkind of cuts off the edge of the screen,\n\n209\n00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:14.745\nthere we go.\n\n210\n00:10:14.745 --> 00:10:16.895\nAll right, so what do we see here?\n\n211\n00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:18.995\nWell, securepracticelabs.com,\nwhat do we get?\n\n212\n00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:21.673\nWe've got host record back,\nwe can see that.\n\n213\n00:10:21.673 --> 00:10:25.315\nGot our TTL.RIP address, that's\ntraditionally what we'd expect from DNS,\n\n214\n00:10:25.315 --> 00:10:27.912\nthat's good, but\nwe got some other stuff here.\n\n215\n00:10:27.912 --> 00:10:32.852\nWe've got our script practice labs.com our\nquery type resource record signature we've\n\n216\n00:10:32.852 --> 00:10:38.586\ngot our TTL.the information associated\nwith it including right see here?\n\n217\n00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:41.565\nExpiration [CROSSTALK],\nsee here signed signer.\n\n218\n00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:42.866\nSorry to cut you off, signature.\n\n219\n00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:43.816\n&gt;&gt; No, it's okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n220\n00:10:43.816 --> 00:10:47.566\nall of that stuff is part of\nwhat DNS set provides, right?\n\n221\n00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:49.584\nYes go ahead.\n&gt;&gt; The TTL is specific for\n\n222\n00:10:49.584 --> 00:10:55.328\nthis particular, this signature or\nthis anchor that we've created?\n\n223\n00:10:55.328 --> 00:10:57.678\nOr what are we specifying\nwith the TTL there?\n\n224\n00:10:57.678 --> 00:11:01.298\n&gt;&gt; This is the information the TTL\nthat we are providing associated\n\n225\n00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:03.128\nwith the record files that we created.\n\n226\n00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:05.328\n&gt;&gt; The record, okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you remember we went in and\n\n227\n00:11:05.328 --> 00:11:08.288\non the properties when we looked at the\nzone there was some stuff on the very last\n\n228\n00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:10.248\ntab under advanced where we had\nTTL values things like that.\n\n229\n00:11:10.248 --> 00:11:11.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; That those were those values that we\n\n230\n00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:12.183\nare taking away.\n\n231\n00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:14.498\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we have all of this here, right?\n\n232\n00:11:14.498 --> 00:11:19.316\n&gt;&gt; And you'll see the original limit\nis original TLLs 3600 this incremented\n\n233\n00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:24.360\ndown because it's counting down if you\nunderstand the logic of how TLL works.\n\n234\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.180\nYou know essentially it's a master\nvalue and every time you issue\n\n235\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.620\nagainst it the clock starts ticking from\nthe master value down toward zero, right?\n\n236\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.070\nThat's the idea behind it, and so\nyou're seeing essentially that this\n\n237\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.610\nwas immediately goes to this\none when we made the quarry.\n\n238\n00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.380\nIf we go back and keep doing this this\nwould increment down lower lower lower.\n\n239\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.880\nAt some point it would\nultimately hit zero and\n\n240\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.000\ndisappear, we'd have to refresh that to\nget a new updated reference to the record.\n\n241\n00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.450\nIt would still be the same information\nbut, it would just, you know,\n\n242\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.450\nultimately count down to zero.\n\n243\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.080\nSo if you wonder why we\nhave an original TTL.\n\n244\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.580\nAnd the incremental or the slight\ndifferent or variation one here.\n\n245\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.310\nIt counts down from the original value.\n\n246\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.960\nAnd we keep seeing that go lower and\nlower every time we issue a query.\n\n247\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.260\nIf we query again, we would just\nsee it kinda incrementing down.\n\n248\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.104\nEventually until it hit\nzero if we keep going.\n\n249\n00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:08.659\nAll right, so let's take a look.\n\n250\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.000\n&gt;&gt; Got this is kind of cool right let me\njust get to our little prompt down there.\n\n251\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.392\nIt's just kind of hanging right at\nthe bottom, it's lost I can see it, so\n\n252\n00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:21.110\nlet me just bring the stuff right here.\n\n253\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.610\nRight so now or we can do right this\nweek to take a look at something else,\n\n254\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:32.420\nanother interesting thing that may be of\nsome worthwhile conversation time for us.\n\n255\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.132\nDNS client nrpt policy, got that okay,\n\n256\n00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:41.020\nso let's just take a looks here.\n\n257\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.205\nSo when we do this, right?\n\n258\n00:12:44.205 --> 00:12:47.270\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH]\nWhat we see and\n\n259\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.440\nlet me talk about I haven't really\nmentioned the NRPT value before,\n\n260\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.590\nthe name resolution\n&gt;&gt; Policy, table?\n\n261\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Policy table, right.\n\n262\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.230\nThe NRPT I didn't really throw it\nout there we are talking about so\n\n263\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.040\nmany other things it would have kind\nof just got lost in the shuffle.\n\n264\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.580\nIt is a little bit easier to\ntalk about it while we are here\n\n265\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.800\nthan it is to actually just throw it out\nahead of time and say you remember we\n\n266\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.720\ntalked about that whole thing back\n&gt;&gt; Three episodes ago.\n\n267\n00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.330\nYou remember that.\n\n268\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.154\nWherever you were sitting there going\nI don't know what the heck is he\n\n269\n00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:10.820\ntalking about, right?\n\n270\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.150\nSo, the NRPT value, NRPT,\nthe name resolution policy table.\n\n271\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.827\nWhat this does is it's just a table\nof all of our name spaces and\n\n272\n00:13:18.827 --> 00:13:21.880\ncorresponding settings,\nthey'tr stored in the Windows registry.\n\n273\n00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.986\nAnd this allows us to determine,\nlocal of each machine.\n\n274\n00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:27.874\nSo I'm looking at the NRPT\npolicy on Windows 10 machine.\n\n275\n00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:30.470\nThat's what I'm trying to query for\nI don't get anything back.\n\n276\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.810\nRight?\nWhat you're seeing is, essentially,\n\n277\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.290\nwhat will be the clients behavior when\nissuing queries and processing responses?\n\n278\n00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.510\nAnd as a result to that,\nwe could specify and manipulate\n\n279\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.030\nthe NRPT policy to achieve certain end\nresults or do a variety of things.\n\n280\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.330\nSo we're just checking\nto see what is there.\n\n281\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.870\nWe could set this up a group policy,\nby the way as well.\n\n282\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.120\nHave some information in the show notes.\n\n283\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.360\nI'm just looking at my notes here.\n\n284\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.890\nJust to give you, no I didn't\nactually put in the whole, no, I did.\n\n285\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.800\nYeah, I did put in the path.\n\n286\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.080\nI was looking to see if I had the path for\nyou for group policy.\n\n287\n00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.150\nI gave you a little bit of\ninformation on it, I told you more or\n\n288\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.710\nless where to look for\nthe policy settings.\n\n289\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.840\nLet me just quickly tell you.\n\n290\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.650\nYou go in under Computer Configuration\na policies, Windows settings,\n\n291\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.350\nname resolution policy.\n\n292\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.690\nOr you can obviously do this\nwith PowerShell as well.\n\n293\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.400\nBut you can go in and you can actually\nlook For this information and\n\n294\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.240\nspecify these policies.\n\n295\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.980\nAnd what I mean by that\nis if we go here and\n\n296\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.920\nwe go here, have a little webpage for\nyou on the NRPT.\n\n297\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.370\nThis is by the way coming\nthrough is from Server 1212 R2.\n\n298\n00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.910\nSo again not brand new to 16,\nsomething that's been around a while.\n\n299\n00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.250\nWe're just integrating it here and adding\nit to the mix along with all the other\n\n300\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.630\nstuff we're doing,\nto make sure you're familiar with it.\n\n301\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.570\nBut you'll see here, right,\nthis is gonna setup, this I told you,\n\n302\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.730\nall the information either through\ngroup policy or PowerShell.\n\n303\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.500\nBut it just has a bunch of rules\nassociated with how the client will behave\n\n304\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.460\nand what we can do when we query and\nhow we get those responses back,\n\n305\n00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.930\nhow we program or\ndeal with them once we do.\n\n306\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.160\nThe policy editor, you could see it here,\n\n307\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.110\nit kinda walks you through\nthe logic of where to go.\n\n308\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.450\nThe path I just mentioned.\n\n309\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.580\nRight there, so I just gave that to you\nbut it's in the notes for you as well.\n\n310\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.106\nSo you could set up NRPT and we can then\ngo ahead and we can specify as a result\n\n311\n00:15:09.106 --> 00:15:13.345\nwhat certain behavior may look like\nwhat we expected to be able to do.\n\n312\n00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:17.696\nYou'll see we do have some options\nhere we can apply a suffix,\n\n313\n00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:22.060\na prefix, an FQDN, subnets for\nIPv4 and or IPv6 right?\n\n314\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.460\nSo based on things coming in we can\napply the policy as a result of any of\n\n315\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.530\nthose things.\n\n316\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.710\nWe can use this to create\ndifferent types of rules right?\n\n317\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.680\nAnd obviously we can use this\nwith DNSSEC and then specify\n\n318\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.030\nthat there's information associated with\nit that's why we're talking about it here.\n\n319\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.270\nSo they talk about the processing\norder of NRPT rules.\n\n320\n00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.860\nIf you're familiar with group policy,\nhopefully you remember.\n\n321\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.704\nYou may or not know, but\nhopefully you remember.\n\n322\n00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:49.496\nProcessing order is local, we always start\nwith the local policy on the machine,\n\n323\n00:15:49.496 --> 00:15:53.525\nwhich kinda sets up our basic\nbackground infrastructure settings so\n\n324\n00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:56.174\nour desktop is the generic\nWindows desktop.\n\n325\n00:15:56.174 --> 00:15:59.019\nGot a Start button or\nsome sort of icon, lower left.\n\n326\n00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:00.814\nTrashcan for recycle bin on the desktop,\n\n327\n00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:04.210\nwhatever the standard settings would\nbe that comes from our local GPO.\n\n328\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.750\nWe have a site link, domain link,\nand organizational unit link GPO.\n\n329\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.100\nWe follow through in those orders and\n\n330\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.460\nkind of apply the policy\nbased on where it may fall.\n\n331\n00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.050\nAnd so we just followed\nthe standard processing order\n\n332\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.130\nto be able to go through and do that.\n\n333\n00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.910\nSo let's just talk a bit about this,\nand how you can set this up.\n\n334\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.660\nOnce you get this all configured,\nyou can see here, we are able to require,\n\n335\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.440\nwhich is the part that's interesting\nwhich is why we are talking about it.\n\n336\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.150\nConfigure to require or\nnot require validation for\n\n337\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.230\nspecific segments of your namespace,\nright?\n\n338\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.380\nIt says, for example,\n\n339\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.130\nyou may use conditional forwarding\nto disable DNSSEC validation.\n\n340\n00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.360\nAnd they talk about describing that and\nshow you where you can do that.\n\n341\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.660\nWe can implement conditional forwarding\nthat directs us to certain systems.\n\n342\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.500\nWe've talked about conditional forwarding,\ndid a demo on that.\n\n343\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.930\nSo we could use this to be able\nto enable or turn on or off or\n\n344\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.800\nprovide support for functionality.\n\n345\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.440\nAnd so they just walk us through\nthe logic of how this works.\n\n346\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.970\nSo we're just checking and\n\n347\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.390\nshowing you what the NRPT\npolicy would be on the system.\n\n348\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.285\nWe're just going through and\n\n349\n00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:05.720\ntake a look at it with the appropriate\nPowerShell command to show you here.\n\n350\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.170\nThere is a policy for\nDNSSEC validation, right?\n\n351\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.960\nWe may or may not have one it's\na matter of how we set this up.\n\n352\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.310\nBut just keep in mind that\nwe have that available, and\n\n353\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.610\nwe could play with this as well.\n\n354\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.785\nJust adding another piece into the puzzle\nfor you, so that when we set up DNSSEC and\n\n355\n00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:23.025\nwe maybe using NRPT policies.\n\n356\n00:17:23.025 --> 00:17:25.665\nWe wanna keep in mind that we\nwanna make sure that we're not\n\n357\n00:17:25.665 --> 00:17:28.515\nshooting ourselves in the foot\nby getting in the way of DNSSEC\n\n358\n00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.825\nperhaps providing policies\nthat could block that,\n\n359\n00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:34.800\nor somehow modify that behavior, so we\njust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n360\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.370\nWe could set up support for this,\nas we said, through either a GPO,\n\n361\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.950\nGroup Policy Object, or with PowerShell.\n\n362\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.060\nWe could do it either way.\n\n363\n00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.290\nNow if we wanted to go in and\n\n364\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:48.960\nset up Group Policy Support to\nprovide NRPT in a group policy.\n\n365\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.460\nWe could go in and\nedit the policy out, set it up.\n\n366\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.030\nAnd I'll show you how to\ndo that really quickly.\n\n367\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.330\nJust go into the path real quick and\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n368\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.010\nSo let me switch over to\nmy domain controller.\n\n369\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.350\nAnd just quickly show you where\nthe policy is, that path we looked at and\n\n370\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.700\nsome of the things associated with that.\n\n371\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.770\nSo let me get over to my domain\ncontroller, right there.\n\n372\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.100\nAnd what we're gonna do\nis just open up our GPMC,\n\n373\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.690\nour Group Policy Management Console.\n\n374\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:18.080\nSo let me just minimize DNS here for\nthe moment, bring up our Server Manager.\n\n375\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.480\nAnd let me bring up our group\npolicy management tool.\n\n376\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.070\nJust go over here,\nour GPM tool right there.\n\n377\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.780\nAnd this will take just\na moment to open up.\n\n378\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.700\nAnd I love the Microsoft tools, right?\n\n379\n00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.160\nSo I said, hey open this for me.\n\n380\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.650\nBut no, don't bring it up and actually\nput it up in way where I wanna use it.\n\n381\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.650\nBut put it like down there and\n\n382\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.570\nmake it flash at me,\nlike its too good to open for me.\n\n383\n00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.130\nI have to go to it, right?\n\n384\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.820\nIts just you know one of\nthose high brow kind of\n\n385\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.750\nentitled tools as suppose\nto a common versus tool.\n\n386\n00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.660\n&gt;&gt; They want you to look for it,\nits kind of like a fun little game Adam.\n\n387\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.030\n&gt;&gt; No, its just bad UI design\nis what it is, but that's okay.\n\n388\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.650\nAll right, so we're gonna bring this\nup right here and well, look at that.\n\n389\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.750\nWe have our Group Policy Management tool,\nso we have that.\n\n390\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.340\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n391\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.750\nLet's make this full screen, so\nwe can start working with it.\n\n392\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:05.640\nNow I'm sure that a lot of you have seen\nthe Group Policy Management tool before.\n\n393\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.780\nHopefully you've had a chance to\nplay with it, interact with it.\n\n394\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.330\nBut you may not have, you never\nwanna take that stuff for granted.\n\n395\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.990\nSo just a quick 30 second,\nhigh-level overview of what policy is.\n\n396\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.170\nThe idea behind group policy is,\n\n397\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.120\nmanipulation of the Windows\nregistry on a machine.\n\n398\n00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.990\nBut doing so\nwith a graphical interface, so\n\n399\n00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.560\nyou're doing it in a way that's not\ngoing to hurt, or harm, or break things.\n\n400\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.390\nBecause we have the ability\nto control what you can do,\n\n401\n00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.580\nwhat settings you have access to.\n\n402\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.175\nAnd by saving those setting off into\ntemplate files of some kind, and\n\n403\n00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:36.995\nthen applying them when the client\nauthenticates into the domain.\n\n404\n00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:40.515\nAnd is gonna have either a user focus,\nor computer focus or\n\n405\n00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:43.557\nboth, cuz we have two sections\nof every policy traditionally.\n\n406\n00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.287\nFocusing on users settings,\nfocusing on computer settings.\n\n407\n00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:48.887\nThe ability to manipulate\nthe environmental variables\n\n408\n00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:51.447\nthat then control how we\nare able to do things.\n\n409\n00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:53.717\nWhat we're able to do under\nwhat conditions, etc.\n\n410\n00:19:53.717 --> 00:19:57.647\nSo thousands of settings literally\nare potentially available to us end\n\n411\n00:19:57.647 --> 00:19:59.257\nto end inside a group policy.\n\n412\n00:19:59.257 --> 00:20:01.737\nAnd this tool is just gonna\nallow us to go and edit one or\n\n413\n00:20:01.737 --> 00:20:05.980\nmore of those group policies, create one,\nmodify settings, whatever we wanna do.\n\n414\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.220\nGroup policy been around\nsince Windows 2000,\n\n415\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.340\nthis was switched over to what we\nthink of now as the Active Directory,\n\n416\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.380\nor the hierarchical namespace based\non LDAP that we're all familiar with.\n\n417\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.170\nBut we had a precursor to this tool that\nwas around since Windows 9X, since Windows\n\n418\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.970\n95 from the earliest days of graphical\noperating systems on the Microsoft side.\n\n419\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.385\nIt used to be call POLEDIT,\nI don't know if you remember.\n\n420\n00:20:30.385 --> 00:20:33.774\nYou may not remember the POLEDIT tool,\nthose of you out there that may or\n\n421\n00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:36.331\nmay not remember it, but\nPOLEDIT for Policy Editor.\n\n422\n00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:38.600\nAnd the POLEDIT tool is In Windows 9X and\n\n423\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.472\ngoing into the very early\ngenerations of clients,\n\n424\n00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:46.210\nwould have been a tool that you would have\nused as the precursor, the great, great,\n\n425\n00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:51.066\ngreat grandparent of group policy before\nwe had centralized directory management.\n\n426\n00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:53.355\nWe actually would add it\nlocally on the machine and\n\n427\n00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:56.027\nthe POLEDIT tool would allow\nus to contribute to modify and\n\n428\n00:20:56.027 --> 00:20:59.257\ncontrol those settings in the same\nkind of way that we do here, right?\n\n429\n00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:02.220\nSo it is kind of one of\nan old little bit of do.\n\n430\n00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.677\n&gt;&gt; We got a comment in the chat, yeah.\n\n431\n00:21:03.677 --> 00:21:06.000\nIt says, POLEDIT blast from the past.\n\n432\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.260\n&gt;&gt; It is,\nyou don't wanna play gig trivia with me.\n\n433\n00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.650\nI will kick your butt every time, right?\n\n434\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.123\nCuz I know all those things\nfrom all those years gone by.\n\n435\n00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:15.661\nBut just keep in mind, right?\n\n436\n00:21:15.661 --> 00:21:17.765\nDavid doesn't even barely\nremember that one,\n\n437\n00:21:17.765 --> 00:21:20.563\nthat you never hear David say\nhe doesn't remember an old tool.\n\n438\n00:21:20.563 --> 00:21:23.016\n&gt;&gt; The closest thing I was\nthinking was like DISM, but\n\n439\n00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:24.705\nthen I'm like that's not right.\n\n440\n00:21:24.705 --> 00:21:25.260\n&gt;&gt; D-I-S-M?\n\n441\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.000\nNo that's a totally different thing,\nso no not in this case.\n\n442\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.430\nNot what we're talking about here.\n\n443\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.320\nAll right, so we're gonna go in,\njust thought I'd give you a little\n\n444\n00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.790\nbackground the historical\nreference to that.\n\n445\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.040\nSo we're gonna go and we're gonna open\nup our group policy management console.\n\n446\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.995\nSo we're gonna open this up.\n\n447\n00:21:38.995 --> 00:21:40.140\nYou see we have our forest here.\n\n448\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.870\nLet's open up our domain practicelabs.com\nkind of get that opened up.\n\n449\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.290\nAnd what we're gonna do is\ncreate a new group policy.\n\n450\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.670\nIn case you haven't seen this done before,\nwe're gonna right-click and\n\n451\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.200\ncreate a new group policy right here.\n\n452\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.900\nAnd we're gonna call it DNSSEC and\n\n453\n00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.781\nwe're gonna look at some of\nthose NRPT settings, right?\n\n454\n00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:56.822\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna right-click right here.\n\n455\n00:21:56.822 --> 00:22:00.570\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and create\na GPO in this domain, I'll link it here.\n\n456\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.890\nYou could see we're doing that,\nright there.\n\n457\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.864\nWe just give it a name,\nwe'll just move this over here, and\n\n458\n00:22:06.864 --> 00:22:12.630\nwe'll call this DNSSEC, name it anything\nyou want doesn't really matter.\n\n459\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.140\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n460\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.700\nWe're not gonna have a source GPO, meaning\nwe're gonna start from a blank canvas and\n\n461\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.310\nkind just create our own as we go.\n\n462\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.570\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n463\n00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.180\nClick okay,\nyou'll see that our little shortcut for\n\n464\n00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.720\nour DNSSEC Policy gets created there.\n\n465\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.060\nNow when you click on that, you get this\nlittle pop up, depending on whether or\n\n466\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.330\nnot you've checked off that box.\n\n467\n00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.340\nIt says,\nhey you've selected a template link.\n\n468\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.820\nDo you want to actually edit the GPO?\n\n469\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.730\nWell, yes we do, so we'll click OK.\n\n470\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.140\nShows us the basic background\nproperties and things like that, right?\n\n471\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.540\nAnd so what we can do, is right-click and\nwe can choose Edit, right?\n\n472\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.708\nWe can go in and edit the GPO and\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n473\n00:22:45.708 --> 00:22:51.070\nSo we're gonna edit this GPO and\nlet's go ahead open this up.\n\n474\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.428\nGet a separate little window,\nkind of gives us our computer and\n\n475\n00:22:55.428 --> 00:22:57.088\nour user focus areas for editing.\n\n476\n00:22:57.088 --> 00:23:00.044\nLet us make this full screen here, stem\nthis out a little bit cuz you're gonna\n\n477\n00:23:00.044 --> 00:23:02.061\nhave to see where we're going or\nwhat we're doing.\n\n478\n00:23:02.061 --> 00:23:04.205\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n479\n00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:08.900\n[COUGH]\nLet me just figure out exactly what\n\n480\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.100\nI want right here, we got that,\nwe got that, we got that.\n\n481\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.230\nAnd we're go into our path\nunder computers, right, yeah.\n\n482\n00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.710\nSo we're gonna go into computers,\npolicies, Windows settings.\n\n483\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.640\nLet me just open this up.\n\n484\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.370\nWindows settings, give that a second.\n\n485\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.070\nNow this takes a moment to\nopen up cuz there's a lot.\n\n486\n00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.134\nYeah, there's just a lot of stuff\nyou kinda gotta load as you go.\n\n487\n00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:28.049\nSo don't be worried about the fact\nit may take a moment to show up,\n\n488\n00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:28.849\nit will be there.\n\n489\n00:23:28.849 --> 00:23:31.607\nAll right, and then you'll see\nName Resolution Policy, right there.\n\n490\n00:23:31.607 --> 00:23:34.690\nSo we just gonna open up click on that\n,and you can see there is nothing which is\n\n491\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.692\nfine it's up for the screen right here and\nthis is where we're gonna go in.\n\n492\n00:23:37.692 --> 00:23:41.405\nWe're gonna actually start programming\nthis is no hierarchy nothing opens up down\n\n493\n00:23:41.405 --> 00:23:44.215\nhere, where some of these other\npolicies do where you click and\n\n494\n00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.884\nthere's like 200 things that\nopen up right down below.\n\n495\n00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:48.824\nLooks like going into\nthe Event Viewer you see all those,\n\n496\n00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:51.504\nyou go to Microsoft folders, you see all\nthose things that open up down below.\n\n497\n00:23:51.504 --> 00:23:52.915\nSo this one's pretty straight forward,\nright?\n\n498\n00:23:52.915 --> 00:23:55.102\nSo we have our Name Resolution Policy,\nright?\n\n499\n00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:56.427\nThis is the NRPT.\n\n500\n00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:58.086\nInformation we were talking about.\n\n501\n00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:03.140\nSo what we're gonna do over here is we're\ngonna go ahead, and it says create a rule.\n\n502\n00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.030\nCan we actually go full screen, cuz I'm\nhovering over a little bit of this,\n\n503\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.394\nand it's gonna get bigger as we go.\n\n504\n00:24:07.394 --> 00:24:10.888\nAll right, so what we can see\nhere is the Create Rules area.\n\n505\n00:24:10.888 --> 00:24:14.682\nAnd you'll see to which part of the name\nspace does this rule apply, and\n\n506\n00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:15.850\nnotice here.\n\n507\n00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.807\nWe talked about some of these items and\n\n508\n00:24:17.807 --> 00:24:22.167\nI showed you the screen on the webpage\nsuffix, prefix FQDN, IPv4, IPv6 subnet.\n\n509\n00:24:22.167 --> 00:24:25.480\nSo we're gonna make a choice here.\n\n510\n00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.165\nSo we gonna leave it to default a suffix,\nwhat we're gonna do is put in a rule that\n\n511\n00:24:29.165 --> 00:24:31.155\nis gonna peeve it on\nthe suffix we provide.\n\n512\n00:24:31.155 --> 00:24:34.460\nSo we're gonna specify here,\nsecure.practicelabs.com.\n\n513\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.652\nJust remember that's our suffix for\n\n514\n00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:39.983\nour query that we're issuing\nagainst the signed zone.\n\n515\n00:24:39.983 --> 00:24:41.396\nWe're gonna link this all back.\n\n516\n00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:49.520\nSo secure.practicelabs,\n.com, type that in.\n\n517\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.206\nAnd then what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n518\n00:24:52.206 --> 00:24:53.876\nI'm gonna just scroll down here.\n\n519\n00:24:53.876 --> 00:24:57.220\nJust give me half a second just so\nyou can see a little bit more of that.\n\n520\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.760\nAll right, so then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna enable DNSSEC in this rule.\n\n521\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.772\nYou could see right here, we can turn\non DNSSEC associated with this rule.\n\n522\n00:25:04.772 --> 00:25:08.340\nThis is really the cool part, where we\nlink the two technologies together.\n\n523\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.603\nSo we're gonna take the DNSSEC,\napply it to this rule.\n\n524\n00:25:10.603 --> 00:25:12.379\nAnd then we have some options of course,\nand\n\n525\n00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:15.590\nwe'll talk about what's going on with\nthis tabs there in just a minute.\n\n526\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.300\nSo let's enable the DNSSEC in this\nrule and you'll see we check that off.\n\n527\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.410\nWe have our validation section right here.\n\n528\n00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.920\nValidate it says hey,\nrequire DNS clients to check that or\n\n529\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.820\ncheck the name and address has\nbeen validated by the DNS server.\n\n530\n00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.100\nSo we can force through this rule\nthe use of validation the use of DNSSEC.\n\n531\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.515\nAnd this is where we\napply the front end for\n\n532\n00:25:39.515 --> 00:25:43.103\nDNSSEC to the clients to force\nthem to use DNSSEC authorized or\n\n533\n00:25:43.103 --> 00:25:47.455\nsigned zones to ensure that they're\ngetting the proper name resolution.\n\n534\n00:25:47.455 --> 00:25:49.340\nThat's we're gonna be doing here.\n\n535\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.420\nSo we can specify that,\nnotice also by the way,\n\n536\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.700\nwe can force IPsec communication between\nthe DNS client and the DNS server.\n\n537\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.650\nNow we've talked about IPsec and\nthe value of it with IPv6.\n\n538\n00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.860\nIn fact, it's required for\nyou to use IPv6.\n\n539\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.356\nThose of you that know about IPsec and\nknow good old fashioned IPv4\n\n540\n00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:09.115\nknows that unless we go out\nof our way to set up IPsec.\n\n541\n00:26:09.115 --> 00:26:11.673\nAnd a lot of you may set it up,\nmay use it, but unless you\n\n542\n00:26:11.673 --> 00:26:15.590\ngo out of your way to apply it, it's not\nused natively, it's not used by default.\n\n543\n00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.260\nIt is supported, but its not used.\n\n544\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.244\nIn other words, we don't encrypt out IPv4\ntraffic by default natively using IPsec\n\n545\n00:26:23.244 --> 00:26:25.011\nwhere as we would with IPv6.\n\n546\n00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:28.963\nSo we have this option,\nbecause we can force the use of IPsec,\n\n547\n00:26:28.963 --> 00:26:33.790\nif we wanna provide that secure\nlevel of communication in theory.\n\n548\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.603\nLet's just say here, hypothetically,\nyou'll notice that we could specify low,\n\n549\n00:26:37.603 --> 00:26:39.278\nmedium, high level of encryption.\n\n550\n00:26:39.278 --> 00:26:44.365\nAnd we can specify the appropriate\nencryption algorithms to use with IPsec.\n\n551\n00:26:44.365 --> 00:26:47.268\nThat way we're able to provide the\nconfidentiality protections we spoke about\n\n552\n00:26:47.268 --> 00:26:48.098\nin the prior episode.\n\n553\n00:26:48.098 --> 00:26:51.667\nWhen we went into the discussion about\nwhat digital assigning may or not mean.\n\n554\n00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:55.553\nYou gotta be careful when you're setting\nup IPsec though because remember,\n\n555\n00:26:55.553 --> 00:26:58.282\nyou're gonna specify you\nwant it to be used here.\n\n556\n00:26:58.282 --> 00:27:00.912\nIf both parties don't support it and\nyou just highlight it and\n\n557\n00:27:00.912 --> 00:27:03.342\nset it up,\nyou're gonna have some problems.\n\n558\n00:27:03.342 --> 00:27:06.476\nSo understand that your DNS servers\nhave to support it, implement it,\n\n559\n00:27:06.476 --> 00:27:10.045\nhave it available, as well as the clients\nthat you're gonna apply this rule to.\n\n560\n00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:12.374\nIf you apply this to older clients,\n\n561\n00:27:12.374 --> 00:27:17.354\nwe have a mixture of clients that are\noperating in our domain at any one time.\n\n562\n00:27:17.354 --> 00:27:21.299\nIf everybody's standardized everything's\nWindows 10, Windows 8, or whatever, hey,\n\n563\n00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:23.710\nno big deal that's probably\ngonna work just fine.\n\n564\n00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.510\nBut let's go back in time a little,\n\n565\n00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.640\nlet see if there are some of\nthose Windows 7 clients in there.\n\n566\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.562\nMaybe we may even have\nsome earlier clients.\n\n567\n00:27:31.562 --> 00:27:35.837\nThey may not fully integrate with,\nsupport and understand IPsec or\n\n568\n00:27:35.837 --> 00:27:39.970\nbe able to provide support for\nit at the highest levels.\n\n569\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.052\nSo for instance, if we go back here for\njust one second,\n\n570\n00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:46.530\nthe use of AES may not be supported\nin older Microsoft clients,\n\n571\n00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.230\nwhereas the low level triple DES,\n3DES would.\n\n572\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.021\nSo you may be able to set this, but you\nwould have to understand the selection of\n\n573\n00:27:53.021 --> 00:27:56.820\nalgorithm could play a part in whether\nclients could actually use this or not.\n\n574\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.176\nAnd you may be shooting yourself in\nthe foot is all I'm suggesting to you,\n\n575\n00:27:59.176 --> 00:27:59.978\nthat could be a problem.\n\n576\n00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Making that decision by\nreducing that security there.\n\n577\n00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.906\n&gt;&gt; Well just that you wanna make sure\nthat you take into account all of your\n\n578\n00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:07.615\nclients support.\n\n579\n00:28:07.615 --> 00:28:10.200\nSo I'm suggesting if you do have\na mixed client environment.\n\n580\n00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.600\nIf you don't, it's not a big deal.\n\n581\n00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.423\nThen just enable it and all your\nnew modern clients should support.\n\n582\n00:28:15.423 --> 00:28:17.850\nAES is the highest level with no trouble.\n\n583\n00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.561\nBut we swap that in after\nXP around Windows 7.\n\n584\n00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:24.145\nSo XP and Vista, and\nsome of those earlier clients,\n\n585\n00:28:24.145 --> 00:28:28.160\neven though they're not supported I\nunderstand, you should not be using them.\n\n586\n00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.390\nThey're not longer under warranty,\nso to speak.\n\n587\n00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.181\nBut the reality is that I do have\nclients in the real world that\n\n588\n00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:36.162\nare running Windows XP and\nrunning Vista as crazy as that may be.\n\n589\n00:28:36.162 --> 00:28:38.770\nBut people do for a variety of reasons.\n\n590\n00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.287\nI'm just pointing out that those clients,\n\n591\n00:28:40.287 --> 00:28:42.260\neven though you may not expose\nthem to the outside world.\n\n592\n00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.000\nSo maybe they're not as big of\na security liability from a patch\n\n593\n00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.440\nmanagement perspective, things like that.\n\n594\n00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.608\nLast time I checked,\nthey still need DNS to do their job.\n\n595\n00:28:49.608 --> 00:28:53.275\n[LAUGH] So they still need to connect and\ncommunicate, and as a result,\n\n596\n00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:55.774\nyou may actually run into\na bit of an issue here.\n\n597\n00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:59.424\nThat's all I'm suggesting, just pointing\nout that in the real world it'll benefit\n\n598\n00:28:59.424 --> 00:29:00.904\nof those things that can go wrong.\n\n599\n00:29:00.904 --> 00:29:02.888\nAnd tell you how to prevent\nthem from going wrong,\n\n600\n00:29:02.888 --> 00:29:04.644\njust wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n601\n00:29:04.644 --> 00:29:08.180\nAll right, so we specify we're gonna check\noff here the required DNS clients to claim\n\n602\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.094\nor to check rather that\nthe name is validated,\n\n603\n00:29:10.094 --> 00:29:11.731\nthis is really the whole point of this.\n\n604\n00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:15.120\nSo we're gonna check this off and\nthen we're gonna go ahead.\n\n605\n00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.764\nI'm gonna go down and\nclick Create here in just one second.\n\n606\n00:29:17.764 --> 00:29:20.705\nDown here, you could see right down here,\nI'm gonna be able to click Create.\n\n607\n00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:23.479\nBut I just wanted to show you a couple\nof these things quickly before we get\n\n608\n00:29:23.479 --> 00:29:24.260\nout of here.\n\n609\n00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.930\nSo DNS settings for direct access,\nwe haven't talked about direct access yet.\n\n610\n00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.677\nThat's kind of an upcoming conversation\nin some additional episodes,\n\n611\n00:29:30.677 --> 00:29:31.810\nyou can always take a look at.\n\n612\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.508\nBut it's one of our remote\naccess technologies, so\n\n613\n00:29:34.508 --> 00:29:37.230\nwhen you look at the remote access VPN.\n\n614\n00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.621\nDiscussions and\nepisodes on those kinds of technologies,\n\n615\n00:29:39.621 --> 00:29:41.020\nyou'd be able to reference them.\n\n616\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.128\nWe have new information on DNS servers,\nand you'll notice down here,\n\n617\n00:29:45.128 --> 00:29:47.190\nscroll down before I click Create.\n\n618\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.310\nThat I would then see the name policy or\nname resolution policy table.\n\n619\n00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.514\nOnce I create it,\nI'll see a listing of rules that are here.\n\n620\n00:29:54.514 --> 00:29:57.290\nSo let's just click Create,\nyou'll notice my rule drops down.\n\n621\n00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.860\nIt is available there, and\nI've got that setup, pardon me.\n\n622\n00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.910\nAnd I can see that my rule is down here.\n\n623\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:09.070\nNow, once I've created,\nit kind of a two step process.\n\n624\n00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.386\nCreated the rule, but\nwe're not out of the wizard here yet.\n\n625\n00:30:11.386 --> 00:30:12.309\nWe're not out of the screen.\n\n626\n00:30:12.309 --> 00:30:17.239\nAll right, what we have to do,\ngot this other button down here.\n\n627\n00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:18.780\nGotta click Apply.\n\n628\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.344\nSo we have the rule there,\ngotta click Apply now to make sure\n\n629\n00:30:23.344 --> 00:30:27.099\nthat our rule is ultimately\ngoing to be applied.\n\n630\n00:30:27.099 --> 00:30:31.670\nSo we gotta click Apply, make sure my\nrule gets applied, so we do all that.\n\n631\n00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.063\nSo now that I've got that,\n\n632\n00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:36.711\nnow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ncome out of the Group Policy Editor.\n\n633\n00:30:36.711 --> 00:30:39.573\nIf you know anything about GPM Editing or\nGroup Policy Editing,\n\n634\n00:30:39.573 --> 00:30:41.310\nyou finish what you're doing.\n\n635\n00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.393\nSo we're just gonna\nclose the editor there.\n\n636\n00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:50.410\nGonna close out of here,\njust minimize our dashboard here.\n\n637\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.451\nWell actually I didn't hold on one\nsecond a little PowerShell forgot to\n\n638\n00:30:57.451 --> 00:30:58.184\nminimize that one.\n\n639\n00:30:58.184 --> 00:31:00.695\nHave PowerShell open or do I?\n\n640\n00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:01.281\nNope, that's my command line.\n\n641\n00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:04.030\nYeah, let me get rid of that\nlet me just PowerShell.\n\n642\n00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.482\nForgot to do that, I meant to\nhave that open and I just forgot.\n\n643\n00:31:06.482 --> 00:31:08.974\nSo let me go to PowerShell\nhere just to open that up.\n\n644\n00:31:08.974 --> 00:31:12.210\nAnd let's make that a little bigger for\nyou see the way I normally do.\n\n645\n00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:16.770\nIt'd be easier for to see what we're\ntyping, just modify that real quick and\n\n646\n00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.696\nput a 18 point font on there, probably a\nlittle bit easier for you to see that now.\n\n647\n00:31:21.696 --> 00:31:25.510\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do\nis just do a quick GP update force.\n\n648\n00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.301\nWe're gonna go in, in other words,\nI'm just refresh our group policy.\n\n649\n00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:31.480\nSo let's go in and do that.\n\n650\n00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.850\nOkay, let's just update\nthe policy real quick.\n\n651\n00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.316\nWe're gonna issue the get DNS client\nNRPT policy cmdlet again to see if\n\n652\n00:31:44.316 --> 00:31:45.444\nthe policies apply.\n\n653\n00:31:45.444 --> 00:31:47.428\nRemember I did on the Windows 10 machine,\n\n654\n00:31:47.428 --> 00:31:50.926\nwe didn't see we should see a listing of\nthe policy if there is a policy there.\n\n655\n00:31:50.926 --> 00:31:53.613\nThat's why we're doing this just to\nshow you how you would create and\n\n656\n00:31:53.613 --> 00:31:54.457\nhow you would apply.\n\n657\n00:31:54.457 --> 00:32:02.169\nSo get DNS or DNS client,\nWhat is that the NRPT, right?\n\n658\n00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:08.591\nSo, NRPT policy, DNS client NRPT come on.\n\n659\n00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:10.010\nI already hit the Tab, so I gotta wait.\n\n660\n00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.190\nNope there we go, okay, there we go.\n\n661\n00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.390\nOkay, policy, all right, so\nhit that give that a second.\n\n662\n00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.666\nAnd boom, that's what we will see when\nwe actually have a policy created\n\n663\n00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:18.320\nand applied.\n\n664\n00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.592\nRemember on the Windows 10 client\nwe did that there was nothing.\n\n665\n00:32:20.592 --> 00:32:22.230\nSo, no policy there, right?\n\n666\n00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.520\nBut, now,\nwe've actually implemented a policy.\n\n667\n00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.070\nSo, now, this policy would control\nwhatever the policy is set to do.\n\n668\n00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.210\nThis one is saying, hey, make sure you use\nan authorized zone that's been signed.\n\n669\n00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.085\nSo, you force us to do that when we're\ngoing to secure practicelabs.com.\n\n670\n00:32:36.085 --> 00:32:40.995\nBut the idea is we're simply using a group\npolicy to be able to apply the NRPT\n\n671\n00:32:40.995 --> 00:32:41.625\ntemplate.\n\n672\n00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:43.575\nApply the rule and, now,\n\n673\n00:32:43.575 --> 00:32:46.280\nwe can see evidence in the fact that\nthe rule is active in the policy.\n\n674\n00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.319\nCuz I created it, I applied it, and, now,\nanybody who touches this policy, or is\n\n675\n00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:54.405\napplying this policy as part of a domain\nlogon will actually then be bound by it.\n\n676\n00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.894\nSo, this is how we bring NRPT and\n\n677\n00:32:56.894 --> 00:33:00.862\nthe DNSSEC together to be\nable to apply policies for\n\n678\n00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:07.420\nDNSSEC to clients based on the use of\nthe name resolution policy table policy.\n\n679\n00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.985\nAnd our PT policy policy,\nright?, that's how we do that.\n\n680\n00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:10.651\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n681\n00:33:10.651 --> 00:33:13.277\n&gt;&gt; I never actually saw that work through,\nI mean, although you said,\n\n682\n00:33:13.277 --> 00:33:16.692\nit's been out since 2012, and then here\nin 2016 we still have that as a feature.\n\n683\n00:33:16.692 --> 00:33:18.705\nSo, thank you for showing us, Adam.\n\n684\n00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:20.915\n&gt;&gt; So, let's do one more thing,\nlet's go to our Windows 10 client.\n\n685\n00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:23.335\nLet's kinda see this, now, remember,\nwe did it on the other side.\n\n686\n00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:25.715\nWe actually took a look at that,\nsaw it didn't work, right?, or\n\n687\n00:33:25.715 --> 00:33:26.815\ndidn't have the policy, whatever.\n\n688\n00:33:26.815 --> 00:33:29.451\nBut let's just quickly flip over to\nthe client, let's see the output of this.\n\n689\n00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:32.540\nWe'll do a quick refresh for\npolicy on the client the way we did here.\n\n690\n00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.255\nWe'll obviously see that\nwe do have the same thing.\n\n691\n00:33:34.255 --> 00:33:35.860\nIt'll show up there and we'll see that.\n\n692\n00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.987\nLet's make sure, cuz like you always say,\nlet's trust, but\n\n693\n00:33:38.987 --> 00:33:41.470\nlet's validate that it's\nactually happening.\n\n694\n00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.743\nSo, if you remember, this is what we\ndid on the client, we had nothing back.\n\n695\n00:33:44.743 --> 00:33:47.750\nSo, we could see at the time we did\nthis there was no policy, right?\n\n696\n00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.522\nSo, let's go ahead, let's see if\nwe can see what's going on now.\n\n697\n00:33:50.522 --> 00:33:55.400\nLet's do a GP update, and\nlet's do a force there.\n\n698\n00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.389\nWhoops, what did I do.\n\n699\n00:34:07.129 --> 00:34:09.560\nWould help if I did the following.\n\n700\n00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Is the force with you?\n\n701\n00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.660\n&gt;&gt; Apparently not,\nhold on one second, gpupdate.\n\n702\n00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.181\nThought I spelled that correctly,\nright, /force, that should work.\n\n703\n00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:21.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like it.\n\n704\n00:34:23.256 --> 00:34:25.177\n&gt;&gt; There we go, yeah I don't know,\nmaybe there was a space, or\n\n705\n00:34:25.177 --> 00:34:26.810\nsomething where I don't\nknow why it just did that.\n\n706\n00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.675\nBut, I think,\nI typed the same exact command.\n\n707\n00:34:28.675 --> 00:34:31.330\nWhy, no, GP, I left out the p, that's why.\n\n708\n00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.380\nI did gpuudate, not gpupdate like you see-\n&gt;&gt; I see, yeah-\n\n709\n00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.440\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I left the p out.\n\n710\n00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.528\nRemember, you can not trust me\nto type no matter what you do.\n\n711\n00:34:37.528 --> 00:34:39.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't let me near a keyboard-\n\n712\n00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:40.785\n&gt;&gt; And here I am like over here squinting,\n\n713\n00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:42.117\nand leaning trying to check your syntax.\n\n714\n00:34:42.117 --> 00:34:44.896\n&gt;&gt; Don't let me near a keyboard,\nyou know, that is yeah, just I,\n\n715\n00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:45.933\nyou know I cannot type.\n\n716\n00:34:45.933 --> 00:34:48.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so get DNS client policy.\n\n717\n00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:51.338\nWe'll try this again, right?,\nand boom, you see it's there.\n\n718\n00:34:51.338 --> 00:34:54.565\nSo, you can see that the policy gets\napplied to whatever is in the domain.\n\n719\n00:34:54.565 --> 00:34:57.670\nWhenever clients are gonna logon,\nwe can actually see that.\n\n720\n00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.470\nAnd we're now able to do the following.\n\n721\n00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.880\nLet's take a look and see what we get, cuz\nthis is gonna help us to understand this.\n\n722\n00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.831\nGive me just a second,\nlet me move this over here.\n\n723\n00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:09.580\nLet me just make a little room here, so\nyou can see what we're gonna do, right?\n\n724\n00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.475\nSo, we know, DNS,\nset validation required true, we know,\n\n725\n00:35:12.475 --> 00:35:15.107\nthat's what we're doing with the policy,\nall right.\n\n726\n00:35:15.107 --> 00:35:18.015\nSo, now,\nlet's do the following one more time.\n\n727\n00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:20.915\nI think, I have my resolve,\nyeah, I got that there.\n\n728\n00:35:20.915 --> 00:35:25.885\nResolve-DnsName, secure practicelabs.com,\nserver plabdm1 DNS sec, okay?\n\n729\n00:35:26.995 --> 00:35:33.110\nAll right, right, so we are,\nremember, able, there we go, right?\n\n730\n00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.990\nWe're able to, and you see by\nthe way the TTL went down, right?\n\n731\n00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.130\nRemember, I told you it would just\nkeep incrementing down eventually.\n\n732\n00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.640\nJust keep ticking down towards the bottom,\nright?\n\n733\n00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.749\nSo, you can see that we're\nable to do this, right?\n\n734\n00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:47.111\nWe're able to go in, we're able to get our\ninformation even with the policy applied,\n\n735\n00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:49.460\nbecause we're using a secure, signed zone.\n\n736\n00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.092\nWe're meeting the requirements\nof the policy, right?\n\n737\n00:35:51.092 --> 00:35:55.990\nWe're getting back the information, secure\npracticelabs.com is where we're going.\n\n738\n00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:02.956\nBut if I want to go ahead, and I want to\nbe able to, maybe get another record.\n\n739\n00:36:02.956 --> 00:36:04.650\nMaybe let's get something\nelse out of that zone.\n\n740\n00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.141\nAre we going to be able to\nmeet the same requirements?\n\n741\n00:36:06.141 --> 00:36:07.530\nOr are we going to be able to do that?\n\n742\n00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.920\nThat's something else we can look at.\n\n743\n00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.250\nSo, let's do that really quickly,\njust modify the statement here.\n\n744\n00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.212\nInstead of, what did we do, we did that,\n\n745\n00:36:15.212 --> 00:36:19.370\nlet's do a record type specifically,\nlet's do our soa.\n\n746\n00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.216\nSo, let me just go back here really quick,\nlet's modify that,\n\n747\n00:36:23.216 --> 00:36:26.147\nResolve-DnsName secure practicelabs.com.\n\n748\n00:36:26.147 --> 00:36:33.617\nAnd let's do type right here, so\nlet's do type and let's do soa.\n\n749\n00:36:33.617 --> 00:36:38.046\nAnd then we'll do server,\n[SOUND], okay, so let's do that.\n\n750\n00:36:38.046 --> 00:36:42.363\nAnd you'll see we're able to get, let's\njust take a look at what we get here.\n\n751\n00:36:42.363 --> 00:36:45.137\n[SOUND] Go back up,\ngot a lot of stuff actually.\n\n752\n00:36:45.137 --> 00:36:49.130\nYou'll see that we're able to get\nour soa record this time, right?\n\n753\n00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:53.010\nAnd we get all that information,\nwe're able to see the RR sig,\n\n754\n00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.939\nthe resource record.\n\n755\n00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.923\nSig set, we're able to see all\nthe associated information.\n\n756\n00:36:59.923 --> 00:37:03.500\nThose are some of those crazy looking\nrecords in there with those strings at\n\n757\n00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.500\nthe beginning of them that I pointed out.\n\n758\n00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.300\nWhen we setup the zone and\nwe had all those files down at the bottom,\n\n759\n00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.860\nall those resource records and all those\nlong strings, so we're able to see those.\n\n760\n00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.920\nSo, you could see we're able\nto successfully query for\n\n761\n00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.340\ndifferent records as long as we're\nfollowing the policy, right?\n\n762\n00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.270\nAs long as we're going in in querying\nthe zone, that is signed, or\n\n763\n00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.220\nwe're using the policy applying it and\nwe're then able to communicate.\n\n764\n00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.819\nSo, this is what NRPT, what policy does,\nthis is what DNS sec is given,\n\n765\n00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:30.359\nand is giving us the ability to see\nit's actually working in real time.\n\n766\n00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:31.998\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, all right.\n\n767\n00:37:31.998 --> 00:37:33.970\nSo, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n768\n00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:34.870\nWe've checked our work.\n\n769\n00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:35.730\nWe're good to go.\n\n770\n00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.230\nSo, thank you for tuning in with us, but\n\n771\n00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.720\nstay tuned there's more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n772\n00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.070\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n773\n00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.270\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boost.\n\n774\n00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n775\n00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.261\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, bye.\n\n776\n00:37:45.261 -->

00:00:08.296\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.837\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:16.190\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.750\nSo we been talking about DNS for\n\n8\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.810\na while we've covered a lot of different\ntopics I think there's one tiny little\n\n9\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.640\nNano topic that we have left to cover and\nwith us today back in studios we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.450\nAdam Gordon how are you doing Adam\n&gt;&gt; I am good hopefully, you are as well\n\n11\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.470\nI'm gonna play off the a little joke\nthing got, whatever you call that.\n\n12\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.070\nThat thing that Cherokee just said.\n\n13\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.000\n&gt;&gt; I try, l try.\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna do it differently.\n\n14\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.374\nI'm gonna say that this is gonna be a nano\nlike episode because it's gonna be so\n\n15\n00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:47.380\nshort and small.\n\n16\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, l like it.\n&gt;&gt; Ooh yes, so there we go.\n\n17\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.390\n&gt;&gt; So what are we gonna be talking about?\n\n18\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.100\n&gt;&gt; And we're done, we're finished.\n\n19\n00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.000\n&gt;&gt; Goodbye.\n&gt;&gt; DNS on nano, nothing else to say.\n\n20\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.081\nWe're actually gonna talk about how to set\nup a really cool way to deal with DNS, we\n\n21\n00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.401\ntalk this with Cherokee and saying perhaps\nit's been a lot of different new features,\n\n22\n00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.962\nold features,\ncombination of things around DNS.\n\n23\n00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:09.427\nA lot of stuff we could have done before,\nsome new stuff that we haven't been able\n\n24\n00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:13.970\nto do, things like the NRPT policy and\nDNS Sec Integration in some prior episode.\n\n25\n00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.660\nBut also it's a cool stuff, right?\n\n26\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.780\nAnd thought it would be great to\nround out our conversations on DNS\n\n27\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.470\nwith the nano server.\n\n28\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.570\nSo a new feature for Windows in\nthe last version or so of Windows.\n\n29\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.020\nBeen able to get this new\nthought process up and running.\n\n30\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.220\nWe now can play with it.\n\n31\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.310\nWe can integrate DNS as\na role into the nano server.\n\n32\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.190\nThought we'd just spend a couple minutes\nliterally just walking through the steps\n\n33\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.780\non how to do this.\n\n34\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.070\nSo if you join me here,\n\n35\n00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.020\nwhat you will see is that we do\nhave a little guidance out here.\n\n36\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.270\nNow I just wanna warn you about this one.\n\n37\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.240\nWe normally tell you, hey,\ngo out there, take a look.\n\n38\n00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960\nIt's gonna give you the information\nyou need and it will.\n\n39\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.080\nOne thing that we just wanna\nmake sure we talk about.\n\n40\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.220\nI'm just gonna move my cup\nhere while we're talking,\n\n41\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.180\nget that straw out of my way now\nyour straw is sitting right there.\n\n42\n00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.290\nWe have got like straws everywhere.\n\n43\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.250\nAll right, so I am just gonna actually\ntake mine and throw it right.\n\n44\n00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.540\nLook at, woo, I can do it from right here.\n\n45\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.390\nLook at that that is so cool.\n\n46\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.771\nIt is like a disembodied head.\n\n47\n00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:03.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Where did you go?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n48\n00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.985\nI am small because it is nano\nit is like I am shrunken down.\n\n49\n00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:06.485\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:07.375\n&gt;&gt; And that's what it is.\n\n51\n00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.255\nAll right, so,\nhow we deploy Windows DNS Server.\n\n52\n00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:10.885\nNow, just a word about this web page.\n\n53\n00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:12.015\nWant you to go take a look.\n\n54\n00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:13.245\nEncourage you to do this, we always do.\n\n55\n00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:16.885\nBut, having said that, you will find\nsome information in here that may\n\n56\n00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:19.035\nthrow you off, and\nI don't want you to be concerned about it.\n\n57\n00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:21.155\nIt talks about the fact,\nand can we go full screen?\n\n58\n00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:23.235\nI'll point out what we're taking about,\njust so you could see it.\n\n59\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.830\n&gt;&gt; Talks about the fact that Server 16\ntechnical preview offers this capability.\n\n60\n00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.810\nMeaning this post was written before\nWindows Server 2016 was final,\n\n61\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990\nfinal, final and released.\n\n62\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.230\nThat doesn't mean.\n\n63\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.700\nThat the Nano Server support and or\nthat the steps involved to change.\n\n64\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.010\nIt simply means that this post that we're\nreferring you has not been updated to\n\n65\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.110\nreflect the fact that it actually is\nworking that way in the final release.\n\n66\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.525\nSo definitely wanna go take a look.\n\n67\n00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:52.545\nWe're gonna go through the steps,\nI'm gonna summarize them for you.\n\n68\n00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:53.535\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n69\n00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:56.795\nBut I don't want you to think that this\ninformation won't be valid when you go and\n\n70\n00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:58.065\ntake a look and think to yourself.\n\n71\n00:02:58.065 --> 00:02:59.165\nHey, why are they telling us to go and\n\n72\n00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:01.730\nlook at information about\nwhat it would have been like?\n\n73\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.010\nHad we done the full version and then\nnever updated it, the steps are the same,\n\n74\n00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.830\nthere is no difference.\n\n75\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.090\nSo just so you know that, and you can see\nthe source where this is coming from.\n\n76\n00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.420\nIt is coming from out of the technical\nlibrary and the documentation.\n\n77\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.430\nThis is gonna give you the overview\nof the steps involved.\n\n78\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.860\nWe're gonna go through this.\n\n79\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.340\nI want to talk about how this works.\n\n80\n00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.940\nBut, your Nano Server,\n\n81\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.390\njust to give you a little positioning\nof what Nano Server may be good for.\n\n82\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.790\nWe got some scenarios that they list here.\n\n83\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.990\nA computer host for Hyper-V machines.\n\n84\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.010\nWhether they are clustered or\nnot, irrelevant.\n\n85\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.580\nSo, a small instance that is running.\n\n86\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.480\nThat could then provide services.\n\n87\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.796\nSo that's gonna be cool.\n\n88\n00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.358\nWe have stored scale out so\n\n89\n00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:44.405\nscale out file servers you could run\nthose on nano as well we'll talk\n\n90\n00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:49.210\nabout some of those with things like\nDFS in upcoming episodes branch cache.\n\n91\n00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.610\nSome of that kind of stuff.\n\n92\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.510\nAs a DNS server we're gonna be focussing\nin right there on that particular\n\n93\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.450\nscenario.\n\n94\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.640\nAs a web server this is one of the things\nthat it's being positioned to do,\n\n95\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.267\nis that nano can run a web server\ninstance out there for us and.\n\n96\n00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:07.350\nProvide web services so also obviously\nuseful for cloud applications and\n\n97\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.990\nhosting cloud apps on as we're\nsetting that up just be aware of that.\n\n98\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.350\nWindows Server 16 is the requirement here\nnot the technical preview ISO now the full\n\n99\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.090\ndeployed versions just be aware of\nthat notice we could also run this\n\n100\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.900\non Server 12 are two right,\nif we want to using\n\n101\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.430\nall this is a Hyper-V host keep this in\nmind we run these as virtual machines.\n\n102\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.900\nWe create the VHD for\nthe Nano Server as you can see there.\n\n103\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.230\nAnd then we actually go ahead and\nwe host this.\n\n104\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.310\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n105\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.240\nGood, questions, thoughts?\n\n106\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.150\nI don't know, I just wanna\nmake sure you're with me here.\n\n107\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you.\n\n108\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.110\n&gt;&gt; I know you are.\nYou're always with me, Cherokee.\n\n109\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.500\nthat's why I love having the time to host\nwith you, because you're paying attention.\n\n110\n00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.690\nYou're keeping me honest,\n\n111\n00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.840\nthrowing in those great comments\nthat you always have about things.\n\n112\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.285\nLet me ask you a quick\nquestion about something.\n\n113\n00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So I know you may not have actually\n\n114\n00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.580\nplayed with nano before.\n\n115\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.087\nThis is relatively new.\n\n116\n00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:55.181\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I know you've done a lot of work with\n\n117\n00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:58.240\ncertainly non traditional Windows\nversions or things like you and\n\n118\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.385\nas you mention you're,\nyou are familiar with buying the things.\n\n119\n00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:04.421\nThings like that but you may not\nnecessarily have seen this before.\n\n120\n00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.694\nBut what in your mind, if you were,\nlet's say, an IT professional today,\n\n121\n00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:11.072\nsitting out there, talking with us,\nlistening to us, thinking about nano,\n\n122\n00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:12.885\nwould you be excited about deploying it?\n\n123\n00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:14.287\nWould you be excited about using it?\n\n124\n00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:15.047\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n125\n00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:17.487\nAll I see is I see positivity.\n\n126\n00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:18.807\nI see dollar signs.\n\n127\n00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:23.267\nI see a healthier planet earth and\nthat's my vision.\n\n128\n00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:27.817\nAnd I could be out in left field here,\nleft field.\n\n129\n00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nBut how does all that relate to the fact\n\n130\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.005\nthat it's smaller\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.\n\n131\n00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.120\n&gt;&gt; The fact that it's got less of\na footprint, those kinds of thinks.\n\n132\n00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, less of a footprint,\nwe're talking about, so\n\n133\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.600\nwe saw this with Core coming into play.\n\n134\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we see\n\n135\n00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.930\nvirtualization which will reduce that\nfootprint even more because I can have\n\n136\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.900\nessentially less physical hardware.\n\n137\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.540\nI can have those virtual\nmachines running on it.\n\n138\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.150\nAnd I can have more\nvirtual machines running.\n\n139\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.280\nBecause every time I'm\nextracting that coding,\n\n140\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.300\nthat software I'm really slimming\ndown my operating system.\n\n141\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.610\nThen I can just add more to it.\n\n142\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.170\nSo that's obviously gonna be a cost and\n\n143\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.300\nbenefit there from\nthe business perspective.\n\n144\n00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.870\nI see increased security\nbecause I have less coding, so\n\n145\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.020\nless potential vulnerabilities there.\n\n146\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.780\nAnd then as far as the power consumption\nfrom those additional machines,\n\n147\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.190\nand that's my thought is if I don't\nneed all the bells, and whistles, and\n\n148\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.840\nall those additional features.\n\n149\n00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.900\nThen I can have a more efficient\nproduction environment\n\n150\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.050\nby using a really slimmed-down\nversion like Nano.\n\n151\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.010\n&gt;&gt; And these are all great points.\n\n152\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.300\nAnd that's a lot of the reasons why\nwe're gonna see this probably I'm\n\n153\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.210\nguessing and all.\n\n154\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.274\nPlay the future is stir play off for\nyou for a minute.\n\n155\n00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:32.720\nI'm gonna anticipate and I'm gonna project\nthat we're gonna start seeing a lot more\n\n156\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.730\ndeployment to this in server forms and\ncloud environments like you were\n\n157\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.840\nsuggesting for instance where we're gonna\nbe able to run this instance as a full.\n\n158\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.990\nSupport instance in the OS sense,\nfor key network services,\n\n159\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.780\nwe've stressed the importance of DNS for\ninstance, and why it's so critical.\n\n160\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.119\nWeb hosting, we there's a tremendous\namount of web hosting that goes on in\n\n161\n00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:55.254\nthe Cloud, and we know that certainly\nthis provides an option for us.\n\n162\n00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:58.266\nSo to be able to virtualize that\nexperience, provide these resources, and\n\n163\n00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:01.511\nthen as a result to be able to do all the\nother things that Cherokee was describing,\n\n164\n00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:03.909\nit's gonna be I think a good play for\nMicrosoft in this here,\n\n165\n00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.300\nI think it's gonna work out well.\n\n166\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.500\nSo let's, instead of just\nwalking through on the page,\n\n167\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.355\nit's a little hard to see It's small,\nthe type may not be easy to read.\n\n168\n00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:13.075\nThe commands are hard to keep track of.\n\n169\n00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:14.785\nI've just summarized all of this for\nyou in my notes.\n\n170\n00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:16.215\nI'm going to step through\nit in my notes in a minute.\n\n171\n00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:19.115\nBut I just wanted you to see\nwhere this is coming from.\n\n172\n00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:21.022\nWanted you to see that you can go out and\ntake a look.\n\n173\n00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:23.812\nif you need some information and\nrefer back to it but\n\n174\n00:07:23.812 --> 00:07:25.012\nwe're gonna put this up right here.\n\n175\n00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:28.472\nMake it a little bit easier for you to\nsee, we can go full screen some covering\n\n176\n00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:30.592\nI think a portion of\nthe really important stuff.\n\n177\n00:07:30.592 --> 00:07:32.802\nSo let's just take a look at what we're\ngoing to do here we already talked about\n\n178\n00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:34.222\nwhat a nano server is.\n\n179\n00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:39.280\nOnce you know where to find the ISO for\nthis for Server 16 now.\n\n180\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.990\nIt's in or set up in, as you could\nsee here, on the installation DVD, or\n\n181\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.740\nISO file,\nin the directory called Nano Server.\n\n182\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.870\nSo in the NanoServer folder.\n\n183\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.440\nYou're gonna be able to go,\nfind the image that we need.\n\n184\n00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.130\nStart working with this, so\nit's already contained there for\n\n185\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.940\nyou when you get Windows Server 16.\n\n186\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.040\nEasy to work with.\n\n187\n00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.490\nYou'll have a .wim image in a subfolder\nthat's referred to as packages.\n\n188\n00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.570\nIf you're familiar with doing imaging or\nwith deployments, if you use for\n\n189\n00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.820\ninstance Systems Center\nConfig Manager SSCM and\n\n190\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.680\nuse the OSD the operating system\ndeployment feature set there.\n\n191\n00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.900\nYou're probably familiar with win images,\n\n192\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.350\nif you do WDS Windows Deployment Services\nand you're familiar with WinPE and\n\n193\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.930\nthe process of creating images, you're\nprobably familiar with the .win extension.\n\n194\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.400\nThis is just the pre-compiled image of the\noperating system binders are gonna use and\n\n195\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.650\nmount that's our imaging extension for\nWindows and that's what we refer to as.\n\n196\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.600\nSo Just so you know, we use the package\nfiles to add server roles or\n\n197\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.850\nfeatures to the VHD image, and\nso the package directory, or\n\n198\n00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.370\npackage folder, is gonna be like in Linux,\nwhere you're unpacking the modules and\n\n199\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.760\nyou're creating different TPMs for\npackages you're then gonna use.\n\n200\n00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.070\nThis is what they are.\n\n201\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.820\nAnd so we see that structure looks\nkind of similar, kind of very,\n\n202\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.710\nvery almost aligned thought process\naround what Linux has been for\n\n203\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.480\ngenerations, and we see that migration and\nkind of that movement\n\n204\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.230\ninto that thought process on the Windows\nside more and more around some things.\n\n205\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.250\nYou've mentioned that for\nsome of our other conversations and areas.\n\n206\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.950\nNow I've touched on it as well here and\nthere, so we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n207\n00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.420\nWe set up, and of course I do this with.\n\n208\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.980\nAs we talked about with some of the other\nthings, our good friend PowerShell, right.\n\n209\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.660\nSo, we use the package\nmanagement PowerShell module\n\n210\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.370\nto be able to manipulate set up\nthe install and configure it.\n\n211\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.370\nSo you're gonna have to learn and\nbe comfortable with a little more about\n\n212\n00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.520\nPowerShell to work with Nano, but\nshould be no surprise to you we've been\n\n213\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.780\ntalking about the importance of PowerShell\nand why we should be thinking about it.\n\n214\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.860\nThe Nano Server Image Generator script is\ngoing to be part of what we do here so\n\n215\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.670\nwe're gonna import the Nano Server,\nPowerShell module.\n\n216\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.500\nYou could see right there,\n\n217\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.550\nwe're gonna bring that in that's gonna\ngive us the ability to work with\n\n218\n00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.430\nall of this, and use the commandlets\nthat are gonna be supported.\n\n219\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.050\nSo we'll be able to go do that.\n\n220\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.270\nThen, once we've done that, and\n\n221\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.920\nall these instructions are out\non the website, as well.\n\n222\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.450\nIt's just that it may be a little\nbit easier for you to follow here.\n\n223\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.790\nEverything has been vetted to make sure\nit's aligned with what we're now doing\n\n224\n00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.450\nin Server 16.\n\n225\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.190\nIn case there might be a little.\n\n226\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.740\nHere and there and\n\n227\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.310\nconsistency with the your version on the\nweb with regards to hey, it was a typical\n\n228\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.860\npreview maybe the directory structure\nwas different something like that.\n\n229\n00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.450\nSo, this information will align you\nwith where you wanna be right now,\n\n230\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.860\nwe create the HD, and we set up specify\nwhat we're gonna need for that.\n\n231\n00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.030\nSo you'll see here,\nwe do need an administrator password,\n\n232\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.140\nwe're gonna prompt for that.\n\n233\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.460\nSo NewNanoServerImage, media path.\n\n234\n00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.492\nRemember, and I've talked about this in\nother areas when we show you our notes or\n\n235\n00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:26.600\nPowerShell scripts.\n\n236\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.270\nWe put stuff like that in there.\n\n237\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.470\nThat does not mean,\ntype in path to route to media.\n\n238\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.540\nWhat that means is that's a placeholder-\n&gt;&gt; To put your path.\n\n239\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.680\n&gt;&gt; To whatever it's gonna be,\nits address, so just adjust the script\n\n240\n00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.509\nis all I'm suggesting to you,\nBasepath, .\\Base, TargetPath, and\n\n241\n00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:48.900\n.\\NanoServerVM, NanoServerVM.vhd,\nagain you're gonna specify\n\n242\n00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.280\nwhat the name is gonna be right computer\nname obviously specify the computer name.\n\n243\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.790\nAnd then whatever drivers you need, the\npackages, the Nano Server DNS package in\n\n244\n00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.460\nthis case because, we're talking about\nhow do we do this for DNS, right?\n\n245\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.730\nSo specifically, we're looking\nat how to deploy this for DNS.\n\n246\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.535\nIf we wanted to do this for the web server\none of those other scenarios there yeah\n\n247\n00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:11.573\nthere maybe some slight adjustments here\nthe name of the package would be different\n\n248\n00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:15.171\nwe need IIS instead of DNS in order to\ndeploy the web server package for us.\n\n249\n00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:19.726\nWe have things like that so just wanna\nmake sure you adjust accordingly once we\n\n250\n00:11:19.726 --> 00:11:24.069\nget the install done we import the VHD\ninto our Hyper-V host we set it up and\n\n251\n00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:26.129\nrun it as a guest OS or as a guest VM.\n\n252\n00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:31.430\nWe then go ahead, we sign in, now keep in\nmind just like Courtney Metrocorn I like.\n\n253\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.170\nThe though process around core because\nit's the same environment here essentially\n\n254\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.590\neven more stripped down, even less likely\nfor us to be able to do certain things.\n\n255\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.220\nYou in core you log in you essentially,\nhave a shell that's really what you get.\n\n256\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.350\nNano, as you could see there,\nwe're gonna have the same thing.\n\n257\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.100\nYou log in,\n\n258\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.710\nwe perform one of the most fundamental\nmanagement tasks interactively on Nano.\n\n259\n00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.600\nWe really can't even do\nanything logged in locally.\n\n260\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.340\nEverything's going to be done remotely,\nremoting in.\n\n261\n00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.480\nNow with Core, we do have the option to\ninstall a gooey and essentially add in\n\n262\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.820\nthe server manager to configure and\ndo things and remove it back out again.\n\n263\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.980\nWe don't even do that with Nano.\n\n264\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.860\nNano is Raspberry Pi on Microsoft, right,\n\n265\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.280\nit's a very stripped\ndown version of the OS.\n\n266\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.390\nSo we sign in,\nwe have the Nano Server recovery console.\n\n267\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.940\nAnd by the way, don't let that name fool\nyou, that doesn't mean you broke it or\n\n268\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.310\nsomething went wrong, that's just\nwhat we call the console that you see\n\n269\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.710\nthat as you could see there,\nit gives us some basic information.\n\n270\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.700\nThe computer name, if we are affiliated\nwith a work group or domain,\n\n271\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.360\nwhatever we do, the OS that is installed,\nso the versioning you know this\n\n272\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.940\nis Windows Server 2016 build five or\nwhatever, date, time all localized, and\n\n273\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.480\nthe network configuration that is\nwhat we see there, just so you know,\n\n274\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.759\nonce we have set up the network settings\nwhich we can do if we need to there.\n\n275\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.836\nEnable remote management for our\ninbound communication for the firewall,\n\n276\n00:12:44.836 --> 00:12:49.164\nwe're then gonna be managing remotely,\ntraditionally using Windows PowerShell and\n\n277\n00:12:49.164 --> 00:12:52.838\nroll one of the other management tool so\nwe could use remotely the rights to\n\n278\n00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.587\nbe able to connect server manager for\ninstance right.\n\n279\n00:12:55.587 --> 00:12:59.153\nSomething like that so if you wanna use\nPowerShell,so I just thought hey, yeah,\n\n280\n00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.083\nyou're doing this,\n\n281\n00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:02.940\nyou might as well figure out how\nto connect PowerShell remotely.\n\n282\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.200\nWe're talking about PowerShell\nremoting sometimes.\n\n283\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.380\nYou may or may not be familiar with it.\n\n284\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.860\nSo put a little bit of information in\nhere, help you to figure that out.\n\n285\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.755\nWe set PowerShell up to connect remotely\nin but in order to do that, we have to,\n\n286\n00:13:13.755 --> 00:13:15.575\non the machine we want\nto run PowerShell from.\n\n287\n00:13:15.575 --> 00:13:18.875\nMeaning this would be\nour admin workstation,\n\n288\n00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:22.605\nthis is the host that we're going to\nbe connecting from, we have to specify\n\n289\n00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:26.760\nthat we're going to allow a connection\nout to all the nano server and\n\n290\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.408\nadd to what's called\nthe trusted host link.\n\n291\n00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:32.140\nMeaning in PowerShell locally on your\nmachine we don't know why remoting\n\n292\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.460\nnormally from power sharing unless you\ngo out of your way to configure it.\n\n293\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.080\nIt's a security thing cuz we don't want\npeople connecting into you, remoting and\n\n294\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.100\nrunning scripts on your machine we\nblock that capability because it's\n\n295\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.020\na bad idea to do that, traditionally.\n\n296\n00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.290\nSo we have what's called the trusted host\nlist, so we can add a machine in assuming\n\n297\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.680\nthe nanoserver's ip address is, you know,\nwhatever, you could see it there.\n\n298\n00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.160\nWe'd set that up, specify the name,\nor rather the IP address.\n\n299\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.350\nAnd then we go ahead and\nwe make the remote PowerShell connection.\n\n300\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.030\nSo we specify here I\njust declared a variable,\n\n301\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.380\nset IP equal to the IP of the Nano Server.\n\n302\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.830\nSet user equal to, you know,\nwhatever the user is.\n\n303\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.030\nIn this case, the value of that machine.\n\n304\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.910\nThe IP and\nthe administrator locally on that machine,\n\n305\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.180\nthat's what this statement\ndoes right here.\n\n306\n00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.650\nAnd then enter PSSession,\n\n307\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.000\nthat's the standard command that\nwe use to set up a session.\n\n308\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.180\nSpecify computer name and credential.\n\n309\n00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.050\nAnd we'll provide that.\n\n310\n00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.610\nNow you will be prompted for\nthe password, right?\n\n311\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.780\nSo you'll log in, you'll get that, and\nthen to install the DNS Role, remember,\n\n312\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.480\nall we did was install the package\non the nano server with the other\n\n313\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.580\ncommand further up as we were\ncompiling the image to setup the VHD.\n\n314\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.000\nWe did not configure the DNS Server Role\nby installing it in Windows.\n\n315\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.380\nWe provided the package files that\nwill make it available to us, right?\n\n316\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.510\nI just wanna be\ndistinguishing about that and\n\n317\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.558\nmake sure you're clear that\nit's a two step process.\n\n318\n00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.690\nConfigure the VHD,\nprovide the binary files,\n\n319\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:58.020\nthe package files,\nthen actually use PowerShell here or\n\n320\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.790\nwhatever remote tool you're gonna use to\nconnect and install the configured DNS.\n\n321\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.840\nYou could hopefully by now understand\nthe logic of the PowerShell\n\n322\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.970\ncommand you're looking at.\n\n323\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.280\nEnables Windows feature.\n\n324\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.410\nLike feature name DNS Server for all.\n\n325\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.570\nAfter we set that up.\n\n326\n00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.740\nYou just go ahead and use your normal\nWindows PowerShell command lets.\n\n327\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.004\nWe've shown you what those are Server 16.\n\n328\n00:15:17.004 --> 00:15:19.250\nAnd you can go ahead and\nmanage the DNS Server.\n\n329\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.650\nOn the inner server the way\nit would manage and\n\n330\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.250\ninteract with it all\nthe other thought processes.\n\n331\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.250\nAll the other episodes\neverything we talked about.\n\n332\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.140\nEverything we've done and\nshown you up until now you can do the same\n\n333\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.020\nthing with the Powershell command\nwhich we set up on there.\n\n334\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.530\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool you have that\nall those additional of the same\n\n335\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.400\nfeature with are really slim down version\nso it's kind of like we are getting more\n\n336\n00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.800\n&gt;&gt; More for less here, or\n\n337\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.000\nthe same for less, I guess.\n\n338\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.570\n&gt;&gt; It's like a BOGO, it's like\nbuy one DNS server at full price,\n\n339\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.360\nget a nano one free of charge.\n\n340\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.060\nThere you go.\n\n341\n00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, it sounds great.\n\n342\n00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.670\nThank you for introducing us to this\nnew and exciting technology, Adam.\n\n343\n00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.180\nAnd thank you for joining us, as well.\n\n344\n00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.490\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n345\n00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.500\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n346\n00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.420\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.168\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:12.167\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:15.793\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:18.085\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:22.084\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nat implementing and managing IPAM.\n\n8\n00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.889\nBack in studios with us today we have,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:25.709\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:28.169\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good, I'm doing good,\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n11\n00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.793\nIPAM, IP Address Management\nas in what IPAM stands for.\n\n12\n00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.130\nIPAM is a great technology,\nit's been around for a while.\n\n13\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.584\nIt actually it not new to Server 2016,\nbut it is interesting.\n\n14\n00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:42.501\nIf you've ever seen our MCSE private\ncloud shows then you will remember this.\n\n15\n00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.270\nBecause you and\nI young lady actually did this together.\n\n16\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.247\nBut if you've seen our MCSE\nprivate cloud shows we,\n\n17\n00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.251\non one point in there where we're\ndealing with the 7247 content.\n\n18\n00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.268\nThe private cloud kinda part two focused\non System Center Virtual Machine Manager\n\n19\n00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:57.330\nin particular.\n\n20\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.360\nWe actually walked through and\n\n21\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.932\ndid an integration of IPAM with SCVMM and\nshowed you how to do that.\n\n22\n00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:05.740\nSo your IPAM is useful in a lot\nof different areas that provides\n\n23\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.850\noverall IP address across\nour Enterprise network,\n\n24\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.600\ngives us a console interface\nto be able to do that with.\n\n25\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.830\nOne of the big challenges\nwe have as IT professionals\n\n26\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.860\nis we have a lot of systems that are gonna\nbe providing address information.\n\n27\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.293\nEither aggregating it up,\nDHCP is a good example of that.\n\n28\n00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:25.810\nWe spent prior episodes talking\nabout DHCP and how that works.\n\n29\n00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.626\nDNS another great example of that,\n\n30\n00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:31.209\nwe spent a lot of time explaining\nhow DNS works and Server 16 to date.\n\n31\n00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.383\nAnd I encourage you to go back and\ntake a look at these episodes,\n\n32\n00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:34.334\nif you haven't seen them.\n\n33\n00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:38.060\nBut we got at least two major networking\nplatform systems that do that,\n\n34\n00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.120\nnot to mention the fact we\nconnect those two together.\n\n35\n00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.550\nThey often share information,\n\n36\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.970\nwe made through a wizard to the next\nto provide additional information.\n\n37\n00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.740\nWith regards to name resolution,\nour address management from the host\n\n38\n00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.040\nperspective in terms of\nNetBIOS friendly names.\n\n39\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.480\nAnd then we may have other\nconfiguration management platforms.\n\n40\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.120\nSystem Center Config Manager for\n\n41\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.680\ninstance, SCCM, SCCM DB,\nConfiguration Management Database product.\n\n42\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.240\nThings like HP OpenView, Tivoli, the Orion\nproduct from Solo Winds, whatever you use.\n\n43\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.729\nThere's all these different platforms\nout there any, and all of them are gonna\n\n44\n00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.347\nprovide the opportunity to do\naspects of network integration,\n\n45\n00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:19.020\nnetwork interrogation,\ndiscovery, finding resources.\n\n46\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.430\nBut it's hard to be able to go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.690\npull all this information\ntogether in one place.\n\n48\n00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.350\nAnd this is one of the things that\nIPAM does for us really well.\n\n49\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.895\nIt's gonna give us the ability to find\nout what's running, to go out and\n\n50\n00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:31.128\nquery, in other words.\n\n51\n00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:34.876\nAnd figure out what systems are available,\nwhat IP addresses are out there.\n\n52\n00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:39.521\nAnd then as a result, let us manage,\naudit, monitor, maintain, setup,\n\n53\n00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:44.765\ndiscover, you name it, all those things we\nwould do right around our address space.\n\n54\n00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.680\nBut not just on one machine, not just in\none subnet, not just in one domain, but\n\n55\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.084\nacross the entire address\nspace of our network.\n\n56\n00:02:51.084 --> 00:02:54.002\nThis is really the value\nof what IPAM provides.\n\n57\n00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:55.252\nPretty cool technology.\n\n58\n00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:57.619\nWe're gonna take a look at how to\nset it up, talk a bit about it,\n\n59\n00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.692\nhelp you to understand\na little bit more about it.\n\n60\n00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.461\nBut if you haven't used it before,\nand again it's been around for\n\n61\n00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:04.502\na little bit now,\nthis is not new to Server 16.\n\n62\n00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:08.676\nBut if you haven't investigated using it,\nit may actually be something that's gonna\n\n63\n00:03:08.676 --> 00:03:12.294\nprovide and add a lot of value to you,\nin terms of what you can do to scale up.\n\n64\n00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:14.931\nAnd really understand\nthe management of IP addressing and\n\n65\n00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:17.436\nthe address space across\nthe entire enterprise.\n\n66\n00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:19.709\nSharing with you just a real world\nthought process here for a minute.\n\n67\n00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.896\nYou, as an auditor going and\ndoing security work for customers.\n\n68\n00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:24.302\nSpending time in their networks,\n\n69\n00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:26.584\nhelping them to better\nunderstand their datacenters.\n\n70\n00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:30.329\nBuilding datacenters, doing all the stuff\nyou've heard that I do when I'm not here\n\n71\n00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.876\nhanging out with Cherokee\ntalking about stuff, right?\n\n72\n00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:34.885\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But when I do all that kind of stuff or\n\n73\n00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:37.830\nwhen any of you, cuz a lot of you,\nI'm sure do this kind of stuff.\n\n74\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.900\nThis is not a unique set of\nskills in the IT industry\n\n75\n00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.580\nthat we all are a part of today.\n\n76\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.480\nMany of you I'm sure are doing\nthose things in real time.\n\n77\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.001\nWhen you do those kinds of jobs, you\nknow how valuable not only information.\n\n78\n00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.628\nBut accurate information,\n\n79\n00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:56.043\nwell documented information is to\nthe success of these kinds of activities.\n\n80\n00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:59.187\nAnd as an auditor in particular,\nI love when I can talk to customers and\n\n81\n00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:01.335\nwhen I'm going to engage\nin these activities.\n\n82\n00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:04.015\nAnd say to them hey,\nwhere is the documentation, right?\n\n83\n00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:04.955\nWhat do you have?\n\n84\n00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:07.074\nShow me what we're doing,\nlet's go and verify and\n\n85\n00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:09.459\nvalidate that this is\nlegitimately what's happening.\n\n86\n00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.903\nIf you could show me an IPAM console,\nwe can go out and we look at.\n\n87\n00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.575\nAnd we'll walk through this\nprocess in our discussions and\n\n88\n00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:19.043\nour demonstrations of not\nonly how it's configured.\n\n89\n00:04:19.043 --> 00:04:21.610\nBut then ultimately the output of that,\nyou can see the address,\n\n90\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.252\nwe can understand and see what's there.\n\n91\n00:04:23.252 --> 00:04:26.882\nIf you could show me this kind of\ninformation, this is where I can look at\n\n92\n00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:30.708\nit as an auditor and say, hey,\nthis company they have their act together.\n\n93\n00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:34.990\nThey've got valid information,\nthey've got a system that is scaled.\n\n94\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.545\nThat's enterprise-wide,\nthat's gonna be able to be architected, so\n\n95\n00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:38.376\nthat it's resilient.\n\n96\n00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:41.459\nAnd it's gonna be accurate, and\nthis is the kind of stuff we wanna see.\n\n97\n00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.307\nThis is the kind of stuff that helps us to\nunderstand that you are gonna be able to\n\n98\n00:04:44.307 --> 00:04:47.126\nprovide the right kind of information,\nthat you're doing the right thing.\n\n99\n00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:50.418\nSo it's gonna be very important,\nvery valuable for us to think about this.\n\n100\n00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:55.600\nIPAM is made up for distant modules\nthat provide the following functionally.\n\n101\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400\nWe have IPAM discovery, that has\nthe ability to go out and to do discovery.\n\n102\n00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.816\nYou can imagine what that is gonna do,\nit's gonna leverage our ADDS, or\n\n103\n00:05:02.816 --> 00:05:05.459\nActive Directory Directory Service\ninfrastructure.\n\n104\n00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.369\nOne of the requirements for\nIPAM by the way,\n\n105\n00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:09.959\nthe machines that are gonna be\nhosting IPAM and running it.\n\n106\n00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.688\nThey have to be domain integrated,\nthey have to be members of the domain,\n\n107\n00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:13.709\nin order for us to install.\n\n108\n00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.210\nTake a look at the installation\nrequirements as we go.\n\n109\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.226\nBut we're gonna be running\nanything from Server 2008 and\n\n110\n00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:22.080\nnewer to be able to do this,\nso we're gonna set that up.\n\n111\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.460\nWe're gonna have the ability to then\nbe able to leverage that integration.\n\n112\n00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.633\nWe can add servers in and find servers\nmanually as part of the discovery, or\n\n113\n00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.630\nwe can query the Active Directory.\n\n114\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.011\nWe often will do both, and we'll be able\nto then get a list of the Active Directory\n\n115\n00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:36.574\nsystems that are registered in ADL.\n\n116\n00:05:36.574 --> 00:05:40.168\nAll the computer accounts,\nthat are gonna provide that information.\n\n117\n00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:43.411\nMeaning anything on 2008\nforward that's registered as\n\n118\n00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:46.120\na computer can be found in IPAM and\ncan be seen.\n\n119\n00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.560\nBut what if we have other systems\nthat we wanna add in manually,\n\n120\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.310\nwe have the option to do that as well.\n\n121\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.918\nIP address base management,\nthis is another module or functional area.\n\n122\n00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:58.070\nWe do viewing, monitoring,\nmanaging of all the IP address bases.\n\n123\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.100\nWe can dynamically issue or statically\nassign addresses using this functionality.\n\n124\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.084\nSo we have the capability to be able\nto understand what's out there.\n\n125\n00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:08.794\nBut also to interact with and\nactually manage the IP infrastructure.\n\n126\n00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:11.926\nAnd we've talked about the value\nof how IPv4 is setup and\n\n127\n00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:16.970\nhow it works in prior episodes, IPv6, how\nit's setup and works in prior episodes.\n\n128\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.209\nAnd as I mentioned,\nwe've been through DHCP and DNS.\n\n129\n00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:20.584\nWe've talked about all of\nthe building blocks, right?\n\n130\n00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:23.230\nAll the different requirements that\nwe would need to understand here.\n\n131\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.580\nWe could track utilization, and\nalso detect overlapping DHCP scope.\n\n132\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.890\nSo we can tell that there may\nbe some conflicts in DHCP.\n\n133\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.380\nAnd figure out what's going on there,\n\n134\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.380\nwith IP address space management\nthrough IPAM which is nice.\n\n135\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.130\nWe have multiserver management and\nmonitoring,\n\n136\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.760\nthat's a functional element as well.\n\n137\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.150\nManage multiple DHCP servers,\nunderstanding what's happening there.\n\n138\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.808\nRemember IPAM is really all about\nunderstanding the DHCP architecture and\n\n139\n00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:47.501\ninfrastructure and DNS, right?\n\n140\n00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:51.132\nBecause were gonna wanna understand\nwhat's going on with all the IP address\n\n141\n00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:54.490\nmanagement and all the information\naggregated all up in one place.\n\n142\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.622\nAnd so we can manage all those systems,\n\n143\n00:06:56.622 --> 00:06:59.890\nwouldn't it be nice if we had\na heads up or all up console?\n\n144\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.770\nWhere we see all our DHCP servers,\n\n145\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.790\ninstead of having to go to\neach one as we've been doing.\n\n146\n00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.770\nWell, IPAM can provide that for us, right?\n\n147\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.167\nAs well as multiple DNS servers.\n\n148\n00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:09.897\nRemember, we have the ability to be\nable to manage and work with both and\n\n149\n00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:11.001\nwe were talking about that.\n\n150\n00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.126\nWe can check the health status of DNS.\n\n151\n00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:16.835\nWe can look at authoritative DNS servers\nagainst the zones they're managing.\n\n152\n00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:18.001\nAll the different stuff\nthat we'd wanna do.\n\n153\n00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.000\n&gt;&gt; All in one place saving us time.\n\n154\n00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.584\n&gt;&gt; All in one place.\n\n155\n00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:21.500\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a great idea to me.\n\n156\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.376\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome, you should-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.015\n&gt;&gt; Market that and\n\n158\n00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:26.334\nthink about the fact that\nthat's really cool, right?\n\n159\n00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:29.627\nOperational auditing and\nIPS tracking, the fourth module or\n\n160\n00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:32.000\narea functionality we provided with IPAM.\n\n161\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.459\nWe can track configuration problems,\nunderstand when there are issues.\n\n162\n00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.626\nHey, I wanna set the scope up and\nI wanna have some crazy number of address.\n\n163\n00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:43.297\nOr some sort of multiple subnet scope,\nand we didn't set up super scopes or\n\n164\n00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:44.440\nthings to do that.\n\n165\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.627\nWhatever we may need to do that would be\nspecified and the right way of doing it.\n\n166\n00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:50.524\nWe can then go ahead and\nwe would get information about that, and\n\n167\n00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:52.690\nknow that that may or may not be an issue.\n\n168\n00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.256\nSo when we go in and we take a look, and\n\n169\n00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:56.293\nwe're gonna do that in\njust half a second here.\n\n170\n00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:57.337\nOkay, or we'll do it now, right?\n\n171\n00:07:57.337 --> 00:08:00.031\n[LAUGH] I was just extending\nthe environment time before we\n\n172\n00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:00.879\nbrought that up.\n\n173\n00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.541\nThis is what it looks like, before we\ngo in there, Let's just go over here,\n\n174\n00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:05.587\nWhat's New in IPAM.\n\n175\n00:08:05.587 --> 00:08:06.422\nSo as always,\n\n176\n00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:11.780\nI try to present you some new information\nfrom the Microsoft documentation vault.\n\n177\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.800\nBring it out for you,\nshow you where to go.\n\n178\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.881\nGive you an opportunity to go look some\nstuff up on the web if you want to.\n\n179\n00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.606\nYou'll see it applies to\nWindows Server 2016, right?\n\n180\n00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.680\nCreated in the beginning of 2017 there.\n\n181\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.727\nI love the fact, right, this is one of\nthose things that I've noticed recently,\n\n182\n00:08:24.727 --> 00:08:26.460\na lot of the new\ndocumentation on the website.\n\n183\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.029\nSo they give you all of this,\nbut then it says, hey,\n\n184\n00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:29.048\nhow long will it take you to read?\n\n185\n00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:31.613\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Five minutes to read, like all right,\n\n186\n00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:33.830\ndo you have a stopwatch, are you timing?\n\n187\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.687\nLet's go, I'm gonna scroll through here.\n\n188\n00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:36.950\nYou got to read this in\nless than five minutes.\n\n189\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.220\n&gt;&gt; Based on whose reading skills?\n\n190\n00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's what I'm thinking,\nit's like, how do they come up with that?\n\n191\n00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.570\nWhere does that come from?\n\n192\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.059\nLike an average human will\nread that in five minutes?\n\n193\n00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:43.883\n&gt;&gt; Probably, yeah.\n\n194\n00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.492\n&gt;&gt; Like somebody who\nknows about [CROSSTALK]\n\n195\n00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.075\n&gt;&gt; All the contributors to the right of\n\n196\n00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:49.568\nthat decided that's how much\ntime it would, perhaps.\n\n197\n00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:51.750\n&gt;&gt; It took them that long to figure out\nthat that's how long it would take.\n\n198\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.545\nBut just, so you can see here,\nand remember as I told you,\n\n199\n00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:57.418\nIPAM is not new to 2016.\n\n200\n00:08:57.418 --> 00:09:01.524\nSo you'll see, IPAM function that\nis new or changed in Server 2016.\n\n201\n00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:03.400\nMeaning, hey, its been around for a while.\n\n202\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.060\nThere are some updates as you could\nsee right down there at the bottom,\n\n203\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.730\nthat will update functionality\nfrom prior versions.\n\n204\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.990\nThere may be some new things\nthat we haven't done before.\n\n205\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.050\nSo it is something you\nwanna take a look at.\n\n206\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.820\nYou can see here,\nenhanced IP address management.\n\n207\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.950\nEnhanced management of DNS.\n\n208\n00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.710\nWe've been speaking about\nsome of those things.\n\n209\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.910\nDHCP and DNS address management,\ntalked about that.\n\n210\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.110\nSo DNS service management that's\nbeen enhanced is brand new.\n\n211\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.400\nWe've improved IP and\nintegration of the DHCP and DNS overall.\n\n212\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.795\nMultiple Active Directory forest support,\nthat is a cool one, and that is brand new.\n\n213\n00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:36.100\nUp until now, IPAM has been\nlimited to the forest you're in.\n\n214\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.780\nAnd we've talked about this in\nprior conversations little bit.\n\n215\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.770\nThis idea of maybe merger and\nacquisition going on.\n\n216\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.000\nYour having multiple forests that we may\nhave to manage in the advent of cloud\n\n217\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.530\ninfrastructure, right?\n\n218\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.392\nThings like running systems in a\nmulti-tenant private cloud environment as\n\n219\n00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:53.222\na provider.\n\n220\n00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:57.310\nWhere we may have different forests that\nwe have to manage across and through.\n\n221\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.202\nThis now becomes really critical, and\nwe now actually have that support,\n\n222\n00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.210\nwhich is nice.\n\n223\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.050\nWe can manage DNS and\nDHCP servers across multiple forests,\n\n224\n00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.400\nas long as we have two-way\ntrust relationships.\n\n225\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.220\nSomething that Cherokee has reminded\nus about from time to time.\n\n226\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.934\nWe've talked about forest, and\nyou've asked about trust relationships.\n\n227\n00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:15.340\nAnd reminded us that we need to have that,\nright?\n\n228\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.700\nPurge utilization data,\nwe can actually go in and\n\n229\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.690\nreduce the size of the IPM\ndatabase by cutting it down.\n\n230\n00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.835\nWhich we've had issues\nwith in prior versions.\n\n231\n00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:24.970\nKinda just aggregates everything and\nstays in there.\n\n232\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.920\nNow we can actually clean it out.\n\n233\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.199\nAnd we do have PowerShell support cuz\nwhat would we be without PowerShell\n\n234\n00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.230\nsupport, right?\n\n235\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.500\nFor role-based access control,\nwe can actually now delegate out roles and\n\n236\n00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.080\nconfigure them with PowerShell.\n\n237\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.949\nAnd we do have a set of\nroles you can see here.\n\n238\n00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:42.680\nRole-based security, can we go full\nscreen just so that you can see this?\n\n239\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.430\nWe do have role-based security\nthat you can see here.\n\n240\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.920\nI've just put a little document together,\na little chart here with all\n\n241\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.360\nthe different, as you can see, roles that\nwill exist or user file processes that\n\n242\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.320\nwe have that are showing what the IPAM\ninfrastructure security groups will be.\n\n243\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.830\nSo we can use these and\n\n244\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.140\ndelegate authority based on things\nlike IPAM DNS Administrator.\n\n245\n00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.072\nIPAM ASM, MSM Administrator,\ndifferent areas for the modules,\n\n246\n00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:11.018\nright, module address.\n\n247\n00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:15.240\nRecord Administrator,\noverall Administrator, right?\n\n248\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.630\nJust all these different ones,\nReservation Administrator for DHCP.\n\n249\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.368\nScope administrator,\nDNS record administrator.\n\n250\n00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:23.341\nWe're breaking down the logic here and\n\n251\n00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:26.160\nwe're able to subdivide\nthe functions in these tools.\n\n252\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.840\nAnd say through the console, hey,\n\n253\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.910\nI'm just gonna give maybe Joe the right\nto be the DHCP Scope Administrator.\n\n254\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.440\nAnd then I'm gonna let David be\nthe DNS Record Administrator.\n\n255\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.848\nAnd Cherokee, you're gonna be\nthe Overall Administrator for that, right?\n\n256\n00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:40.068\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.\n\n257\n00:11:40.068 --> 00:11:41.053\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n258\n00:11:41.053 --> 00:11:43.558\nwe're gonna give you the rights to\ntake care of everything else, right?\n\n259\n00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:47.740\nAnd so could see that actually can be\nvery specific with our subdivisioning\n\n260\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.170\nof our delegation thought process here,\nright?\n\n261\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.250\nSo we have this capability in here,\nwhich is really kinda nice.\n\n262\n00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.210\nAnd so\nwe can do that through PowerShell now,\n\n263\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.970\nas well as doing it from\nwithin the console.\n\n264\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.060\nSo that's also very nice.\n\n265\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.580\nSo they just go into some detail here\nabout enhanced IP address management.\n\n266\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:08.580\nWe do support multiple subnets now or\nnewer, updated extended functionality.\n\n267\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.160\nSo it's nice cuz we can just go through.\n\n268\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.613\nAnd they talk about some of the PowerShell\ncommandlets here like add IP, IPAM subnet,\n\n269\n00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:16.300\nand things of that nature.\n\n270\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.240\nAnd Find-IpamFreeSubnet and\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n271\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.550\nSo you would want to take a look.\n\n272\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.438\nThis website's gonna help you to at least\nunderstand a little bit more about what's\n\n273\n00:12:24.438 --> 00:12:27.740\nhappening, what's going on,\nhow we can leverage this information.\n\n274\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.008\nThe deployment requirements, I mentioned\nthat these will be important for\n\n275\n00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:31.880\nus to take a look at.\n\n276\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.953\nLet me just throw these up on\nscreen real quick here for you.\n\n277\n00:12:35.953 --> 00:12:38.625\nSo deployment requirements are right here,\nyou can see.\n\n278\n00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:42.320\nWe do need to have the IPM server be\na domain member, I mentioned that.\n\n279\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.870\nBut it cannot be domain controller, right?\n\n280\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.315\nSo it must be a member of the domain,\nas I suggested, but\n\n281\n00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:47.990\nnot deployed on a domain controller.\n\n282\n00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.732\nIt usually is recommended that you\ndeploy this is a single purpose server.\n\n283\n00:12:51.732 --> 00:12:54.450\nMeaning, hey,\nwe're gonna run IPAM on this thing.\n\n284\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.320\nWe're not gonna be doing\na bunch of others stuff, right?\n\n285\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.889\nBecause we are installing a database,\nwe are creating a lot of traffic.\n\n286\n00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:03.250\nWe're gonna have a lot of traffic\ncoming in and out, a lot of usage.\n\n287\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.380\nAnd we wanna make sure we dedicate a box\nthat's gonna run this role properly.\n\n288\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.480\nSo single purpose servers is\nwhat we often refer to that as.\n\n289\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.850\nThings like, for instance if I said,\n\n290\n00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.740\nif IPAM installs on a DHCP server,\nyou'll have an issue here.\n\n291\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.600\nBecause IPAM's not gonna be able to\ndetect other DHCP servers on the network\n\n292\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.320\nif we're running DHCP locally.\n\n293\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.820\nWe're essentially gonna manage the local\ninstance of DHCP and nothing else.\n\n294\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.190\nBlinding us to one of the most\nimportant elements that IPAM provides.\n\n295\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.640\nWhich is, hey, let me go out and\nfind all the other DHCP servers.\n\n296\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.340\nSo that would be important to know.\n\n297\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.190\nOtherwise, you gotta go and\nback that out and start over again.\n\n298\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.420\nSo we have to enable IPv6 support, it is\nbuilt in, but we do have to enable it.\n\n299\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.308\nWe don't come out of the box ready to go.\n\n300\n00:13:40.308 --> 00:13:42.049\nSo just wanna make sure you know that.\n\n301\n00:13:42.049 --> 00:13:44.654\nSign in with a domain account,\nnot a local admin account.\n\n302\n00:13:44.654 --> 00:13:46.613\nJust remember, we're domain joined, right?\n\n303\n00:13:46.613 --> 00:13:48.104\nSo we need to know that.\n\n304\n00:13:48.104 --> 00:13:52.814\nAnd we have to set up and enable logging\nof account sign-ins on domain controllers\n\n305\n00:13:52.814 --> 00:13:57.112\nor network policy servers when we wanna\nbe able to do IP address tracking and\n\n306\n00:13:57.112 --> 00:13:58.080\nauditing.\n\n307\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.340\nI mentioned one of the key\nvalue propositions, right?\n\n308\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.346\nFor me as an auditor, for\nme as a security-focused individual,\n\n309\n00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:06.410\nit's this idea that I can look at\nIP address tracking and auditing.\n\n310\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.660\nAnd get reports on that\nin your environment.\n\n311\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.870\nFor you to set that up, logging of\naccount sign-ins must be enabled.\n\n312\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.710\nSo you just wanna know\nsome of these things.\n\n313\n00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.550\nThese are little bells and\nwhistles that you wanna be aware of.\n\n314\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.300\nWe can obviously,\nas you can see here, specify.\n\n315\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.420\nAnd we do have some requirements here.\n\n316\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.020\nWe do need a 2.0 gig or\nfaster dual-core processor, pretty basic.\n\n317\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.688\nServer 12 or later, I mentioned,\nthis feature's been around for a while.\n\n318\n00:14:30.688 --> 00:14:33.127\n4 or more gigs of RAM, not a lot.\n\n319\n00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:36.530\n80 gigs of hard drive space, so\nit's really straightforward, right?\n\n320\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.490\nNot a very complicated install.\n\n321\n00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.100\nAnd certainly not one that's\ngoing to be very heavy-handed.\n\n322\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.048\nIn the sense that we need tremendous\namounts of resources to run this\n\n323\n00:14:46.048 --> 00:14:46.780\nthing, right?\n\n324\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.850\nI mean, we could be running this as a\nvirtualized role on a VM somewhere, right?\n\n325\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.100\nAnd that would not be a big deal.\n\n326\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.010\nI mean, spinning up a VM with 4 gigs\nof memory And a couple of processors.\n\n327\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.280\nThat's really not very complicated\ntoday in a hosting environment, right?\n\n328\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.150\nThat really wouldn't take a lot of concern\nor require a lot of resources at all.\n\n329\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.740\nSo just wanna be thinking about that,\njust be aware of that.\n\n330\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.630\nSo we could set that up, pretty easy\nto do, and then you take a look here.\n\n331\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.550\nWhen we do install the role,\nI've already got it setup and installed.\n\n332\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.190\nI just used PowerShell\nto instantiate the role.\n\n333\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.700\nWe're gonna go through in\nan upcoming episode a walkthrough\n\n334\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.650\nof how to configure this top to bottom.\n\n335\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.000\nBut I'm on the server\nwhere IPAM is running.\n\n336\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.130\nI've just gone ahead and just simply\nclicked right here on my IPAM item.\n\n337\n00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.810\nAnd gone on in and opened up my IPAM\nserver task little console view here.\n\n338\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.630\nNow this is kind of interesting\nif you haven't seen IPAM before.\n\n339\n00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.820\nNormally we say, hey, you installed that,\nlet's just go and go the tools.\n\n340\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.940\nAnd then we'll pull that down and\ngo take a look.\n\n341\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.080\nAnd you'll go and take a look here.\n\n342\n00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.760\nJust go down to the bottom and\nback up to the top.\n\n343\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.970\nAnd as I'm doing that, you'll see\nthat IPAM is not installed here,\n\n344\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.810\nright, as a tool, but rather it's\nrun from the console right here.\n\n345\n00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.004\nSo if you're going looking for it,\nit's like, hey, let me click on that.\n\n346\n00:15:58.004 --> 00:15:59.755\nLet me go find that, open that up.\n\n347\n00:15:59.755 --> 00:16:02.088\nIt's not a separate tool like DNS or DHCP.\n\n348\n00:16:02.088 --> 00:16:04.337\nIt's an aggregated management console.\n\n349\n00:16:04.337 --> 00:16:06.711\nThat exists inside of the server manager.\n\n350\n00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.362\n&gt;&gt; And you can see at the top there,\nthat headline,\n\n351\n00:16:09.362 --> 00:16:12.680\nI guess that should it call that banner,\nso to speak, IPAM.\n\n352\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.686\n&gt;&gt; You can, you can certainly see it\nthere, but just pointing out if you go\n\n353\n00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:18.085\nlooking for this thing you\nwould be looking a long time.\n\n354\n00:16:18.085 --> 00:16:21.430\nIt' not going to be there,\nit is not showing up any time soon.\n\n355\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.974\nYou don't want to get caught clicking,\nwhere is that thing and\n\n356\n00:16:23.974 --> 00:16:25.033\nI don't know where it is.\n\n357\n00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:27.841\nSo you just wanna know how to find\nthis is what I will suggest to you.\n\n358\n00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:31.150\nNow, we will step through these\nsteps in an upcoming demonstration.\n\n359\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.890\nWe're not gonna spend\ntime on it right now.\n\n360\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.820\nBut I do wanna show you just quickly\nhow we start the process here.\n\n361\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.970\nSo you set this up,\nyou install IPAM, right?\n\n362\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.670\nSo we've installed it,\nlet me just show you what I did here,\n\n363\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.840\nnot very difficult to do.\n\n364\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.250\nAs always, let's move that over so\nwe can see that.\n\n365\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.430\nUse PowerShell here,\nyou can see add Windows feature.\n\n366\n00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.980\nName of the feature IPAM,\ninclude management tools and\n\n367\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.688\nI'll kinda cut that off so\nI moved it over.\n\n368\n00:16:54.688 --> 00:16:56.530\nInclude all sub-features.\n\n369\n00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.500\nI've talked about the need to specify,\n\n370\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.840\nsometimes you wanna use the management\ntools and include all sub-features.\n\n371\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.810\nParameters that we want we can get\neverything when we do the install.\n\n372\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.130\nSo we did that, and then takes a couple\nof minutes to go ahead and configure,\n\n373\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.020\ncomes back hopefully.\n\n374\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.090\nIf you do it everything is running,\nsuccess true,\n\n375\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.060\nrestart not required,\nsuccess, got all that set up.\n\n376\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.540\nSo we did all that and all I did was just\ngo into the console refreshed, we've\n\n377\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.740\ntalked about the need to refresh if you\nhave server manager up, but we did that.\n\n378\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.320\nIPAM pops in, very easy, go click on\nit and there our IPAM server task.\n\n379\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.770\nIt's nice we have this\nlittle six step process and\n\n380\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.005\nwe will be walking through these\nin our upcoming demonstration.\n\n381\n00:17:31.005 --> 00:17:34.662\nHey, we're going to step two now, let's\ngo provision the IPAM server, we will be\n\n382\n00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:38.235\nwalking through some of that, but you\nstart with connecting to the IPAM server.\n\n383\n00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:41.588\nWe installed on this machine, IPAM is\nrun here so it is already connected,\n\n384\n00:17:41.588 --> 00:17:45.264\nit comes up ready to go, and you can see\nthat, you can probably see it right there,\n\n385\n00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.876\nit's in grey but\nit's underneath it says connected to and\n\n386\n00:17:47.876 --> 00:17:50.790\nit specifies the name of the machine\nthat we're on right there.\n\n387\n00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.626\nAnd you could see connected as, tells us\nwho we are connected as and in this case\n\n388\n00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:58.172\nyou are the domain administrator stress\nthe importance of logging in and\n\n389\n00:17:58.172 --> 00:18:01.951\nensuring we're on a domain member and\nthat we are using a domain account, but\n\n390\n00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:05.847\nthat we are not connecting from a machine\nthat would be a domain controller cuz we\n\n391\n00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:07.930\ncan't install IPAM domain controller.\n\n392\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.510\nSo just wanna make sure we are aware\nof all the things we talked about,\n\n393\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.230\nif you had to for some reason we\npath these two on IPAM sever or\n\n394\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.150\npath to another one no big deal, you'll\nsee here we do have the ability to be able\n\n395\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.330\nto tell where we are and what we're\nmanaging so we could select more than one\n\n396\n00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.490\nserver if there is another IPAM server\nhere that maybe we wanted to manage.\n\n397\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.130\nRemotely meeting,\n\n398\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.840\nyou know we had IPAM installed in multiple\nservers, we'd be able to see those here.\n\n399\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.860\nSo we could see that, and then once\nwe're done we would actually come in and\n\n400\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.150\nprovision the IPAM server.\n\n401\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.430\nNow, before we deploy IPAM, things I\nalready told you about, just to remind\n\n402\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.940\nyou of this, we can, remember, have two\nway trust relationships between FARS.\n\n403\n00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.408\nWe talked about the support there.\n\n404\n00:18:44.408 --> 00:18:48.520\nWe do have to make sure and understand\nthat every IPAM server that we install is\n\n405\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.383\nnot gonna communicate with\nanother one in the sense.\n\n406\n00:18:51.383 --> 00:18:55.118\nAnd we're gonna be able to go in an say,\nlook, there's five IPAM servers and\n\n407\n00:18:55.118 --> 00:18:59.082\nlet's all talk and share our database\ninformation, of a common database where we\n\n408\n00:18:59.082 --> 00:19:03.580\nrecord all information, like an external\nSQL database, that everybody references.\n\n409\n00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:08.160\nEach IPAM server is going to have its\nown database, and it's gonna use its own\n\n410\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.240\ndatabase locally to be able to manage its\nown information that it's aggregating.\n\n411\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.590\nSo as a result, keep in mind that\neverything is essentially local and\n\n412\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.460\nthat we're knowledgeable about\nwhat's on our machine, right?\n\n413\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.525\nWe're not gonna see a common\ndatabase that we could scale out and\n\n414\n00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:26.435\nuse like in a clustered environment or\nsomething like that.\n\n415\n00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:29.779\nDoesn't work that way, and so as a result\nwe're really knowledgeable about what\n\n416\n00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:31.530\nwe own, and what we're aware of locally.\n\n417\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.170\nBut we're not gonna share that\nknowledge across other instances.\n\n418\n00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.860\nI just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n419\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.340\nNow, what can we support?\n\n420\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.150\nSingle IPAM server can actually\nsupport up to 150 DHP servers and\n\n421\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.710\nup to 500 DNS servers.\n\n422\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.000\nThat's a lot of\ninfrastructure that we can,\n\n423\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.020\nas I get an eyelash in my\neye while I'm talking.\n\n424\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.270\nAmazing I can multitask and\ndo two things at once.\n\n425\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.230\nBlinded as I am, and not being able to\nsee anything I can still talk about IPAM.\n\n426\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.260\nSo, we can support up to 500 DNS servers,\n150 DHCP servers.\n\n427\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.210\nThat's a lot of servers in our\ninfrastructure being managed\n\n428\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.360\nfrom one system.\n\n429\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.804\nRemember, they don't all have\nto be available on this box,\n\n430\n00:20:09.804 --> 00:20:12.330\nso all we have to do is install\nthe monitoring capability here.\n\n431\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.610\nThat's what we're doing with IPAM.\n\n432\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.010\nWe're then going out and finding and\ndiscovering those by going to the AD and\n\n433\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.522\nsaying, hey, in these subnets that\nI've specified I want to manage,\n\n434\n00:20:20.522 --> 00:20:23.570\nin these IP4 or 6 subnets or\n\n435\n00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.090\nscopes, I want to find All the DHCP and\nDNS servers that are in these areas.\n\n436\n00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.960\nAnd I wanna make sure I can\nhave knowledge of them.\n\n437\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.890\nSo we have a lot of those.\n\n438\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.630\nWe can manage-\n&gt;&gt; Are we limited by scopes?\n\n439\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.656\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry?\n&gt;&gt; Are we limited to amount of scopes?\n\n440\n00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:36.308\n&gt;&gt; We are, I was about to say that, but\n\n441\n00:20:36.308 --> 00:20:39.741\nI think you probably cheated an looked\nahead and saw what that number was.\n\n442\n00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:44.537\nSo why don't tell all of our Lovely\nstudio audience participants out there in\n\n443\n00:20:44.537 --> 00:20:47.535\nour ITProTV world,\nhow many scopes and zones?\n\n444\n00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:48.530\nCuz you didn't mention zones also.\n\n445\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.120\n&gt;&gt; I didn't mention zones.\n\n446\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.080\n&gt;&gt; How many scopes and zones are within?\n\n447\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.447\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it looks like we're\nloaded to 6,000 scopes, and 150 zones.\n\n448\n00:20:56.447 --> 00:21:00.290\n&gt;&gt; 6,000 DHCP scopes across\nthose 150 DHCP servers.\n\n449\n00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.020\nAnd on those 500 DNS servers,\n150 DNS zones, right?\n\n450\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.860\nSo that's a lot if you think about that.\n\n451\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.830\nIt's a lot of infrastructure\nthat we're managing and\n\n452\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.820\na lot of stuff that we wanna think about.\n\n453\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.625\nNow, we all also do\nsomething else really cool.\n\n454\n00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:16.425\nWe store this data, this aggregated\ndata we find and understand.\n\n455\n00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:19.395\nAnd auditing in terms of the use of\nIP address, all that kind of stuff.\n\n456\n00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:21.705\nWe store that,\nwe store it for three years.\n\n457\n00:21:21.705 --> 00:21:25.925\nWe store it for three years with\nthe forensics data for IP address leases.\n\n458\n00:21:25.925 --> 00:21:29.455\nFor host media access control address,\nin other words, Mac address controls.\n\n459\n00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.780\nUser sign in and sign out information.\n\n460\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.010\nWe keep 3 years worth of data\non that in the IPAM database.\n\n461\n00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.000\nNow, you have to obviously be able to\ngo back and access to all of that data.\n\n462\n00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.220\nSo when you have the capability to\ninterrogate the IPAM database to see\n\n463\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.730\nwhat's been historically going on, which\nis again one of the reasons as an auditor\n\n464\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.200\nI love the tool because I get that depth\nof information looking backwards and\n\n465\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.880\nseeing what there, and\nI'm able to understand that.\n\n466\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.450\nSo that is actually kind of\ninteresting and pretty cool.\n\n467\n00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.030\nThat is probably also if I\nwas to have to guess and\n\n468\n00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.420\nsay, well maybe a testable factoid\nat some point in the future.\n\n469\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.704\nI'm just saying, I never know,\nbut you know, I am saying.\n\n470\n00:22:05.704 --> 00:22:08.220\nWildly speculating is what I'm doing.\n\n471\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.470\nOn IPAM supports WID,\nthe Windows Internal Database that we use.\n\n472\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.230\nWe can use SQL server as I mentioned,\nyou could theoretically\n\n473\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.610\nhave a single instance specifically for,\nthis instance of IPAM.\n\n474\n00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:23.700\nBut to do one understand that normally we\nsue the Windows internal database WID to\n\n475\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.070\nhost that unless we go out\nof our way to specify that.\n\n476\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.940\nWe do have the option to move our database\nout to SQL up to you to decide, but just\n\n477\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.880\nkeep in mind that instance of SQL we gonna\nuse it has to running on the IPM server.\n\n478\n00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.110\nNo remote access connection where we got\nthat SQL Cluster like I was suggesting\n\n479\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.230\nthat you would not be able to use.\n\n480\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.040\nGotta be a local install SQL.\n\n481\n00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.890\nSo just wanna make sure you're aware\nof that, and we're thinking about that.\n\n482\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.046\nWe did talk about\nintegrating IPAM into VMM.\n\n483\n00:22:50.046 --> 00:22:53.635\nI started out our conversations by saying\nwe could integrate this with CVMM.\n\n484\n00:22:53.635 --> 00:22:57.000\nI actually said, and encouraged you to\ngo take a look that we actually have\n\n485\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.910\ndone a demo on this Cherokee and I.\n\n486\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.030\nAnd you could go in and take a look at\nhow that's done in the MCC private cloud,\n\n487\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.720\nthe 7247 content we actually did.\n\n488\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.380\nI did stand up of the VMM solution,\ninstalled IPAM.\n\n489\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.480\nI showed you how to integrate the two.\n\n490\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.620\nIt was a lot of fun.\n\n491\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.770\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information.\n\n492\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.190\n&gt;&gt; It was a lot of fun and\nit's pretty cool to do.\n\n493\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.660\nIt's not very difficult to do at all,\nquite honestly.\n\n494\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.110\nIt's actually very easy to do so\njust be aware of that.\n\n495\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.300\nSo we have all of that.\n\n496\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.230\nWe also talked about the fact that\n\n497\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.790\nwe do have some of our capabilities\nin terms of our roles and\n\n498\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.190\njust the overview of all the things that\nwe want to make sure we're aware of.\n\n499\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.760\nWhen we come back, and\nwe will be coming back for\n\n500\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.930\na part two in order to be able to\ngo through and take a look at this.\n\n501\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.190\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nwalk us through the remaining steps here\n\n502\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.400\nprovisioning the IPM server, configuring\nthe server directory, setting up and\n\n503\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.140\nstarting discovery,\nI said directory rather, excuse me,\n\n504\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.038\nconfiguring discovery\nis what I meant to say.\n\n505\n00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:49.798\nStarting discovery, and\nthen going in and specifying and\n\n506\n00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:52.791\nverifying what we want to do and\nwhat access we also want to get.\n\n507\n00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:56.587\nAnd then looking at data that we retrieve,\nso that way, once we get all that back and\n\n508\n00:23:56.587 --> 00:23:59.857\nI know right now there really isn't\nmuch of anything to show you there.\n\n509\n00:23:59.857 --> 00:24:01.517\nBut we will be able to go and\n\n510\n00:24:01.517 --> 00:24:05.895\nwe'll actually be able to see\nInformation I want to be able to go in and\n\n511\n00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:10.510\nstart to see information coming in\nform of IPAM management system here.\n\n512\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.790\nBe able to aggregate data and\nstart to look at interaction, and so\n\n513\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.580\nwe wanna come back and\ntake a look at how to do that.\n\n514\n00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.020\nI just wanna give you the overview and\nthe foundation of what IPAM is and\n\n515\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.970\nhow we set it up before we\nactually take that journey.\n\n516\n00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.300\nSo we're gonna invite you to come back and\n\n517\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.040\ntake a look at it, that,\nwith us with part two.\n\n518\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n519\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.280\nI'm down for a journey, an IPAM journey.\n\n520\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.310\nAnd I hope you are too.\n\n521\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.844\nSo please join-\n&gt;&gt; Permission slips.\n\n522\n00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Permission slips.\n\n523\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, make sure your parents\nsign those permission slips.\n\n524\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.539\n&gt;&gt; Pair up, everybody two students--\n&gt;&gt; I'm the buddy.\n\n525\n00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:36.545\n&gt;&gt; on a bus, right?\n\n526\n00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:37.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And make sure you have\n\n527\n00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.020\na permission slip.\n\n528\n00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you so much and\nhopefully we'll see you soon.\n\n529\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.120\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n530\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.340\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n531\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.041\n&gt;&gt; I'm

00:00:08.019\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.746\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT ProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.090\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at how to implement and\n\n8\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.760\nmanage our IPM servers.\n\n9\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.700\nAnd, actually, I think there's\na demonstration on the forefront.\n\n10\n00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.100\nAnd with us today, back in studio,\nis we have Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.120\nWhat do you say Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.060\n&gt;&gt; I say it is demo time.\n\n13\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.810\nThat's what I say.\n\n14\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.420\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n15\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240\nWe're gonna jump back\nin where we left off.\n\n16\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.920\nWe had said, in our prior episode,\n\n17\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.640\nwe just kind of laid down\nthe foundational discussion around IPAM.\n\n18\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.510\nShowed you the console,\nexplained the basic ideas behind it.\n\n19\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600\nTold you what the requirements\nwere to stand it up and\n\n20\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.640\nmake sure you configured it properly.\n\n21\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.280\nDomain member but not domain controller.\n\n22\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.710\nLogin as an administrator with rights.\n\n23\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.280\nMake sure you have those things\nkind of straight in your head.\n\n24\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.190\nWhat we're going to do is jump in and\nstart walking through the logic\n\n25\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.320\nof how to go from step one all the way\nthrough step six on that console.\n\n26\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.533\nWe've already taken care of step one,\nwe are connected to the IPM server,\n\n27\n00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.070\nwe've already got the role setup.\n\n28\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.930\nSo let's jump what feature setup\nshould say, let's jump in.\n\n29\n00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.380\nAnd we're now go ahead and\nwe're going to provision the IPM server.\n\n30\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.330\nSo we're going to start right there, we're\ngonna click on item number two, let me\n\n31\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.620\njust bring this up here so you can see\n'cuz we do get rather lengthy Dialog Box,\n\n32\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.070\nactually so big as a matter of fact that\nwhat we're going to do is go and do that.\n\n33\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.780\nSo, we can see what's there.\n\n34\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.260\nAnd what we're doing, is we're starting to\ngo through and we are going to start to\n\n35\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.700\nconfigure, as you can see, right after we\nget through the before you begin phase,\n\n36\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.020\nand just take a look at what's there.\n\n37\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.730\nBut we're going to configure the database.\n\n38\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.090\nRemember I mentioned we have\nthis internal database.\n\n39\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.400\nThe WID database which we rely on.\n\n40\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.870\nMay have a SQL server database.\n\n41\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.270\nWe wanna use local to the IPM server.\n\n42\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.460\nFor doing that we have to have\nthe SQL server installed ready to go,\n\n43\n00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.570\nthe instance information.\n\n44\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020\nSo we'll be given that option here,\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n45\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.220\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nconfigure the database.\n\n46\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.900\nWe will use the Window's internal\ndatabase for the demo just so\n\n47\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.090\nyou know as we're walking through.\n\n48\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.260\nWe're not gonna stand up a separate\nSQL instance local to the box, but\n\n49\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.700\nyou could if you wanted to.\n\n50\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.420\nSo you'll just be able to\nsee us go through all that.\n\n51\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.110\nWe'll set up our provisioning method.\n\n52\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.360\nWe'll wait for\nthis part of the wizard to finish.\n\n53\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.850\nAnd then we'll continue walking\nthrough the steps, setting IPM up and\n\n54\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.000\nconfiguring all the different\naspects as we go.\n\n55\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.413\nSo ioin me as we set on this journey\nright and let's go get started.\n\n56\n00:02:20.413 --> 00:02:23.192\nSo we know that we got some\noverview material here just\n\n57\n00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:26.032\ngives us a little indicator\nof what we're about to do,\n\n58\n00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.747\nallows us to as it says hearing and\nas I reminded you,\n\n59\n00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:32.960\nI'll just, well I can't really highlight,\nbut I'll just point to it.\n\n60\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.760\nThat would create an IPM database\neither locally directly into WID or\n\n61\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.730\nwith the SQL Server.\n\n62\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.490\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\ndown here I know you can't really see,\n\n63\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.100\nI'm covering it but right behind me\nthere is a next button right here.\n\n64\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.160\nThere you go, right there so we're just\ngonna go ahead and we're gonna click next.\n\n65\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.483\nWe get this screen right here\nwhere we're gonna be able to\n\n66\n00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:55.064\nchoose to put in our information either\nabout the windows internal database.\n\n67\n00:02:55.064 --> 00:02:59.247\nWe said we would use the local\na built-in plab process by default.\n\n68\n00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:03.267\nYou'll see that there, it's already\nprovisioned out with the directory\n\n69\n00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:07.928\ninformation the percent Windows directory\npercent placeholder just usually winds up\n\n70\n00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:11.245\nbeing C windows but\nwherever you install Windows of the system\n\n71\n00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:14.849\nvariable System32 IPM database,\nthat's where we'll end up.\n\n72\n00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.550\nAll right, so that's what we're gonna do.\n\n73\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.560\nNotice here, if we wanna use SQL Server,\nspecify that out.\n\n74\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.550\nPut our server name, database name,\nour port number, 1433,\n\n75\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.700\nand create a new schema for it.\n\n76\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.550\nSo we'll choose what we're gonna do.\n\n77\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.610\nWe'll be doing WID here, click Next.\n\n78\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.400\nWe then have to specify\nour provisioning method.\n\n79\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.670\nIf we're doing group policy based,\nwhich we would traditionally do.\n\n80\n00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.620\nAnd use IPAM or rather manage IPAM with\ngroup policy based provisioning so\n\n81\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.170\nthat we create in the domains we're gonna\nmanage the appropriate group policy\n\n82\n00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.120\nobjects that then let us go out and\nfind the servers and interact with them.\n\n83\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.870\nWe'll have to specify what your group\npolicy name prefix will be here.\n\n84\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.320\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just use, just\nput on the policy prefix we're gonna use,\n\n85\n00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.250\ncall this IPAM so PLABS-IPAM for\nour plab server domain right?\n\n86\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.820\nAnd then our practice labs,excuse me,\ndomain that we're using, and\n\n87\n00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.760\nIPAM just telling us what it is,\nso we'll specify this.\n\n88\n00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.190\nWe can also do this manually,\nnotice here manual provisioning method,\n\n89\n00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.510\nthis allows us to configure the required\nnetwork shares, security groups, and\n\n90\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.760\nfirewall rules, but\nwe do some manually on each server.\n\n91\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.030\nMay not wanna go to all that trouble,\nit's a lot of work, and so\n\n92\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.660\nwe certainly can do that but\nit's up to us to decide.\n\n93\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.103\nIf we do a through group policy, then IPAM\nautomatically does configure the settings\n\n94\n00:04:33.103 --> 00:04:36.990\non the management server by setting up and\nmanaging it with the group policy\n\n95\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.454\ntemplates that will then allow us to have\nall of that information specified, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.454 --> 00:04:45.172\nSays very useful and large networks\nespecially, where we're gonna be managing\n\n97\n00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:48.616\nwith a bunch of different servers and\nthat we can go ahead and specify that we\n\n98\n00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:52.160\nstandardize everything and it's all\ngonna be configured the right way.\n\n99\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that,\nwe'll just specify our prefix there,\n\n100\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.465\nClick Next, got our Summary screen,\nnothing too involved.\n\n101\n00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.445\nBut notice specifically, the Group\nPolicy Objects that will get created,\n\n102\n00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:07.425\nthere are three of them here,\nby the way, just so you can see.\n\n103\n00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:11.755\nWe'll see one for DHCP servers,\none for DNS, and, of course, one for\n\n104\n00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:14.215\nour network policy service\non the domain controller.\n\n105\n00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:17.025\nSo we're gonna be able to\ninteract with the two primary\n\n106\n00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:21.340\npoints of information gathering that\nwe focus on with IPAM, DHCP and DNS.\n\n107\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.970\nWe have a third group policy object that\nwill configure or give a settings around\n\n108\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.400\nmanagement of the main controllers or\npolicy service as well.\n\n109\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.070\nWe'll have all that.\n\n110\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.050\nWe'll configure the IPM database.\n\n111\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.950\nWe'll make sure we have the schedule\n\n112\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.390\ntask on the IPAM server set up that\nwe collect data from the network.\n\n113\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.460\nIt's gonna provision out for\nus in the configuration wizard will.\n\n114\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.590\nThe required task and\n\n115\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.924\nset them up pre-scheduled tasks will have\nthe local security groups necessary to\n\n116\n00:05:47.924 --> 00:05:51.778\nspecify the admin role issued some of\nthose groups in the prior episode.\n\n117\n00:05:51.778 --> 00:05:55.570\nWe're gonna have the document with all the\nroles, we'll talk about what those would\n\n118\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.010\nbe, and we'll enable IP address tracking\ncapabilities on the IPM service.\n\n119\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.050\nWe're gonna get all that set up when\nwe do this we're gonna click apply.\n\n120\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.850\nProvisioning in progress.\n\n121\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.540\nPlease stand by as we say, right?\n\n122\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.330\nSo you'll see that's gonna go through,\nit's gonna take a few\n\n123\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.810\nminutes to do this so we're gonna go\nahead and let this run it's course.\n\n124\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.890\nWe're gonna come on back\nas soon as it's ready and\n\n125\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.610\nthen we're gonna take you on\nthe next stage of our journey here.\n\n126\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Once we're finished we'll\n\n127\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.400\nsee a nice little.\n\n128\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.720\nConfiguration success window,\nsee a summary there, we'll go back to\n\n129\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.450\nthe console and then we'll be able to go\nahead and configure server discovery,\n\n130\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.110\nthat'll will be our next stop on\nour little road trip here, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.660\n&gt;&gt; And they tell them keep your arms and\nyour legs inside the moving vehicle.\n\n132\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.820\n&gt;&gt; At all times.\n&gt;&gt; At all times.\n\n133\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.591\nAll right, and it looks like we've\narrived safely at our destination.\n\n134\n00:06:41.278 --> 00:06:43.775\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's take a look.\n\n135\n00:06:43.775 --> 00:06:46.160\n[LAUGH] Look at what we got there, right?\n\n136\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.570\nPAM provisioning completed\nsuccessfully screen.\n\n137\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.440\nOn average, in the real world we time\nlapse sometimes, it's hey, you guys relax,\n\n138\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.200\nlet us just finish it up.\n\n139\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.070\nWe'll come back and show you.\n\n140\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.070\nBut you don't always get to\nsee how long it really takes.\n\n141\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.760\nTakes maybe a minute or\n\n142\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.940\ntwo depending on how involved\nthe database configuration is.\n\n143\n00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.060\nI will share with you in the real world\njust so you know, the WID configuration,\n\n144\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.760\nthe Windows Internal Database,\n\n145\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.350\ndoes not take as long as\nprovisioning a SQL server instance.\n\n146\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.770\nSo if you did choose to go with\na local SQL server instance\n\n147\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.780\nit would take you a little bit longer.\n\n148\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.360\nThree to five minutes, who knows,\n\n149\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.950\nit really depends on the processing power\nof the box that you're running on, but\n\n150\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.110\nSQL Server configuration will take longer\nthan the Windows Internal Database.\n\n151\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.293\nJust so you know, we did the WIN database,\nso it didn't take very long at all, and\n\n152\n00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:29.410\nit's gonna run pretty quickly as a result\nof that just so you're aware of that.\n\n153\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.411\nSo we have our IP provision successfully.\n\n154\n00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.341\nWe have our next step here right we\ngonna click close at the bottom.\n\n155\n00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:38.542\nI know you can see that there is little\nclose button right back there behind me at\n\n156\n00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.256\nthe bottom right hand side of the screen.\n\n157\n00:07:40.256 --> 00:07:43.155\nIf we could show that real quick just so\nyou could see where I'm about to click.\n\n158\n00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:44.535\nThere we go, we're gonna click close.\n\n159\n00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:47.455\nThis'll throw us back into that\nmain screen with all the steps,\n\n160\n00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:49.475\nand we're just gonna pick\nup on the next step here.\n\n161\n00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:50.675\nSo we're gonna click close.\n\n162\n00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:53.225\nTakes us right back into\nserver manager as you can see.\n\n163\n00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:56.337\nNotice by the way provisioning\nthe IPAM server now completed.\n\n164\n00:07:56.337 --> 00:07:59.587\nSo we can see that we're kind\nof marking our journey as we go.\n\n165\n00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:03.504\nNow notice configure the server discovery,\ndomain selected none.\n\n166\n00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:05.254\nWe're gonna Fix that right now.\n\n167\n00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:10.025\nSo we're gonna click here, gonna go in,\nI'm just gonna move this up over here.\n\n168\n00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:13.800\nSo that we can talk about that, and\nsee that while we're going through.\n\n169\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.544\nAnd so what we're gonna do is select\nthe forest section and click Get Forest.\n\n170\n00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:20.990\nNow over here, let's talk for\na minute before I do this.\n\n171\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.100\nSo in the real world notice,\n\n172\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.477\nit may happen here and\nif does I just want you to be aware of it.\n\n173\n00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:27.194\nIf it happens to you in the real world,\nno worries,\n\n174\n00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:29.671\ndon't fear the get\nforests little item here.\n\n175\n00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:32.401\nWhat you're gonna do is you're gonna\ngo out and select the forest, but\n\n176\n00:08:32.401 --> 00:08:34.599\nnotice we don't have any here and\nso we're gonna click.\n\n177\n00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:39.299\nNow it's gonna go out and start trying to\ndiscover, but it may take a little bit,\n\n178\n00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.429\nespecially if you have\na very large infrastructure.\n\n179\n00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.165\nIt's gonna take a while to figure\nout what all of that looks like.\n\n180\n00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:47.955\nSo we may try this and\nit may actually show up and\n\n181\n00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:50.855\nwe may not see anything on the window\nwhere we select initially.\n\n182\n00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:53.418\nMay have to give it up a minute,\nbut eventually we'll populate,\n\n183\n00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:55.854\njust want you to be comfortable with that,\njust understand.\n\n184\n00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:58.360\nWe're gonna click here,\ngonna do get forest.\n\n185\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.888\nYou'll see here it says the background\ntask has been scheduled and\n\n186\n00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.974\nstarted fetching the trusted forest.\n\n187\n00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:07.163\nPlease close this particular item and\nthen go ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:09.450\nlaunch it again after it finishes.\n\n189\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.620\nWe've got our thing going\non back here as well.\n\n190\n00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.917\nIt's okay, we're gonna click OK,\nwe're gonna click OK.\n\n191\n00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:19.077\nSo it says, discovered servers\nare based on, and you'll see here.\n\n192\n00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:22.670\nNext data collection is please\nrefresh to update this view.\n\n193\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.860\nClick more here, it gives you\na little bit more information.\n\n194\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.250\nShows you that it's running, shows\nyou that it did seem to do discovery.\n\n195\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.610\nAnd by the way,\nthat's what we wanna see here.\n\n196\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.510\nIt did, looks like it did complete,\nso we're interested in that.\n\n197\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.610\nWe don't seem to see there's any errors,\nso\n\n198\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.609\nwe just wanna know that\nwe can check there.\n\n199\n00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:44.027\nSo let's go back in here and\nwe should now, and you could see here,\n\n200\n00:09:44.027 --> 00:09:45.015\nit is populating.\n\n201\n00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:48.229\nWhat I was suggesting is that you can do\nthat and if nothing shows up right away,\n\n202\n00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:51.320\nyou may have just launched it too\nearly before it actually finished.\n\n203\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.916\nThe way you would know would be to\nactually pay attention to this little\n\n204\n00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:54.581\nyellow bar here.\n\n205\n00:09:54.581 --> 00:09:58.293\nAnd although it's not the most obvious\nthing in the world, click the More link.\n\n206\n00:09:58.293 --> 00:10:01.654\nIt should say click here for status or\nsomething to tell you that it's running or\n\n207\n00:10:01.654 --> 00:10:02.620\nthat it's finished.\n\n208\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.470\nBut I'm just trying to make sure you know\nhow to navigate your way around in here.\n\n209\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.800\nAnd so you're comfortable\nwith things when they occur.\n\n210\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.796\nYou're not guessing as to where it is, but\n\n211\n00:10:10.796 --> 00:10:13.297\nthat more item would show\nyou the status I showed you.\n\n212\n00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:14.650\nDid it complete successfully?\n\n213\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.044\nSo we do expect to see and\nthat we do have our four selection here.\n\n214\n00:10:18.044 --> 00:10:22.528\nSo we're gonna be able to go in and\ndo this, I will be able to go ahead and\n\n215\n00:10:22.528 --> 00:10:25.884\nmake sure we have\na practicelabs.com forest here.\n\n216\n00:10:25.884 --> 00:10:28.785\nWe do, and you could see that's\nthe only one we are operating with.\n\n217\n00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:32.397\nSelect domain to discover, we obviously\nthen will be able to select one or\n\n218\n00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:33.165\nmore domains.\n\n219\n00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:36.963\nWe can choose here, you'll see we have\nour root domain for practicelabs.com, but\n\n220\n00:10:36.963 --> 00:10:38.797\nyou'll notice that we can add domains.\n\n221\n00:10:38.797 --> 00:10:42.645\nWe would obviously then kinda populate and\npop up a list here, because remember,\n\n222\n00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:45.170\nwe do have a single forest\nthat we're linked to.\n\n223\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.334\nBut we may have multiple\ndomains within the forest, and\n\n224\n00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:48.723\nthat's not uncommon by any means.\n\n225\n00:10:48.723 --> 00:10:53.208\nWe often will normally have more than\none domain, so let's go ahead and\n\n226\n00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:54.189\nlet's add in.\n\n227\n00:10:56.877 --> 00:11:00.140\nYou'll see here we click the Select\ndomains to discover add in our\n\n228\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.859\nroot domain.\n\n229\n00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:04.731\nSo we're gonna choose that domain\ncontroller DHCP server DNS server.\n\n230\n00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.345\nWhat are we gonna be querying,\nwhat are we gonna be discovering?\n\n231\n00:11:07.345 --> 00:11:09.495\nWe want obviously hopefully\nwe want all three, and\n\n232\n00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:11.350\nso we're gonna make choices there.\n\n233\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.867\nIf we add in domains, we don't want for\nsome reason, just remove them,\n\n234\n00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:17.357\nthat's what the remove button is for\nright there.\n\n235\n00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:20.514\nAnd we just can just grab that,\nhighlight that, remove it and\n\n236\n00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:23.139\ngo back and make a choice or\nsomething like that so.\n\n237\n00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:25.499\n&gt;&gt; Now if we had several\ndifferent domains,\n\n238\n00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:28.877\nwould that affect the duration\nof this discovery process?\n\n239\n00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:32.227\nI'm assuming it would,\njust having to go ahead and check that.\n\n240\n00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:34.552\n&gt;&gt; It would take a little longer,\nabsolutely no doubt about it, it would.\n\n241\n00:11:34.552 --> 00:11:37.915\nBecause obviously we'd have to go in and\nfind information across different name\n\n242\n00:11:37.915 --> 00:11:40.370\nspaces, and so\nit may extend that time by a little bit.\n\n243\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.027\nHard to say how long, but it would.\n\n244\n00:11:42.027 --> 00:11:43.211\nTraditionally we'd say, yes.\n\n245\n00:11:43.211 --> 00:11:45.004\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It would definitely take longer than it\n\n246\n00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.622\nwould if we were just\nlooking at the root domain,\n\n247\n00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:48.171\nwhich is all we're gonna do here for\nour demo.\n\n248\n00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:51.525\nUR namespace in the demo environment\nis flat, we just have one domain.\n\n249\n00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:53.714\nOne forest, one tree,\none domain nothing complicated.\n\n250\n00:11:53.714 --> 00:11:57.806\nBut as I pointed out in the real world,\nit would certainly most likely be that we\n\n251\n00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:00.605\nwould see lots of domains or\nwe may have more than one.\n\n252\n00:12:00.605 --> 00:12:03.312\nSo Cherokee raises an excellent\npoint which is hey,\n\n253\n00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:06.642\njust know the more things you choose,\nyou wanna go out and find.\n\n254\n00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.162\nYou gotta allocate some time,\nthe longer it may take to do that, so\n\n255\n00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:09.842\njust be patient.\n\n256\n00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:12.733\nAll right, so we have all that, so\nwe have done that, we're gonna click OK.\n\n257\n00:12:14.077 --> 00:12:17.249\nNow again we're going to\ndomain selected one, so\n\n258\n00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:19.930\nwe could see we did now go in and do that.\n\n259\n00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.371\nWe're back in the IPAM window, so we've\ndone the first half here, steps one, two,\n\n260\n00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:24.999\nand three.\n\n261\n00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:27.922\nWe're now gonna move over here,\nStart server discovery.\n\n262\n00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:29.262\nCuz remember, up until now,\n\n263\n00:12:29.262 --> 00:12:32.159\nreally all we've been doing is\ndoing the administrative behind\n\n264\n00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.015\nthe scenes architecture,\nplumbing connectivity settings.\n\n265\n00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:37.615\nWe haven't really done anything yet\nthat actually goes out and\n\n266\n00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:39.000\nleverages these settings.\n\n267\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.225\nWe've just set them up and said,\nwell I'd like to go to this server.\n\n268\n00:12:42.225 --> 00:12:45.630\nI'd like to use this credential, I wanna\ngo ahead and I wanna use this database.\n\n269\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.500\nI wanna set up and configure discovery in\nthis far as with this domains, looking for\n\n270\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.780\nthese servers, so that when I do\nstuff I know what I'm gonna do.\n\n271\n00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.500\nWell now it's time to do stuff, so\n\n272\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.780\nnow we're gonna actually go off over here,\nStart server discovery.\n\n273\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.334\nAnd let's just go ahead just clear\nthis out of the way here real quick,\n\n274\n00:13:00.334 --> 00:13:01.864\njust get the little yellow bar out there.\n\n275\n00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.990\nBecause we already did the discovery,\nso we don't have to.\n\n276\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.812\nNow by the way just before I go\nthrough and do anything else here.\n\n277\n00:13:07.812 --> 00:13:11.882\nJust want you to see, let me just move\nthis over if I can grab the that's not\n\n278\n00:13:11.882 --> 00:13:13.679\nwhat I wanted, go back over here.\n\n279\n00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:16.440\nSee if I can grab the arrow and\nextend that, there we go.\n\n280\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.294\nLook just over here at all the stuff\nthat's popped in here as we've been\n\n281\n00:13:19.294 --> 00:13:20.400\nstarting to do something.\n\n282\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.406\nHaving really said, by they way,\nhey look at overview, but\n\n283\n00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:25.700\nnow with server inventory,\nIP address space.\n\n284\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.680\nRemember I mentioned we're gonna be able\nto see all these things once we actually\n\n285\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.910\nstart discovering.\n\n286\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.090\nThere's nothing populated yet.\n\n287\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.190\nI inadvertently clicked on,\nwhat you saw was blank.\n\n288\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.870\nCuz I haven't actually started discover\nyet, but you can see IP address inventory,\n\n289\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.363\nblocks, ranges, virtualized IP address\nspace and simpler connected, SCVMM.\n\n290\n00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.300\nWe talked about the fact that\nwe can integrate the two.\n\n291\n00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.570\nMonitor and manage our server,\nour scopes, our zones, our server groups.\n\n292\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.520\nThe event catalogue acts as control,\nthat's where our roles ar gonna be.\n\n293\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.772\nSo all the things that we talked\nabout that we have to have and\n\n294\n00:13:53.772 --> 00:13:54.773\nwe are gonna be able to do.\n\n295\n00:13:54.773 --> 00:13:58.240\nOnce we get our provision of the IPAM\nserver, all that stuff pops in here.\n\n296\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.412\nIt's all available to us,\nplus our server inventory.\n\n297\n00:14:00.412 --> 00:14:02.314\nSo let's just take a quick\nlook before we do anything.\n\n298\n00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:05.916\nYou'll see we will be able to go in,\nsee our server inventory here.\n\n299\n00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:09.130\nAgain, nothing there yet,\nwe'll obviously populate this.\n\n300\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.688\nWe'd have a view here, but you can see\nmanaged servers, unmanaged servers.\n\n301\n00:14:13.688 --> 00:14:17.635\nI know it's kind of hard to see at\nthe bottom, for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n302\n00:14:17.635 --> 00:14:19.580\nRemember we do have support for both.\n\n303\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.370\nWe do have our IP address space,\nkind of gives us little overview here.\n\n304\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.850\nWe have our address blocks.\n\n305\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.982\nIf you take a look down here at\nthe bottom, and by the way as you click on\n\n306\n00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:34.792\nsomething up here, if your picking\nup on the fact on the left.\n\n307\n00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:38.450\nAt the lower area, you kind of see the\ndetail of all the settings that we select\n\n308\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.890\nat the category up here in the workspace.\n\n309\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.214\nPublic address spaces, private address\nspaces, on mapped address spaces.\n\n310\n00:14:45.214 --> 00:14:49.257\nSo if we click here on public or whatever\nyou'll see that we don't have anything.\n\n311\n00:14:49.257 --> 00:14:54.207\nBut we can obviously drill through here\nfor IPv4 and IPv6 to see our global and\n\n312\n00:14:54.207 --> 00:14:56.307\nunmapped address spaces there.\n\n313\n00:14:56.307 --> 00:15:00.980\nIP address inventory,\nagain v4 and v6 support.\n\n314\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.850\nAddress ranges, so\nwe'd be able to see that here.\n\n315\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.150\nIf we have any virtualized IP address\nspaces and we're using our SCVMM time,\n\n316\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.730\nwe would see that information here.\n\n317\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.123\nWe have our Monitor and Manage area.\n\n318\n00:15:12.123 --> 00:15:16.509\nWe've got our sub areas for DHS and\nDHCP server, DHCP scope, DNS zones and\n\n319\n00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:18.890\nserver groups all listed here.\n\n320\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.350\nSo we would be able to see for\n\n321\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:25.660\nboth IPv4 and IPv6, our DNS and\nDHCP servers overall once they populate.\n\n322\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.889\nOur DHCP scopes would be listed here,\npublic and\n\n323\n00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:31.347\nprivate, for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n324\n00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:35.247\nDNS zones, same thing, IPv4,\naddress or rather reverse look up and\n\n325\n00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:38.380\nforward look up zones,\nyou'll see them there.\n\n326\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:44.360\nConditional forwarding if we're doing\nthat through the DNS interface we talked\n\n327\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.990\nabout and set up conditional forwarding,\ndid a walk through and a demo on that.\n\n328\n00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.424\nSo hopefully you remember what that is,\nand\n\n329\n00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:51.607\nthen you see how these things by\nthe way that don't look familiar.\n\n330\n00:15:51.607 --> 00:15:54.388\nYou don't remember what these terms mean,\nyou're not familiar with them,\n\n331\n00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:55.087\nhey, guess what?\n\n332\n00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:57.811\nYou got a great set up,\nso let's go back and\n\n333\n00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:01.837\ntake a look at on both IPv4,\nIPv6, as well as in DNS and DHCP.\n\n334\n00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:05.343\nWe've done extensive discussions\non all four of these topic areas\n\n335\n00:16:05.343 --> 00:16:08.050\nin prior episodes,\nprior to getting into IPAM.\n\n336\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.270\nAnd you can go back and\ntake a look at any of them, and\n\n337\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.310\njust get refresher as often as you need,\nto right?\n\n338\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.685\nSo that's just something to consider and\nthink about.\n\n339\n00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:18.065\nWe have server groups down here,\nas you can see.\n\n340\n00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.285\nSo we'll be able to see those.\n\n341\n00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:22.808\nWe have our event catalog, we'll just be\nable to see, essentially editing, editing?\n\n342\n00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:24.004\nAuditing, rather, our log entries, right.\n\n343\n00:16:24.004 --> 00:16:27.695\nSo all the events that are taking place,\nthat would all be here.\n\n344\n00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.575\nBut you'll see,\nwe can see DHTP configuration events,\n\n345\n00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:33.225\nIP address tracking by IP address.\n\n346\n00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:38.300\nDown there by client ID, by host name, by\nusername, so we can filter and drill down.\n\n347\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.330\nAgain, no data yet,\n\n348\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.740\nwe're going to obviously to be able to see\nthese things once we get done configuring.\n\n349\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.240\nAnd of course, access control.\n\n350\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.390\nThis is where we would see the roles that\nI showed you in the Word document that I\n\n351\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.870\nbroke out and created for you.\n\n352\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.670\nPrior episode, just to give you\nan overview as to what they are.\n\n353\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.380\nBut you could see our\nbuilt-in roles are here.\n\n354\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.380\nThese are the ones that I had\nspecified in the document.\n\n355\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.110\n&gt;&gt; And which one did you say I was,\nI was the, let's see-\n\n356\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.690\n&gt;&gt; You were the mistress of all,\n\n357\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.740\nyou were the queen of everything.\n\n358\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Administrator, okay cool, all right.\n\n359\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.672\n&gt;&gt; You are the overarching administrator.\n\n360\n00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Let's keep that in mind\nwhen we go to configure.\n\n361\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have access scopes,\nright, we have access policies.\n\n362\n00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.370\nIf we have any of those here, so\nwe have all of that up here, right?\n\n363\n00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.840\nAnd you'll notice, by the way,\nif I wanna add, since we're here,\n\n364\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.700\njust quickly show you.\n\n365\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.620\nIf I wanna go ahead and add a role, for\ninstance, we do have that task area.\n\n366\n00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.388\nYou may be familiar with this, if you\nuse the Windows Server Manager Console.\n\n367\n00:17:27.388 --> 00:17:29.730\nYou know how we always have that,\nonce we drill through and\n\n368\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.060\nstart using the interface to manage stuff.\n\n369\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.730\nWe do have this task area\nthat gives us tasks specific\n\n370\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.110\nto whatever we may be doing.\n\n371\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.650\nSo we do have the Add User Role capability\nhere, if we wanna add a role in.\n\n372\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.647\nPerhaps sub-divide a role, and\nbreak it out, and customize.\n\n373\n00:17:42.647 --> 00:17:45.490\nWe could go in, add a user role, specify.\n\n374\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.650\nYou'll see we have\nthe option to select here,\n\n375\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.800\nif I wanna give somebody\nDNS server operations.\n\n376\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.210\nBut I can specify that, right?\n\n377\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.500\nMaybe logical group operations.\n\n378\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.250\nBut maybe I don't want everything.\n\n379\n00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.677\nMaybe I just want to delete logical\ngroups, you get the idea, right?\n\n380\n00:18:03.677 --> 00:18:05.301\nThis would let us mix and match, or\n\n381\n00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:08.561\ncreate a custom roles from the ones\nthat are already built out for us.\n\n382\n00:18:08.561 --> 00:18:12.043\nSo we can create that, give it a name, and\nthen we would be able to have that role,\n\n383\n00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:13.100\nif we wanted to.\n\n384\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.821\nSo let's just say that we call this.\n\n385\n00:18:15.821 --> 00:18:23.100\nJust since we're doing this, I'll go ahead\nand do this, ITProTV Role 1 or something.\n\n386\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.505\nCaps Lock is on.\n\n387\n00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:26.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just thinking that the other day.\n\n388\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.920\nI got through and\nI was just not paying attention.\n\n389\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.950\nAnd then you look down and\nyou see this huge string.\n\n390\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.670\nAnd it's all backwards,\nif your Caps Lock is on.\n\n391\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:38.330\nThere should be a shortcut\nkey to reverse that.\n\n392\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.725\nWhy, why haven't they?\n\n393\n00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:42.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The burning eternal question of\n\n394\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.430\nour time.\n\n395\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.770\nAll right, So ITProTV Role 1.\n\n396\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.880\nYou'll see this just quickly,\nsince we're here talking about it.\n\n397\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.460\nJust showing you how you can create\na custom role, so you could see that.\n\n398\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.412\nBut of course, we're not gonna be able to\nutilize that until we actually go through,\n\n399\n00:18:53.412 --> 00:18:55.570\nand populate some more stuff,\nand do some discovery.\n\n400\n00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.930\nSo we're gonna go and\nkick off our discovery.\n\n401\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.170\nSo let's go in,\nlet's go back up here to our Overview.\n\n402\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.485\nJust come back to the top here,\ngo back to Overview.\n\n403\n00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:05.910\nAnd we'll be able to pick\nup where we left off.\n\n404\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.810\nStart Server Discovery,\nso let's click there.\n\n405\n00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.752\nAnd you'll see that that has started.\n\n406\n00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:13.840\nNow you'll see here, I just extended this.\n\n407\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.280\nLet me move this back the other way,\ncuz it's hard to see everything now.\n\n408\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.775\nYou do see a little blue line tracking\nacross there, so we know it's running.\n\n409\n00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:25.360\nBut what I was going to show you, if I\ncan catch that, move that, there we go.\n\n410\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:25.970\nThere are one or\n\n411\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.080\nmore IPAM tests running in the task\nscheduler, please wait for completion.\n\n412\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.310\nSo it's telling us it's doing something,\nI showed you how we could look at that.\n\n413\n00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.800\nGo here to more, and we could go in.\n\n414\n00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.680\nWe could take a look, and\nsee that it is running right up here,\n\n415\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.650\nIPAM server discovery task.\n\n416\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.700\nSo, we can see that is running,\nand see the status of it.\n\n417\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.890\nIt's gonna run, it's gonna take\na little bit to do the discovery.\n\n418\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.650\nSo, we're going to wait for\nit to do its discovery.\n\n419\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.080\nOnce we're done, we'll come on back.\n\n420\n00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.900\nAnd, we'll show you what\nhappens after that, okay?\n\n421\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n422\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.230\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n423\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.740\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n424\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.970\nBut, for this show,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign out.\n\n425\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.490\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n426\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n427\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.710\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here on ITProTV.\n\n428\n00:20:05.710 -->

00:00:11.689\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.333\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.810\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.020\nIn the previous episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.160\nAdam was performing a demonstration,\nwalking us through an IPM setup.\n\n8\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.850\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ncontinue to do so in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.570\nSo how are you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.940\nAre we ready to go here?\n\n11\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.000\n&gt;&gt; We are,\nwe finished our server discovery.\n\n12\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000\nWe'll take a look at what that\nlooks like here momentarily.\n\n13\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.787\nAnd we're about to jump in,\nor we will go in.\n\n14\n00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:38.630\nSelect or add our servers,\nmanage and verify IPM access.\n\n15\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.240\nWe'll see that we have\na little bit of an issue,\n\n16\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.160\nwe're gonna use PowerShell to\nhelp us fix that up right now.\n\n17\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.131\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:45.710\nWe'll talk about what's going on here.\n\n19\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.020\nSo we did finish up, and I left it up so\nwe can see discovered servers, right,\n\n20\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.300\nwere finally found.\n\n21\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.537\nTook, I don't know maybe, what seven,\neight, nine minutes, something like that,\n\n22\n00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:55.590\nten minutes to run.\n\n23\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.900\nSo we could go in,\nwe can as we did here, click.\n\n24\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.710\nYou see it did complete so we could\nsee information about that right here.\n\n25\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.910\nAnd I didn't show you last time but\njust so you know.\n\n26\n00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.000\nDown at the bottom here\nin the console window,\n\n27\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.840\nwe also can see our scheduled tasks.\n\n28\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.170\nAnd we can see that they're running,\nserver discovery was set up.\n\n29\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.850\nIt said running and\nnow it says ready cuz it's finished.\n\n30\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.189\nSo I can see this view in a couple of\ndifferent places depending on where I'm\n\n31\n00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:19.890\ngoing to look.\n\n32\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.340\nWe did talk about all those tasks when I\nwas doing the provisioning and I said,\n\n33\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.000\nhey look,\nthis is essentially what's gonna happen.\n\n34\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.940\nWe're gonna set up the server,\nwe'll put the database in.\n\n35\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.050\nWe'll do this, we'll do that and\n\n36\n00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.170\nthere's gonna be some scheduled tasks\nthat'll get configured and set up for us.\n\n37\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.300\nAnd you could see they're listed here.\n\n38\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.220\nSo if you wanted to see what they are,\n\n39\n00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.520\nyou can actually see them and\nsee the last time they ran right here.\n\n40\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.090\nAnd notice some of them have not run yet.\n\n41\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.280\nWe haven't done an audit for instance\nbecause we didn't have a reason to.\n\n42\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.430\nWe haven't found anything yet, so\n\n43\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.370\nit'd be hard to audit something we\ndon't even know that we have, right?\n\n44\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.510\nBut you could see all\nthe scheduled tasks right here, and\n\n45\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.780\nyou can see they're listed right down\nhere at the bottom of the console.\n\n46\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.760\nAll right, so we're back up here,\nselect or add service to manage and\n\n47\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.720\nverify IPM access, let's click here.\n\n48\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.520\nNow what we're gonna see, and\n\n49\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.630\nnotice all it did was just drop\nus down to server inventory.\n\n50\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.209\nWe could have come right here and\njust gone to server inventory.\n\n51\n00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.240\nBut you'll see that we do have\na recommended action here.\n\n52\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.103\nIt says, hey, set manageability\nstatus because IPM access status\n\n53\n00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:16.775\nis blocked on this server for\npracticelabs.com.\n\n54\n00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:18.622\nSo what we're saying is essentially, hey,\n\n55\n00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:21.425\nwe may have a issue that we just\nhave to go in, we have to address.\n\n56\n00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:24.345\nAnd so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go in and fix this.\n\n57\n00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:26.385\nWe're gonna use PowerShell to go in and\n\n58\n00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:30.455\ninvoke our IPM GPO provisioning and\nwe're gonna specify our domain.\n\n59\n00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:33.325\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nspecify our prefix name.\n\n60\n00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:38.776\nIf you remember, we configured that as\npart of our initial standup of the server,\n\n61\n00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:41.309\nthe plabs-ipam prefix for our GPOs.\n\n62\n00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:42.090\nAnd we're gonna step that up.\n\n63\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.170\nAnd we're gonna specify\nthe IPM server FQDN and\n\n64\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.050\nthe delegated.GPOuser administrator.\n\n65\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.589\nAnd I have all that just typed out already\nin Notepad just because I didn't want to\n\n66\n00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.805\nhave to type this all in on the console.\n\n67\n00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:57.560\nAnd subject you all to the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well thank you.\n\n68\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.636\n&gt;&gt; Insaneness of me typing, so\n\n69\n00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:04.570\nI'm just gonna do a Ctrl+A here to\nhighlight and a Ctrl+C to copy.\n\n70\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.460\nAnd you'll see that, and\nactually let me do this,\n\n71\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.400\nlet me just get rid of this little\nannoying copy box when we do that.\n\n72\n00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.390\nBut let me do this.\n\n73\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.098\nWhat I want to do.\n\n74\n00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:16.080\nI'm just gonna do it this way so\nyou can see, but\n\n75\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.420\nI don't want to get all the spaces at the\nend of that and have a bunch of spaces.\n\n76\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.144\nBut you can see, I'm basically just\ngonna use this PowerShell script.\n\n77\n00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:24.819\nI'm just gonna highlight\ngoing backwards here and\n\n78\n00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.010\ncopy just once we get\neverything without the spaces.\n\n79\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.374\nWe're gonna take a copy of that and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n80\n00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:33.570\nwe're gonna drop this in to PowerShell.\n\n81\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.897\nWe do have PowerShell\nopened up right here.\n\n82\n00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:37.674\nSo we'll just put that in right there.\n\n83\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.150\nAnd you can see we're using\nthe Invoke-IpamGpoProvisioning cmdlet.\n\n84\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.530\nSpecify the domain names,\nspecify the GPO prefix,\n\n85\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.830\nand it all kinda wraps around there but\nit's plabs-ipam.\n\n86\n00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.916\nAnd then.\n\n87\n00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.883\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe're sure that's the name of the server?\n\n88\n00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:56.515\nThe IPAM server.\n\n89\n00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:59.900\n&gt;&gt; We're sure of nothing, but we're\nassuming that's the name and if it's not.\n\n90\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.540\n&gt;&gt; We're hoping.\n&gt;&gt; Well, then you'll be patient and\n\n91\n00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.360\nwait for me to fix it.\n\n92\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.190\nThat's just the way it's gonna be.\n\n93\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.430\nDon't be harshing my\nmellow here with IPAM,\n\n94\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.280\ncome on have a little faith, will you?\n\n95\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.129\nI've done this at least\nhalf a time before, right.\n\n96\n00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It should work.\n\n97\n00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:12.840\nAll right, so we do have all that.\n\n98\n00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.630\nYes, we are sure that is the name.\n\n99\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.105\nAnd we do have IPAM server FTDN.\n\n100\n00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:20.430\nWe're specifying, as you could see here,\nthe FQDN of the machine,\n\n101\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.690\nthe IPM server that's the plab,\nDM01 machine that we're on right here.\n\n102\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.380\nAnd then the delegated GPO user for\nadministrator, right.\n\n103\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.180\nSo we're gonna go ahead, gonna hit that.\n\n104\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.730\nWe'll give that just\na second to go do its thing.\n\n105\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.928\nAnd you'll see it comes up, prompts us and\nsays, hey, we're gonna go in.\n\n106\n00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:42.528\nAnd while we're about to do this,\nit says the invoke cmdlet creates and\n\n107\n00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:45.888\nlinks three GPL objects,\nthe ones we were talking about, right.\n\n108\n00:04:45.888 --> 00:04:49.327\nAnd the domain indicated by the domain\nparameter, for provisioning,\n\n109\n00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:50.565\naccess settings, etc.\n\n110\n00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:55.455\nCmdlet also modifies the domain wide DNS\nACL to enable us to then be able to grant\n\n111\n00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.770\naccess to the IPAM server so\nwe can get access to this information.\n\n112\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.590\nThis is the part that is giving us\nthe little, hey, required action,\n\n113\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.660\ndo something prompt in the console.\n\n114\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.854\nCuz we haven't specified\nthat we have access and\n\n115\n00:05:05.854 --> 00:05:07.631\nrights to all the DNS information yet.\n\n116\n00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:10.990\nThis cmdlet's gonna help us to do this and\nset this up.\n\n117\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.790\nSo it's saying the value of the GPO prefix\nname here must be the same as the one\n\n118\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.380\nprovided by the IPM provisioning\nwizard when selecting the option for\n\n119\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.550\ngroup policy-based provision.\n\n120\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.560\nRemember, I did that.\n\n121\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.580\nThat’s the thing that\nCherokee was referring to.\n\n122\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.760\nShe said, hey, are you sure?\n\n123\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.110\nYou wrote that in and\nthat’s what you did in the console.\n\n124\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.835\nPlabs-, I know its kind of cut off up\nthere cuz it kind of scrolls over but,\n\n125\n00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:31.350\nplabs-ipam.\n\n126\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.923\nThat information is what\nwe're talking about.\n\n127\n00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:36.643\nThat has to be the same, that's what\nCherokee was reminding me to make sure\n\n128\n00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:38.665\nthat I had actually typed in correctly.\n\n129\n00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:41.365\nAnd that we do know that\nthat is consistent, right?\n\n130\n00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:43.164\nSo, faith, faith, right, faith?\n\n131\n00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:44.689\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, good,\n\n132\n00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:45.795\nso we're gonna do this.\n\n133\n00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:49.665\nAll right, so it's asking us there, hey,\nare we sure, do you wanna provide or\n\n134\n00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.095\nrather do you wanna perform this action?\n\n135\n00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:52.375\nWell, of course we do, right?\n\n136\n00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.140\nSo let's hit Yes there.\n\n137\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.096\nLet's go give it its thing.\n\n138\n00:05:55.096 --> 00:06:01.464\nProvisioning IPAM, validating parameters,\ncreating GPOs, importing GPOs.\n\n139\n00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:03.548\nIt'd be great if this talked to you,\nright?\n\n140\n00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:05.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am now importing GPOs,\n\n141\n00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:07.370\nplease wait while I do that.\n\n142\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.260\nAnd then it was linking,\nand boom, it's done.\n\n143\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.575\nAnd so, by the way, ha.\n\n144\n00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:12.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay cuz it works.\n\n145\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Good job, Adam.\n\n146\n00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.470\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nyou have no faith in me, none.\n\n147\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.930\nYou should've seen her before we came one,\nshe was like are you sure,\n\n148\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.945\nare you positive, did you get it,\ndo you know what it is?\n\n149\n00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:24.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I couldn't remember\nwhat [CROSSTALK] means.\n\n150\n00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.250\nIt's from the previous episodes so\nI didn't know if you could remember too.\n\n151\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.545\nI'm like what did you name it?\n\n152\n00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:30.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not right, it's not gonna work.\n\n153\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.458\nI said,\ndon't worry it's gonna work, right?\n\n154\n00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:36.080\nI should have typed it wrong just\non purpose just to freak her out.\n\n155\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.350\nAll right, so you could see here\nthat went through no problem.\n\n156\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.026\nRight, and so now it says, hey, by the\nway, group policy requires each computer\n\n157\n00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.317\nhad to have permissions to\nread GPO data In order for\n\n158\n00:06:44.317 --> 00:06:45.779\nus to be able to do this, right.\n\n159\n00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:47.420\nFor more information please see.\n\n160\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.370\nSo gives us a little link, tells us\nwhat's going on about that, that's nice.\n\n161\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.970\nBy the way, none of that stuff's\nrelated to this question right here.\n\n162\n00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.280\nIt says, hey do you wanna continue,\nmeaning,\n\n163\n00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.340\nis there something else you want to do,\nright?\n\n164\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.070\nWell, yeah, no, I don't have anything\nelse I want to do or any of the policies.\n\n165\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.840\nSo I'm just gonna click No,\nand we're good right?\n\n166\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.500\nThat's it.\n\n167\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.660\nSo we went ahead and we did that.\n\n168\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.195\nAnd so just make sure.\n\n169\n00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.510\nTry that one more time.\n\n170\n00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.490\nOkay, yeah,\nyeah just make sure it actually did that.\n\n171\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.340\nAll right, good,\nall right, so we are good.\n\n172\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.380\nAll right, so\nwe're just gonna minimize there.\n\n173\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:27.431\nAll right, so [COUGH] once we have\ndone that, we've set that up.\n\n174\n00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.583\nAnd we've been able to go in and\nconfigure all that.\n\n175\n00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.891\nWhat we're going to do\nnow is go do a gpupdate.\n\n176\n00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:36.273\nAnd we're gonna go in and force\nan update of the group policies, right.\n\n177\n00:07:36.273 --> 00:07:38.540\nSo you could see nothing's changed yet.\n\n178\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.961\nSo we're gonna go in,\ngo back to Powershell here.\n\n179\n00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:45.473\nAnd let's do the following.\n\n180\n00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:52.152\nLet me do this, just let me clear\nthe screen out here real quick.\n\n181\n00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:54.198\nJust give us a little room\njust to be able to work with.\n\n182\n00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:58.016\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do,\nactually you know what I'm gonna do is we\n\n183\n00:07:58.016 --> 00:08:01.460\ngot that crazy Information down at\nthe bottom of the PowerShell window.\n\n184\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.640\nAgain, that happens sometimes,\nit just didn't clear itself.\n\n185\n00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.160\nSo let me just come in here, just open\nPowerShell back up just to make sure that\n\n186\n00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.910\nit is clear of any remnants of\nthe commands, things like that.\n\n187\n00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.270\nSometimes you get some\ncrazy things that happen.\n\n188\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.120\nLet me just extend the console back out so\nyou guys can see it and\n\n189\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.450\nmake it a little bit easier for\nyou to read what we're doing.\n\n190\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.572\nWe're just gonna do a gpupdate /force,\nnothing too crazy, but\n\n191\n00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:24.570\njust this way you can actually see it.\n\n192\n00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.714\nIt's nice and clean, got no issues there.\n\n193\n00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:29.897\nAll right so, let's make sure we\nspell gpupdate correctly this time,\n\n194\n00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:33.468\nbecause you know, last time I did\nupdate or something crazy like that.\n\n195\n00:08:33.468 --> 00:08:39.597\nAll right, so gpupdate /force, just do\nan update on the policy here real quick.\n\n196\n00:08:39.597 --> 00:08:43.020\nAll right, so we should get that going,\nit shouldn't take too long.\n\n197\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.009\nAnd once we have that up and running.\n\n198\n00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:51.204\nOkay, so we've got that.\n\n199\n00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:52.110\nAll right, good.\n\n200\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.876\nSo now we're gonna come back in here.\n\n201\n00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:56.409\nNow what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n202\n00:08:56.409 --> 00:09:01.159\nWe're gonna go in, and\nI'm gonna close this Server Manager out.\n\n203\n00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:05.880\nI'm just gonna reopen it, right,\njust to get that up and running again.\n\n204\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.510\nSo let's just go ahead.\n\n205\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.120\nJust go here,\nlet's go back to Server Manager.\n\n206\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.425\nJust do a quick refresh on it,\nbring it back up again.\n\n207\n00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:17.184\nLet it find all the stuff\nwe have going on there.\n\n208\n00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:18.890\nGive it just a minute.\n\n209\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.110\nThere is our ipen right there so\nlet's just click back in there.\n\n210\n00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.537\nGo back in on our Overview there.\n\n211\n00:09:25.537 --> 00:09:28.176\nAll right, so we'll go back\nover here to server inventory.\n\n212\n00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:29.021\nAll right, so\n\n213\n00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:33.388\nnow what we're going to do is got our\nIPv4 window opened up right there and\n\n214\n00:09:33.388 --> 00:09:38.495\nwe're gonna right click and we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna do the following.\n\n215\n00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.080\nAnd do Edit Server,\nright here on our little, hey,\n\n216\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.470\nyou should pay attention and do something.\n\n217\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.835\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo an Edit Server.\n\n218\n00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.513\nNow what we're gonna do,\nlet me just bring this over here actually,\n\n219\n00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:50.370\nyou know what I'm gonna\nmake this full screen.\n\n220\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.970\nA little bit easier for you to see.\n\n221\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.640\nAnd you should other than the OK button at\nthe bottom which really isn't probably all\n\n222\n00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.040\nthat big of a deal for the moment,\nyou're seeing everything on the screen so\n\n223\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.330\nyou are not missing anything.\n\n224\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.420\nSo now what we're gonna do is just take\na look at some of the configuration\n\n225\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.820\ninformation in here.\n\n226\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.430\nSo what we're gonna do is go in and\n\n227\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.750\nwe're gonna add our editor\non the add edit server.\n\n228\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.970\nWe're gonna go in, we're gonna\nsee our server type right here.\n\n229\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.100\nYou can see DC, DNS, DHCP, server, right?\n\n230\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.240\nAnd, making sure we\nhave all those enabled.\n\n231\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.870\nAnd we know they're enabled,\nwe checked this before and\n\n232\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.550\nwe know we have them set up,\nwhen we did our discovery.\n\n233\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.220\nWe're just checking to make sure\neverything is set up the right way.\n\n234\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.860\nYou'll see here,\nunder Manageability Status, all right?\n\n235\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.980\nRight now, it's unspecified.\n\n236\n00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.940\nWe're gonna change that\nout in just a minute.\n\n237\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.220\nBut notice that, if we had to,\n\n238\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.914\nwe could add the Network Policy Server\nin here, NPS.\n\n239\n00:10:36.914 --> 00:10:40.540\nNetwork Policy Server,\nthat maybe important at some point.\n\n240\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.794\nSo unspecified, we're gonna choose here,\n\n241\n00:10:42.794 --> 00:10:45.299\nchange this to manageability\nstatus to managed.\n\n242\n00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:48.939\nSo we're gonna come in here, specify\nthat to Managed, we're gonna press OK.\n\n243\n00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:53.255\nAnd we're gonna come back here and we're\ngonna refresh our server access status and\n\n244\n00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.360\nget that to change.\n\n245\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.745\nSo I'm gonna click OK,\nagain the bottom button is just,\n\n246\n00:10:56.745 --> 00:10:59.838\nrather the button is right below me here,\nyou're not missing anything.\n\n247\n00:10:59.838 --> 00:11:02.890\nYou don't need to see, you know what an OK\nbutton looks like in other words, right?\n\n248\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.700\nI'm just clicking OK at\nlower right hand corner.\n\n249\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.370\nClick OK, give that just a second and\nupdating the IPM GPO failed, awesome.\n\n250\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.010\nOkay, so that is actually a problem,\nso let's see.\n\n251\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:15.874\nSo it looks like, and\n\n252\n00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:18.706\nlet's just read what's going on cuz\nnormally we should not get that.\n\n253\n00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:22.510\nWe should just actually have\nour policy being applied.\n\n254\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.900\nBut on occasion, things go wrong,\nand you never know.\n\n255\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.102\nBut, we're gonna read our error code,\n\n256\n00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.580\nwe're gonna find out what\nactually happened here.\n\n257\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.962\nSo, automated deployment settings\nin failed the following error,\n\n258\n00:11:30.962 --> 00:11:31.960\nattempt to modify.\n\n259\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.469\nFor server failed,\nensure you IPAM, GPOs exist and\n\n260\n00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:39.242\nIPAM service computer access\nhas permissions to edit.\n\n261\n00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:41.975\nAll right, so looks like either\nwe have a permission problem,\n\n262\n00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:47.760\nand/or that our GPOs may not\nhave been provisioned properly.\n\n263\n00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.100\nIt looked like PowerShell was acting\na little funny when I went to say no and\n\n264\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.056\nremember it kind of repeated,\ndidn't kick out of the console.\n\n265\n00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:57.680\nPowerShell may have not actually finalized\neven though it did come back and\n\n266\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.250\nkind of say it looked like it worked.\n\n267\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.860\nIt may actually have given us a problem,\ncuz it does look like it did.\n\n268\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.813\nSo let's retry.\n\n269\n00:12:03.813 --> 00:12:06.552\nAll right, so\nit doesn't look like it's finding it.\n\n270\n00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:11.110\nYou can see now that it is on\nfrom warning to actually failure.\n\n271\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.648\nSo we may have to restart our domain\ncontroller to fix this problem and\n\n272\n00:12:13.648 --> 00:12:15.030\nsee if the policies are there.\n\n273\n00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.643\nBut perhaps they're just not registering,\nbecause remember,\n\n274\n00:12:17.643 --> 00:12:20.254\nwe did do the policies that looked\nlike the wizard in PowerShell,\n\n275\n00:12:20.254 --> 00:12:22.360\nnot the wizard rather,\nthe PowerShell script ran.\n\n276\n00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.396\nLooked liked everything was successful,\ndidn't come back and\n\n277\n00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:28.270\ngive us any errors and\nit looked like it had completed.\n\n278\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.290\nBut even though we did the gpupdate\n/force, maybe the policies for\n\n279\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.980\nsome reason were not applied properly.\n\n280\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.012\nSo what we're gonna do\nis just take a moment.\n\n281\n00:12:35.012 --> 00:12:37.050\nI'm gonna restart both machines,\n\n282\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.465\nbring them back up,\nlet them talk to each other for a minute.\n\n283\n00:12:39.465 --> 00:12:41.292\nWe'll verify that this is working.\n\n284\n00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:43.780\nIf it's nothing more than just\na communication problem or\n\n285\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.730\nthe policy is just not setting up\nproperly at the domain controller and\n\n286\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.360\nreplicating and\ntherefore forcing the update here.\n\n287\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.100\nMay not have pulled them down\nbecause maybe they were in flux.\n\n288\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.230\nWe'll be able to fix that with\na restart with no problem.\n\n289\n00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.010\nIf it's something more involved,\nthen we'll dig into it and figure out what\n\n290\n00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.090\nthe troubleshooting issues are that\nwe'll address and walk through that.\n\n291\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.630\nBut let me go ahead and restart.\n\n292\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.800\nSo we're gonna ask you to be\npatient here for just a minute.\n\n293\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.550\nYou're not gonna wanna\nwatch me restart these.\n\n294\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.238\nSo I'm gonna restart them, we're gonna\ncome back with them up and running and\n\n295\n00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:10.757\nhopefully having this already worked out.\n\n296\n00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.459\nAnd we'll see you in just\na moment while we do that.\n\n297\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.550\nAll right, so look, we fixed our problem.\n\n298\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.980\nLet me explain what went wrong here.\n\n299\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.420\nThis is something that does happens\nsometimes in the real world.\n\n300\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.042\nBut you could see, just as I could\nrender to show you what's going on.\n\n301\n00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:26.559\nThis was successful in the interim just\nwhile we said, hey, let's take a break for\n\n302\n00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.500\njust a quick second.\n\n303\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.450\nLet me figure out what's\ngoing on with that error and\n\n304\n00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.140\nI told you I was gonna restart\nboth machines and I did.\n\n305\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.610\nWhat I actually did was I thought\nbetter than that, and I shut them down.\n\n306\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.100\nNow, let me explain the difference.\n\n307\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.790\nIf the error is in memory and\n\n308\n00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.110\nyou restart you're not necessarily\nguaranteed you're gonna clear the error.\n\n309\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.660\nWhereas if you shut down the machine,\nI understand in the real world\n\n310\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.130\nI'm gonna be able to just shut\na production server off so easily.\n\n311\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.681\nBut if you've gotta restart it\nyou might as well shut it down.\n\n312\n00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:50.390\nSo it doesn't really matter.\n\n313\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.180\nSo either way, but\nwhat I did is I shut them down,\n\n314\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.260\njust to clear whatever was\ngoing on in memory with them.\n\n315\n00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.564\nBut I think what the problem was,\nbecause you can see now clearly,\n\n316\n00:13:59.564 --> 00:14:03.399\nthe minute I did that, brought these\nback up, brought backup the IPM panel,\n\n317\n00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:06.547\njust went in, right clicked and\nwent ahead and tried it again.\n\n318\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:10.136\nIt came up, within about 30 seconds and\nwent green.\n\n319\n00:14:10.136 --> 00:14:13.070\nWhat I think the problem was,\nwas the following.\n\n320\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.910\nAnd let me show you here.\n\n321\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.780\nSo when we go into our domain controller,\n\n322\n00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.490\nwe're on our domain controller where our\ngroup policies would have been created and\n\n323\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.670\nindeed they are cuz we know\nthat they were created.\n\n324\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.820\nWe could see them here, by the way.\n\n325\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.730\nSo welcome to group policy wizard.\n\n326\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.760\nWasn't supposed to be part of the demo but\nyou know what?\n\n327\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.287\nWe're gonna show you\nwhere they are anyway.\n\n328\n00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:35.209\nSo you could see our group policies that\nwe were talking about through PowerShell\n\n329\n00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:36.760\nwhen we ran that script.\n\n330\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.030\nActually, R stood up and configured\nhere and what happens sometimes and\n\n331\n00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.660\nmost likely what happened\nhere is a timing issue.\n\n332\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.370\nSequencing and\n\n333\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.170\ntiming is everything in life, and the\nerror indicated that the group policies\n\n334\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.970\nwere either not available and/or\nwe didn't have permission.\n\n335\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.060\nNow I know it wasn't a permission issue\neven though it says, hey, maybe it was.\n\n336\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.250\nWe're logged on as a domain admin,\nwe're on a domain joined machine.\n\n337\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.917\nThere's no way it was a permission\nissue so we can safely eliminate that.\n\n338\n00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.490\nEven though it's a possibility,\nwe can safely eliminate that.\n\n339\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.150\nNo reason to even go think about\ntroubleshooting that because\n\n340\n00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.800\nwe're not using an aliased account.\n\n341\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.210\nWe're not using an account\nthat won't have admin rights,\n\n342\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.100\ncuz we're logged on as a domain admin.\n\n343\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.030\nIf that account failed, we don't have\nrights, we have bigger issues, right?\n\n344\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.280\nSo we know for\na fact that wasn't the issue.\n\n345\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.300\nBut the other thing that that error code\ntold us or that screen told us was hey,\n\n346\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.900\nmaybe it's group policy issue.\n\n347\n00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.050\nMaybe the policies are not there or\nmaybe there was an error creating them.\n\n348\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.770\nWell, I was pretty confident there\nwasn't an error creating them, but\n\n349\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.320\nI was not 100% confident that\nthey actually were there.\n\n350\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.240\nAnd what I mean by that is they\nwere created because I know that\n\n351\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.440\nPowerShell would have come back and\nyelled at me and\n\n352\n00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.840\nsaid, I had an error trying to get\nin there and write those policies.\n\n353\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.473\nThat's yet another reason why I know by\nthe way that it wasn't a permission issue\n\n354\n00:15:45.473 --> 00:15:47.137\nand it wasn't a user account issue.\n\n355\n00:15:47.137 --> 00:15:50.594\nPowerShell would have thrown an exception\nand said, I tried to do this and\n\n356\n00:15:50.594 --> 00:15:54.272\nI couldn't do it, because the permission\nyou told me you were giving me to do it\n\n357\n00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:55.306\nwas not sufficient.\n\n358\n00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:56.036\nIn other words,\n\n359\n00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:59.435\nwould have seen that angry red script\non the screen saying there's an error.\n\n360\n00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:02.090\nYou're familiar with that,\nevery time I type something we get that,\n\n361\n00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.126\ncuz I can't type, right?\n\n362\n00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:04.620\nSo you always see that.\n\n363\n00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.422\nBut I know for\na fact it didn't happen here.\n\n364\n00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:10.452\nAnd as a result of that I was a 100%\nsure no permission issue, and\n\n365\n00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:14.078\nI was a 100% sure those group\npolicies had been created.\n\n366\n00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:15.761\nI didn't even need to go look, but\n\n367\n00:16:15.761 --> 00:16:19.603\nwhat I wasn't 100% sure of was whether\nthey were finished being created.\n\n368\n00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:24.289\nStood up and referenced within the 10\nseconds, 20 seconds, a minute whatever it\n\n369\n00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:27.930\nwas that it took us to get out of\nPower Shell, go do our refresh, and\n\n370\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.855\nthen load them up, and try to see and\nreference them from the IPAM tool.\n\n371\n00:16:31.855 --> 00:16:34.694\nAnd it turns out I was actually\nright when I was thinking,\n\n372\n00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:38.730\nmaybe we didn't give it enough time, maybe\nit just needed an extra minute or so.\n\n373\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.840\nAnd even though I hit retry, and\neven though I was asking it to, for\n\n374\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.240\nsome reason even though\nthe policies were there,\n\n375\n00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.990\nit just wasn't registering\nthat they were there.\n\n376\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.610\nSo that can happen sometimes,\nnot a big deal.\n\n377\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.070\nEasy to fix.\n\n378\n00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.890\nIn our world, all I did, as I said,\nI didn't do anything crazy,\n\n379\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.050\nno magic voodoo behind the scenes\nwhen you weren't looking, right?\n\n380\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.430\nTotal transparency here.\n\n381\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.340\nAll I did was just shutdown both machines,\ntook a moment or\n\n382\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.390\ntwo to bring them back up.\n\n383\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.450\nJust went ahead and restart them,\nlogged back in, that's all I did.\n\n384\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.540\nDidn't even do anything other\nthan just open the console and\n\n385\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.345\nsaw that those policies are there.\n\n386\n00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:13.740\nOpen the other system, went in, and\nI'll show you what I did on IPAM,\n\n387\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.080\njust to make sure we know.\n\n388\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.660\nSo all I did was do this here.\n\n389\n00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.450\nAll I did over here was come over here.\n\n390\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.750\nThis was still red at that point,\nlike you saw it before.\n\n391\n00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.240\nAll I did was right click here.\n\n392\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.650\nAnd all I did was Refresh Access\nServer Status one more time.\n\n393\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.900\nAnd within 30 seconds, the task ran.\n\n394\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.020\nAnd it came up and it's fine.\n\n395\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.955\nSo it was just a timing issue,\nreally nothing more than that.\n\n396\n00:17:32.955 --> 00:17:34.800\nAnd that's good that it happened, right?\n\n397\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.320\nWe don't wanna avoid those errors.\n\n398\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.538\nWe don't wanna pretend like nothing\nnever goes wrong in the real world.\n\n399\n00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:40.640\nStuff doesn't work and break all the time.\n\n400\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.000\n&gt;&gt; That would be horrible if someone just\nthought that it worked perfectly for\n\n401\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.918\neveryone, and they were the only\none that things broke for.\n\n402\n00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:46.321\n&gt;&gt; Well, only for me actually.\n\n403\n00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I knew how to type it\n\n404\n00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:49.530\nwould probably work better.\n\n405\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.720\nBut this time it wasn't me.\n\n406\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.140\nI actually was not at fault here.\n\n407\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.000\nYou saw it worked the right way, so\nyeah, but look this stuff does happen.\n\n408\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.530\nWe joke around about it,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n409\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.930\nBut sometimes those errors can\nactually be very problematic.\n\n410\n00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.829\nThey can be detrimental to your ability\nto be able to manage the system, and\n\n411\n00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:05.725\nthere are significant\nthings that can go wrong.\n\n412\n00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:07.752\nThis one thankfully no big deal.\n\n413\n00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:09.030\n&gt;&gt; It's a learning experience.\n\n414\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.770\n&gt;&gt; It is a learning experience.\n\n415\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.395\nSo it's absolute good for you to see that,\n\n416\n00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:14.430\nbecause when it happens to you in\nthe real world then it may, right?\n\n417\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.530\nAnd if it does, hey now you know that\nit's not the biggest deal in the world.\n\n418\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.230\nJust go fix it, not a problem.\n\n419\n00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.330\nHappens to us.\n\n420\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.470\nIt can happen to you.\n\n421\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.814\nIt never happens to Cherokee,\nbut it happens to me.\n\n422\n00:18:22.814 --> 00:18:25.276\nBut only when I'm with her,\nthat's the thing, right?\n\n423\n00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:27.710\nAll right, so we have that going on.\n\n424\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.360\nSo we're done, so let's go backup here.\n\n425\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.520\nWe did step five now.\n\n426\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.010\nWe actually got that running.\n\n427\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.260\nWe're actually able to see stuff,\nso let's go back here.\n\n428\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.266\nWe still have one more\nstop on our journey here.\n\n429\n00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:39.445\nRetrieve data from managed servers,\nall this stuff up until now.\n\n430\n00:18:39.445 --> 00:18:42.441\nAll we've done is just set up everything,\nsay I wanna get this,\n\n431\n00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:45.936\nI wanna get it from over here, wanna go\nout and talk to, wanna make sure I can\n\n432\n00:18:45.936 --> 00:18:49.240\naccess it, wanna make sure it's set up,\nwanna make sure I can see it.\n\n433\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.650\nBut we haven't actually\ngotten any data yet.\n\n434\n00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.420\nThis is gonna be the next step\nthat we're gonna go through here,\n\n435\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.970\nand we're gonna actually go in.\n\n436\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.970\nAnd we're gonna make sure\nthat we can now go in,\n\n437\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.490\nand we can actually retrieve our data.\n\n438\n00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.901\nSo we're gonna go through here,\ngo to step 6.\n\n439\n00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:08.836\nAnd what we're gonna do is the following,\nlet me just make sure, that's all good,\n\n440\n00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:11.020\nthat's all good,\nthat's all good, yup step 6.\n\n441\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.166\nJust following along in my notes here,\njust making sure I didn't miss anything\n\n442\n00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:14.426\nelse I wanna to talk about\nwith you real quick.\n\n443\n00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:17.111\nWe got all that,\nwe got all that, all right good.\n\n444\n00:19:17.111 --> 00:19:22.950\nSo we're gonna go a head and\nwe are going to do the following.\n\n445\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.714\nLet's click right here.\n\n446\n00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:27.281\nAll right, yeah.\n\n447\n00:19:27.281 --> 00:19:29.980\nSo let's click here.\n\n448\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.440\nThere are one or more IPAM tasks running.\n\n449\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.860\nYou know we're commonly seeing this now.\n\n450\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.520\nYou know it's running the task.\n\n451\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.550\nYou guys know the drill, we come over\nhere, go more, we can take a look.\n\n452\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.450\nAnd when it says more than one, you could\nsee there are a lot of tasks running.\n\n453\n00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.020\nBut notice that they completed\npretty quickly here, right?\n\n454\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.170\nDNS server configuration,\ngo in, audit test scripts.\n\n455\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.490\nIt's gonna grab all that data,\nshow it to us.\n\n456\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.890\nSo it's done all that.\n\n457\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.789\nLet's go in here.\nLet's see now that we do have an IPO.\n\n458\n00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:59.920\nLet me probably move this out\na little bit, probably be better for\n\n459\n00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.902\nyou just to know whats there.\n\n460\n00:20:00.902 --> 00:20:03.843\nIf I can catch that, right?\n\n461\n00:20:03.843 --> 00:20:06.906\nIt's always hard to,\nall right there we go, just so\n\n462\n00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:09.493\nyou can kinda see what's\ngoing on in there.\n\n463\n00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:11.610\nSo when I click on something,\nI know what it is.\n\n464\n00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.150\nSo IP address box, right?\n\n465\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.820\nYou'll see now we actually\nhave some information.\n\n466\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.710\nRemember we went through here before, and\nwe were looking, we didn't see anything.\n\n467\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.240\nIt was a whole lot of nothing in there,\nright?\n\n468\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.270\nBecause whenever we looked,\nwe didn't see it.\n\n469\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.085\nBut now that we've stood this up,\nset everything up, set it all, and\n\n470\n00:20:24.085 --> 00:20:27.258\nconfigured it all, you can see that we\nactually now have information in here.\n\n471\n00:20:27.258 --> 00:20:29.137\nSo we have an address block in here.\n\n472\n00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:33.204\nWe have IP address information\nthrough our block for IPv4.\n\n473\n00:20:33.204 --> 00:20:39.145\nWe can go in, and we see that we\nhave our DHCP and DNS servers.\n\n474\n00:20:39.145 --> 00:20:41.155\nOne of each,\nwell it's essentially the same machine,\n\n475\n00:20:41.155 --> 00:20:44.060\nbut you know that we have the services\nrunning, so we can see them there.\n\n476\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.760\nThey are on the same machine,\nyou can see that, but\n\n477\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.770\nyou could see that we do see that.\n\n478\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.160\nOur DHCP scope,\nyou can see we do have that there.\n\n479\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.670\nOur DNS zone or zones, there's two,\nwe could see them there.\n\n480\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.920\nAnd you could see that we have\naccess to that information.\n\n481\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.150\nWe have our event catalog,\ngot some stuff going on in there, so\n\n482\n00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.350\nit shows us that we've doing some things.\n\n483\n00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.920\nSo you could see that we're now\nstarting to get information coming in,\n\n484\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.610\nand we're actually able now to start\nconsuming information within IPAM,\n\n485\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.300\nwe do have a basic information there.\n\n486\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.785\nWe went ahead and we took a look,\nwe can see that we do have the properties.\n\n487\n00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:22.860\nLet's go back and take a look at,\nlet's say the zones right here for\n\n488\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.658\ninstance just hypothetically.\n\n489\n00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:27.370\nAnd you go down here we\ndo have a detailed view,\n\n490\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.490\nlet us just take a look at what\nzone we are going to look at.\n\n491\n00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.907\nLet us do the practicelabs.com on.\n\n492\n00:21:30.907 --> 00:21:32.638\nMaybe full screen for\nthis would be a good idea, so\n\n493\n00:21:32.638 --> 00:21:34.135\nyou could see all\nthe detail at the bottom.\n\n494\n00:21:34.135 --> 00:21:38.580\nBut you could see as we go down that\nwe have detailed information here.\n\n495\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.310\nLet's go down and take a look.\n\n496\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.770\nAnd we can see that we have our\nzone properties, practicelabs.com.\n\n497\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.270\nZone status okay, that's good to know.\n\n498\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.610\nDuration and current state,\n\n499\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.670\nwhether it's how long has it been\nin the current state of being okay.\n\n500\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.290\nYou can see time there.\n\n501\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.190\nWe do have our preferred DNS servers,\nour information,\n\n502\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.260\ndynamic update settings secure, right?\n\n503\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.300\nAre we scavenging?\n\n504\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.710\nCurrently no scavenging set up.\n\n505\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:02.470\nIs it assigned?\n\n506\n00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.570\nRemember we did that whole DNSSEC\ndiscussion around signing our zone.\n\n507\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.150\nIs it signed?\n\n508\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.680\nNo, we could tell the status of that.\n\n509\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.660\nWe have all that information here.\n\n510\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.610\nWe can go and look at our authoritative\nservers, and we can see which servers\n\n511\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.890\nare authoritative,\nsee their status right here.\n\n512\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:17.650\nThey are running, right?\n\n513\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.850\nWe can see all of that information\nright here by looking at the detail.\n\n514\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.350\nIf we go into our DHCP scope,\nlet's just kinda drill down,\n\n515\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.620\ntake a look a little bit here.\n\n516\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.690\nGot some additional information\nin the detailed view here.\n\n517\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.680\nAgain, Scope Properties, so\nwe've got the scope name.\n\n518\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.390\nScroll down so\nwe can kinda see everything in there.\n\n519\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.100\nI've got a server name, got our server\nIP's start and end address for the scope.\n\n520\n00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.770\nYou could see that there.\n\n521\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.628\nWe have our percent utilized, so\nwe're using 30% of our scope,\n\n522\n00:22:45.628 --> 00:22:50.383\na very small scope only 200 to 209, so\njust for demo purposes, not very big.\n\n523\n00:22:50.383 --> 00:22:54.062\nBut you'll see its status active,\ndefault class C or\n\n524\n00:22:54.062 --> 00:22:57.844\nslash 24 subnet mask,\nno delay specified, right?\n\n525\n00:22:57.844 --> 00:23:01.973\nSo we can see here, that we have our\nprefix length, our policy activation\n\n526\n00:23:01.973 --> 00:23:06.578\nstatus, dynamic updates are supported,\nall the detailed information we need.\n\n527\n00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:09.800\nWe also can take a look\nat our scope options.\n\n528\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.557\nWe see what options we've assigned here.\n\n529\n00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:15.688\nWe talked about the value of an importance\nof DHCP scope options when we did out run\n\n530\n00:23:15.688 --> 00:23:17.043\nthrough on DHCP, right?\n\n531\n00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:18.850\nWe talked about all the different\nscope options we have.\n\n532\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.010\nYou can see all those right here.\n\n533\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.260\nIf we have any policies associated\nwith DHCP we would see those.\n\n534\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.750\nWe have no effective policies,\nbut we talked about those.\n\n535\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.230\nThe event catalog,\nwe see event ID's specific to DHCP and\n\n536\n00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.170\nany information we may wanna be aware of.\n\n537\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.140\nYou could see it right there.\n\n538\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.080\nSo we have all that, right?\n\n539\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.200\nWe actually have,\nas you know, our servers.\n\n540\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.165\nWe see both servers there.\n\n541\n00:23:39.165 --> 00:23:41.343\nThis one is for DHCP.\n\n542\n00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:45.570\nAnd so, essentially just the same\ninformation that we're seeing.\n\n543\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.420\nBut we have more of the detail here,\nbecause now we're looking at server\n\n544\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.440\nproperties, not specifically\nDHCP scope properties.\n\n545\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.456\nSo we're seeing the configuration.\n\n546\n00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:58.309\nBut you'll see here allow Mac address\nfiltering, deny, dynamic update, etc.\n\n547\n00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:02.093\nAll that is specified here as well,\nwe already took a look at options.\n\n548\n00:24:02.093 --> 00:24:04.490\nAll right, if there were any\navailable that had been specified.\n\n549\n00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.326\nThis is at the server level,\nnot at the scope level.\n\n550\n00:24:07.326 --> 00:24:08.559\nThere are no server options.\n\n551\n00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:10.746\nRemember we have different levels for\noptions, right?\n\n552\n00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:12.233\nWe had talked about that.\n\n553\n00:24:12.233 --> 00:24:16.257\nSo we have scope options for the server,\nscope options for, or rather options for\n\n554\n00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:19.542\nthe scope options for the server,\nno options at the server level.\n\n555\n00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:22.993\nSo we're seeing everything we would see\nby going through the Management Console.\n\n556\n00:24:22.993 --> 00:24:27.517\nIndividual to one of these services,\nbut we're getting it all, as we said,\n\n557\n00:24:27.517 --> 00:24:29.197\naggregated up inside IPAM.\n\n558\n00:24:29.197 --> 00:24:32.634\nI haven't heard an or an yet\nfrom you, I'm just pointing it out.\n\n559\n00:24:32.634 --> 00:24:33.323\nIt's a little late now.\n\n560\n00:24:33.323 --> 00:24:36.067\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm also thinking.\n\n561\n00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:37.710\n&gt;&gt; That was kinda like, that wasn't real.\n\n562\n00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.991\nIt was like after the fact and prompted.\n\n563\n00:24:39.991 --> 00:24:41.919\nBut that's okay, it is pretty cool.\n\n564\n00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.412\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Is that you have talked about a lot of\n\n565\n00:24:43.412 --> 00:24:43.983\nthese things and\n\n566\n00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:45.524\nnow we're actually being able to see them-\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n567\n00:24:45.524 --> 00:24:47.044\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's why I'm just kind of absorbing it-\n\n568\n00:24:47.044 --> 00:24:47.986\n&gt;&gt; You're absorbing it all.\n\n569\n00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:48.956\n&gt;&gt; Taking it all in.\n\n570\n00:24:48.956 --> 00:24:49.456\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n571\n00:24:49.456 --> 00:24:50.749\nSo you were saving it up for an ooh or\n\n572\n00:24:50.749 --> 00:24:52.561\nan ahh at the end, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's right. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I jumped\n\n573\n00:24:52.561 --> 00:24:55.368\nthe gun on that, I apologize.\nAll right, so let's go back full screen,\n\n574\n00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:58.602\nlet's just continue taking a look.\nYou can see we do have, I'm just going to\n\n575\n00:24:58.602 --> 00:25:02.573\nthe IP address block just so we can see.\nSo we do have our address block here.\n\n576\n00:25:02.573 --> 00:25:03.877\nWe do see it as private,\n\n577\n00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:04.648\nright?\nAgain,\n\n578\n00:25:04.648 --> 00:25:07.379\nkind of the information we already saw.\nJust look at it from a different\n\n579\n00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:10.782\nprospective.\nBut we do see the DHCP server name here.\n\n580\n00:25:10.782 --> 00:25:12.768\nWe do get some trending information for\n\n581\n00:25:12.768 --> 00:25:13.780\nutilization.\nNow we\n\n582\n00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.711\nhaven't been running this long enough.\nIt's kind of a cool feature,\n\n583\n00:25:16.711 --> 00:25:20.018\nbut we haven't been running this long\nenough to actually have developed\n\n584\n00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:22.725\nany data of any significance in\nterms of the amount of time or\n\n585\n00:25:22.725 --> 00:25:23.737\nduration here.\nBut\n\n586\n00:25:23.737 --> 00:25:28.052\nremember I did mention to you that\nwe do keep data historically for\n\n587\n00:25:28.052 --> 00:25:31.152\nyears in the IPAM database-\n&gt;&gt; No, you said after three years.\n\n588\n00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:32.545\n&gt;&gt; On forensic data.\n\n589\n00:25:32.545 --> 00:25:33.453\nSo I could go out,\n\n590\n00:25:33.453 --> 00:25:36.795\nI mean not that I'm gonna have any\ndata there but you get the idea.\n\n591\n00:25:36.795 --> 00:25:38.581\nBut I could go out, even on a day I just\n\n592\n00:25:38.581 --> 00:25:41.815\ndon't have enough data in here from\nthe demo for 30 minutes to set\n\n593\n00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:45.578\nthis up to actually show you anything.\nBut you can imagine if you're running this\n\n594\n00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:48.433\nin production and actually developing\nthis running it long term.\n\n595\n00:25:48.433 --> 00:25:49.339\nWe'd be able to see\n\n596\n00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:53.183\nhistorical data start pulling it in.\nUtilization trend on our IP addresses, for\n\n597\n00:25:53.183 --> 00:25:54.653\ninstance, right?\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n598\n00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.045\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why it says up to five years\n\n599\n00:25:56.045 --> 00:25:58.214\nthere on that little-\n&gt;&gt; Because you can go up to five years,\n\n600\n00:25:58.214 --> 00:26:00.140\nit's just that we maintain.\nWe normally cut off\n\n601\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.370\nat three- [CROSSTALK] Setting,\nthe cap is five, you could actually go\n\n602\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.017\nup to five years if you wanted to, right?\nSo event catalog se,e that we have\n\n603\n00:26:07.017 --> 00:26:10.942\ninformation here, right?\nSo we have quite a bit of stuff that we're\n\n604\n00:26:10.942 --> 00:26:15.363\nable to pull in and start to work with\nonce we get IPAM all up and running,\n\n605\n00:26:15.363 --> 00:26:18.233\nall right?\nSo this is a pretty neat little tool when\n\n606\n00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:22.208\nyou get it all configured, stood up,\nbroken out, and we have everything\n\n607\n00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:26.844\nfinally said and done, so to speak, right?\n&gt;&gt; So does that mean we've reached the end\n\n608\n00:26:26.844 --> 00:26:30.417\nof our journey, our field trip?\n&gt;&gt; Well, not quite.\n\n609\n00:26:30.417 --> 00:26:31.929\nSo, let's just take a look at something\n\n610\n00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:33.898\nelse here.\nAlmost, but let's go back in here,\n\n611\n00:26:33.898 --> 00:26:35.674\nlet's just take a look at something else.\n\n612\n00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:38.166\nLets go in here.\n\n613\n00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.674\nGo back to full screen if you will cuz\nI want you to be able to see this.\n\n614\n00:26:40.674 --> 00:26:44.128\nSo I'm back on the DHCP and\nDNS server area, for instance, right?\n\n615\n00:26:44.128 --> 00:26:47.047\nRight-clicking on, and\nlet me just click away so you could see.\n\n616\n00:26:47.047 --> 00:26:51.995\nI am looking at DHCP right now, the DHCP\nrole, right-click and look at the options\n\n617\n00:26:51.995 --> 00:26:56.892\nI get, we just scroll down here so you can\nkind of see this list pop up here, right?\n\n618\n00:26:56.892 --> 00:27:01.872\nFrom here I mention that just becomes our\ncentral management area where we can go\n\n619\n00:27:01.872 --> 00:27:05.904\nin and we can work with and\nconfigure settings on these servers.\n\n620\n00:27:05.904 --> 00:27:07.299\nLook at all the things I\ncould do right from here.\n\n621\n00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:10.862\nI'm not in the DHCP MMC, I'm in IPAM.\n\n622\n00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:11.763\nBut look at what I can do.\n\n623\n00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:15.070\nI can get server properties,\nset up options, set up scopes.\n\n624\n00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.807\n&gt;&gt; Create scopes.\n\n625\n00:27:15.807 --> 00:27:16.620\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n626\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.527\nView our user and vendor class options,\ntake a look at all that.\n\n627\n00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:21.629\nSet up our DHCP policies,\nwe can import them.\n\n628\n00:27:21.629 --> 00:27:23.849\nWe went through and\ndiscussed all of these things and\n\n629\n00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:26.180\ndid demonstrations on all\nof these in prior episodes.\n\n630\n00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.894\nWe can add our MAC address filtering.\n\n631\n00:27:27.894 --> 00:27:32.461\nI can launch the actual Management shell\nspecific to DHCP on that server if I\n\n632\n00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:33.050\nwant to.\n\n633\n00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.637\nI could deactivate and activate policies,\nreplicate, set address scopes,\n\n634\n00:27:36.637 --> 00:27:38.279\nretrieve serve data, you name it.\n\n635\n00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.127\nI can go in and do all that.\n\n636\n00:27:39.127 --> 00:27:43.064\nSo if I wanted to edit the server\nproperties, I could go in and turn on and\n\n637\n00:27:43.064 --> 00:27:45.179\noff logging, for instance, right?\n\n638\n00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:47.017\nI can take a look at DNS updates and\n\n639\n00:27:47.017 --> 00:27:49.650\nspecify whether dynamic\nupdates are allowed.\n\n640\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.425\nAnd I can go in I can\nlook at DNS credentials,\n\n641\n00:27:52.425 --> 00:27:55.277\nand I can specify all sorts of stuff,\nright?\n\n642\n00:27:55.277 --> 00:27:57.218\nJust look at the different stuff I can do.\n\n643\n00:27:57.218 --> 00:27:58.949\nI could turn on MAC address filtering,\nright?\n\n644\n00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:04.210\nSo I can do any or all of these things\nif I go to our DNS server, right?\n\n645\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.320\nJust there.\n\n646\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.874\nAgain, we can do some stuff.\n\n647\n00:28:06.874 --> 00:28:09.232\nMaybe not as extensive, cuz obviously-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm looking at.\n\n648\n00:28:09.232 --> 00:28:11.752\n&gt;&gt; It depends on where we are,\nbut I can create zones.\n\n649\n00:28:11.752 --> 00:28:15.007\nI could set up conditional forwarding,\ntalked about that.\n\n650\n00:28:15.007 --> 00:28:18.039\nI can retrieve the server data, or\nif I need to go into more detail,\n\n651\n00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:20.095\ncuz DNS is more complex,\nI may be able to go and\n\n652\n00:28:20.095 --> 00:28:22.391\nlaunch the console to do\nthings I need to do there.\n\n653\n00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:26.961\nBut, again, I have the ability to be able\nto manage, and to actually interact with,\n\n654\n00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:31.610\nand configure, and look at properties,\nand coordinate activity, right from here.\n\n655\n00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.783\nNot that IPAM's gonna solve every problem\nand give us central management of\n\n656\n00:28:34.783 --> 00:28:37.719\neverything, .never ever having to\ngo back to those consoles again.\n\n657\n00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:41.367\nBut it gives us a tremendous amount of\nflexibility before we have to go launch\n\n658\n00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:44.958\nan individual console on a certain\nmachine to be able to configure things.\n\n659\n00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:47.011\nSo pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; And with all this flexibility,\n\n660\n00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:50.614\nyou kind of just see the importance\nof security in your networks today.\n\n661\n00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:54.277\nBecause could you imagine if someone were\ncapable of accessing all these features\n\n662\n00:28:54.277 --> 00:28:55.879\nwithin one centralized location?\n\n663\n00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:58.576\nIt would be just as easy for\nthem that it is for you.\n\n664\n00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.131\nSo you have keep that in mind.\n\n665\n00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:01.837\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nLet's just drill down one more level.\n\n666\n00:29:01.837 --> 00:29:04.821\nSame kind of idea, but you can see\nhere I just went into the DHCP scopes.\n\n667\n00:29:04.821 --> 00:29:06.481\nWent to our scope, right clicked.\n\n668\n00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:09.198\nEdit our scope, duplicate it,\ncreate it, add it.\n\n669\n00:29:09.198 --> 00:29:11.531\nCreate a super scope,\nwe talked about that.\n\n670\n00:29:11.531 --> 00:29:15.375\nHey, configure failover, that was a cool,\nfun little demo that you and I did, right?\n\n671\n00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:16.987\nWe set up the HTTP failover.\n\n672\n00:29:16.987 --> 00:29:20.828\nLook at what we can do here,\nwe're essentially accessing management\n\n673\n00:29:20.828 --> 00:29:23.573\ncapabilities across any of these areas,\nright?\n\n674\n00:29:23.573 --> 00:29:27.592\nLook at, again,\nlet's just go up here real quick.\n\n675\n00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:30.350\nLet's make sure we can get to this, right?\n\n676\n00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.950\nRight click,\nall I'm doing is right clicking.\n\n677\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.491\nI can edit the zone, I can delete it.\n\n678\n00:29:33.491 --> 00:29:35.333\nYou always wanted to do that, right?\n\n679\n00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:37.754\nBefore you leave work at\nthe end of the day, right?\n\n680\n00:29:37.754 --> 00:29:38.683\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No!\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that.\n\n681\n00:29:38.683 --> 00:29:40.618\nI'm kidding.\nDon't do that, right?\n\n682\n00:29:40.618 --> 00:29:43.734\nYou can add resource records here, one of\nthe most common things we've got to do.\n\n683\n00:29:43.734 --> 00:29:44.980\nAdd resource records, right?\n\n684\n00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.932\nWe can do that, look, click right there,\nwhat are we going to do?\n\n685\n00:29:47.932 --> 00:29:51.288\nWe got a little window that comes up, and\nwe're going to add our resource records.\n\n686\n00:29:51.288 --> 00:29:55.320\nThere's our zone, there's our sever,\nconfigure DNS resource records,\n\n687\n00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.775\nnew, what are we gonna do?\n\n688\n00:29:56.775 --> 00:29:59.570\nLets just scroll down there.\n\n689\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.964\nKinda see, let me bring that up just the\nway it's kinda coming up in the window.\n\n690\n00:30:02.964 --> 00:30:03.719\nThere we go.\nAll right, yes.\n\n691\n00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:05.342\nSo you can see that, so new.\n\n692\n00:30:05.342 --> 00:30:08.374\nConfigure DNS resource records,\ngreat, right?\n\n693\n00:30:08.374 --> 00:30:10.270\nNew resource record type.\n\n694\n00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.653\nSelect what kind of records you want,\nthat list should look familiar to you.\n\n695\n00:30:13.653 --> 00:30:15.072\nThat's the list of all the stuff we want.\n\n696\n00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:17.482\nWe can go ahead and\nadd a record right from here.\n\n697\n00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.043\nI mean,\nwe could do everything we need to do.\n\n698\n00:30:19.043 --> 00:30:20.523\n&gt;&gt; And this kind of goes without saying.\n\n699\n00:30:20.523 --> 00:30:22.866\nBut when you're managing remotely,\n\n700\n00:30:22.866 --> 00:30:27.037\nlet's say we are managing some remote\nservers at any kind of actions\n\n701\n00:30:27.037 --> 00:30:31.302\nthat we execute that would disconnect\nus or power that machine down.\n\n702\n00:30:31.302 --> 00:30:34.073\nLike, just best practices,\nlike restarting a machine so\n\n703\n00:30:34.073 --> 00:30:37.820\nwe don't have to drive across the world\nto get powered on and things like that.\n\n704\n00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.920\nWhen we were performing remote management\nyou just wanna be aware of that\n\n705\n00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.734\ntoo, right?\n\n706\n00:30:42.734 --> 00:30:44.647\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely important to consider.\n\n707\n00:30:44.647 --> 00:30:49.982\nI mean, if you're working remotely\nacross several subnets, who knows how.\n\n708\n00:30:49.982 --> 00:30:53.595\nWhat kind of job do you have in your into\na data center your managing remotely you\n\n709\n00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:56.245\njust got to think about the fact\nthat you do lose, right.\n\n710\n00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:58.124\nYou do lose connectivity, right?\n\n711\n00:30:58.124 --> 00:30:59.810\nThe server maybe doesn't come back up,\n\n712\n00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.748\nsomebody's got to figure out how to\nhike out there and take care of it.\n\n713\n00:31:02.748 --> 00:31:06.650\nSee, you just got a way those concerns\nas we would always educate you and\n\n714\n00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.132\nindicate to you it would be good for\nyou to do.\n\n715\n00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:11.386\nBut, also the flip side of this.\n\n716\n00:31:11.386 --> 00:31:12.729\nLook don't fear the reboot.\n\n717\n00:31:12.729 --> 00:31:15.849\nDon't fear the restart if you're\ngonna solve a problem but make sure,\n\n718\n00:31:15.849 --> 00:31:17.825\nto Cherokee's point, and it's a good one,\n\n719\n00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:21.206\nthat you have a human standing by to fix\nsomething if it doesn't come back up.\n\n720\n00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:22.382\nBecause you never know,\n\n721\n00:31:22.382 --> 00:31:26.190\nI mean the restart could just totally fry\nwhatever was already starting to happen\n\n722\n00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.606\nand make it go bad and the server may\njust go down hard and not come back up.\n\n723\n00:31:29.606 --> 00:31:32.464\nAnd then somebody has to, you'll\ninterdict there and figure it out, but\n\n724\n00:31:32.464 --> 00:31:34.368\nthat doesn't mean you\nshouldn't take it down.\n\n725\n00:31:34.368 --> 00:31:37.176\nIt just means you've gotta be prepared to\ndeal with it if you have to go in there\n\n726\n00:31:37.176 --> 00:31:38.403\nand help it to come back up again.\n\n727\n00:31:38.403 --> 00:31:39.904\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n728\n00:31:39.904 --> 00:31:43.210\nBut that, as we say, is IPM in a nutshell.\n\n729\n00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:43.839\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n730\n00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:45.613\nWell, thank you so much for\njoining us today, Adam.\n\n731\n00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:47.175\nAnd thank you for joining us as well.\n\n732\n00:31:47.175 --> 00:31:49.399\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n733\n00:31:49.399 --> 00:31:51.324\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n734\n00:31:51.324 --> 00:31:52.351\n&gt;&gt;

networking.\n\n15\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.834\nAnd as Cherokee just said, we're gonna\nturn our attention to remote access.\n\n16\n00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:43.891\nOne of the most important things we\ncan do after we set up IP addressing,\n\n17\n00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:48.714\nafter we configure name resolution,\nDNS, DHCP, IPv4, IPv6.\n\n18\n00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:52.616\nIf we get all that out of the way after\nwe do some IP address management,\n\n19\n00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.007\ndid several sets of episodes\ntogether there for you on IPAM.\n\n20\n00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.021\nReally interesting concept\nif you have not seen it,\n\n21\n00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.330\nI encourage you to go take a look and\ncheck those out.\n\n22\n00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.920\nAfter we do all that what we then have\nto do is take all that information,\n\n23\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.970\nall that architecture, all that hard work\nand enable remote users to come in and\n\n24\n00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720\naccess network resources, typically\nfrom outside the organization, so\n\n25\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.290\nthat they are able to go ahead.\n\n26\n00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.490\nAnd that they are able to use resources,\n\n27\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.510\ninteract with them as if they were sitting\ninside of the network on the LAN, but\n\n28\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.910\nin fact they're outside,\nthey're remote, right?\n\n29\n00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.110\nSo we're talking about what we would\ntraditionally call routing and\n\n30\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.270\nremote access.\n\n31\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.800\nWe're gonna take a look at what\nthat looks like in Server 16.\n\n32\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.560\nHas not really changed\nmuch from prior versions.\n\n33\n00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.175\nIf you've been interacting with Windows,\nyou probably have a sense of what RAS or\n\n34\n00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:43.040\nRRAS as we formerly refer to it,\nhas looked like.\n\n35\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.660\nThe interface looks the same.\n\n36\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.820\nThe set up is pretty much the same.\n\n37\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.520\nCan enable it through PowerShell.\n\n38\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.330\nCan install it through\nthe server manager GUI.\n\n39\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.560\nWe then go in and\nwe configure it from within the MMC.\n\n40\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.130\nAnd we then can set up our VPN\nconnections, set up our network policy\n\n41\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.430\nservers, we can do ahead and\nset up our Direct Access support.\n\n42\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.910\nWe can set up the RAS solution\nas a router, doing netting.\n\n43\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.690\nWe'll take a look and talk about that.\n\n44\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.690\nWeb application proxy can be used as well.\n\n45\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.860\nWe have features and\ncapabilities in there,\n\n46\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.750\nwe are going to walk\nthrough in this episode.\n\n47\n00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.995\nGive you a high level thought\nprocess as to what that looks like.\n\n48\n00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:22.510\nWe'll take you through and show you\nhow to begin the configuration and\n\n49\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.390\nsetup of the RS solution,\nand how to set it up and\n\n50\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.580\nconfigure it, depending on the profile\nthat you wanna support for\n\n51\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.030\ndifferent business scenarios or\ndifferent usage requirements.\n\n52\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.390\nSo I mentioned that there are four\ndifferent remote access options for\n\n53\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.150\nsupport.\n\n54\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.720\nWe do have direct access.\n\n55\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.300\nThis is where you're gonna get in form\nthe outside coming in from remote users,\n\n56\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.200\naccessing resources, like I was\nsuggesting, email servers, shared folders,\n\n57\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.170\nwhatever it may be.\n\n58\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.750\nWithout have to use the VPN, the VPN was\nVPN as it is sometimes referred too.\n\n59\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.260\nFormal name for it for\nmany iterations now is direct access.\n\n60\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.330\nYeah, remember when I\nwas working directly, or\n\n61\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.120\nwhen I say directly, as an orange badge,\nas we would call it at Microsoft.\n\n62\n00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.680\nWhen I was out there based in Seattle,\nprobably close to 10 years ago now.\n\n63\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.986\nAnd when I was there doing essentially\nsecond hand consulting work through\n\n64\n00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:20.551\nan external company back to\nMicrosoft as many people will do.\n\n65\n00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:24.433\nI was using, when I was travelling and\ndoing the work I was doing, I was with\n\n66\n00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:28.395\nthe enterprise group that actually\ndealing with things all over the world.\n\n67\n00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:33.699\nWhen I was out travelling, I was using\nwhat will become direct access technology,\n\n68\n00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.950\nthis was being previewed internally\nat Microsoft at the time.\n\n69\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.800\nWe often will release that\nkind of technology and\n\n70\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.670\nthen make it available internally.\n\n71\n00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.360\nThey call it eating your own dog food,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.939\nSo you test it out and you use it,\nget it all straight and organized and\n\n73\n00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.582\nreally get all the bugs out of it,\nand then ultimately integrate it and\n\n74\n00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:52.850\nput it out as features.\n\n75\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.157\nAnd so I remember using what would become\ndirect access technology before it became\n\n76\n00:03:57.157 --> 00:03:58.336\npublicly available.\n\n77\n00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:01.918\nAnd being in India,\nbeing in many around the world and\n\n78\n00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:07.092\nusing this technology to come through\nthe web and essentially tunnel through\n\n79\n00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:12.666\nexisting traffic pathways to get in and\naccess the internal corporate extranet and\n\n80\n00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:17.222\nthings like Microsoft websites\ninternal email whatever it may be.\n\n81\n00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:21.328\nUsing it on a couple of different\nmobile devices, cell phones, tablets or\n\n82\n00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:25.370\nwhat would become more or less the thought\nprocess around a tablet then and\n\n83\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.430\nyou know laptops.\n\n84\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.010\nAnd I remember being able to\nset this up and configure it.\n\n85\n00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.870\nIt was not difficult to do then.\n\n86\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.910\nIt's certainly less difficult\nto do it if at all now.\n\n87\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.694\nAnd so it's actually really\ninteresting technology.\n\n88\n00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:38.899\nWe were chatting just a little bit about\nthe concept before we got started.\n\n89\n00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:42.822\nAnd it is, as Cherokee said,\npretty exciting and cool to talk about.\n\n90\n00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:45.480\nWe're goinna devote some episodes\nto talking about it more in depth.\n\n91\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.275\nA little bit later on,\nkind of go through it in more detail.\n\n92\n00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:52.650\nJust really a high level thought process\nof one of t he four ways we provide RAS or\n\n93\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.460\nremote, and routing and\nremote access support right now,\n\n94\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.090\njust introduced the idea to you.\n\n95\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.920\nBut we support\nthe traditional VPNs as well.\n\n96\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.830\nSo the idea of using a client based VPN or\nthe agent for the endpoint has some\n\n97\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.140\nsort of software and configuration\nthat allows it to connect in.\n\n98\n00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.150\nAnd then it connects to the server.\n\n99\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.260\nA VPN is sort of just a point\nto point connection, right?\n\n100\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.050\nWe talked about the fact that we have\nthe client, we have the server, you create\n\n101\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.160\na pathway what we would call a tunnel\ndedicated between the two allowing for\n\n102\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.955\nafter authentication and\nmost likely encryption.\n\n103\n00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:27.575\nSecure authorized communication that will\nallow those two parties to be able to\n\n104\n00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:30.015\nexchange information back and\nforth as required.\n\n105\n00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:33.025\nWe do this over a shared or\npublic network traditionally.\n\n106\n00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:36.295\nMeaning, over the Internet more\noften than not is how we actually\n\n107\n00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.285\nset up our VPN tunnels today.\n\n108\n00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:43.170\nWe certainly, they'd be able to use\nVPN site to site on private corporate\n\n109\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.350\nnetworks with dedicated endpoint\nbandwidth and connections.\n\n110\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.670\nIt's not unheard of, and\n\n111\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.230\ncertainly many of my larger enterprise\nclients will have global spanning networks\n\n112\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.130\nthat are run on their own private\nback bone infrastructure.\n\n113\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.560\nThey've got dedicated circuits,\ndedicated bandwidth that they are paying\n\n114\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.630\na premium to provision from providers and\nuse exclusively for their own needs.\n\n115\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.313\nAnd they will set up dedicated site\nVPNs over those private networks.\n\n116\n00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:12.290\nSo it is possible that we could see VPNs\nbeing set up on private corporate internal\n\n117\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.070\nLAN base networks that are just extended\nglobally across these dedicated links,\n\n118\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.328\nbut the traditional way we see VPNs would\nbe tunneling through the Internet, right,\n\n119\n00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:22.110\nmore often than not.\n\n120\n00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.910\nI'm sure we've probably all had one or\n\n121\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.630\nmore of those experiences where we've had\nto use a remote gateway connection or\n\n122\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.970\nsome sort of VPN like connection to\nget in and share and access resources.\n\n123\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.510\nThe data is sent over the private link,\nit's encrypted, as we said most probably\n\n124\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.280\nyou're authenticating, so we're not\ngonna worry about talking to strangers,\n\n125\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.862\nunless they're able to hack their\nway in for some odd reason.\n\n126\n00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.492\nWe're gonna encrypt the traffic,\nensuring it is secure.\n\n127\n00:06:46.492 --> 00:06:50.270\nWe're gonna appear to be operating\non the private network internally\n\n128\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.975\nwith a dedicated IP address on\nthe corporate private internal LAN, or\n\n129\n00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:57.905\naccessing things like printers and\nresources assuming we map them and\n\n130\n00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.205\nmake them available locally\nas if we were there.\n\n131\n00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:04.335\nSitting in that office right next to the\nresource or on the same subnet locally,\n\n132\n00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:05.845\nwhatever you want to think of it as.\n\n133\n00:07:05.845 --> 00:07:08.365\nBut we're sitting outside remotely,\nwherever we may be.\n\n134\n00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:10.635\nSo that technology has been around for\na long, long time, right?\n\n135\n00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:12.380\nThat is not brand new.\n\n136\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.810\nRouting over all has a thought\nprocess around the RRAS solution,\n\n137\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.140\nis the most basic fundamental\ncore function that RRAS provides.\n\n138\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.300\nThis is setting up the server that\nwill be multi-homed in other words.\n\n139\n00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.910\nInitially the server will have at\nleast two network interfaces on it.\n\n140\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.120\nOne that will face internal to one or\nmore LANs that we are using or\n\n141\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.650\nsubnets through the LAN that we\nare using for inside access.\n\n142\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.020\nOne interface that faces outside\nessentially to the external world\n\n143\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.660\nthat we could then use to be able\nto provide inbound connection, and\n\n144\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.070\nmanagement control of inbound connections\nfor direct access VPNs whatever.\n\n145\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.705\nWhen we set a routing, we're just setting\nup the system that work like a router,\n\n146\n00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:53.885\na software based router.\n\n147\n00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:57.023\nWe probably are throwing\nthat on top of that,\n\n148\n00:07:57.023 --> 00:08:02.473\nnetwork address translation is gonna to\nallow us To be able to hide the internal\n\n149\n00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:07.841\nprivate network IPs from the outside\nworld, by presenting a standardized,\n\n150\n00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.918\npublic, IPv4 facing interface,\ntraditionally.\n\n151\n00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:15.705\nThat is gonna be used for all address\nof inbound traffic coming back in,\n\n152\n00:08:15.705 --> 00:08:17.285\nand outbound traffic going out.\n\n153\n00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:20.919\nWe're gonna appear, in other words, as if\nwe're emanating from a single address, and\n\n154\n00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:22.717\nwe use that address for all communication.\n\n155\n00:08:22.717 --> 00:08:27.297\nBut then internally, we have an address\ntable that translates that inbound traffic\n\n156\n00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:30.143\nbecause of the encapsulation\nwe unwrap the packet.\n\n157\n00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:34.206\nAnd we see internally, wait,\nthere's a secondary layer of addressing.\n\n158\n00:08:34.206 --> 00:08:39.455\nAnd we're really looking for 10.005 and\ndelivering that to an endpoint internally,\n\n159\n00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:43.167\non a private class A or class B or\nclass C address, whatever it is.\n\n160\n00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:47.660\nAnd we're gonna just simply strip away\nthe external packet encapsulation.\n\n161\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.920\nLook at the internal packet addressing,\nand as a second layer,\n\n162\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.320\ndeliver that packet inside, through\nthe router, through the for instance.\n\n163\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.990\nSo, we're gonna use routing protocols,\ntraditional ones.\n\n164\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.720\nOnes I'm sure you're\nprobably familiar with, or\n\n165\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.565\nyou've heard of at least things like RIP,\nperhaps RIPv2 most likely not just RIP,\n\n166\n00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:06.475\nbut Routing Information Protocol.\n\n167\n00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:09.635\nThings like IGMP,\nInternet Group Management Protocol.\n\n168\n00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.865\nThings like, DHCP as a relay agent.\n\n169\n00:09:12.865 --> 00:09:15.675\nWe set up, we've actually shown you\nhow to do that in our prior episodes.\n\n170\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:19.775\nWe set up our DHCP relay agent on\nthe RS system and use it there.\n\n171\n00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:22.870\nSo these are the kinda things that would\nbe involved with routing traditionally.\n\n172\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.469\nAnd then Web Application Proxy.\n\n173\n00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:29.020\nThe Web App Proxy is a reverse\nproxy functionality.\n\n174\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.520\nWe're providing this for\nusers who have to accept or\n\n175\n00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.858\nuse organizations internal based\nweb applications from outside.\n\n176\n00:09:36.858 --> 00:09:40.880\nSo you wanna be able to get into an\ninternal web app that's hosted somewhere,\n\n177\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.960\nand use it from outside,\n\n178\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.510\nacross a VPN connection,\nthen the Web App Proxy does this.\n\n179\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.110\nWe pre-authenticate users coming in,\nauthorize them, understand who they are,\n\n180\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.090\nand connect them in.\n\n181\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.530\nWe need Active Directory\nfederation services, potentially,\n\n182\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.720\nis one way to do pre-authentication.\n\n183\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.510\nExtensive conversation\nabout how we do ADFS.\n\n184\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.380\nNot gonna go into, how we do identity and\nfederation management, in general?\n\n185\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.370\nIn these conversations, in this show or\nany of the shows around,\n\n186\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.840\nthe 7740, 70 741 content,\nthe Windows networking.\n\n187\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.532\nBut what we actually have and\nwill have is,\n\n188\n00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:15.936\na whole set of shows on identity\nin Windows Server 2016.\n\n189\n00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:21.576\nThe 7742 show and series of shows, and\nthat's gonna go into ADFS and RMS, and\n\n190\n00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:27.140\nall the other stuff you need,\nABC 123 identity management kind of stuff.\n\n191\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.320\nBut we're gonna go through that\ndiscussion in those areas.\n\n192\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.620\nEncourage you at some point,\nto take a look at that conversation and\n\n193\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.500\nthat content.\n\n194\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.260\nBut just mentioning here,\n\n195\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.170\nthat ADFS is going to be used as one\npossible authentication mechanism.\n\n196\n00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.103\nWe could also do what's called\npass through authentication.\n\n197\n00:10:43.103 --> 00:10:47.454\nWhere the application itself is\ndoing the actual authentication, not\n\n198\n00:10:47.454 --> 00:10:52.990\nthe Web App Proxy, with ADFS, we're making\nthe Web App Proxy do the authentication.\n\n199\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.790\nAs a standoff solution, we're gonna\nintegrate the authentication there.\n\n200\n00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.559\nAnd we're gonna use ADFS as\nthe proxy capability, or, excuse me,\n\n201\n00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:05.527\nthrough the proxy capability,\ngonna use ADFS to create, and manage,\n\n202\n00:11:05.527 --> 00:11:07.330\nthat authentication request.\n\n203\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.121\nBut with pass through, we just push the\nauthentication request through he proxy,\n\n204\n00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:13.342\nand the end point application\ninteracts with and\n\n205\n00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:15.270\nauthenticates you, and allows you in.\n\n206\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.889\nSo, we have a couple of\ndifferent ways of doing this.\n\n207\n00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:21.756\nJust wanna make sure that we are familiar\nwith the thought process of the four\n\n208\n00:11:21.756 --> 00:11:26.337\ndifferent items or options we have\nas we look at starting to configure.\n\n209\n00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:30.180\nAnd setting up our remote access, or\nrouting and remote access solution.\n\n210\n00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.400\nWe do have two routing and\nremote access or RAS,\n\n211\n00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.580\nRemote Access Management options when\nwe go in and configure the system.\n\n212\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.012\nWe do have our traditional routing and\nremote access console.\n\n213\n00:11:40.012 --> 00:11:44.480\nAnd we have a routing Remote Access\nManagement interface as well.\n\n214\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.010\nThought it may be helpful just\nto start taking a look at those.\n\n215\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.000\nSo if you wanna join me here in the\nconsole, you can see that I've already got\n\n216\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.120\nrouting and remote access set up,\nin the sense that I've installed the role.\n\n217\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.320\nWe have it configured in the sense\nthat we can open up and manage it, but\n\n218\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.110\nyou'll notice, the first thing we have to\ndo is actually configure the RAS server.\n\n219\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.520\nThe console comes up essentially ready for\nus to do the next step in the process.\n\n220\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.965\nBut installing is nothing more.\n\n221\n00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:16.580\nLet's go down here,\nthan simply going in through PowerShell.\n\n222\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.894\nLet me just bring this up so\nyou can see this.\n\n223\n00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:24.810\nAnd adding in the Windows feature,\nyou can probably see it right there.\n\n224\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.293\nWe used PowerShell to add the Windows\nfeature DirectAcess VPN, and\n\n225\n00:12:28.293 --> 00:12:32.341\nrouting included management tools such\nas what I've kind of trails off to do.\n\n226\n00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:35.549\nAnd you could see we were successful,\ndid not require a restart,\n\n227\n00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:38.527\ninstalled the RAS connection\nmanager administration kit,\n\n228\n00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:41.510\nall the supporting tools and\nall the elements we need.\n\n229\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.959\nSo we have all that set up.\n\n230\n00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:47.359\nAnd then now that we've done that,\nwe just bring back at my VM,\n\n231\n00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:50.906\nI just hit the wrong minor sign on\nthe console there, there we go.\n\n232\n00:12:50.906 --> 00:12:54.790\nAnd so now that we have that, we're\ninside and about ready to get started.\n\n233\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.071\nSo before we do that, let me just show\nyou what I was talking about with the two\n\n234\n00:12:58.071 --> 00:13:00.140\ndifferent counsels I was mentioning.\n\n235\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.410\nUp in the tools area here, this is on\nthe server manager, in the server manager,\n\n236\n00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.400\non the box that we\nare making our RAS server.\n\n237\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.961\nJust scroll down so you can see.\n\n238\n00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:10.760\nI've got Remote Access Management.\n\n239\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.740\nThis is one of the two consoles and\nuser interfaces we'll use for management.\n\n240\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.370\nAnd then, the one we're in right now,\nrouting and remote access, or RRAS, right?\n\n241\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.820\nWe're gonna configure the routing and\nremote access server role first.\n\n242\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.290\nSo we're gonna go in and take a look at\nthat, and that's where we're gonna start.\n\n243\n00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.116\nBut we do have both.\n\n244\n00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:28.735\nJust wanna make sure you're aware of\nthe fact that they are both there.\n\n245\n00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:32.460\nAll right, so let me come down here.\n\n246\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.090\nLet's just bring back up our RRAS console,\nscroll back up here.\n\n247\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.170\nAnd, we're gonna right click, and\n\n248\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.010\nwe're gonna configure as you can see\nenable routing and remote access, so\n\n249\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.522\nlet's just do that,\nwe're gonna get our little wizard here.\n\n250\n00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:48.856\nIt's gonna come up and\nmake itself available for us.\n\n251\n00:13:48.856 --> 00:13:52.451\nAnd what we're gonna do is, just take a\nlook at the different options we have for\n\n252\n00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:54.556\nconfiguration, before we do anything else.\n\n253\n00:13:54.556 --> 00:13:57.840\nSo let me bring that ups so\nyou guys can see that a little better.\n\n254\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.590\nAnd just a standard welcome screen,\nnothing too fancy there.\n\n255\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.470\nAnd then you'll see as we were talking\nabout that we have some options here.\n\n256\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.150\nRouting and remote access gives us\nas I said different capabilities,\n\n257\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.790\nremote access dialup or VPN, nut, so\ntraditional straight nut solution.\n\n258\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.266\nVPN access and nut, so\nwe combine the two together essentially.\n\n259\n00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:21.670\nIndividual options, third one,\nkind of combine those two.\n\n260\n00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.813\nSecurity connection between\ntwo private networks.\n\n261\n00:14:23.813 --> 00:14:27.106\nThis will be something like branch\noffice connectivity site to site\n\n262\n00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:28.630\nVPN as I was talking about.\n\n263\n00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.670\nThat we could set up an indicated private\ninternal network of some kind, or\n\n264\n00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.320\na custom configuration where\nwe’re able to go in and\n\n265\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.650\ndecide how we want to\nspecify our configuration.\n\n266\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.450\nEssentially, manually make choices.\n\n267\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.700\nThe options that we see here, are going\nto have a preset set of steps and\n\n268\n00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.660\nscreens that we answer questions through.\n\n269\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.380\nKind of almost like a templated\ndeployment that is gonna\n\n270\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.450\nfocus us in on just configuring\nthat aspect of the RRAS solution.\n\n271\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.300\nIf you want a little more flexibility,\nyou will do the custom solution down at\n\n272\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.170\nthe bottom, where we set up things like\nrouting for instance, generically, right?\n\n273\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.510\nSo I'm gonna go in and view custom,\nand we'll just click here.\n\n274\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.170\nAnd you'll see, then, we can choose any or\nall of the options we had there, but\n\n275\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.780\nwe also have land routing,\njust traditional routing.\n\n276\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.350\nCuz remember, one of the functions RRAS\nprovides is as a traditional software\n\n277\n00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.555\nbased router, so we could do this as well.\n\n278\n00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:20.166\nBe up to us to decide.\n\n279\n00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:22.460\nLet me just go back here for one second.\n\n280\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.230\nIf you were to choose, hypothetically,\n\n281\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.320\none of these options to show\nyou what may exist here.\n\n282\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.070\nYou'll see that, it's grayed out\ndepending on what we have set up and\n\n283\n00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.719\ndecided to do,\nyou will have different options to choose.\n\n284\n00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:38.330\nJust choose the net one there.\n\n285\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.506\nRight, you'll see create a new\ndemand interface for the Internet.\n\n286\n00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:45.090\nWe may have some set up we have to do\nto provide interface management for\n\n287\n00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.510\nsetting this up, initially.\n\n288\n00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.612\nSo, the Wizard kinda constraints us and\ndoes us some different things.\n\n289\n00:15:49.612 --> 00:15:52.121\nBut it directs us into path\nwe need to go to stand up and\n\n290\n00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:54.817\nconfigure the role based on\nthe choices we're making.\n\n291\n00:15:54.817 --> 00:15:56.070\nSo we're gonna choose\nCustom Configuration.\n\n292\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.490\nWe have different options here.\n\n293\n00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.254\nWe're gonna do or set up an LAN router.\n\n294\n00:16:00.254 --> 00:16:01.487\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncheck that off.\n\n295\n00:16:01.487 --> 00:16:06.024\nIt's gonna be a very short trip cuz once\nwe do that we're essentially then going to\n\n296\n00:16:06.024 --> 00:16:08.150\nhit Next and we're gonna be set to go.\n\n297\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.460\nIt's just gonna go ahead and configure it,\nstart the service, we'll see that happen.\n\n298\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.050\nAnd then, by the way,\nI can remember back probably to NT4,\n\n299\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.100\nI mean this service and this thought\nprocess has been around for some time.\n\n300\n00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.760\nAnd the screen you're about to\nsee where it starts the service,\n\n301\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.180\nit has like the little pizza\npan clock kinda thing.\n\n302\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.070\nIt's go the circle,\nyou've probably seen it.\n\n303\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.855\nWith all the notches on it\nit looks like the clock?\n\n304\n00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it goes, and\n\n305\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.360\nI'm starting the service and\nit goes around.\n\n306\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.340\nThat's been around for\n\n307\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.300\nprobably close to 20 years they have\nnot changed that box on that interface.\n\n308\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.430\nIt has looked the same forever, right?\n\n309\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.437\n&gt;&gt; Well,\neven when you're walking through this and\n\n310\n00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:44.130\nyou see some of the terminology and\nit says enter the phone number.\n\n311\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.150\nSome of these-\n&gt;&gt; Of the dial up yeah.\n\n312\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.610\n&gt;&gt; It kinda seems like a little,\nit's been around a while.\n\n313\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.050\nIt has.\n\n314\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you see here we did that,\njust start service, we click there.\n\n315\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.880\nThat thing right there, that's been\naround, that's older than I am.\n\n316\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.560\nThat's how long that's been around, right?\n\n317\n00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.850\nSo that just says it has not changed,\nright?\n\n318\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.560\nSo it's just starting the service up and\nit's just setting it up, configuring.\n\n319\n00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.050\nIt doesn't take very long, as you can see.\n\n320\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.160\nAnd then once we've done that,\nyou will see that.\n\n321\n00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.865\nOur little red circle with a, hey,\nyou need to configure me sign.\n\n322\n00:17:14.865 --> 00:17:18.038\nIt's change that and now we actually\nhave the system up and running,\n\n323\n00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:22.080\nit got a white circle there or the green\ntriangle that indicates it's running\n\n324\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.410\nlocal, we're on the machine\nwe're managing locally.\n\n325\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.410\nWe've got our network interfaces.\n\n326\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.054\nWe've got our, let's see if we can just\nextend that out there so you can see.\n\n327\n00:17:31.054 --> 00:17:33.490\nWe've got a Routing and\nRemote Access, Logging and Policies,\n\n328\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.941\njust trying to show you what that was.\n\n329\n00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:38.780\nWe've got our IPv4 and IPv6 information.\n\n330\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.900\nRemember, we do support both IPv4 and\nIPv6, so we can see that.\n\n331\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.040\nAnd we can go in, there we go,\n\n332\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.380\nit's like impossible to grab the edge\nof that thing and actually move it.\n\n333\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.883\nAnd then we can go ahead and we can start\nto figure out what it is that we're going\n\n334\n00:17:56.883 --> 00:18:01.249\nto do, or how we're gonna actually\nconfigure and go in and start to setup and\n\n335\n00:18:01.249 --> 00:18:02.425\nuse the interface.\n\n336\n00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:04.638\nSo we're going to do some of\nthat as we go through but\n\n337\n00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:07.569\nlet's just spend a few minutes just\ngetting a feel for the console,\n\n338\n00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:11.189\nlet's not worry too much about how we're\ngoing to configure things at the moment.\n\n339\n00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:12.847\nReally just poke around under the hood,\n\n340\n00:18:12.847 --> 00:18:16.113\nlets take the look some of the properties\nof things we can examine and make sure we\n\n341\n00:18:16.113 --> 00:18:19.111\nunderstand the working mechanics of\nwhere we are and what we're doing.\n\n342\n00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:21.936\nSo we're in the console here,\nas you can see,\n\n343\n00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:26.760\nif I wanna add a server right at the top\nI can manage more than one server here.\n\n344\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.070\nMost of these consoles have the ability\nto be able to be focused on\n\n345\n00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.990\ndifferent instances and\ntherefore bring them in and manage them.\n\n346\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:37.110\nSo that way if we're centrally working, we\ngot a bunch of different remote servers.\n\n347\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.860\nWe can go ahead and connect to them and\ninteract with them.\n\n348\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:45.080\nWe may have a cool feature like IPAM\nwhere we can bring in multiple DHCP and\n\n349\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.270\nDNS service in one place and\nmanage them all.\n\n350\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.680\nBut we may not be using\na feature like that, and so,\n\n351\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.160\nmaybe we just have a console list to be\nfocused on an individual system, right?\n\n352\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.500\nSo just be aware of that, one of those\nkind of things would be helpful.\n\n353\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.530\nSo we do have that ability here.\n\n354\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.918\nWe do have our sever status,\njust click there and we can see,\n\n355\n00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:06.438\nit is a server 16 standard server,\nit's called pladdc02, it has started,\n\n356\n00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:10.242\nno ports currently in use, been up for\nabout two minutes right now.\n\n357\n00:19:10.242 --> 00:19:13.024\nSo you're going to see some\nbasic information there, but\n\n358\n00:19:13.024 --> 00:19:15.220\nthat does show us a server status here.\n\n359\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.840\nAnd you could see,\nhighlight an individual server and\n\n360\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.530\nyou'll see that,\nit detected an error with the snap and\n\n361\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.950\nrecommended you should shut down and\nrestart the MMC.\n\n362\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.750\nWe can actually ignore that error,\nno big deal.\n\n363\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.410\nThere's no error right now\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n364\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.440\nI was just showing you that when you go\nto highlight, there's no option here,\n\n365\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.880\njust highlighting and\nkind of looking at it.\n\n366\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.490\nSo, we see server status.\n\n367\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.680\nNo big deal.\n\n368\n00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.270\nWhen we come over here to\nour plad DC local machine,\n\n369\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.300\nyou'll see that we can right click.\n\n370\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.600\nWe do wanna disable RAS or\n[INAUDIBLE] for some reason.\n\n371\n00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.450\nWe can go ahead and we can do that\nright from where we configured it.\n\n372\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.530\nSo you see we have the option to do that.\n\n373\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.895\nWe will be talking about direct\naccess in some upcoming episodes.\n\n374\n00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:58.821\nAnd you'll see enabling direct access\nis a right click on the server and\n\n375\n00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:01.719\nthen there's a wizard of course,\nwe walk through we'll set that up.\n\n376\n00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:04.252\nSo we have capabilities to go in and\ndo that but\n\n377\n00:20:04.252 --> 00:20:07.420\nwe will certainly be coming back and\ntaking a look.\n\n378\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.395\nWe do have all task,\n\n379\n00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:11.710\ntypically all task more often that not\nespecially in most of these consoles.\n\n380\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.770\nWhile it may involve other things\nmaybe backing up, exporting,\n\n381\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:18.080\ndepending on the console, it always\nwith that exception in both stopping and\n\n382\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.330\nstarting the services.\n\n383\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.440\nSo when you have to go do that,\nif you're looking for\n\n384\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.200\nwhere to do that, that's always gonna\nbe up under all tasks on the instance.\n\n385\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.120\nSo you'll see that there.\n\n386\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.770\nYour standard view,\ncustomized the interface, etc.\n\n387\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.820\nWe can go in, look at properties.\n\n388\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.080\nSo we're just gonna right\nclick our two properties here.\n\n389\n00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.008\nLet me bring this up so you can see this,\n\n390\n00:20:36.008 --> 00:20:38.650\nwithout going across to\nthe top of the VM window here.\n\n391\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.220\nAll right, so you can see we do have\nsome interesting property tabs,\n\n392\n00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.210\njust some things to note here.\n\n393\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.350\nOn the General area we have set\nthis ups as an IPv4 router, right?\n\n394\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.140\nWe're doing LAN routing only, but\n\n395\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:54.640\nnotice we can change the interface enable\nIPv6 support by setting up IPv6 routing.\n\n396\n00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.643\nI'm tripping over IPv this morning.\n\n397\n00:20:57.643 --> 00:20:59.537\nWe could set up four and\nsix based routing, there we go, right?\n\n398\n00:20:59.537 --> 00:21:01.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you've done it for\nso long.\n\n399\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.790\n&gt;&gt; I think I used up my quota for\nall of those on the IPv4 and IPv6 shows.\n\n400\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.140\nI think I no longer can say that cuz\nwe spent so much time talking about it.\n\n401\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.150\nSo IPv4 and\nIPv6 capabilities can be enabled here.\n\n402\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.030\nRemember, since we chose\njust initially to set it up\n\n403\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:22.200\nas a router we didn't enable the remote\naccess capabilities to do things like VPN.\n\n404\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.010\nWe could set those up and configure them\nhere and check off boxes to enable that,\n\n405\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.270\nbut we just basically set this up as\na router and nothing more initially.\n\n406\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.390\nSo, we'll just locate the options\nhere which is why certain things\n\n407\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.380\nhave not been checked off cuz we\ndidn't make choices to use them.\n\n408\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.900\nWe do have security here.\n\n409\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.240\nOur authentication providers and\nour accounting providers are here.\n\n410\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.050\nInteresting conversation, a lot of\ntimes people will get confused when\n\n411\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:50.190\nwe talk about authentication\nversus accounting, right?\n\n412\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.240\nAnd the idea of accounting is really the\nidea of the RADIUS portion of our program.\n\n413\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.770\nBeing able to use what's called AAA,\nauthorization, access control and\n\n414\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.660\naccounting is really just tracking\nusage and keeping track of\n\n415\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.250\nthrough logging the inbound and outbound\ntraffic that sessions are engaging in.\n\n416\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.460\nSo a RADIUS server or\n\n417\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.720\nRADIUS solution allows us to do\nthat tracking and that auditing.\n\n418\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.470\nAnd this is what ISPs among\nmany other organizations use.\n\n419\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.155\nAny of us that connect from home or\non Internet connection somewhere,\n\n420\n00:22:22.155 --> 00:22:26.135\nare most likely going through,\nif you're using an ISP to do that,\n\n421\n00:22:26.135 --> 00:22:30.290\nare going through one more RADIUS\nserver somewhere in that chain.\n\n422\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.500\nKeeping track of your session, what l\ndid to connect from, MAC address are you\n\n423\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.150\nusing, what kind of traffic are you\ngenerating, how long have you been there?\n\n424\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:42.180\nThat way you get up to no good, I'm not\nsuggesting you would I'm just pointing\n\n425\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.840\nout that if you get attempted to, remember\nthe dark side is the strong force, right?\n\n426\n00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.466\nIf you ever get tempted to go out and\nto engage in activities and\n\n427\n00:22:51.466 --> 00:22:56.550\nnefarious or perhaps ethical and legal,\nwe do have an ability to track that.\n\n428\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.720\nThat's why you get those nasty cease and\ndesist letters from ISPs every so\n\n429\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.700\noften, when either at your business,\n\n430\n00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.160\nsomebody is doing something\nthey're not supposed to do.\n\n431\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.610\nMaybe you're not aware of it, but maybe\nthey're doing file sharing or stuff like\n\n432\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.500\nthat, using one of those P2P clients, and\nthey're not supposed to be doing that.\n\n433\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.930\nAnd you'll get a letter from\nthe ISP essentially saying, hey,\n\n434\n00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.240\nby the way,\nthis activity was spotted on your network.\n\n435\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.224\nCut it out or we're gonna cut you off.\n\n436\n00:23:19.224 --> 00:23:21.494\nThey know you're doing that because\nthey're running RADIUS solutions.\n\n437\n00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:24.966\nSo the accounting capability here\nis what we're talking about and\n\n438\n00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:26.148\nthat's what that is.\n\n439\n00:23:26.148 --> 00:23:30.614\nThe authentication provider, you'll see\nwe can do this either through the RADIUS\n\n440\n00:23:30.614 --> 00:23:33.950\nauthentication or\nWindows authentication provider.\n\n441\n00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.900\nAnd we then have our authentication\nmethods that we can use here.\n\n442\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.490\nWe do have Extensible Authentication\nProtocol support, what we call EAP.\n\n443\n00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.120\nThis is a framework that\nallows us to extend and\n\n444\n00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.630\nadd additional authentication\nmechanism as they become available.\n\n445\n00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.879\nThings like smart card support, for\ninstance, is enabled through the use EAP.\n\n446\n00:23:52.879 --> 00:23:56.728\nAlso we do have Microsoft Encrypted\nAuthentication version 2.\n\n447\n00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:00.890\nWe usually just call that commonly\nMS-CHAPv2 So we do have MS-CHAP v2,\n\n448\n00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.830\nwe do have CHAP, that is the non-Microsoft\nversion of CHAP, just to be clear.\n\n449\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.710\nPAP, that's the unencrypted\nversion you should never,\n\n450\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.520\never use under any circumstances.\n\n451\n00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.010\nI made this point in my notes by the way,\njust to be clear for\n\n452\n00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.540\nyou, CHAP here is not\nMicrosoft CHAP as I said, but CHAP.\n\n453\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.531\nThere is two, there are as I should say,\nwe try that talking in the second,\n\n454\n00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:22.681\nthird, fourth, and\nfifth person earlier, right?\n\n455\n00:24:22.681 --> 00:24:25.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, there is and are, there are two\n\n456\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.495\nversions of Microsoft implemented CHAP\nthat have been around for some time.\n\n457\n00:24:29.495 --> 00:24:33.240\nMS-CHAP, which you do not see here and\nthe newer version,\n\n458\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.810\nnewer still being relatively old, it's\nbeen around for a while now, MS-CHAP v2.\n\n459\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.670\nNotice that we no longer support MS-CHAP,\nthat has been deprecated, it's gone,\n\n460\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.940\nwe only support MS-CHAP v2 on the\nMicrosoft-specific implementation of CHAP.\n\n461\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.130\nCHAP generically is the industry\nstandard version of CHAP.\n\n462\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:56.471\nSo CHAP and PAP are going to\nbe non-Microsoft specific.\n\n463\n00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:59.960\nAnd MS-CHAP v2 is\nthe Microsoft customized or\n\n464\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.580\ntweaked implementation of CHAP just so\nyou know.\n\n465\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.350\nI make the point in my notes that CHAP and\nPAP, although they are available,\n\n466\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.780\nalthough you can use them,\n\n467\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.400\nare not recommended because of the fact\nthat they are considered to be\n\n468\n00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.370\na vulnerable path especially\nbecause it just sends in the clear.\n\n469\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.510\nThere is really nothing more\nto say about it than that, so\n\n470\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.530\nthere is never a good reason to be\nusing PAP with one exception which is,\n\n471\n00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:28.440\nif you have very old clients or some sort\nof odd kind of a system that requires\n\n472\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.730\nthis because of a vendor specification\ndue to the way it configures and\n\n473\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.860\nconnects, you may have to provide that.\n\n474\n00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.370\nThat's really the only\nreason that it's still here.\n\n475\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.090\nOther than that there's really\nnever a good reason to be using PAP\n\n476\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.420\neven internally.\n\n477\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.980\nEven on private internal networks where\nyou're maybe doing routing internally\n\n478\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.170\nbetween different sites or\nwithin on the land different areas.\n\n479\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.300\nMaybe from production over to\ntesting that kind of thing.\n\n480\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.481\nThere's never a good reason to use PAP,\nbecause anybody who's an insider,\n\n481\n00:25:56.481 --> 00:26:00.919\nan insider threat in other words, somebody\nwho's an authorized employee on your\n\n482\n00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:03.363\nnetwork, looking at all that information,\n\n483\n00:26:03.363 --> 00:26:07.575\nthey're gonna see that stream in\nthe clear if they're network monitoring.\n\n484\n00:26:07.575 --> 00:26:11.705\nAnd as a result of that, we don't want to\nexpose usernames and passwords, right,\n\n485\n00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:13.419\nbecause that's just really bad.\n\n486\n00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:16.369\nSo I make the point in the notes,\njust to remind you, that CHAP and\n\n487\n00:26:16.369 --> 00:26:19.990\nPAP, although they're supported,\nare not recommended for use.\n\n488\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.860\nIn other words, if you're ever\nasked in the real world, you can\n\n489\n00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.386\ncertainly talk about the fact they are\nsupported but probably not recommended.\n\n490\n00:26:26.386 --> 00:26:31.870\nAnd, unless a vendor specifies there's\nsetting that requires this, and\n\n491\n00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.860\nyou have a discussion internally about the\nefficacy of doing this in a non-encrypted\n\n492\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.550\nway, you probably don't want to make\nthose choices, so just know that.\n\n493\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:44.489\nSo EAP-MSCHAPv2, certainly a machine\ncertificate authentication for\n\n494\n00:26:44.489 --> 00:26:47.324\nthe use and setup of L2TP/IPSec.\n\n495\n00:26:47.324 --> 00:26:51.386\nWe have IKEv2, so we do our key exchange,\ncertificate exchange and stuff like that.\n\n496\n00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:54.474\nSo we do have that capability here\non authenticated access, right,\n\n497\n00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:58.010\nwe actually just allow systems to\nconnect without authentication.\n\n498\n00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:03.510\nQuite honestly, if you had to choose and\ntheoretically a scenario or word problem\n\n499\n00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.020\nor a hey what's the right answer gonna\nbe to get this question right activity.\n\n500\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.480\nAnd you were given solution or a scenario\nthat forced you to make a choice between\n\n501\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.240\nusing PAP, CHAP, and/or allow\nconnectivity without authentication.\n\n502\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.600\nYou'd have to think long and\nhard about which one to do.\n\n503\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.400\nDepending on the parameters of\nthe question, essentially connect without\n\n504\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.340\nauthentication may actually be\na better choice than using PAP and\n\n505\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.240\nexposing user names and passwords.\n\n506\n00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.990\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n507\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.470\nSo just wanna think about that and\n\n508\n00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.140\njust make sure that you\nare thinking along those lines.\n\n509\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.680\nSo, we do have\nauthentication methods here.\n\n510\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.230\nYou would check off obviously and\n\n511\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.460\nengage the appropriate choices\nbased on what you wanna do.\n\n512\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.880\nFor accounting, you'll see we do have\nthe radius solution as well as the Windows\n\n513\n00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.135\nsupported solution internally,\nin other words.\n\n514\n00:27:49.135 --> 00:27:53.103\nWe have that and then Andrew we have none,\nwe can specify what we want there,\n\n515\n00:27:53.103 --> 00:27:57.195\nwe can set up IP set policies for LTTPI\nconnections just mentioned we can use IKE\n\n516\n00:27:57.195 --> 00:27:59.372\nfor the key exchange there so we see that.\n\n517\n00:27:59.372 --> 00:28:04.204\nSSL certificate binding could be\nspecified here as well, we have some very\n\n518\n00:28:04.204 --> 00:28:09.265\ninteresting options we can go ahead and\nspecify what our certificates would be\n\n519\n00:28:09.265 --> 00:28:14.670\nto use the SSTP option, the secure socket\ntunneling protocol, for our VPN's.\n\n520\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.810\nWe'll talk more about SSTP and get into\nthat in probably our next episode,\n\n521\n00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.210\njust in an upcoming conversation-\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n522\n00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.120\n&gt;&gt; As we walk through and\n\n523\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.190\nactually continue some of the demo here,\nreally just over viewing some things.\n\n524\n00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.440\nBut SSTP support is a newer\nsupport option in the VPN and\n\n525\n00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.760\nallows us to do secure socket tunneling.\n\n526\n00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.930\nSo we're able to essentially do this\non bind with our SSL listener and\n\n527\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.410\nprovide a certificate to enable that.\n\n528\n00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.360\nSo we can set that up if we'd like.\n\n529\n00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.900\nIPv4 address assignments, you'll see here.\n\n530\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.760\nWe can either use DHCP and/or Static Pool,\nso you can see we can go in and do that.\n\n531\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.700\nWe do have the ability here on\nIPv6 to essentially set up and\n\n532\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.490\nenable forwarding,\ndefault router advertisements.\n\n533\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.570\nRemember, we provide configuration\ninformation to the hosts for\n\n534\n00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.950\nIPv6 through router advertisements\ntraditionally, right?\n\n535\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.520\nSo we're not relying on DHCP for as much\ncuz we're probably gonna get a lot of that\n\n536\n00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.340\nfrom our router advertisement,\nor at least some of it anyway.\n\n537\n00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.166\nThings like a DNS specification for\na DNS server,\n\n538\n00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:14.184\nwould have to come through\nthe DHCP option, right?\n\n539\n00:29:14.184 --> 00:29:18.020\nWhere we get the router advertisers and\ntells us to go and use the DHCP server.\n\n540\n00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.790\nBut basic information for\n\n541\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.610\nIPv6 addressing will typically\ncome from a router advertisement.\n\n542\n00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.670\nSo we've talked about that in\nour IPv6 overview episode.\n\n543\n00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.790\nSo, just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n544\n00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.850\nWe do have settings for\nIKEv2, just the controls and\n\n545\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.915\nthe timeout settings\naround the connections.\n\n546\n00:29:32.915 --> 00:29:36.860\nRRSA associations, in terms of\nhow we negotiate our connectivity\n\n547\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.230\nagreements going in each direction, cuz\nthey're gonna be [COUGH] unidirectional.\n\n548\n00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.930\nSo we need two of them to connect and\n\n549\n00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.700\nactually be able to use L2TP\nin both directions with IPsec.\n\n550\n00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.630\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n551\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.310\nOur PPP solutions here, our point to point\nprotocol solutions are supported, so\n\n552\n00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.970\nyou know very old kind of first\ngeneration, routing protocol support for\n\n553\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.820\ntunneling so we can see them here.\n\n554\n00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.578\nAnd then of course our login\ninformation on the interface as well.\n\n555\n00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:06.930\nBy default typically,\non most interfaces, in most systems,\n\n556\n00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.950\nin most consoles, we're usually logging\nerrors and warnings, pretty standard.\n\n557\n00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.035\nBut you'll see we can specify\nthat we wanna change that up,\n\n558\n00:30:14.035 --> 00:30:19.130\nyou do all events as well, don't log\nevents, log additional information,\n\n559\n00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.560\nthat's the equivalent of\nverbose routing for debugging.\n\n560\n00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.510\nSo we'll be able to manipulate and\nmodify what we wanna do here.\n\n561\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.630\nSo these are all the properties\nthat are up here on the server.\n\n562\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.730\nAnd then we get into our interface areas,\nand\n\n563\n00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.930\nwe'll take a look at some of these in the\nupcoming conversations, as we go in and\n\n564\n00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.440\nstart to play around a little\nbit more with the configuration.\n\n565\n00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.530\nJust really wanted to give you an overview\nof what the service provides, how it looks\n\n566\n00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.870\nwhen the go through and initially choose\nto configure it, and what those settings\n\n567\n00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.380\nlook like initially on the property areas\nas we begin to delve a little bit deeper\n\n568\n00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.180\ninto the mysteries of our wrath\n&gt;&gt; The mystery, so thank you so much for\n\n569\n00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.480\nshowing us the basic navigation in\ngetting act committed there but\n\n570\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.500\nlike you had mentioned you really gotta\ndive in and practice for yourself, but\n\n571\n00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.670\nI wanted to point something out\nsomeone had noted in chat there,\n\n572\n00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.060\nthat you are utilizing\ncertain domain controllers.\n\n573\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.730\nThey saw the naming convention for\nthe P-LAB, which stands for\n\n574\n00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.530\npractice lab, which you should have access\nto with your account, so I just wanted to\n\n575\n00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.510\nremind you its It's great to build\nup your own virtual environment, but\n\n576\n00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:18.590\nsome of the topics that we have been and\nwill be discussing are rather involved.\n\n577\n00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.770\nThey require quite the setup.\n\n578\n00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.290\nSo, please take advantage of the labs\nthat you guys already have access to, and\n\n579\n00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.610\njust keep that in mind.\n\n580\n00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.770\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n581\n00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.210\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n582\n00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n583\n00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.753\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.tv.\n\n584\n00:31:32.753 -->

00:00:11.567\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:15.538\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Networking\nWith Windows Server 2016 Series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:18.050\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.000\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at remote access.\n\n7\n00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900\nWe've taken a look at several different\ncomponents, different interfaces and\n\n8\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.110\ndifferent ways we could set\nup routing a remote access.\n\n9\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.066\nBut back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.187\nAnd I think we're gonna be talking\nabout something else a little bit more\n\n11\n00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:34.650\npolicy driven?\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.361\n&gt;&gt; We are, we are gonna talk about or\n\n13\n00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:40.533\ncontinue talking about the general thought\nprocess of routing a remote access.\n\n14\n00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.569\nBut we're gonna drill in on an interesting\nfeature called network policy server,.\n\n15\n00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.329\nYou would most likely, generically,\nthink of this as RADIUS.\n\n16\n00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.750\nThis is essentially\nMicrosoft's RADIUS solution.\n\n17\n00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.000\nAnd we're gonna go through and\njust talk about what it is.\n\n18\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.300\nWe'll give you a quick overview here for\njust a moment or two, hit the highlights.\n\n19\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.210\nThen we're gonna go and\nwe're gonna configure it.\n\n20\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.240\nI've got the role already set\nup on one of our servers.\n\n21\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.670\nWe'll walk through how to set that up.\n\n22\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.560\nWe'll flip back over, take a look at the\nrouting and remote access server, again.\n\n23\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.360\nThis time, unlike our last walk-through\nwhere I had already configured it and\n\n24\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.957\nwe set it up just for LAN routing.\n\n25\n00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:13.666\nWe're gonna actually walk through and\nconfigure it, and\n\n26\n00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.810\nthis time we'll set it up for VPN access.\n\n27\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.940\nSo you'll see me set that up,\nwe'll talk through that.\n\n28\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.070\nWe'll be doing some additional discussions\non upcoming episodes on VPN anyway.\n\n29\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.900\nBut it's never bad to\nsee this more than once.\n\n30\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.160\nCuz it's the kind of thing\nthat the more you do,\n\n31\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.340\nthe more you're comfortable with and,\nobviously, the better off you are.\n\n32\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.980\nSo let's talk about network\npolicy service for just a minute.\n\n33\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.860\nPart of the idea here,\nultimately, of using routing and\n\n34\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.760\nremote access is the ability to be able\nto understand what people are doing,\n\n35\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.910\nwhere they're coming from.\n\n36\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.000\nAnd control, potentially, the conditions\nthat allow them to connect in remotely.\n\n37\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.720\nAnd the name implies what we do,\nnetwork policies, network policy server.\n\n38\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.141\nWe're setting up policies.\n\n39\n00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:53.940\nWe're attempting to specify what kind\nof control we would like to exert,\n\n40\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.590\nwhether it's a connection request policy\nwhich is what we will use traditionally.\n\n41\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.620\nMaybe time of day, maybe the realm name or\n\n42\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.320\nthe domain name we're coming from,\nmaybe the type of request we're using.\n\n43\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.110\nMaybe the IP address of the machine\nthat we're connecting from.\n\n44\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.810\nThe RADIUS client would be\nthe machine we're connecting in from.\n\n45\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.490\nAny or all of those things could be\nused to be specified as a policy element\n\n46\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340\nthat will allow us to say allow or\ndeny right?\n\n47\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.950\nSo we're gonna bring all that stuff in,\nso this is kind of cool.\n\n48\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.730\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of cool.\n\n49\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.360\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of cool.\n\n50\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.090\n&gt;&gt; And in my mind, so\n[LAUGH] that's a scary place to be.\n\n51\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.635\nBut it's almost like a bouncer but with\n\n52\n00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:36.590\na explicit set of parameters or rules that\nwe have to follow like a set of rules.\n\n53\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.740\nAnd so I don't know if that\nwill make sense to you, but\n\n54\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.400\nlet's listen to what Adam has to say.\n\n55\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.920\nAnd see if you can relate it, perhaps, in\nthat way, or a way that is better for you.\n\n56\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.971\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to the bar analogy,\nthe brawling bar analogy.\n\n57\n00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of like some sort of\ntoll gate that is, yeah, they set forth\n\n58\n00:02:51.812 --> 00:02:55.214\nthese rules and you have to-\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so we would call those,\n\n59\n00:02:55.214 --> 00:03:01.150\nspecifically, it is so important to be\nable to speak each other's language.\n\n60\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.790\nAnd it's shocking to me that I actually am\nnot only in that head space, but you and\n\n61\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.720\nI understand each other, which is awesome.\n\n62\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.655\nSo, let me translate, more or less,\nin terms of what we're talking about.\n\n63\n00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.727\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nthat is what Adam is here for.\n\n64\n00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:14.232\n&gt;&gt; Let's take that Cherokee-ism and\nactually unwind it so\n\n65\n00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:15.230\nwe can understand it.\n\n66\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.030\nSo what Cherokee is implying and, indeed,\nshe's absolutely correct when she talks\n\n67\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.310\nabout this, is the idea that we\nhave this pre-made thought process.\n\n68\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.238\nSometimes we call it a template,\nwe're not gonna refer to it that way here.\n\n69\n00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.162\nBut just to give you a general\nsense of what it is,\n\n70\n00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:31.972\nwe would called it a template, or in this\ncase, a default connection request policy.\n\n71\n00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:33.450\nWhich is what we actually call it.\n\n72\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.830\nWhich is already set up as\nwe configure the NPS and\n\n73\n00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.350\nis there to operate much like the default\nresponse rule would be on a firewall.\n\n74\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.600\nYou either block all traffic, or deny\nall,unless we program in rules that will\n\n75\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.780\nopen up or allow certain traffic flows.\n\n76\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.950\nWe want a default behavior, a fallback\noption, for response and for management.\n\n77\n00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.690\nSo that way,\n\n78\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.260\nthe system is working even if we don't\ndo anything other than just stand it up.\n\n79\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.376\nAnd so we do have what we call\ndefault connection request policy.\n\n80\n00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:04.440\nIt is created when you install and\nconfigure NPS.\n\n81\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.400\nWe'll talk about, or at least I'll just\nquickly go through the logic with you\n\n82\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.210\nhere, what the conditions are for it.\n\n83\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.620\nThere's six things\nspecifically assigned or\n\n84\n00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.240\ndefined inside this default connection\npolicy, or this connection request policy.\n\n85\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.140\nYears ago,\nwhen I was in the music business,\n\n86\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.050\nbecause I did many things when I\nwas much shorter in the tooth.\n\n87\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.610\nAnd I was in the music business for many\nyears doing a variety of different things.\n\n88\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.710\nAnd one of the things when I was\npromoting, doing night clubs,\n\n89\n00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.050\nall sorts of stuff, we had the big\nburly people you were talking about.\n\n90\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.310\nBouncers, very nice people by the way.\n\n91\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.240\nAnd they were given a set of\ninstructions based on the kind of\n\n92\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.790\nnight we were doing or\nperhaps the nightclub in question.\n\n93\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.980\nWhether we were promoting\nthis kind of a night or\n\n94\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.390\nthat kind of a night here or there.\n\n95\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.740\nThey were given, essentially,\n\n96\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.100\nthis kind of thing you were talking about,\nthese instructions.\n\n97\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.860\nWe meet with our staff ahead of time,\nbefore we spun the night up.\n\n98\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.810\nAnd said, okay, look,\n\n99\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.270\nhere's the deal, these are the kind\nof people we're expecting.\n\n100\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.000\nWe're doing this kind of a night,\nthese people show up, they get in.\n\n101\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.890\nThese people show up, they don't get in,\nwhatever the case is.\n\n102\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.220\nAnd you would make sure everybody\nknew what the expectation was.\n\n103\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.090\nYou met with the bartenders,\nyou met with the bouncing staff,\n\n104\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.280\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.140\nAnd it was really important because that\nway you eliminated surprises, right?\n\n106\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.360\nAnd you didn't have to\nworry about whether or\n\n107\n00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.900\nnot you would have somebody\nmaking a decision that, perhaps,\n\n108\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.360\ndid or didn't line up with, right,\nthe goal and what you wanted to have done.\n\n109\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.590\nAnd that's what this\ndefault policy will be, or\n\n110\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.508\nany policy that we create really is.\n\n111\n00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:29.470\nIt's a top-down vision and a direction,\nso that we understand how to operate.\n\n112\n00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.900\nAnd so what are the conditions that\nare created inside this policy?\n\n113\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.610\nAuthentication is not configured\nin the policy by default,\n\n114\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.400\nmeaning we would have\nto specify what it is.\n\n115\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.500\nAccounting is not configured,\n\n116\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.620\nforward accounting information\nout to remote RADIUS servers.\n\n117\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.520\nWe call the RADIUS servers that are remote\nfrom the NPS server if we're using\n\n118\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.880\nthe NPS server as a RADIUS server,\nwe call them remote RADIUS servers.\n\n119\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.710\nWe put them into what are called\nremote RADIUS server groups.\n\n120\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.620\nJust a logical association, a little\ncontainer that we manage our remote RADIUS\n\n121\n00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.100\nservers with, that we're gonna be sending\nand receiving information to and from.\n\n122\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.480\nAttribute manipulation is not configured\nwith rules that are gonna change or\n\n123\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.810\nmodify in any way.\n\n124\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.070\nForwarding requests is turned on.\n\n125\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.190\nWhich means that we can, or that\nthe local network I should say, the local\n\n126\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.670\nnetwork policy server will authenticate\nand authorize connection requests.\n\n127\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.520\nBut that is the only thing that,\nessentially,\n\n128\n00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.450\nwe're configuring as part of this policy.\n\n129\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.979\nMeaning we'll allow inbound\nconnections to show up.\n\n130\n00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.233\nAnd we'll be able to forward them but\nwe're not gonna to be able to do anything\n\n131\n00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:28.010\nor the more advanced feature\nsets out of the box by default.\n\n132\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.190\nNo advanced attributes are configured and\n\n133\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.960\nthe default connection request policy\nuses the NPS server as the RADIUS server.\n\n134\n00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.290\nMeaning we essentially program the system\nas a RADIUS server out of the box\n\n135\n00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.050\nwith the ability to be able to\njust simply interact with and\n\n136\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.700\nunderstand inbound connections,\nbut nothing beyond that.\n\n137\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.840\nAnything beyond that, we have to program\nin and, obviously, go in and configure.\n\n138\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.580\nSo we would create our network policies,\nwhich are essentially these sets of\n\n139\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.250\nconditions that we would like\nto be able to work with,\n\n140\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.520\nor specify that we're going to have.\n\n141\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.040\nTheir constraints, conditions,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n142\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.540\nAnd policies have four\ndifferent categories\n\n143\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.049\nof properties that we\nwould often work with.\n\n144\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.530\nAnd we'll take a look at what these are.\n\n145\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.930\nBut we have conditions,\n\n146\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.200\nconstraints, there's an overview area,\nI think general settings.\n\n147\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.770\nAnd then there's an overall set of\nsettings that we go through that\n\n148\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.420\nare applied to the connection request.\n\n149\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.130\nAnd we'll take a look\nquickly in the interface, and\n\n150\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.350\nkinda give you a sense\nof what this looks like.\n\n151\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.660\nSo let's go in and let's actually\ntake a look real quick here.\n\n152\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.310\nWe'll get ready to start configuring.\n\n153\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.160\nSo we have our NPS server role set up and\nestablished.\n\n154\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.000\nI've gone in through PowerShell,\n\n155\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.370\nas we often do ahead of time just to\nstand this up and configure it so\n\n156\n00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.165\nyou're not waiting on 10 or\n15 minutes worth of installation to occur.\n\n157\n00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.960\nAdd-windowsFeature NPS,\nNetwork Policy Server.\n\n158\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.740\nAs always, include management tools.\n\n159\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.016\nYou'll see we were successful,\nwe got that stood up.\n\n160\n00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.750\nSo that was the only thing\nwe did ahead of time.\n\n161\n00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.009\nThen we just went into the server manager,\n\n162\n00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.591\nopened up the network\npolicy server interface.\n\n163\n00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:55.322\nSo we just went in here you'll see\nNPAS is installed, now unlike Which,\n\n164\n00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:57.463\nremember, we did some walk throughs on,\n\n165\n00:07:57.463 --> 00:08:01.830\nwe showed you we managed directly through\nthe server manager in the dashboard page.\n\n166\n00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.060\nWe don't do that here\nlike most of the tools.\n\n167\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.376\nWe do have an MMC specifically for it.\n\n168\n00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:07.556\nSo, let's go to the tools area.\n\n169\n00:08:07.556 --> 00:08:11.430\nWe'll just go in Network\npolicy server right there.\n\n170\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.810\nWe just click on that to open it up,\nwhich we've already done.\n\n171\n00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.100\nAnd so we just have this stood up and\nenabled, and\n\n172\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.150\nall I did was just slide the bar\nover here a little to the right to\n\n173\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.300\nlet you see the remote radius\nserver group item, right?\n\n174\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.087\nSo we've got got all that configured.\n\n175\n00:08:23.087 --> 00:08:27.457\nWe're gonna go ahead now, and before I\nactually go in and before I set up a new\n\n176\n00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:31.689\nradius client or set up a radius client,\nlet's take a look at some of those\n\n177\n00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:36.090\npolicies we were just talking about,\nor at least the idea behind them.\n\n178\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.610\nSo we do have over here a policies area,\nas you can see.\n\n179\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.810\nI'm just gonna open this up, and\nyou'll see connection request policies.\n\n180\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.090\nAnd you'll see we do have our\nWindows authentication for\n\n181\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.630\nall users default policy\nthat we spoke about.\n\n182\n00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.270\nThat's created out of the box, that's\nthe one we were just taking a look at, or\n\n183\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.420\nat least talking about.\n\n184\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.940\nWe do have, you'll see there,\nnetwork policies to them,\n\n185\n00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.058\nconnections to other access servers.\n\n186\n00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:01.970\nConnections to.\n\n187\n00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.190\nYou'll see those are denying access,\nthey are enabled.\n\n188\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.180\nSo we have a couple of policies,\nthree to be precise, that are set up and\n\n189\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.310\nare enabled, as we configure in.\n\n190\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.700\nI don't have to do anything,\nthose just come in, out of the box.\n\n191\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.720\nAnd we'll go in and we'll take\na look at them in just a minute.\n\n192\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.695\nWe do have under templates here as well,\nor templates I should say,\n\n193\n00:09:20.695 --> 00:09:23.500\nthe ability to look at shared secrets,\nright?\n\n194\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.330\nSo you know what those are.\n\n195\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.326\nThose are traditionally\ngonna be just passwords.\n\n196\n00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:31.240\nWe have radius clients,\nwe have radius servers, right?\n\n197\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.960\nAnd we have IP filters, right?\n\n198\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.340\nSo we can create, as you'll see here,\n\n199\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.840\na new template in any one of these areas\nto specify how we wanna program or\n\n200\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.520\nconfigure something if we wanna use that\ntemplate as we would often do to be able\n\n201\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.620\nto create multiple copies of something and\ndeploy, we could do that here.\n\n202\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.350\nWe're not gonna worry about that for\nthe moment.\n\n203\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.970\nBut just so\nyou can see that we have that information.\n\n204\n00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.130\nWe have an accounting area here as well.\n\n205\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.500\nRemember, one of the primary\nfunctions of radius,\n\n206\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.430\nwe talk about radius as being\na triple A solution, right?\n\n207\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.800\nAuthorization, Access control,\nand Accounting, right?\n\n208\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.210\nSo we're bringing in\nthe idea of the accounting,\n\n209\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.590\nthe function that monitors, audits,\nand keeps track of session and\n\n210\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.550\nstate, and tallies up what we're doing,\nwhere we're doing it to.\n\n211\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.155\nEssentially is, for lack of a better way\nof describing it, spying on us, right?\n\n212\n00:10:15.155 --> 00:10:18.085\nCuz it's the big brother functionality.\n\n213\n00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.545\nBut it's the auditing, the capability\nto understand the connections and\n\n214\n00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:22.815\nwhat's going through the server,\nand keeping track of all that,\n\n215\n00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:24.185\nthat accounting speaks to.\n\n216\n00:10:24.185 --> 00:10:26.950\nAnd so, you'll see we have the ability\nhere to configure accounting.\n\n217\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.840\nWe have the ability to look at\nlog files and properties, and\n\n218\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.700\nchange what we're logging and\nunderstand how that's happening.\n\n219\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.760\nCurrently, we're logging to the default\ndirectory of Windows System32 log files.\n\n220\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.580\nWe could setup SQL Server logging, and\nchange the SQL Server logging properties,\n\n221\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.480\nif we wanna go in and modify that.\n\n222\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.380\nCurrently not setup.\n\n223\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.190\nWe could specify we want to log there.\n\n224\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.460\nSo we have different options, right?\n\n225\n00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.160\nAnd we can go in and specify how\nthis is going to be configured.\n\n226\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.290\nBut let's start right up here\nwith our radius clients, right?\n\n227\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.190\nNothing there yet.\n\n228\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.550\nBut what we're going to do is right-click,\ncreate a new radius client.\n\n229\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.620\nMove this over so\nyou can see that while we're talking.\n\n230\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.190\nAll right, and so, what we're gonna\ndo is setup a new RADIUS client.\n\n231\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.500\nSo we'll click New here.\n\n232\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.164\nGonna give it a name.\n\n233\n00:11:08.164 --> 00:11:15.690\nI'm gonna specify that this is our Plab,\njust do that.\n\n234\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.490\nDC01, name it for the machine that we are\ngoing to be using as the radius client,\n\n235\n00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.750\nwhatever the machine name is\nyour gonna use, obviously.\n\n236\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.130\nAnd the address, the IP or\nDNS information for it again.\n\n237\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.525\nYeah, you'd want to know what\nthis in your your environment.\n\n238\n00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:33.185\nWe're just using the presets\nfrom our demo environment here.\n\n239\n00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:37.515\nYou would substitute in whatever\nthe specifics are for your environment.\n\n240\n00:11:37.515 --> 00:11:40.145\nGot the button right over here,\nthe big verify button, right?\n\n241\n00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:43.072\nSo we're gonna click\nthere just to make sure.\n\n242\n00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:44.327\nGo and resolve.\n\n243\n00:11:44.327 --> 00:11:46.512\nSee it drops our IP address down in there.\n\n244\n00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:49.772\nMeaning that it does understand and\nfind that IP and that it is active.\n\n245\n00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:52.302\nSo always wanna check that and\njust make sure.\n\n246\n00:11:52.302 --> 00:11:55.159\nIf you have an error, if you put in\nthe wrong address, something's not right,\n\n247\n00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:57.762\nrouting's not working, there's some\nsort of issue or concern there,\n\n248\n00:11:57.762 --> 00:12:00.600\nyou'll get an error and you'll obviously\nwill go out and fix it at that point.\n\n249\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.418\nSo once we have all that and\nwe choose that, we're good.\n\n250\n00:12:03.418 --> 00:12:05.370\nThen, we have our shared secret down here.\n\n251\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.850\nRemember, we said shared secrets are\nreally nothing more than just passwords.\n\n252\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.370\nSo, select an existing\nshared secret template.\n\n253\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.948\nRemember, I showed you the template.\n\n254\n00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:16.705\nIf I'd programmed one in already that has\nthat, then I could just go grab it and\n\n255\n00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:21.595\nsay, I want the Windows Server 12 R2\nweb server shared secret template, or\n\n256\n00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:22.705\nwhatever I called it.\n\n257\n00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:25.975\nAnd I would have that pre-made one that\nI would pop in, it would be applied, and\n\n258\n00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:29.667\nthat would have all the configuration\ninformation necessary.\n\n259\n00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.047\nDon't have that, we haven't created one.\n\n260\n00:12:31.047 --> 00:12:31.917\nNo big deal.\n\n261\n00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:36.077\nWe have an option here, as you can see,\nto manually set up the shared secret or\n\n262\n00:12:36.077 --> 00:12:38.327\nhave the system autogenerate one for us.\n\n263\n00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:41.097\nSo that way, it's a random value so\nto speak, right?\n\n264\n00:12:41.097 --> 00:12:42.757\nBut we're gonna just\nmanually put one in here.\n\n265\n00:12:42.757 --> 00:12:45.177\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n266\n00:12:45.177 --> 00:12:46.555\nUse our super secret password.\n\n267\n00:12:48.532 --> 00:12:49.940\nIt's password.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.960\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell Cherokee, she doesn't know.\n\n269\n00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.570\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say, I can tell,\n\n270\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.420\nI can hear the sarcasm in\nyour voice when you say that.\n\n271\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.204\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell her,\nshe doesn't know what it is.\n\n272\n00:12:56.204 --> 00:12:57.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We keep it a secret from her,\n\n273\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.420\nthat way she can't go in there and\ndo demos when I'm not around.\n\n274\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.340\nAll right, so we have our password,\nreally secret password, called password.\n\n275\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.740\nKeep it really simple here, that way,\n\n276\n00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.720\nI don't have to worry about typing\ncomplex stuff and forget what it is.\n\n277\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.660\nAll right, so we have all that.\n\n278\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.850\nWe're gonna put that in now.\n\n279\n00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.945\nThe other thing we're gonna do here is,\nbefore we finish up, and I'm not done yet,\n\n280\n00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:17.443\nbecause I'm gonna go the advanced tab,\nright?.\n\n281\n00:13:17.443 --> 00:13:20.600\nSo, we're gonna go over here,\nwe've basically set up our initial\n\n282\n00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.070\nconfiguration, told us what the name is,\nthe IP address.\n\n283\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.250\nSo, what we're gonna do is specify\nto shared secret turned on, or\n\n284\n00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.140\nspecify we would like to\nenable our radius client.\n\n285\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.540\nBut what we have to do is\ncome over here as well, and\n\n286\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.060\nyou'll see on the advance\ntab we can set up or enable\n\n287\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.800\nthe access request messages must contain\nthe message authenticator attribute.\n\n288\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.540\nWe're gonna check that off, allowing us to\nspecify that we're gonna need that message\n\n289\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.520\nauthenticator attribute as part of\nwhat we are expecting when we connect\n\n290\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.820\nto verify and validate that\nthe client should be allowed.\n\n291\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.660\nSo we're going to set that up.\n\n292\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.410\nChoose that here.\n\n293\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.490\nYou'll notice that we do have other\nRadius vendors that we can choose.\n\n294\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.210\nWe're just doing Radius standard,\ngenerically supported.\n\n295\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.520\nBut notice, there are a bunch of specific\nvendors that provide Radius services, and\n\n296\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.180\nwe may be able to choose\na solution from any one of them.\n\n297\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.770\nAnd I'm sure, if you look closely,\nyou'll probably recognize one or\n\n298\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.590\nmore names on that list.\n\n299\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.980\nThere's Zylogics, there's US Robotics,\nthere's Intel, right?\n\n300\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.648\nThere are things like Free Com, right?\n\n301\n00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:18.680\nSo there's all sorts of\ndifferent ones on here.\n\n302\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.515\nCISCO, right?\n\n303\n00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:20.920\nDG International.\n\n304\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.543\nThere's a whole bunch\nthat are listed here.\n\n305\n00:14:22.543 --> 00:14:24.058\nNortel is there, right?\n\n306\n00:14:24.058 --> 00:14:25.634\nMicrosoft is there, of course, right?\n\n307\n00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:30.417\nSo we're just gonna have the option here,\ndepending on what we're doing, to specify.\n\n308\n00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:33.827\nSo we'll be able to do that if we\nhave a specific Radiant client,\n\n309\n00:14:33.827 --> 00:14:38.800\nmeaning a client coming from one of those\nvendors that we're gonna wanna use, right?\n\n310\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.070\nWe could then specify,\nright, what that may be.\n\n311\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.372\nBut we're using a generic one.\n\n312\n00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:45.420\nRadius standard means essentially\nit's like an HP print driver,\n\n313\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.950\nit works with basically anything.\n\n314\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.427\nBut keep in mind that if you have,\nmaybe you're NorTel-centric or\n\n315\n00:14:51.427 --> 00:14:54.220\nyou're Cisco-centric and\nyou're using their infrastructure,\n\n316\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.920\nyou're gonna have most\nlikely their RADIUS client.\n\n317\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.040\nAnd as a result, you would have to\nspecify that on this connection so\n\n318\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.570\nthat the server understands you're\ncoming in with a specific client,\n\n319\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.860\nand it's gonna communicate a certain way,\nand\n\n320\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.000\nthat toggle there just tells the server\nto accept that inbound client and\n\n321\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.200\nwork with it, and essentially learn how to\nspeak, right, quote unquote that language.\n\n322\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.980\nSo just allows for the vagaries and the\nspecificity of that particular client's\n\n323\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.540\nunique connection strength, things of\nthat nature, that's all we're doing.\n\n324\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.030\nSo, we're just specifying\nthe client there, if we need to.\n\n325\n00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.090\nWe're not going to, we're gonna choose\nstandard, but it's up to us to decide.\n\n326\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.870\nWere you going to say something?\n\n327\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:27.680\nI'm just gonna click OK.\n\n328\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.372\n&gt;&gt; I was, but\nI don't really know how related it is.\n\n329\n00:15:29.372 --> 00:15:33.123\nOn that drop-down list, and\nwhen you said generic, I guess Cisco-\n\n330\n00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:34.439\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n331\n00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:36.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, Radius is,\n\n332\n00:15:36.175 --> 00:15:40.580\ngenerically speaking, and they almost\ncategorize it kind of generically as well.\n\n333\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.000\nBecause they just put CISCO there,\nand I don't see Tack X or Tack X Plus.\n\n334\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.360\nIt's not going into that specific detail.\n\n335\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.384\nI was just kind of, it was a little\ninteresting to look at that.\n\n336\n00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:52.872\n&gt;&gt; Well, number one, generically,\nall we're doing is specifying the vendor\n\n337\n00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:55.769\nthere so that, again,\nthe inbound connection Is programmed so\n\n338\n00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:58.934\nthat when the server picks it up and\nsays you're a Radius client,\n\n339\n00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:02.730\nlet me check my list here, make sure\nI've got a listing for you essentially.\n\n340\n00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.419\nOr to use the bouncer analogy,\n\n341\n00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:04.675\nlet me look at my guest list\nto make sure you're listed.\n\n342\n00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:06.916\n&gt;&gt; Are you allowed [LAUGH]?\n\n343\n00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:08.571\n&gt;&gt; And you've got the right check or\nwhatever next to your name.\n\n344\n00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.025\nAll we're doing is making sure\nthe server understands that\n\n345\n00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:13.680\nwe may be coming in with\na vendor specific choice.\n\n346\n00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.205\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we can be specific in our\n\n347\n00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:18.647\nprogramming of the client to further\nspecify that the client will come\n\n348\n00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:19.185\nthat way.\n\n349\n00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:22.080\nAnd that's really all we're doing,\nis just specifying that.\n\n350\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.820\nSo, you're right,\n\n351\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.510\nCisco has a couple of different versions\nin theory of support for Radius.\n\n352\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.970\nThere are, by vendor on that list,\nmultiple ways to implement Radius.\n\n353\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.212\nIt's really just a vendor association,\nthat we're specifying right there.\n\n354\n00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n355\n00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've got that setup,\nso we've done that.\n\n356\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.610\nNow what we're gonna do, is remember\nI showed you the accounting area.\n\n357\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.810\nWe're gonna go ahead and just play\naround in there for just a minute.\n\n358\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.220\nWe've got our Radius client enabled there,\nRadius standard,\n\n359\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.960\nstatus enabled, very simple,\nnot very difficult to set up and enable.\n\n360\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.870\nAnd obviously we would create a list\nwith multiple clients depending on\n\n361\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.370\nhow many we're gonna support,\n\n362\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.550\nspecifically client types of connections\nthat we're gonna support I should say.\n\n363\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.100\nBut let's go in,\nlet's take a look at this accounting area.\n\n364\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.556\nWe'll go in, we could take a look\nat the log file properties.\n\n365\n00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:05.720\nI told you, we can go in and\nchange these, if we wanted to.\n\n366\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.630\nSo let's go in here, just take a look.\n\n367\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.128\nThis is where we can specify.\n\n368\n00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.977\nAnd we've talked about this before,\n\n369\n00:17:11.977 --> 00:17:15.110\nthe kinds of information that\nwe're gonna be logging, right?\n\n370\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.930\nSo we can go in,\n\n371\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.110\nand you'll see here, we could specify,\nas well as the location, by the way.\n\n372\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.070\nWe'll do that on the other tab for\nlog file.\n\n373\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.230\nBut things like accounting request,\nauthentication, periodic accounting and\n\n374\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.000\nauthentication status updates.\n\n375\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.311\nIf logging fails,\ndiscard connection request meaning,\n\n376\n00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:35.170\nif logging were to fail for\nwhatever reason, stop the connection.\n\n377\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.930\nMeaning essentially we break\nthe connection if you can't log it.\n\n378\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.213\nWhich is good because that means you don't\nallow anybody into the system unless\n\n379\n00:17:41.213 --> 00:17:44.253\nwe can keep track of what they're doing,\nwhich is actually a good thing,\n\n380\n00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:45.300\nif you think about that.\n\n381\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.020\nAnd we do have the ability here with\nlog files to specify a default path or\n\n382\n00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.000\nchange that, pretty common.\n\n383\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.560\nWe do, and\n\n384\n00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.530\nthis is important, we can specify\nthe different formats we wanna log with.\n\n385\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.110\nAnd I know maybe hard to see, maybe we can\ngo full screen for just a second on this.\n\n386\n00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.090\nCuz it is important just to\nbe able to see these three.\n\n387\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.160\nYou'll see we have DTS compliant,\nwe have ODBC Legacy, and IAS Legacy.\n\n388\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.670\nInternet Authentication Server\nis what IAS is,\n\n389\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.900\nthat's Microsoft's older version\nof this thought process.\n\n390\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.500\nSo we have the ability here, right,\nto be able to log in different formats.\n\n391\n00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.539\nAnd it depends on what we're doing,\nthe standard format more often than not\n\n392\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.100\nthat we would probably use would\nbe ODBC Legacy, it is the default.\n\n393\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.558\nThat will give us just\nthe general information,\n\n394\n00:18:30.558 --> 00:18:33.970\nthe standardized way,\nODBC open database connectivity, right?\n\n395\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.890\nSo the idea is just a generic format\nthat can be used by any data source\n\n396\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.290\nto be able to read the information coming\nin or any data information that comes in.\n\n397\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.301\nAnd will be structured in a way\nthat just about any database on\n\n398\n00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:49.450\nthe planet could receive that information,\nmodify, manipulate, use it, etc.\n\n399\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.870\nSo it's a pretty standard form, but\n\n400\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.920\nwe may decide to modify the format\nit will be up to us ultimately.\n\n401\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.170\nIt will really just depend on\nthe necessity of what we're logging and\n\n402\n00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.360\nhow we're doing that.\n\n403\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.395\nI'm gonna change this out and do IAS\nLegacy, just to change the logging format\n\n404\n00:19:03.395 --> 00:19:07.509\nbut it, again, you would probably leave\nit at ODBC and that would just be fine.\n\n405\n00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:11.095\nYou'll see here create a new log,\nhow often we create a new log,\n\n406\n00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:13.752\nevery day, every week, every month, never,\n\n407\n00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:17.650\nessentially just like it says\nin brackets unlimited file size.\n\n408\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.140\nWhat you're saying there is that\nwe're just gonna keep logging and\n\n409\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.640\nlogging into that file.\n\n410\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.730\nWe're not gonna stop the growth of it,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n411\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.490\nOr we could just say regardless of day,\nor week, or\n\n412\n00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.750\nmonth, just based on a time value\nrather excuse me, a size value.\n\n413\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.945\nWhen it gets to be ten megabytes,\ncreate a new log and\n\n414\n00:19:33.945 --> 00:19:37.750\nit'll just truncate every ten megs or\nwhatever it does and that'll be up to us.\n\n415\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.800\nWhen disk is full,\n\n416\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.120\ndelete older log files, we will start\ncycling through those logs, right?\n\n417\n00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.810\nAnd going okay,\ndisk is full let's get rid of 3, 4, 5, 10,\n\n418\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.000\n20, 100 logs, whatever it is,\nin order to overwrite and make room.\n\n419\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.930\nSo we're gonna start doing that,\nthat'll be up to us.\n\n420\n00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.210\nSo we'll just do one daily here,\n\n421\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.520\njust to show you that we\ncan modify these settings.\n\n422\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.400\nWe'll go ahead, we'll click OK, and we'll\nthen have that all up and ready to go.\n\n423\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.560\nSo we've done that.\n\n424\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.731\nWhat we're gonna do now is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n425\n00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:14.271\nI'm gonna switch over in just a minute,\nto my [COUGH] other machine.\n\n426\n00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:18.289\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna configure or\n\n427\n00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:22.119\nset up when we do that\nthe [COUGH] Rass remoting.\n\n428\n00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:26.080\nTry that again the r/Rass is what I'm\ntrying to say, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n429\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.620\nset up and configure the routing and\nremote access services.\n\n430\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.690\nI've already got them installed,\n\n431\n00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.640\nwe'll go ahead, we'll take a look at\nhow to initialize in just a minute.\n\n432\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.635\nBut before we do right just\nlike I was telling you,\n\n433\n00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:37.890\nI just wanted to show you one or\ntwo quick additional things here.\n\n434\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:43.560\nRight so up here right, you'll see that we\ncan import or export our configuration.\n\n435\n00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.440\nThis is kind of nice aside from\nthe obvious things like stop and\n\n436\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.240\nstart the service right?\n\n437\n00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.360\nWe can always do that.\n\n438\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.450\nBut we can import or export, which means\nonce I stand up and configure this server\n\n439\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.680\nI could export the config,\nI could take it to another NPS server.\n\n440\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.280\nAgain, think global infrastructure.\n\n441\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.690\nWe've got more than one NPS or\n\n442\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.960\nRadius server probably stood up in\na large enterprise environment.\n\n443\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.450\nAnd we're gonna wanna be able to\nperhaps not duplicate, I mean again,\n\n444\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.100\nimagine one little simple\nconfiguration like we did one client.\n\n445\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.060\nOne little modification on the log file.\n\n446\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.610\nYeah, we could reproduce that,\nno big deal.\n\n447\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.850\nBut imagine, you had a bunch of templates,\n\n448\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.310\nyou had a bunch of Radius\nclients already configured.\n\n449\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.040\nYou wanna reproduce that across your\nenvironment, maybe by branch office,\n\n450\n00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.950\nmaybe geography, regional,\nwho knows what it is.\n\n451\n00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.860\nBut you don't wanna go to\nthe trouble of having to reconfigure\n\n452\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.780\nthis thing from scratch.\n\n453\n00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.118\nIt would be nice if you could take that,\nexport it, and then, obviously, use that.\n\n454\n00:21:32.118 --> 00:21:35.710\nSo I thought it would just be nice\nreal quick, just to do export here.\n\n455\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:40.660\nAll right, I am aware that I am exporting,\nor I am exporting not just config, but\n\n456\n00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.500\nnotice I am exporting all shared secrets.\n\n457\n00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.830\nWhat we're doing is prompting and\n\n458\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.180\nsaying hey by the way, you do realize\nyou're exporting passwords, right?\n\n459\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.158\nAnd that they may not be secure and\nstored properly when you do that, so\n\n460\n00:21:50.158 --> 00:21:51.480\njust be aware of that.\n\n461\n00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.090\nIt does say hey, by the way,\nstore this in a secure location.\n\n462\n00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:58.200\nAll right, just make sure you're aware of\nthat and it also says SQL Server logging\n\n463\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.792\nsettings are not exported after you\nexport the file on another router.\n\n464\n00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:04.580\nAfter you import you have to manually\nconfigure the SQL log settings.\n\n465\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.290\nWe did not setup SQL logging,\njust to be clear so you know in the demo,\n\n466\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.230\nright, what we're doing.\n\n467\n00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.140\nBut, remember, in the real world if\nyou were logging out to SQL Server you\n\n468\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.210\nwould have to then deal with setting\nthat logging up again separately.\n\n469\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.466\nWe're not exporting that config,\njust so you know.\n\n470\n00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:23.120\nSo I'm just gonna check this off just so\nyou can see what happens here.\n\n471\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.558\nIt's very simple, notice, by the way,\nwe gotta opt in and specify,\n\n472\n00:22:26.558 --> 00:22:28.090\nessentially acknowledge it.\n\n473\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Acknowledge it, yeah.\n\n474\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.620\n&gt;&gt; And accepting the responsibility\nof exporting the passwords, or\n\n475\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.070\nwe can't actually export.\n\n476\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.611\nSo I just want you to see that,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n477\n00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:37.814\n&gt;&gt; Just something to think\nabout when you're doing a lot\n\n478\n00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:41.942\nof different exporting like when you\nwere showing us with our DHCP and\n\n479\n00:22:41.942 --> 00:22:45.830\ntalking about DHCP migration and\nany kind of like DNS.\n\n480\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.670\nAll that information, if you think about,\nif you're creating like an executable file\n\n481\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.220\nor an XML file and\nyou're storing that information anywhere.\n\n482\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.560\nThose are your core network\nservices that we're talking about,\n\n483\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.800\nwith a lot of important information.\n\n484\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.790\nSo always be aware of that when\nyou're running through these steps.\n\n485\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Very, very important, very true\nto stop and really consider that.\n\n486\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.240\nSo I just said, basically, yeah,\nwhile Cherokee was talking, said export,\n\n487\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.750\nall I did was just save it,\ntell it where to put it.\n\n488\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.373\nI dumped it on the desktop, just so\nyou could see it called NPS Server 1.\n\n489\n00:23:10.373 --> 00:23:14.000\nIt's an XML file,\nno magic or mystery here.\n\n490\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.200\nWe can certainly open this thing up and\njust take a quick look.\n\n491\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.330\nWe'll do it in Internet Explorer, we could\ndo it anywhere, it doesn't really matter.\n\n492\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.588\nYou think if you keep clicking ask me\nlater often enough it would get the idea.\n\n493\n00:23:27.588 --> 00:23:28.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I guess\n\n494\n00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.334\nit's lonely and needs friends.\n\n495\n00:23:29.334 --> 00:23:31.290\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those kind of people?\n\n496\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:31.949\n&gt;&gt; It needs friends and\n\n497\n00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:34.053\nwants to really make friends with\nyou no matter how hard you try.\n\n498\n00:23:34.053 --> 00:23:35.780\n&gt;&gt; They don't get the point, yeah.\n\n499\n00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.245\n&gt;&gt; So you can see here this is really\njust the guts of the config file.\n\n500\n00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:40.487\nIt's just got all the information.\n\n501\n00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:44.924\nIt's about 50k, 55k, in my case,\nvery small configuration, but\n\n502\n00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.955\nit's got everything here.\n\n503\n00:23:46.955 --> 00:23:51.794\nAnd as we go through it's just all\nthe XML code that allows me to understand\n\n504\n00:23:51.794 --> 00:23:54.304\nwhat I'm doing and how I'm doing it.\n\n505\n00:23:54.304 --> 00:23:55.710\nWe haven't looked at those policies yet.\n\n506\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.338\nBut all the policies that\nare there by default are there,\n\n507\n00:23:58.338 --> 00:23:59.723\nalong with everything else.\n\n508\n00:23:59.723 --> 00:24:01.194\nThat is configured.\n\n509\n00:24:01.194 --> 00:24:05.240\nThere is my client configuration\nright there, there's my client name.\n\n510\n00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.536\nWhat I just did where I setup the client,\nthe RADIUS client,\n\n511\n00:24:08.536 --> 00:24:12.946\nthat's the actual config portion of the\nexport that shows me the client config.\n\n512\n00:24:12.946 --> 00:24:15.234\nThere's the IP address we specified,\nright?\n\n513\n00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:18.690\nSo all that stuff we just saw\nis actually sitting right there.\n\n514\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.030\nSo that's the export,\nthat's what you would do with that.\n\n515\n00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.830\nAll right, so let's get back in here for\njust a second.\n\n516\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.680\nAgain, just before we zip over and\nset up the routing remote access side,\n\n517\n00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.710\nI thought I'd quickly just show you what\none of these policies looks like, just so\n\n518\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.770\nyou can see the default\nones that are built in.\n\n519\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.810\nAt least you have a sense of that.\n\n520\n00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.215\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n521\n00:24:36.215 --> 00:24:39.412\nOn the network policies,remember we\nhave two by default, on the connection\n\n522\n00:24:39.412 --> 00:24:42.420\nrequest policies, we have the ones\nwe talked about here as well.\n\n523\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.134\nWe could see the date and\ntime here, you will see date and\n\n524\n00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:50.660\ntime restrictions Sunday\nthrough Saturday 0, 0 to 2,400.\n\n525\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.092\nAnd essentially every day of the week,\nseven days of the week ,24 hours a day\n\n526\n00:24:55.092 --> 00:24:58.055\nright is what we're specifying here,\nright?\n\n527\n00:24:58.055 --> 00:24:59.925\nAnd it says conditions,\nthe following conditions are met.\n\n528\n00:24:59.925 --> 00:25:02.845\nCondition, the time restrictions value and\n\n529\n00:25:02.845 --> 00:25:07.010\nthen authentication\nprovider local computer.\n\n530\n00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.950\nIt's telling us we're gonna authenticate\nagainst local computer, right,\n\n531\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.260\nif we are doing this for all users.\n\n532\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.750\nSo we could go in, we can disable\na policy right here, we can delete it,\n\n533\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.230\nrename duplicate it as a policy template.\n\n534\n00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.940\nLet's look at properties real\nquick just so you can see.\n\n535\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.740\nMove this over here for a second just, so\n\n536\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.520\nit's a little bit easier to\nsee what's going on there.\n\n537\n00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.420\nWe got the policy name.\n\n538\n00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.340\nThat's just metadata tag descriptor.\n\n539\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.510\nIt's up to you if you wanna rename that.\n\n540\n00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.280\nPolicy enabled.\n\n541\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.060\nPolicy is turned on.\n\n542\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.037\nYou right-click disable,\nit unchecks that box.\n\n543\n00:25:35.037 --> 00:25:37.680\nSo you'll see here network\nconnection method,\n\n544\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.073\nselect the type of network access server\nthat is gonna send the request into NPS.\n\n545\n00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:46.362\nYou can either select here a network\naccess server type or vendor specific, but\n\n546\n00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:50.120\nneither is required kind of giving\nus the option it says there.\n\n547\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.196\nIt says if your network access\nserver's 802.1x authenticating or\n\n548\n00:25:54.196 --> 00:25:59.020\nis an 802.1x authenticating switch or\nwireless access, go with unspecified.\n\n549\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.300\nSo if you're sending information in,\nright, from Fabric,\n\n550\n00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.080\nthey have certain certain configurations.\n\n551\n00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.670\nWe'd give you guidance\non what to do there.\n\n552\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.730\nSo you pay attention,\nyou obviously follow what the steps are.\n\n553\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.700\nYou see we can choose\na remote desktop gateway, or\n\n554\n00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.370\nour remote server VPN or dial-up.\n\n555\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.550\nSo that would be RRAS server, and\n\n556\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.940\nour remote desktop gateway for terminal\nconnection's end, to be able to do RDP.\n\n557\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.510\nWe have our conditions.\n\n558\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.290\nThat's the condition that we just\ntook a look at, but we do have other\n\n559\n00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:29.870\nconditions here, of course that we could\nspecify if we needed to by editing in or\n\n560\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.290\nadding or removing as needed.\n\n561\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.670\nIf I wanted to edit this,\n\n562\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.690\nlet's just say hypothetically,\nyou'll see we get that interface.\n\n563\n00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.550\nAgain one of those interface that's been\naround since Windows NT, 3.5.1., and 4.0.\n\n564\n00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.874\nThat's how old that interface is.\n\n565\n00:26:42.874 --> 00:26:43.463\nWe would just be able to drag and connect.\n\n566\n00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:47.475\n&gt;&gt; It's simple and easy to understand,\nso why change if it's not broke, Adam?\n\n567\n00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:48.930\n&gt;&gt; No, it is, it does work, it works well.\n\n568\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.130\nThere's definitely nothing wrong with it,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n569\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.840\nSo the interesting thing is here\nwe'll come in and we'll do a policy.\n\n570\n00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.780\nWe'll actually create one in a little\nwhile in our upcoming episode just to\n\n571\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.199\ngive you an overview while we're here as\nwe're getting started with configuration.\n\n572\n00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:03.981\nBut you'll see we can come in under\nconditions, and we can specify, right?\n\n573\n00:27:03.981 --> 00:27:07.136\nWe could specify the username that is\nused by the access client in the Radius\n\n574\n00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:09.470\nmessage, right, that's a character string.\n\n575\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.080\nWe could do Access Client.IPv4 Address,\nAccess Client.IPv6 Address.\n\n576\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.810\nWe could do our frame protocols here and\n\n577\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.640\nspecify that, our service type,\nour tunnel type.\n\n578\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.720\nLook at all the options we have, day and\ntime restrictions, you already saw those.\n\n579\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.950\nWe could do Calling Station ID client\nfriendly, all sorts of different stuff for\n\n580\n00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.770\nthe RADIUS client properties here, right?\n\n581\n00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.530\nWe can go in, you'll see on the gateway\nand specify Gateway Information.\n\n582\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.085\nAgain both If IPv4 and IPv6 supported\nas well as port type in condition for\n\n583\n00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:42.485\nspecification, things like wireless for\ninstance the other two that I love and\n\n584\n00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:44.085\nsupport would be found there.\n\n585\n00:27:44.085 --> 00:27:46.685\nSo we could add any one of\nthese just by grabbing one,\n\n586\n00:27:46.685 --> 00:27:49.975\nclicking add and a random we chose\nthe NAS port type down at the bottom.\n\n587\n00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:53.435\nAnd you'll see if I chose this one,\nI could chose sync,\n\n588\n00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:58.310\nasync, ISDN, there's technology here\na lot about these days VPN, right?\n\n589\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.308\nWe can choose wireless, so this is how\nwe will set up wireless support, FDDI,\n\n590\n00:28:02.308 --> 00:28:03.996\nfiber token ring, right?\n\n591\n00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:07.440\nWe could Ethernet, token ring,\nagain technology that is\n\n592\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.060\nolder in some aspects but\nstill used in some areas, right?\n\n593\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.144\nWe do have the ability to be able specify,\n\n594\n00:28:14.144 --> 00:28:17.945\nwhole bunch of stuff here,\nx25, XTSL, right?\n\n595\n00:28:17.945 --> 00:28:25.006\nWe do have IDSL, all sorts of different\noption ISDN, let's talk about the whole.\n\n596\n00:28:25.006 --> 00:28:26.847\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of all retired networking standards and\n\n597\n00:28:26.847 --> 00:28:29.090\nprotocols that you don't\nhear about anymore.\n\n598\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.540\nWe got all that kind of stuff, right?\n\n599\n00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.300\nSo we have all that set our conditions and\nthen,\n\n600\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.950\nwe can go in,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n601\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.290\nClick add, add those conditions in and\nwe're good, right?\n\n602\n00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.470\nWe're just able to add those in.\n\n603\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.370\nSo let me go out of there.\n\n604\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.850\nWe can go in and we can stack them up and\nmake sure they're there.\n\n605\n00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.050\nAnd then, just on the settings area here,\n\n606\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.040\nwe do have our required\nauthentication methods.\n\n607\n00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.860\nYou'll see we have our\nauthentication method.\n\n608\n00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.790\nWe can override the policy\nauthentication settings and\n\n609\n00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.360\nthen we can go in and\nhard code the authentication methods.\n\n610\n00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.928\nAnd we spoke about some of these,\nif you remember\n\n611\n00:29:00.928 --> 00:29:04.574\nI spoke about the difference between CHAP,\nthen PAP and MSCHAPv2.\n\n612\n00:29:04.574 --> 00:29:07.848\nIn the beginning conversations in this\nblock of episodes around the RRAS\n\n613\n00:29:07.848 --> 00:29:08.660\nfunctionality.\n\n614\n00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.890\nWhen we were in the RRAS server\nin episode one, kinda demoing and\n\n615\n00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:16.215\ntalking through the logic there you\ncould see CHAP, PAP, cecure path.\n\n616\n00:29:16.215 --> 00:29:18.225\nYou could see MSCHAP, MSCHAPv2.\n\n617\n00:29:18.225 --> 00:29:21.965\nWe do actually have a setting for\nMSCHAP here for older clients,\n\n618\n00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:25.585\neven though I told you on the new RS\ninterface we don't use MSCHAP anymore.\n\n619\n00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:28.085\nIt's only MSCHAPv2, so you could see that.\n\n620\n00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:31.267\nWe could specify EAP,\nExtensible Authentication Protocol,\n\n621\n00:29:31.267 --> 00:29:32.377\nextensions or types.\n\n622\n00:29:32.377 --> 00:29:37.617\nSo we could add in an EAP type based on\neither mapping a certificate or PEAP,\n\n623\n00:29:37.617 --> 00:29:43.517\nProtected EAP, or EAP with MSCHAPv2, which\nis a secure shared password communication.\n\n624\n00:29:43.517 --> 00:29:45.107\nSo we can do different things here.\n\n625\n00:29:45.107 --> 00:29:49.694\nWe could specify that we\nare doing either authentication\n\n626\n00:29:49.694 --> 00:29:53.237\nrequests on this server\nlocally as you saw.\n\n627\n00:29:53.237 --> 00:29:56.560\nRemember that's what the policy does\nout of the box, essentially that.\n\n628\n00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.480\nOr accept users without\nvalidating credentials.\n\n629\n00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.460\nEssentially allow anonymous inbound\ncontrol or inbound requests.\n\n630\n00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.020\nWe could specify accounting, forward these\nout to a remote server in the RADIUS\n\n631\n00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.020\ngroup, meaning this server\nmay be sitting in the DMZ.\n\n632\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.280\nIs essentially just acting as a proxy for\ninbound connections, and\n\n633\n00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.530\nwe can make this a radius proxy and\nwe can then say, hold on a second, right?\n\n634\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.120\nIf you're inbound, let's say,\nyou'll connect to me, Cherokee, hold on.\n\n635\n00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.846\nI'm in the DMC.\n\n636\n00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:25.503\nI'm gonna proxy that request back to our\nroom that RADIUS server group somewhere\n\n637\n00:30:25.503 --> 00:30:28.632\nelse that is on the inside of\nthe firewall doing the authentication.\n\n638\n00:30:28.632 --> 00:30:30.961\nAnd then they're gonna come\nback securely talk to me, and\n\n639\n00:30:30.961 --> 00:30:33.300\nthen I'm gonna allow you through,\nassuming that works.\n\n640\n00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:38.950\nSo I'm not exposing the internal directory\nand the active AD infrastructure.\n\n641\n00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.950\nBut I'm simply as a picket line\ngateway device acting as a proxy\n\n642\n00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.650\nto accept those inbound requests.\n\n643\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.676\nThis would be like in theory what\na registration authority may be doing in\n\n644\n00:30:48.676 --> 00:30:50.065\na PKI solution, right?\n\n645\n00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:54.397\nWhere we have the registration authority\nacting as the inbound aggregation point\n\n646\n00:30:54.397 --> 00:30:58.351\nfor client requests for certificates,\ntakes the handoff and then goes and\n\n647\n00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:01.256\ndoes the authentication\nwith the directory servers.\n\n648\n00:31:01.256 --> 00:31:05.201\nValidates the client, then comes back and\napproves that the client is legitimated,\n\n649\n00:31:05.201 --> 00:31:08.490\nand then allows the PKI infrastructure,\nthe certificate authority,\n\n650\n00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.118\nto do the issuing after it takes\ncare of all the burdensome\n\n651\n00:31:11.118 --> 00:31:13.170\nwork of doing the authentication.\n\n652\n00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.290\nSo it acts like a proxy\nin that respect as well.\n\n653\n00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.090\nSo we can set up that up if we want to.\n\n654\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.090\nIt's up to us.\n\n655\n00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you bring up a really good point,\nAdam, because-\n\n656\n00:31:19.765 --> 00:31:20.415\n&gt;&gt; I always do.\n\n657\n00:31:20.415 --> 00:31:21.922\n&gt;&gt; I know you always do.\n&gt;&gt; You say that as if that's like a shock.\n\n658\n00:31:21.922 --> 00:31:24.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's rare that I don't,\n\n659\n00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:26.029\nis how yo should say that .all right,\nso, what point?\n\n660\n00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:27.859\n&gt;&gt; So the thing is in documentation and\n\n661\n00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:31.280\nnetworking diagrams you guys might\ncome across different terms.\n\n662\n00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.050\nLike you'll hear you've mentioned AAA,\nyou've mentioned authentication.\n\n663\n00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.440\nSometimes they're even called\nauthentication servers.\n\n664\n00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.880\nRADIUS is just pretty popular, so\nyou'll often see it dubbed as that.\n\n665\n00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.439\nSo these terms can mean slightly\ndifferent things in the way that they're\n\n666\n00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:48.434\ndesigned within the networks.\n\n667\n00:31:48.434 --> 00:31:53.173\nSo just be aware that they're very closely\nrelated, but you can, like Adam said,\n\n668\n00:31:53.173 --> 00:31:57.318\noff set the authentication server to\nthe authenticator although it is.\n\n669\n00:31:57.318 --> 00:32:01.498\nStill a AAA server so to speak,\nso just gonna be aware of that.\n\n670\n00:32:01.498 --> 00:32:03.300\n&gt;&gt; The languages are important.\n\n671\n00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.940\nRadius is a intra-standard term.\n\n672\n00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.270\nSo for any of you who are working and\n\n673\n00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.980\ndo this kind of stuff specifically\nlet's say in this area.\n\n674\n00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.980\nRemote access and\nyou manage gateway things and this nature.\n\n675\n00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.810\nI'm sure you're very familiar with\nthe concept of Radius because it's\n\n676\n00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.880\nan industry wide accepted\nstandard solution you know.\n\n677\n00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.040\nAuthentication and session management\nprotocol and thought process.\n\n678\n00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.202\nMicrosoft supports it is just any vendor\ndoes, you saw the list of vendors that\n\n679\n00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:32.845\nare Radius clients and in major technology\nvendor is on that list for the most part.\n\n680\n00:32:32.845 --> 00:32:37.096\nSo it's all there but the point is that\nnot every vendor refers to it necessarily\n\n681\n00:32:37.096 --> 00:32:40.157\nfirst and foremost and\nthe name of the product is Radius.\n\n682\n00:32:40.157 --> 00:32:43.891\nWe call ours the NPS, and with policy\nserver happens to be a Radius server so\n\n683\n00:32:43.891 --> 00:32:47.095\nit's radius capable but\nwe don't just use the generic term.\n\n684\n00:32:47.095 --> 00:32:50.296\nSo it is important to be aware of that\nthat's why we try to use the language that\n\n685\n00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:53.273\nget you thinking about the different\nways you see and hear these terms.\n\n686\n00:32:53.273 --> 00:32:56.581\nCuz it is important to understand that so,\nalways good for us to be reminded of that,\n\n687\n00:32:56.581 --> 00:32:57.150\nabsolutely.\n\n688\n00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.480\nSo we've got a lot of different\nstuff here that we could specify.\n\n689\n00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.080\nWe can add in, there we go,\ncould add in attributes, right.\n\n690\n00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.650\nThat maybe additional things we wanna\nbe looking at as part of the policy and\n\n691\n00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.050\ncomparing and\nwe could do either standard ones or\n\n692\n00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:16.060\nyou also see vendor specific ones top up\nthe vendor specificity of Radius clients.\n\n693\n00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.475\nEach client may behave\na little differently,\n\n694\n00:33:17.475 --> 00:33:19.680\nmay have certain attributes\nassociated with them.\n\n695\n00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.650\nWe could have those in here.\n\n696\n00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.980\nSo we could put a lot of stuff in here and\nedit that out is part of our policy and\n\n697\n00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.330\nstack those policies up and\ninteract with them.\n\n698\n00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.160\nSo I just wanted you to see that is\nwe getting started with kind of our\n\n699\n00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.640\nfirst episode here in notes part three\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n700\n00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.520\n&gt;&gt; But in the group our first episode\n\n701\n00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.805\naround specifically BNP as functionality,\nshowing you how to stand up the server,\n\n702\n00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:40.075\nsetup a Radius client.\n\n703\n00:33:40.075 --> 00:33:42.055\nJust get comfortable\nwith the general console.\n\n704\n00:33:42.055 --> 00:33:45.415\nWhat we're gonna do as soon as we come\nback is we're gonna go ahead and flip over\n\n705\n00:33:45.415 --> 00:33:49.305\nto the RRAS side and setup and initialize\nthe Routing and Remote Access Server.\n\n706\n00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:52.340\nRemember, I promised you\nyou get to see me do that.\n\n707\n00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.554\nSet it up this time instead of\njust custom set up, right, or\n\n708\n00:33:55.554 --> 00:33:57.380\nmanual if you want to\nthink of it that way and\n\n709\n00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.370\nthen choose LAN routing which\nwe did back in the first demo.\n\n710\n00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.260\nWe're gonna go through an actual\nset up as a VPN server this time.\n\n711\n00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.200\nConfigure it out and\n\n712\n00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.330\nthen talk about how we get these\ntwo things talking to each other.\n\n713\n00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.590\nSo we're gonna continue on\nwith that demonstration but\n\n714\n00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.350\nyou are gonna come back and\nsee us in order to do that.\n\n715\n00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n716\n00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:14.420\nThank you so much for joining us.\n\n717\n00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.050\nBut stay tuned,\n\n718\n00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.210\nwe have additional information\nheaded your way, as Adam has noted.\n\n719\n00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.630\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n720\n00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.640\nRemember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n721\n00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n722\n00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.624\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n723\n00:34:25.624 --> 00:34:26.812\n&gt;&gt; Have a rassy day.\n\n724\n00:34:26.812 --> 00:34:27.679\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n725\n00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:32.727\n[MUSIC]\n\n726\n00:34:32.727 --> 00:34:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

Server 2016\n\n6\n00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:17.893\nseries, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:21.735\nAnd in this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at remote access and\n\n8\n00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.874\njust as promised,\nAdam is going to deliver continuing our\n\n9\n00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:28.671\ndemonstration where we were looking\nat NPS, Network Policy Server.\n\n10\n00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:33.362\nAnd he's actually joined us today back in\nstudio, so Adam, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n11\n00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.770\nfinish up that demo.\n\n12\n00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460\n&gt;&gt; We are, we're gonna jump back in,\nreally no time to spare and\n\n13\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.240\nno time to waste.\n\n14\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.600\nSo we're gonna get started with jumping\nback into the ROS console, we flipped over\n\n15\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.100\nto our ROS server as we were talking\nabout, we've got it right there.\n\n16\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610\nNotice it is not configured yet, I\npromised you that I would walk you through\n\n17\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.500\nand let you see how we configure this.\n\n18\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.767\nI've already shown you how to\nset this up as a LAN router,\n\n19\n00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.630\none of the prior walk-throughs, important\nto know how to do just basic routing.\n\n20\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.722\nWe specified and set up hot to set or\nrather how to configure and\n\n21\n00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:04.221\nbind a protocol,\nrunning protocol like RIPv2,\n\n22\n00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.670\nwe also took a look at how to to set\nNAT up, we've already seen that.\n\n23\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.590\nIf you haven't seen us do that,\nyou definitely wanna go back,\n\n24\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.200\ntake a look at some point but not super\ncritical for our conversation here.\n\n25\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.730\nEven if this is the very first time you're\nseeing the RS server in the console,\n\n26\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.480\nwe're gonna walk through how\nto configure it right now,\n\n27\n00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.110\nbut we're gonna set it up for\nremote access dial up or VPN.\n\n28\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.285\nWe're gonna have a preference for\nthe VPN part because hey, let's face it,\n\n29\n00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:28.690\ndial-up is just old technology, slow,\nnot really what we're looking for\n\n30\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.100\nbut, we still support it\nbecause you know what?\n\n31\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.770\nWhen the zombie apocalypse comes you're\ngonna wanna have a dial-up connection\n\n32\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.750\njust in case, all right, so\nwe're gonna get this going right here.\n\n33\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.280\nI'm just move this over for\njust a moment, click next,\n\n34\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.340\nwe did talk about the different options\nhere, we ran through this the last time,\n\n35\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.330\nbut again,\nyou may not have seen that episode yet.\n\n36\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.610\nSo let's just take a moment here,\n\n37\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.110\nmake sure we're comfortable with what\nwe're seeing before we continue.\n\n38\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.070\nWhen we configure and\nset up the RRAS interface and\n\n39\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.230\nwe install the role, comes up,\nand it is available, but\n\n40\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.030\nwe have to actually go through and\ntell RRAS what we want it to do.\n\n41\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.812\nSo we have this wizard we have to run\nthe first time out of the box, so\n\n42\n00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:04.951\nwe have some options here,\nremote access dial up or\n\n43\n00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.661\nVPN that's what we're gonna\nconfigure here in just a a moment.\n\n44\n00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:12.266\nWe have a straight NAT solution, we could\nset that up, we have VPN with access and\n\n45\n00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.390\nthat's for combining items 1 and\n2 together.\n\n46\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.480\nWe've the secure connection\nbetween two private networks so\n\n47\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.420\nthis will be like a site\nto site connection,\n\n48\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.730\nbranch office, something like that,\ndedicated on private internal networks.\n\n49\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.230\nAnd then custom configuration which is\nwhat you saw me work with and what I was\n\n50\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.160\nreferencing that we did in the first walk\nthrough, we set it up as a LAN router.\n\n51\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.087\nEssentially a software based router and\nthen we went and configured NAT and\n\n52\n00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:39.198\nbound RP or RIPv2 into a couple of the\ninterfaces and enabled the protocol, so\n\n53\n00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.711\nwe could certainly do that.\n\n54\n00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.934\nThese choices we made just give\nus a set of screens that we have\n\n55\n00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:48.830\nto provide information for like a template\nthat we're just answering questions for.\n\n56\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.640\nAnd then as a result of the output we get\nto decide how the system gets stood up and\n\n57\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.610\nultimately gets configured.\n\n58\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.300\nSo we're gonna do remote access dial up or\nVPN, now, and so\n\n59\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.580\nwe have both choices here,\nwhen I did the demo on the first episode\n\n60\n00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.744\nI didn’t bother to mention it cause\nwe were going through quickly.\n\n61\n00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:06.640\nAnd really, it was just, hey by the way,\nlook at that option, that's what you get,\n\n62\n00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.000\nwe didn’t really bother to go through it,\nso\n\n63\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.990\nI wanna tell you about something that\ncan happen in the real world here.\n\n64\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.673\nSo you may have remembered if you've seen\nit already, if not, if you go back and\n\n65\n00:03:13.673 --> 00:03:15.691\nlook at the episode,\nyou'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n66\n00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:19.355\nWhen I came in here, the top option VPN\nwas grayed out, it was dial up only and\n\n67\n00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:23.251\nI just said, yeah you could choose either\none and basically we just hit cancel and\n\n68\n00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:23.845\nwent back.\n\n69\n00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:27.794\nAnd then walked through the other parts\nof the wizard, but you may actually,\n\n70\n00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:31.590\nin the real world, see VPN not being\navailable, grayed out as an option.\n\n71\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.963\nIf that happens by the way, doesn't mean\nyou broke anything, all it means is,\n\n72\n00:03:35.963 --> 00:03:39.550\nhit cancel, comeback in,\nrun the selection option again.\n\n73\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.070\nIt means that the console was not quick\nenough to catch all the configuration\n\n74\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.590\noptions on the system and understand how\nto set the interface up properly for\n\n75\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.976\nyou, it happens sometimes.\n\n76\n00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:51.824\nIt doesn't happen very often, it's\na little glitch in just the way the wizard\n\n77\n00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:56.300\nscreen sets up, queries the system, says\nthis is available as an option, yes or no?\n\n78\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.240\nAnd it shows it to you if you just\ngo a little too quick it doesn't\n\n79\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.730\ncatch up with you basically, is probably\nthe easiest way to describe it.\n\n80\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.860\nIt's not anything that affects you,\n\n81\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.200\nit's just that you have to literally just\ncancel and start it again and by that time\n\n82\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.080\nthe latency has actually caught up with\nyou and it does enable the option.\n\n83\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.610\nSo if you see that happening, just so\nyou know, that way you're aware of it, so\n\n84\n00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.630\nwe're gonna, you see here, choose VPN,\njust click on it right there.\n\n85\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.450\nWe'll click Next, notice that we do\nhave our two interfaces here, Ethernet,\n\n86\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.910\nEthernet 2, we would obviously\nhave these set up ahead of time,\n\n87\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.780\nthese would be the external IP addressed\nand / or internal IP addressed or both.\n\n88\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.360\nCards that are on the host, or\nhowever many there are on the server,\n\n89\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.070\nwhatever we're doing we would\nwanna specify which interface or\n\n90\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.410\ninterfaces we're gonna wanna set up.\n\n91\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.759\nSo we're gonna choose VPN here,\nI'm gonna steal a quick look at my notes,\n\n92\n00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.683\nmake sure I choose the right interface,\nwe're gonna do 010,\n\n93\n00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:49.785\nyou may notice by the way that these\nare both labeled HyperV network.\n\n94\n00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:51.742\nRemember these are virtual machines,\n\n95\n00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:55.594\nwe are running this on a HyperV based\nnetwork for demonstration purposes, so\n\n96\n00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:59.048\nwe'll be ironic for running this\non VM from Microsoft class OneNet.\n\n97\n00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.649\nBut we are running it there just so you\ncan see, so if you see that and wonder,\n\n98\n00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.750\nhey why is that whole Hyper-V thing there?\n\n99\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.857\nIt's because these are virtual machines,\nwe're using virtual network adapter, so\n\n100\n00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:10.664\nthe meta data descriptor just says\nHyper-V cuz that's where they come from,\n\n101\n00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:11.316\njust so you know.\n\n102\n00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:13.484\n&gt;&gt; Like using a Macintosh\ncomputer to demonstrate-\n\n103\n00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:14.140\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n104\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.090\n&gt;&gt; Don't ruin the magic,\n\n106\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.900\ndon't-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n107\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.221\n&gt;&gt; Pay no attention to the woman\nin red behind the screen,\n\n108\n00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.592\nyou've ever seen Wizard of Oz?\n\n109\n00:05:22.592 --> 00:05:23.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the Wizard of Oz.\n\n110\n00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:27.970\n&gt;&gt; It's like we're Toto exposes\nthe wizard, you don't wanna be like that,\n\n111\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.533\nthat ruins the whole thing.\n\n112\n00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:30.268\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll be quiet.\n\n113\n00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:32.001\n&gt;&gt; This is why we don't\ntell you the shared secret,\n\n114\n00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:34.414\nbecause you go around blabbing\n's password to everybody,\n\n115\n00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:36.340\nand everybody would know,\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n116\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.680\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna choose in this case,\n\n117\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.730\nEthernet 2 here, we're gonna uncheck the\npacket filtering item down here just for\n\n118\n00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.390\npurposes of our demonstration,\nmake things easy.\n\n119\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.630\nClick Next, we then have the specify\nhow we're gonna do IP addressing,\n\n120\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.360\nwhether we do it automatically,\nessentially,\n\n121\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.870\nDHCP driven, and/or,\nare we gonna do a specified range?\n\n122\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.096\nWe're gonna do a specified range and\njust put in a small range here but, you,\n\n123\n00:06:00.096 --> 00:06:01.537\nobviously, have either option,\n\n124\n00:06:01.537 --> 00:06:04.588\nwe would have to click New here to put\nthe range in, we're gonna do that.\n\n125\n00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:12.002\nGet a little box here, just make sure\nI've gotten my IP address range,\n\n126\n00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:17.192\ninformation here,\nbear with me just one second,\n\n127\n00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:21.025\nso 192.168.0.150 and\n\n128\n00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:25.000\nthen 192.168.0.190.\n\n129\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.270\nAll right,\n\n130\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.230\nso gonna have 41 addresses there, we're\ngonna click OK, so we've got that set up,\n\n131\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.770\nand we also can add in a couple of ranges\nhere depending on what we're doing.\n\n132\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.830\nSo we'll click Next,\nmanaging multiple remote access servers,\n\n133\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.610\nare we going to set up and manage more\nthan one, and if we are, are we then going\n\n134\n00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.400\nto set up and wanna work with, or set this\nserver up and work with a radius server?\n\n135\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.550\nOf course, clearly the answer\nis yes because that's what we're\n\n136\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.540\ntalking about, right?\n\n137\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.390\nSo it says no use routing remote access to\nauthenticate connection requests meaning\n\n138\n00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.280\nsingle inbound connections come here\nthey get authenticated through here.\n\n139\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.150\nYes, let's set this up, let's set this\nserver up to work with a Radius server,\n\n140\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.490\nremember we're gonna push authentication\nout to the Radius server,\n\n141\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.280\nthat's our perimeter or\nboundary gateway device.\n\n142\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.780\nIt's gonna act as the inbound\nconnection control, it's gonna get\n\n143\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.220\nthe client coming in, it's gonna get that\nauthentication request happening there.\n\n144\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.910\nIt's part of the triple A, that's what we\nwere talking about, right, authentication,\n\n145\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.190\naccess control and auditing, so,\nkeep in mind, that's what we're doing.\n\n146\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.065\nSo we're gonna say, yeah, let's pair up\nwith the Radius server because they're\n\n147\n00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:27.080\nthe cool kids and\nwe want to hang out with them.\n\n148\n00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to do yes,\n\n149\n00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:30.895\nset up the server to work with Radius,\nthat's what we're going to do, so we're\n\n150\n00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:34.995\ngoing to click Next here, now we need to\nspecify, hey, what is that Radius server?\n\n151\n00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:38.142\nMaybe primary certainly,\nmaybe alternate perhaps, perhaps not,\n\n152\n00:07:38.142 --> 00:07:41.410\nand of course, that thing we keep\ncoming back to, that shared secret.\n\n153\n00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.455\n&gt;&gt; Shared secret.\n&gt;&gt; You need to leave the room while I type\n\n154\n00:07:42.455 --> 00:07:43.741\nthe shared secret in,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n155\n00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:44.260\n&gt;&gt; So you don't know what that is.\n\n156\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.212\n&gt;&gt; I'll close my eyes.\n\n157\n00:07:45.212 --> 00:07:49.634\n&gt;&gt; Close your eyes, don't listen, all\nright, so we're going to put in our radio\n\n158\n00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:53.858\nserver name here, that's gonna be,\nsince I typed correctly plabsa01,\n\n159\n00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:57.240\nagain you would have to know\nthe name of the radio server.\n\n160\n00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.744\nYou would have to know what that is,\nobviously it's the one we were just\n\n161\n00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:02.543\nconfiguring, so we're putting that in\nthere, we don't have an alternate for\n\n162\n00:08:02.543 --> 00:08:04.913\npurposes of demonstrations so\nwe're just gonna use our primary.\n\n163\n00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:08.740\nWe're gonna put in our password for\nour shared secret.\n\n164\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.710\nPut that in there.\n\n165\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.550\nClick Next.\n\n166\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.760\nGive that just a second.\n\n167\n00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.390\nSays, okay, great.\n\n168\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.710\nYou're done.\nLet's click Finish.\n\n169\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.590\nNow, remember,\nwe have to spin up the services.\n\n170\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.160\nCuz the first time we configure RRAS,\nit has to go through, set everything up.\n\n171\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.150\nIt then has to launch, and load,\nand configure the services.\n\n172\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.510\nWe're gonna get the little pop-up.\n\n173\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.905\nWe got the little spinning\npizza clock plate there.\n\n174\n00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:30.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna go do it's thing.\n\n175\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.240\nSo don't be surprised,\nthis will take a moment.\n\n176\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.050\nAnd in the real world,\nthis is what you'll see traditionally so\n\n177\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.030\njust be patient with it.\n\n178\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.840\nIt's not like it's gonna take forever.\n\n179\n00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.950\nShouldn't take more than about\n15 to 20 seconds, there you go.\n\n180\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.926\nWe get a little pop-up.\n\n181\n00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:43.650\nNow this pop-up will happen,\n\n182\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.560\nthis is normal to support\nthe relaying of DHCP messages.\n\n183\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.180\nYou would go ahead and\nconfigure the DHCP relay agent.\n\n184\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.170\nThey're just reminding us that RRAS\nis where we set up the relay agent.\n\n185\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.790\nNow we're not doing that here, but\n\n186\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.040\nkeep in mind in the DHCP\nconversations prior episodes, again,\n\n187\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.780\nif you haven't seen them, definitely\nwanna make sure you go take a look.\n\n188\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.110\nWe actually walk through discuss this, but\n\n189\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.940\nwe also actually set up a DHCP relay\nin 40 and showed you how to do that.\n\n190\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.440\nSo we're just gonna click OK.\n\n191\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.080\nThat is just an informational message,\nby the way, nothing more.\n\n192\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.810\nThis is the actual configuration\ntaking place right now.\n\n193\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.310\nSo that's just going through and setting\nthis up and kind of configuring for us,\n\n194\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.550\ndoesn't take very long.\n\n195\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.120\nAs you can see and as soon as\nyou can we get all that done and\n\n196\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.418\nit's been probably now more than about a\nminute inclusive including the sitting and\n\n197\n00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:29.620\njust explaining what was happening\nyou could see we have all that there.\n\n198\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.140\nAnd once we have that configured we're\nnow able to go in and we're now able to\n\n199\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.140\nactually take a look at the interface and\nwe'll do just a quick refresher tour.\n\n200\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.440\nI'm not gonna go back through every\naspect of the detail that we went in\n\n201\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.510\nthe first lecture on the RRAS console.\n\n202\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.220\nInvite you to go back,\ntake a look at that episode,\n\n203\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.780\nwe spent almost an entire episode\ngetting used to the console.\n\n204\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.810\nWe're just gonna show you just a couple\nof things here that we just wanna remind\n\n205\n00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.200\nourselves of and be aware of.\n\n206\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.180\nBut you'll notice here, the remote access\nclients, remote access login policies,\n\n207\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.090\nthat's different to what we would\nhave seen before, so we have that.\n\n208\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.616\nYou'll notice that we do have both IPV4\nand IPV6, unlike in the prior demo where\n\n209\n00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:08.584\nwe would have REP and\nnow all ready associated there.\n\n210\n00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.616\nWe have unloaded those, so\nyou'll see there not there.\n\n211\n00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:15.612\nBut we did talk about how to do them so we\ncertainly can use those if necessary and\n\n212\n00:10:15.612 --> 00:10:17.340\nright-click up here.\n\n213\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.660\nWe certainly can disable this thing if\nwe need to turn it off for some reason.\n\n214\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.640\nWe remind you again that we do have\nthe direct access option there,\n\n215\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.360\nwe'll be seeing that in upcoming episodes,\nand you're just going through and\n\n216\n00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.840\ntalking about direct access.\n\n217\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.130\nWe can stop, start and\n\n218\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.920\nrestart if necessary and\nwe can look at properties here.\n\n219\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.730\nLet's just bring that up,\nit'll take just a second to come up.\n\n220\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.650\nWhat we're gonna do here is just go in and\ngo to the security tabs, as soon as this\n\n221\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.580\ncomes up, and we're gonna set up and\nconfigure our authentication provider.\n\n222\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.590\nRemember that's\nthe authentication provider and\n\n223\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.720\nthe connection back to Radius,\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n224\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.450\nSo we wanna bring this up,\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n225\n00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.890\nWe're going to in addition\nto the properties for\n\n226\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.520\nthe authentication provider.\n\n227\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.460\nI'll just click to give you an idea of\nwhat the other tabs are on there just to\n\n228\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.740\nmake sure that you can see them.\n\n229\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.420\nSomebody have a big stick we\ncan poke our RRAS server,\n\n230\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.700\nmake sure it's paying attention so\nthat the property screen comes up?\n\n231\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.680\nLet me just make sure it's not\ncoming up behind the scenes.\n\n232\n00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.820\nSometimes the console does,\nI hate it when it does that.\n\n233\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.560\nIt brings up the screen but\nyou don't know where it is.\n\n234\n00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.853\nAnd you're sitting and\nwaiting and it's like, well,\n\n235\n00:11:13.853 --> 00:11:14.989\nI think it's gonna be there,\nbut I don't know.\n\n236\n00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:16.273\n&gt;&gt; What a waste of time, [LAUGH] yes.\n\n237\n00:11:16.273 --> 00:11:19.441\n&gt;&gt; And it's not there, so\nlet me try this one more time.\n\n238\n00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:22.150\nIt may just for some reason be thinking.\n\n239\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.830\nWhat I'm actually thinking\nwe'll do is the following.\n\n240\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.390\nLet's just close.\n\n241\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Relaunch?\n\n242\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.\nJust close the tool out, real quick.\n\n243\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.190\nJust relaunch it.\n\n244\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.430\nIt may, for some reason, just be, you\nknow it does that whole wizard thing and\n\n245\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.300\nit says yeah, all the services started,\nit's ready to go but,\n\n246\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.420\nyou know there's actually stuff\nthat happens behind the scenes.\n\n247\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.610\nAfter that that we may actually\nbe the victim of waiting for.\n\n248\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.680\nWe may not see it,\nwe don't know it's happening but\n\n249\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.490\nthere's still some configuration\nthat does take place.\n\n250\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.110\nSo since this is literally\nhappening inline in realtime almost\n\n251\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.540\nimmediately after we spun it up,\nit may actually still be thinking.\n\n252\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.000\nSo let's back and\nwe'll relaunch, no big deal.\n\n253\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.810\nSo let's just come down here,\nallow to give remote access.\n\n254\n00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.200\nI know you can't see,\nit's behind the picture but it is there.\n\n255\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.670\nI'm clicking on about to click on it\nright now, there you go, right there.\n\n256\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.960\nSo you could see we have that so\nlet's just open this up one more time,\n\n257\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.487\nlet's see if what are the better\nlook this time, go to properties.\n\n258\n00:12:09.487 --> 00:12:10.480\n&gt;&gt; And there you go.\n\n259\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.360\n&gt;&gt; See sometimes it's just a matter of\ngetting it to pay attention to you.\n\n260\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.580\nSo let me just move this\nover here real quick.\n\n261\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.460\nSee, you can see that away from\nthat little blue square up there\n\n262\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.590\nthat's just anchoring our window force.\n\n263\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.920\nAll right, so\nwe have the general information here,\n\n264\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.700\nright we do have the ability to set it up.\n\n265\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.740\nAnd we've talked about this\nin the prior episode as well,\n\n266\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.640\nIPv4 and IPv6 routing capabilities.\n\n267\n00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.794\nThis time you'll notice unlike the last\ntime, we did this where we just set it up\n\n268\n00:12:34.794 --> 00:12:39.395\nas IPv4 for routing, this time notice IPv4\nremote access server configured as well.\n\n269\n00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:43.019\nCuz remember we could figure this\nas a RRAS server with VPN and\n\n270\n00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:47.639\nnot just simply as a LAN router so we\nhave different options being selected but\n\n271\n00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:50.640\nstill no IPv6 support we\nhaven't enabled that.\n\n272\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.290\nSo we do have our security area here.\n\n273\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.520\nThis is where we are going.\n\n274\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.040\nNow we're gonna be able to look at\nour authentication provider and\n\n275\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.089\nour accounting provider so we can go\ninto our authentication provider.\n\n276\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.240\nWe can click configure and\nyou'll see here that we have our\n\n277\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.460\nRadius authentication server, the one we\nspecified in the wizard is available here.\n\n278\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.270\nPLASA01, that we have that there.\n\n279\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.710\nAnd we can go in and we can edit this so\nwe can work with this.\n\n280\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.360\nWe're gonna go in and edit this right now.\n\n281\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.340\nWe could add other ones\nhere as well if necessary.\n\n282\n00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.980\nBut we can edit the settings here.\n\n283\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.770\nAnd you'll notice basically\nit's not much to edit.\n\n284\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.290\nBut you'll see we have the server name,\nthe shared secret is there.\n\n285\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.920\nIf we do have to change it for some\nreason, notice we can go in and do that.\n\n286\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.000\nWe have our time out, initial score report\nand then always use message authenticator.\n\n287\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.210\nRemember we specified\nthe message authenticator,\n\n288\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.410\nwe were talking about that in\nthe setup options in the last episode.\n\n289\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.390\nSo we're putting that in there.\n\n290\n00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.230\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\ncheck that off.\n\n291\n00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.060\nWhere then going to go ahead and\nwhere going to click okay,\n\n292\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.550\ngot that enable to click okay there,\nso lets give that a second.\n\n293\n00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.220\nAnd then there we go and\nthen where back into the window,\n\n294\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.020\nall right its not that we have that,\nwhere going to go in.\n\n295\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.730\nAnd we're gonna go to\nour accounting provider.\n\n296\n00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.290\nWe just did our authentication provider.\n\n297\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.780\nWe're gonna go to our accounting provider.\n\n298\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.100\nWe have both, remember.\n\n299\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.830\nAuthentication, hey, who are you?\n\n300\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.200\nLet me check you against\nour standard access list.\n\n301\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.050\nIt's the bouncer saying,\nshow me your name.\n\n302\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.190\nAre you on the list?\n\n303\n00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.550\nThe accounting provider is,\nokay essentially, who's gonna provide\n\n304\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.120\nthe oversight and the control of what\nyou're doing and making sure we keep\n\n305\n00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.500\ntrack of it in the auditing and that's\nwhat the accounting provider is gonna do.\n\n306\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.720\nSo notice, by the way, that both of these\nare set to our radius authentication\n\n307\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.030\nas opposed to in the prior walk through\nwe just set this up as a LAN router and\n\n308\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.950\nI was showing you just what's\nthe settings were as we walk through.\n\n309\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.900\nThat both of them were set to the Windows\nauthentication, option one below.\n\n310\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.010\nIn the pull dawn screen because we\nchose to set this up as our last server\n\n311\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.490\nconfigure for VPN access and\nintegrate it with the radio's client or\n\n312\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.140\nradio's server is part of the work from\nthe wizard, it pretty populate system and\n\n313\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.135\nchanges that default and sets up\nthe radio authentication for ourself.\n\n314\n00:14:58.135 --> 00:14:59.450\nYay for the wizard for the wizard screen.\n\n315\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.937\nRight cuz we don't have\nto do as much work.\n\n316\n00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:02.954\nAll right so we're gonna go go\nto accounting provider here,\n\n317\n00:15:02.954 --> 00:15:04.030\nwe're gonna click configure.\n\n318\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.960\nAgain we have our provider\nalready specified.\n\n319\n00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.389\nWe'll click Edit there, and you'll see\nthat we're gonna have the server name and\n\n320\n00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:15.563\nwe have the password, the shared secret\nthere, we have the ability to go in and\n\n321\n00:15:15.563 --> 00:15:17.293\nto our specified some timeout.\n\n322\n00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:19.679\nWe're going to check off\nSend Radius Accounting on, and\n\n323\n00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.610\naccounting off messages, this allows\nus to specify that we should d or\n\n324\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.735\nshould not be paying\nattention to the session.\n\n325\n00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.245\nAnd as a result we'll be able\nto record what you're doing.\n\n326\n00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:30.455\nAnd then when you decide to stop\ncommunicating, we essentially turn off and\n\n327\n00:15:30.455 --> 00:15:33.505\nstop recording so we're not auditing\nthe logging stuff that isn't happening\n\n328\n00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:36.675\nanymore, It's just flow control, makes\na sense if you think about it that way.\n\n329\n00:15:36.675 --> 00:15:40.155\nSo I'm just gonna click okay there, click\nokay there, again it just takes a second t\n\n330\n00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:43.630\nkind of stand up and\nset that and instantiate itself.\n\n331\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.440\nOnce we're done with that,\nwe're then gonna be able to click okay.\n\n332\n00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.927\nWe're gonna be able to now have our RRAS\nserver set up with our VPN support and\n\n333\n00:15:53.927 --> 00:15:55.744\nour radio Server tie in.\n\n334\n00:15:55.744 --> 00:15:57.902\nSo we've configured now the RRAS piece,\n\n335\n00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:01.109\nwe're gonna go back over here\nto our network policy server and\n\n336\n00:16:01.109 --> 00:16:05.510\nwe're gonna set up a brand new policy,\nI showed you what policies look like.\n\n337\n00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.170\nAnd I showed you editing\none of the default ones.\n\n338\n00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.200\nBut let's go on and create our own,\nright, cuz it's only good and\n\n339\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.982\nonly ultimately works if you actually\ncreate something beyond the default.\n\n340\n00:16:13.982 --> 00:16:16.115\nAnd then actually test to see whether or\nnot that's gonna work or not.\n\n341\n00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:17.802\nSo let's just flip back over here,\n\n342\n00:16:17.802 --> 00:16:21.643\njust gonna extend the lab time really\nquick while we're doing before we do that.\n\n343\n00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:22.766\nCuz all this hard work,\n\n344\n00:16:22.766 --> 00:16:26.260\nit would really be a shame if we have\nto redo everything from the ground up.\n\n345\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.818\nSo wanna make sure we do that, all right.\n\n346\n00:16:27.818 --> 00:16:30.390\nSo back on our network policy server.\n\n347\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.730\nYou've seen this console.\n\n348\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.171\nLeft it just where we were\nlast time we were in here.\n\n349\n00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:36.590\nAll right ,so that means the maid\nhasn't been in to clean up yet, so\n\n350\n00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.572\nwe gotta keep that in mind.\n\n351\n00:16:37.572 --> 00:16:39.990\nA little bit dirty,\nsome dust in the corners, right?\n\n352\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.170\n&gt;&gt; That's your timer.\n\n353\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:41.790\nThey don't clean it.\n\n354\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.582\nThey just blow it up.\n\n355\n00:16:42.582 --> 00:16:44.729\n&gt;&gt; They just come in and say, throw\nthe grenade in the room, you're done.\n\n356\n00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:45.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n357\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.696\nAnd that's the end of it.\n\n358\n00:16:46.696 --> 00:16:49.510\nAll right, so we're gonna extend that do\nwe don't wind up getting blown up here\n\n359\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.180\nhalfway through our conversation.\n\n360\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.220\nSo we're gonna do a new policy, right?\n\n361\n00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.775\nSo what we're gonna do is\nin the network policy area,\n\n362\n00:16:57.775 --> 00:17:01.440\nright here,\nlet's right-click &gt; New Policy.\n\n363\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.981\nLet's give this a name.\n\n364\n00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:07.371\nI'm gonna call this IT,\n\n365\n00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:13.023\nwhoops, ITProTV_Policy1.\n\n366\n00:17:13.023 --> 00:17:14.820\nReally original name on my part.\n\n367\n00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.668\nI worked on that for about four hours\nbefore we came on to do this for you,\n\n368\n00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:21.118\ntried all sorts of different combinations.\n\n369\n00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You even had a test group and\neverything.\n\n370\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.073\nWe did surveys and research.\n\n371\n00:17:25.073 --> 00:17:27.595\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It was hoot and a half.\n\n372\n00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:29.178\nLet me tell you what, if you missed that,\n\n373\n00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:32.240\nyou need to get an invitation to\nthe next one cuz it was pretty rocking.\n\n374\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.223\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna specify this.\n\n375\n00:17:35.223 --> 00:17:38.961\nWe're going to choose remote access\nserver here, and do our VPN dialup.\n\n376\n00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:42.495\nI did talk about this again when we\nedited the policy in the last episode.\n\n377\n00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:45.033\nSo consider this a quick walkthrough\non the Windows authentication\n\n378\n00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:46.160\npolicy that was there.\n\n379\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.370\nI showed you that we could specify the\ntype of access server that we would have.\n\n380\n00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.949\nDefault there is unspecified.\n\n381\n00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:53.933\nWe're doing remote access VPN.\n\n382\n00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:55.111\nWe're tying the two together.\n\n383\n00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:58.243\nSo we're gonna choose that right\nthere at the bottom as our item, and\n\n384\n00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.658\nthat's what we're gonna to.\n\n385\n00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:01.460\nSo we're gonna choose\nthat one right there.\n\n386\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.019\nDon't let that dialup thing fool you.\n\n387\n00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:07.004\nRemember it's a VPN server, and that's\nwhat we're actually using, all right?\n\n388\n00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:11.060\nSo we're gonna click Next here,\nand when we do that.\n\n389\n00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.019\nLet me move this over so you can see.\n\n390\n00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:16.023\nWhen we do that, we're gonna get those\nconditions that we looked at when we did\n\n391\n00:18:16.023 --> 00:18:18.760\nthe run through on how do we\nedit a policy, what's in there?\n\n392\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.460\nThis is where we start specifying some\nof those conditions that I showed you.\n\n393\n00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.740\nNow, could you set up a policy and\n\n394\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.085\nthen when you're done at this\nscreen have no conditions?\n\n395\n00:18:28.085 --> 00:18:30.290\nWell, you'll notice that\nwithout adding a condition,\n\n396\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.632\nwe don't have the ability to go far.\n\n397\n00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:34.510\nWe gotta have at least one\ncondition to initialize the policy.\n\n398\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.120\nBut can you go back and edit the policy\nafterwards, add other conditions,\n\n399\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.450\nyou saw that you could.\n\n400\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.270\nSo it's not as if you gotta\nput everything in here, but\n\n401\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.480\nyou gotta start somewhere, right?\n\n402\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.290\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna add a condition in.\n\n403\n00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.370\nSo let's go ahead and let's do that.\n\n404\n00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.970\n&gt;&gt; What kinda condition are we gonna add?\n\n405\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.749\n&gt;&gt; There are quite a few,\nas you can see here.\n\n406\n00:18:50.749 --> 00:18:52.200\nWhen I showed it to you\nI was on user group,\n\n407\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.498\nif I hadn't scrolled all the way up.\n\n408\n00:18:53.498 --> 00:18:55.220\nThese other two were up there,\nthey were hiding.\n\n409\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.520\nI just didn't bother to go all\nthe way up and show them to you.\n\n410\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.510\nBut you could see here we have\nall sorts of different options.\n\n411\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.979\nWe'll do a Windows group here.\n\n412\n00:19:01.979 --> 00:19:05.546\nThe Windows Group condition specifies\nthat the connecting computer or\n\n413\n00:19:05.546 --> 00:19:07.930\nuser must belong to one\nof the selected groups.\n\n414\n00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.525\nMeaning we're gonna specify membership in\na group in order to allow you to connect.\n\n415\n00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.650\nRemember, conditions are just that.\n\n416\n00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.900\nYou gotta be able to match the conditions\nin order to create the connection\n\n417\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.110\nsuccessfully, right?\n\n418\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.900\nJust like as you said with\nthe bouncing analogy,\n\n419\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.450\nthe idea is that you gotta be on the list,\nright?\n\n420\n00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.140\nAnd or have an ID or\n\n421\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.090\nwhatever the requirements are,\notherwise you don't get in, right?\n\n422\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.760\nOr you just have a lot of extra cash\nyou're not doing anything with and\n\n423\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.250\nyou may make a deposit in your friendly\nneighborhood bouncer bank in which case\n\n424\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.990\nperhaps you will get in, right?\n\n425\n00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.330\nAll right, so just be aware of the fact\nwe obviously are gonna stack these up.\n\n426\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.470\nWe're gonna select the Windows Group here.\n\n427\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.218\nSo we're gonna click Add and when we\ndo that, we get a little popup window,\n\n428\n00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:45.360\nwe have to add a group.\n\n429\n00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.608\nSo we do this.\n\n430\n00:19:46.608 --> 00:19:50.943\nThis little interface here should\nprobably be familiar to you, all right?\n\n431\n00:19:50.943 --> 00:19:53.857\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna grab under the group area,\n\n432\n00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:55.014\nI'm gonna grab my group.\n\n433\n00:19:55.014 --> 00:20:00.890\nI'm gonna do globalit, this is just\na group that already exists in there.\n\n434\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.623\nObviously in the real world, you would\ngrab whatever group you are using for\n\n435\n00:20:04.623 --> 00:20:05.446\nremote access.\n\n436\n00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:09.590\nAnd in this case,\nhowever you wanna drive that membership.\n\n437\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.308\nIt is a good idea, and\nyou do wanna maybe stop for a second or\n\n438\n00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:15.150\nthink logically in your world,\nhow am I gonna plan for this?\n\n439\n00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.220\nDo I already have a group setup\nthat drives remote access?\n\n440\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.350\nDo I, perhaps, have to create one?\n\n441\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.160\nThese are the things you'd\nwanna be thinking through and\n\n442\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.030\njust kinda working through\nyour mind as we do this.\n\n443\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.180\nBut you probably would wanna have one or\n\n444\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.270\nmore groups that are gonna have members in\nthem that are dedicated for remote access.\n\n445\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.900\nYou may not call it Global IT,\nyou may call it something else.\n\n446\n00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.470\nThat's just the name of\nthe group we're using here.\n\n447\n00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.120\nBut just keep that in mind, right?\n\n448\n00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.565\nSo just be aware of the fact this group\nwould come from the LDAP directory,\n\n449\n00:20:39.565 --> 00:20:41.021\ncomes from Active Directory.\n\n450\n00:20:41.021 --> 00:20:43.964\nYou see the domain name there,\npracticelabs.com, right?\n\n451\n00:20:43.964 --> 00:20:48.150\nAnd we're able to go in and choose\nwhatever group or groups we may decide.\n\n452\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.260\nWe could obviously add this in here.\n\n453\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.420\nCan we change object types here?\n\n454\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.820\nNotice we're talking about groups.\n\n455\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.910\nNo object types, right?\n\n456\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.120\nNot users, right?\n\n457\n00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.510\nAlthough users are in groups indirectly,\nbut not computer accounts.\n\n458\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.012\nGroups are for individuals, right,\nthat are added there and or for\n\n459\n00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.929\nthe computers we've put into them.\n\n460\n00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.670\nWe're not selecting them separately,\nwe're only using groups here.\n\n461\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.838\nSo it's gotta be the name of the group,\nnot an individual or computer account.\n\n462\n00:21:10.838 --> 00:21:12.117\nThey could be members of that group.\n\n463\n00:21:12.117 --> 00:21:14.287\nWe could put the computer account and or\n\n464\n00:21:14.287 --> 00:21:17.857\nuser into the global IT group or\ninto domain admins or whatever.\n\n465\n00:21:17.857 --> 00:21:22.436\nBut here, the only option we get is to\nselect a group, not the objects and\n\n466\n00:21:22.436 --> 00:21:24.249\ngroups as part of that list.\n\n467\n00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.011\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n468\n00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:27.267\nJust showing you that so you know.\n\n469\n00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:28.661\nAll right, so we have that there, right?\n\n470\n00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:30.902\nWe're gonna do that, let's click OK.\n\n471\n00:21:30.902 --> 00:21:33.456\nSo we've got that listed there.\n\n472\n00:21:33.456 --> 00:21:35.453\nWe'll click OK, puts that back in there so\n\n473\n00:21:35.453 --> 00:21:38.940\nwe could see we now have our condition\nwith our Windows group, right?\n\n474\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.260\nAll right, so now we can go ahead and\n\n475\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.760\nwe can choose to add more\npermissions if we want to again.\n\n476\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.940\nBe up to us to decide how\nmany we wanna put in there.\n\n477\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.850\nBut notice with at least one,\nwe do get our next button.\n\n478\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.600\nIt is populated, so now we can move ahead.\n\n479\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.070\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n480\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.310\nNow specify access permission.\n\n481\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.480\nAccess granted, access denied,\n\n482\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.060\naccess determined by user dialin\nproperties which override the NPS policy.\n\n483\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.890\nIf we have policy driven authentication,\nright, or condition match\n\n484\n00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.890\nauthentication and then access granted\nas a result, right, we can do that.\n\n485\n00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.330\nBut remember,\nthe general rule of thumb for Windows for\n\n486\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.140\nalmost anything we do is closest\nto the object always wins.\n\n487\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.370\nIt's the same rule for Group Policy\nprocessing, same rule for almost anything.\n\n488\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.050\nMeaning, that if we\noverride the NPS policy,\n\n489\n00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:30.140\nwhich you can clearly see we're allowed\nto do based on user specificity grant,\n\n490\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.920\ngo into an individual user, on the tabs\nthe object properties of that user account\n\n491\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.440\nin AD, Active Directory Users and\nComputer or ADAC, either one, right?\n\n492\n00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.970\nThe Active Directory Administration Center\nis what ADAC is, you could use that tool,\n\n493\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.840\nit's up to you.\n\n494\n00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.785\nEither one, if we grant specific\nrights to that user for\n\n495\n00:22:47.785 --> 00:22:51.120\ndialin properties,\nthat will override the policy here.\n\n496\n00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.032\nSo users can come in with a specific\ngrant that overrides the conditions.\n\n497\n00:22:55.032 --> 00:22:57.930\nBut otherwise, if we don't set them,\nthey're bound by the policy here.\n\n498\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.860\nSo are the conditions of the policy here.\n\n499\n00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.480\nSo it'd be up to us to decide,\nwe can choose.\n\n500\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.995\nSo that is also kind of a neat thing that\nopens up a tremendously interesting world\n\n501\n00:23:06.995 --> 00:23:12.203\nand universe of possibilities for\nus to envision scenarios and questions.\n\n502\n00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:15.588\nAnd boggles the mind what you could do\nwith that when you think about those case\n\n503\n00:23:15.588 --> 00:23:18.000\nstudies you may encounter at\nsome point in the future.\n\n504\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.940\nSo just be aware of the fact that remote\naccess has been one of those technologies\n\n505\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.700\nMicrosoft has really spent a lot of time\nnot only asking about in prior exams, but\n\n506\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.630\ntends to ask about on\ncore networking exams.\n\n507\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.910\nCan't really do networking\nin the Windows world,\n\n508\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.610\ncan't claim you're good at what you do.\n\n509\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.315\nCan't really only connect users if\nthey're only local and not remote.\n\n510\n00:23:36.315 --> 00:23:37.326\nIt's only have the picture, right?\n\n511\n00:23:37.326 --> 00:23:39.522\nSo if you don’t understand networking,\n\n512\n00:23:39.522 --> 00:23:41.789\nit’s gonna be a bit of a challenge for\nyou.\n\n513\n00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:44.526\nJust being fair and honest with our\nassessment about how you wanna make sure\n\n514\n00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:46.188\nyou're thinking about preparing, right?\n\n515\n00:23:46.188 --> 00:23:47.828\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n516\n00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:49.800\nAll right, so\nwe have access granted by default.\n\n517\n00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.665\nWe're gonna let people in,\nI’m feeling generous today.\n\n518\n00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:53.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll let our people in our global\n\n519\n00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:53.930\nIT group good.\n\n520\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.559\n&gt;&gt; Good, let them work.\n\n521\n00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.915\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, exactly, make them work.\n\n522\n00:23:56.915 --> 00:23:57.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n523\n00:23:57.901 --> 00:23:59.861\nconfigure authentication methods here,\nright?\n\n524\n00:23:59.861 --> 00:24:02.070\nWe did talk about different\nauthentication methods.\n\n525\n00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.360\nI've showed you these and\ntalked about them before.\n\n526\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.078\nWe're not gonna bother to make any default\nchoices and modify them here We're\n\n527\n00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:11.264\njust gonna accept what's already there but\nyou can see, we are accepting MS CHAP v2.\n\n528\n00:24:11.264 --> 00:24:12.995\nRight.\nUsers can change the password after\n\n529\n00:24:12.995 --> 00:24:14.515\nit expires, if we want them to.\n\n530\n00:24:14.515 --> 00:24:17.680\nWe're going ahead and accepting\nMS CHAP room, where I showed you.\n\n531\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.620\nWe do have MS CHAP version one support,\nbut notice and\n\n532\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.660\nI told you this, the CHAP,\nthe non Microsoft version of CHAP,\n\n533\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.170\nwhile it's offered, is not recommended for\nuse anywhere, anymore.\n\n534\n00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.180\nSo, we do have it as an option, we do\nsupport it for backwards compatibility but\n\n535\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.700\nboth CHAP and PAP, and\nyou'll notice PAP right below.\n\n536\n00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.000\nI pointed out in I think episode one.\n\n537\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.440\nI told you that while we do support\nthese authentication protocols,\n\n538\n00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.620\nthey are no longer recommended for use.\n\n539\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.720\nCan't stress that enough.\n\n540\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.790\nIt's like the third or fourth time\nI said that, if I repeat myself and\n\n541\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.500\ntell you something more than once, then\nit's probably a good hint and a half for\n\n542\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.260\nyou that that's a really important piece\nof information to be aware of, okay?\n\n543\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.770\nAnd I even went on my way to make a note\nunder the Show Notes in big letters and\n\n544\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.945\nbronzes right next to where it says, hey,\nthese are the protocols for see them.\n\n545\n00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:06.170\nI said, not recommended for use,\nand I put those two right there.\n\n546\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.500\nSo if you miss that\n\n547\n00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.550\nI don't wanna hear from you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n548\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.990\n&gt;&gt; Because I gave you every opportunity to\n\n549\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.060\nbe successful.\n\n550\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.070\nAll right so\nconfigure authentication methods.\n\n551\n00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.920\nYou'll make the appropriate choices here.\n\n552\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.740\nwe'll click next.\n\n553\n00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.770\nConfigure constraints this is where we\ncan go on and say by the way not just\n\n554\n00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.670\nconditions but then additional issues,\nadditional things you wanna address.\n\n555\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.510\nSo constraints these are parameters\nall of the network policy and\n\n556\n00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.740\nare required to match\nthe connection request.\n\n557\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.330\nIf a constraint is not matched\nby the connection request\n\n558\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.150\nMPS automatically rejects the request.\n\n559\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.400\nIf you don't meet every criteria we don't\nlet you in, it's that simple right?\n\n560\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.140\nSo it's not good to be almost as good.\n\n561\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.890\nYou got to be 100%.\n\n562\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.680\nBut it's not horseshoes and\nhand grenades right?\n\n563\n00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.670\nYou got to make sure you match 100%.\n\n564\n00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.590\nAll right so, idle time out,\nwe specify the time out here.\n\n565\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.700\nSession time out, call station ID,\n\n566\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.190\nwe could specify that meaning allow\naccesses only to this number.\n\n567\n00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.390\nWe could actually set this up so\nit calls you back.\n\n568\n00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.050\nThis is like old school technology.\n\n569\n00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.520\nBut we would, in the olden days\nof setting up brass gateways,\n\n570\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.910\npeople would literally be dialing\nup right, you would have,\n\n571\n00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.760\nthat's where the dial-up\nconcept comes from.\n\n572\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.580\nYou would have dial-up on modems or\nyou would have a modem like ISDM modems,\n\n573\n00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.930\nwhatever, that were dialing out.\n\n574\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.790\nIf you wanted a hard code and secure\nan old fashioned dial-up connection,\n\n575\n00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.860\nthe only way to do it was to be able\nto specify drop the connection.\n\n576\n00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.230\nAnd then call back to a predetermined\nnumber to allow the connection to be\n\n577\n00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.960\nspecified from the server side,\n\n578\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.430\nknowing that we're dialing in theory\nwhat a secured end point was.\n\n579\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.830\nAnd this was how we would do\ndemand-on-dial inbound gateways from\n\n580\n00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.810\nremote sites.\n\n581\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.290\nYou would have remote sites dial in.\n\n582\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.000\nThe only way you would accept the inbound\nwas to drop the connection and\n\n583\n00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.520\ncall back the pre-determined modem number\n\n584\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.150\nat the remote site to establish\na connection from the server side.\n\n585\n00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.560\nAnd that's why you can program\nin the call station ID.\n\n586\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.710\nThat's why we still have that\nbecause that is still, belive it or\n\n587\n00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.560\nnot, sometimes done.\n\n588\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.160\nNow that doesn't mean that was foolproof\nbecause somebody could have been\n\n589\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.790\ncall forwarding they\nwere really of the nasty.\n\n590\n00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.280\nThey could have been call\nforwarding that number and so\n\n591\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.110\nas a result when you dialed it, right?\n\n592\n00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.734\nThinking from the server side, I'm gonna\nconnect to the authenticated number and\n\n593\n00:27:05.734 --> 00:27:09.257\nI know I'm getting a secured connection,\nthe hacker would've tapped that line,\n\n594\n00:27:09.257 --> 00:27:12.327\ncall forwarded the call coming from\nthe server to their connection, and\n\n595\n00:27:12.327 --> 00:27:15.894\nit would have looked like it was actually\nconnecting to the authenticated number.\n\n596\n00:27:15.894 --> 00:27:17.943\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; It's really connecting to the hacker.\n\n597\n00:27:17.943 --> 00:27:19.848\nThis is, of course,\nnow I'm giving you away all the secrets\n\n598\n00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:20.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n599\n00:27:20.365 --> 00:27:21.883\n&gt;&gt; And we have to now use the whirlizer.\n\n600\n00:27:21.883 --> 00:27:23.307\n&gt;&gt; That is if you're using\ndial-up connections [CROSSTALK]\n\n601\n00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:24.904\n&gt;&gt; Look straight up to the screen,\n\n602\n00:27:24.904 --> 00:27:27.810\nwe're gonna wipe out all that\ninformation from the host.\n\n603\n00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm kind of curious to see,\nI haven't set this up in 2016, but\n\n604\n00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.600\neven in 2012, they would put phone number,\n\n605\n00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.550\neven when you're talking putting\nthe IP address for routing your modox.\n\n606\n00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.330\nSo, I wonder our wizard,\nif we are gonna come across that?\n\n607\n00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.186\nBut I guess that is yet to be determined.\n\n608\n00:27:39.186 --> 00:27:41.787\n&gt;&gt; Well you see here, specify the phone\nnumber of the network access server?\n\n609\n00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:43.407\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n610\n00:27:43.407 --> 00:27:44.370\nThat's what it is.\n\n611\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's that number,\n\n612\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.140\nif you were doing dial back,right?\n\n613\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.520\nThis is essentially what it's for.\n\n614\n00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.390\nThis is the dial-up portion right?\n\n615\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.410\nOf our program for the called station ID.\n\n616\n00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.340\nYou may not be using that and\nif you could see clearly it's an option.\n\n617\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.290\nBut I'm just pointing out\nthis is what it was used for.\n\n618\n00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.000\nAnd that's how we used to have to secure\nthese things because back in the day,\n\n619\n00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.720\nyou couldn't really secure and know for\nsure that that inbound connection\n\n620\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.120\nwas necessarily coming\nfrom an authorized number\n\n621\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.790\nunless you called back to a dedicated\nnumber you'd already programmed in.\n\n622\n00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.930\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And did the match and\n\n623\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.890\nso that's why we would do this.\n\n624\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.850\nIt's not, I told you how to do that.\n\n625\n00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.340\nBut I always told you\nhow I used to hack that.\n\n626\n00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.350\nSo you can imagine what I used to do for\na living when I was younger.\n\n627\n00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.190\nAll right, so day and time,\n\n628\n00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.430\nyou'll see we could specify connections\nduring certain days and times.\n\n629\n00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.760\nThis would be like a business thing.\n\n630\n00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.790\nHey, you're between the hours of eight and\nfive.\n\n631\n00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.360\nWe connect on these days for\nthis particular connection.\n\n632\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.900\nAgain, keep in mind,\nthis may be remote offices right?\n\n633\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.020\nThat are connecting in or\nthat you're connecting to.\n\n634\n00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.540\nThere might not be people\nthere all the times.\n\n635\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.380\nIt could be remote Infrastructure\nbeing monitored and\n\n636\n00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.120\nmanaged somewhere you know, sitting under\nsomebody's desk, who knows where it is.\n\n637\n00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.770\nYou may not want to connect\non a regular basis,\n\n638\n00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.970\nyou may want to bracket these things, so.\n\n639\n00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.070\nWe can go in and do all this.\n\n640\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.790\nSo we would specify whatever constraints\nwe want here, we're not gonna configure\n\n641\n00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.170\nany for purposes of our demonstration,\nbut just so you know what they are.\n\n642\n00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.240\nI will click Next,\nwe do have also the ability\n\n643\n00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.262\nto do radius attributes I talked about\nthese when we edited the policy as well.\n\n644\n00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:05.768\nStandard inventor specific, we do have\nrouting and remote access we've added\n\n645\n00:29:05.768 --> 00:29:10.207\nthose in so you can see here multi link\nand bandwidth allocation protocol it's\n\n646\n00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:15.240\ncalled BAP to do our allocation and our\nthrottling, we could specify that here.\n\n647\n00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.970\nIP filters we can go in and specify any IP\nfilters, both IPv4 input output, and IPv6.\n\n648\n00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.930\nSo we could specify those.\n\n649\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.960\nWe specify encryption,\n\n650\n00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.260\nbasic all the way through to\nstrongest including no encryption.\n\n651\n00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.940\nNotice we're using MPPE,\nMicrosoft Point to Point Encryption.\n\n652\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.270\nIf you are familiar with L2TP, you may\nknow that MPPE is actually what is used\n\n653\n00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.070\nunderlying some of these older, this is\nan older thought process that actually\n\n654\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.910\nis made up of PPTP, Point to Point\nTunneling Protocol and some other stuff.\n\n655\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.070\nAnd that's what's also used in L2TP.\n\n656\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.200\nSo it's kinda interesting because\nPoint to Point Tunneling Protocol\n\n657\n00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.150\nis what we actually are using with L2F,\nLayer 2 Forwarding to make L2TP.\n\n658\n00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.690\nIt's great that we got Microsoft and\nCisco together and you know,\n\n659\n00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.950\ncombined that solution.\n\n660\n00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.450\n&gt;&gt; I wonder about that.\n\n661\n00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.190\nThere's a lot in I.T. works, just like\neveryone had their own little parties and\n\n662\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.410\ndidn't wanna invite each other.\n\n663\n00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.650\nIt's like why can't we just get along.\n\n664\n00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.710\n&gt;&gt; You mean the world's different now?\n\n665\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.640\nLike they do get along now?\n\n666\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.220\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just saying it causes\na lot of extra work for us and\n\n667\n00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.070\nlearning all these different acronyms and\ntechnologies.\n\n668\n00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.440\nAre you complaining about the fact\nthat you have to know this?\n\n669\n00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.805\n&gt;&gt; I'm not complaining about anything.\n\n670\n00:30:18.805 --> 00:30:20.090\n[LAUGH].\n\n671\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.960\n&gt;&gt; Sounded like you were.\n\n672\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.600\nI just wanted to make sure we\nweren't going down that road.\n\n673\n00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.010\nAll right, so let's see here.\n\n674\n00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.330\nWe can classify the IP addresses\nthat we may want to assign here.\n\n675\n00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:30.440\nA whole bunch of options.\n\n676\n00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.440\nAgain, not good at configure right now but\njust showing you what's there.\n\n677\n00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.400\nSo we have quite a lot stuff going on.\n\n678\n00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.810\nRemember, if we added these policies,\n\n679\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.610\nwe will always get access to this stuff,\nwe could change it after the effects.\n\n680\n00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.490\nSo we're gonna click Next here,\nnow we have our completing network policy,\n\n681\n00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.230\ngot it all sketched out, ready to go.\n\n682\n00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:49.890\nI've talked about the value before\njust having this information and\n\n683\n00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.160\nknowing what's going on on here,\nso you Do you have that?\n\n684\n00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.900\nLet's click Finish.\n\n685\n00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.120\nLet's get our policies setup right there,\nsee our policies up at the top,\n\n686\n00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.460\nsitting at the top of the list.\n\n687\n00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.520\nWe have that available to us.\n\n688\n00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.790\nAnd so now, we've gone ahead and\nsetup our Network Policy Server.\n\n689\n00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.460\nWe've setup our RAS server.\n\n690\n00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.320\nWe've configured our VPN Gateway.\n\n691\n00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.730\nWe've linked the two together, so now\nwe have the two talking to one another.\n\n692\n00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.690\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; What's next?\n\n693\n00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.350\nWhat's next?\n\n694\n00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.060\nWell, we could go in and\nconfigure the VPN server and\n\n695\n00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.780\nclient connectivity, set up the ports and\nactually test this whole thing.\n\n696\n00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.340\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; But that would require yet\n\n697\n00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.365\nanother conversation in another episode.\n\n698\n00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:25.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nsounds like a plan Adam.\n\n699\n00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.540\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n700\n00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.440\n&gt;&gt; That's what we'll do then.\n\n701\n00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.710\nWe'll do that when we come back.\n\n702\n00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so thank you so\nmuch for joining us, but stay tuned.\n\n703\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.160\nWe do have more information to cover So,\n\n704\n00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.030\nfor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n705\n00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:44.030\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n706\n00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:44.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n707\n00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.570\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n708\n00:31:46.570 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:07.876\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:11.236\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:15.425\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:17.560\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.670\nIn this episode, we'll continue looking\nat remote access, and I think we're what,\n\n9\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.584\nat a part five now.\n\n10\n00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:26.450\nSo we've been, doing this for quite\nawhile, but there's still more to learn.\n\n11\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.400\nSo back with us today in studios,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.240\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nwe're going to jump back in, and\n\n14\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.205\nwe're going to continue pick up,\nand finish where we left off.\n\n15\n00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:41.312\nCuz what we're gonna do is complete or\nclose the circle of VPN/MPS and\n\n16\n00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.342\nhow we can configure everything.\n\n17\n00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:47.795\nWe've stood up the VPN,\nthe RRAS solution with VPN support.\n\n18\n00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.055\nWe've stood up our MPS server,\n\n19\n00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:52.297\nwe've bound the two together,\nconfigure the radius functionality.\n\n20\n00:00:52.297 --> 00:00:54.377\nWhat we're gonna do now is\nlook at the client side.\n\n21\n00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:56.087\nIt's great to do all this, but\n\n22\n00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:58.793\nif we don't actually tech it,\ncheck it, I sound like you now.\n\n23\n00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:00.579\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if we don't test it and\n\n24\n00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.690\nwe don't actually validate that the rule\nthat we just put in place works,\n\n25\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.217\nthen we don't really know for\nsure what we did is valuable.\n\n26\n00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:10.117\nSo, we're gonna actually, as Cherokee\nalways reminds us to do, go verify and\n\n27\n00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:10.987\nvalidate our works.\n\n28\n00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:15.970\nSo, join me here if you will, we're gonna\ntake a look at our Windows 10 client,\n\n29\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.260\nright on the screen there.\n\n30\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.170\nAnd I've done just a little bit\nof work behind the scenes here,\n\n31\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.340\nI'll explain what I did.\n\n32\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.424\nThis is really Just\nsetting up the connection,\n\n33\n00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:28.720\nadding the VPN connection in to this first\nsign right here to the Windows 10 client.\n\n34\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.350\nI could have done this by going and\ncreating a VPN connection from the Wizard.\n\n35\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.950\nBut I just went ahead, and did it for\nyou here with PowerShell again.\n\n36\n00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.720\nSo you could see what we're doing\njust understand the logic of it, but\n\n37\n00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.120\nalso learn a little more about PowerShell.\n\n38\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.340\nI'm convinced that if we throw enough of\nthese options at you in these episodes,\n\n39\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.440\nthrough osmosis, you're gonna become\nPowerShell-friendly over time and\n\n40\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.250\nlearn more about it.\n\n41\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.110\nSo, add VPN connection command that\nis used, named our connection,\n\n42\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.488\nyou're gonna see this in a minute,\nI'll show it to you in the control panel.\n\n43\n00:01:56.488 --> 00:02:01.050\nServer address is specified where we wanna\nconnect, what's the tunnel type PPTP,\n\n44\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.380\npoint to point tunneling?\n\n45\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.840\nNow ,this next one here\nset VPN connection,\n\n46\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.650\nsplit tunneling true, that sets\nthe split tunneling connection for us.\n\n47\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.240\nThat is unique specifically to the lab\nenvironment, we're using in the demo for\n\n48\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.400\nyou and\nthe environment the way it is set up.\n\n49\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.832\nIf I don't do that particular piece and\nset that up,\n\n50\n00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:20.535\nthen when I go to fire up the VPN, a big\nblack hole opens and swallows my machine,\n\n51\n00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:21.889\nand everything collapses.\n\n52\n00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.841\nBecause I disconnect from the virtual\nnetwork that we're running on and\n\n53\n00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:28.790\nessentially, I am unmanaged,\nI am off in space.\n\n54\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.135\nYou may not set up split tunneling in\nthe real world, that's a whole other\n\n55\n00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.015\nconversation, but in case you're\nwondering why that's sitting there,\n\n56\n00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.295\nthat's there specific to\nthe environment we're using.\n\n57\n00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:40.575\nOtherwise, things just don't work so well\nwhen you have no way to get back to them.\n\n58\n00:02:40.575 --> 00:02:43.270\nLet's put it that way.\nAll right, so then I just issued to get\n\n59\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.275\nVPN connection cmdlet that shows\nme the output of what I did.\n\n60\n00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:48.300\nI did this for two reasons.\n\n61\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.620\nOne, I wanna show you.\n\n62\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.931\nAnd speaking of showing,\nlet me move that over so you can see.\n\n63\n00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:56.890\nI did wanna show you what we actually\ndid the add VPN connect cmdlet,\n\n64\n00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.570\nyou could see that here.\n\n65\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.890\nBut I also did it to verify\nthat set VPN connection\n\n66\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.380\nsplit tunneling option was set to true.\n\n67\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.270\nSo that way, I can actually know that\nI could do this without disconnecting\n\n68\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.390\nthe machine, and\nloosing management of it in the interface.\n\n69\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.370\nAnd you could see,\nthat split tunneling is indeed turned on.\n\n70\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.147\nSet to true cuz is by default, it is not.\n\n71\n00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:21.094\nAnd we could see that we do have our\nplabs PPTP VPN connection set up.\n\n72\n00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:25.360\n192 and 68010 is my IP address,\nthat's where we're connecting.\n\n73\n00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.250\nNotice our authentication method,\nMS-CHAPv2 right there.\n\n74\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.310\nRight, so we have all of our\ninformation set up and ready to go.\n\n75\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.220\nNotice our connection status\nis currently disconnected, so\n\n76\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.240\nwe could tell it's not currently running.\n\n77\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.560\nWe can just double check that.\n\n78\n00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.357\nOne more time because I have been setting\nit up and testing it, just to make sure\n\n79\n00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:48.320\nthat we have accurate information\non the screen for you right now.\n\n80\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320\nIt's currently disconnecting.\n\n81\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.050\nNow, we can tell that and know that.\n\n82\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.420\nWe'll come over her we could see\njust by looking that, yes indeed,\n\n83\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.520\nit is disconnected.\n\n84\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.550\nYou could see the connection there.\n\n85\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.170\nJust in the network and\nsharing center and network and\n\n86\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.600\nInternet, network connections area,\nand the networking center.\n\n87\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.440\nI'm just gonna right-click and\n\n88\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.400\nenable the connection, so\nI'm gonna go in, Connect or Disconnect,\n\n89\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.460\nbring up Settings, highlight it right\nhere and have the option to Connect.\n\n90\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.451\nSo this is Windows 10, so if this\nlooks a little different that what you\n\n91\n00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:17.654\nmaybe used to using, you may have\na different client, maybe use a older one.\n\n92\n00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:21.349\nBut if you're using Windows 8.1, Windows\n10 is gonna look roughly like this.\n\n93\n00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.221\nSo we're gonna connect.\n\n94\n00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:25.530\nI've got a couple of different user\naccounts I'm gonna use to connect in.\n\n95\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.900\nOne that will be allowed to connect in,\nthat's a member of that global IT group,\n\n96\n00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.270\nif you remember that we used in\nthe prior episode to set up the rule.\n\n97\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.761\nI'm gonna use one that's\nnot gonna be allowed in.\n\n98\n00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.100\nYou'll see what happens and\nthe difference between them.\n\n99\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.310\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's hit connect here.\n\n100\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.240\nWe're gonna get prompted with our\ncredential or for our credential.\n\n101\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.380\nSo we'll type this in,\nlet's do practicelabs.\n\n102\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.816\nAnd let me do, Our user, Jan.\n\n103\n00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:55.902\nAnd Jan, Will be able to connect, and\n\n104\n00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:59.720\nyou could see immediately as I connect,\nJan is connected right there.\n\n105\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.232\nAnd when we do this, I'll just minimize\nand minimize, and if we do this.\n\n106\n00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:12.380\nYou will see that, the connection status\nright here has changed to connected.\n\n107\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.010\nSo you could see we\nare actively connected.\n\n108\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.100\nWe're using the VPN right now.\n\n109\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.010\nSo, if we go ahead and we will do\nthis right now, and we disconnect.\n\n110\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.270\nWe'll just disconnect Jan.\n\n111\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.960\nVery simple, turn the VPN connection off.\n\n112\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.320\nSo we know that Jan was able\nto successfully connect in,\n\n113\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.080\npart of the global IT group,\nand therefore allowed in.\n\n114\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.730\nLet's go ahead,\n\n115\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.270\nlet's take a look at another user that\nis going to attempt to connect in.\n\n116\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.790\nHowever this one,\nis not going to be allowed in.\n\n117\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.530\nSo, let's just take a look and\nsee what happened.\n\n118\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.483\nSo again, practice Labs, and then John.\n\n119\n00:05:55.873 --> 00:05:59.606\nAnd you'll see that,\nJohn is not able to connect.\n\n120\n00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:03.005\nAnd you'll see here,\ncan't connect to the PPTP VPN.\n\n121\n00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:07.405\nConnection was prevented, because of\na policy configured on our RAS VPN server.\n\n122\n00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:10.905\nSpecifically it says, authentication\nmethod used by the server to verify\n\n123\n00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:12.465\nusername and password does not or\n\n124\n00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:15.495\nmay not match the authentication\nrequirements in play with the policy,\n\n125\n00:06:15.495 --> 00:06:18.410\nand as a result, essentially,\nhey guess what, John, you're out of luck.\n\n126\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.420\nYou're not getting in.\n\n127\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.050\nAnd so we could see that\nJohn is not allowed in, and\n\n128\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.590\nas a result that is denied connectivity.\n\n129\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.720\nAnd so of course if we just close that\nout, we see the VPN is not connected.\n\n130\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.730\nAnd if we went back, and we took a look,\n\n131\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.130\njust to tell, We would see that\nit is indeed disconnected.\n\n132\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.020\nSo we could see our policy\nis actually working.\n\n133\n00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.716\nWe are able to, or not able to connect,\ndepending on who we are.\n\n134\n00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:45.888\nIn this case, remember, you have to\nbe a member of the appropriate group\n\n135\n00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.957\nwith the appropriate configuration or\nconditions and criteria met,\n\n136\n00:06:48.957 --> 00:06:50.345\nin order to be able to connect.\n\n137\n00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.705\nAnd whatever John's problem is, it\nviolates one or more of the conditions or\n\n138\n00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:53.551\nattributes of the policy.\n\n139\n00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:55.087\n&gt;&gt; He didn't have the proper attire.\n\n140\n00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:56.000\n&gt;&gt; He may not have.\n\n141\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.701\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He may have liked Brittany Spears or\n\n142\n00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.720\nsomebody, and we just don't allow that\nkind of behavior here at ITProTV.\n\n143\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.690\nSo as a result,\nhe may not have been allowed in.\n\n144\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.820\nWhatever the case is, but we're not\ndone yet, this is obviously pretty cool.\n\n145\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.310\nAfter all that work prior to\nsetting up all the moving parts,\n\n146\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.680\nright, we actually do see\nthe policy's in effect.\n\n147\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.660\nSo that is cool, but that's not all we\nwanna do, because this is important.\n\n148\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.295\nPolicy enforcement very good.\n\n149\n00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:24.266\nBut remember as the IT administrator,\nas the RRAS overseer, as the NPS overseer,\n\n150\n00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:27.888\nsomebody who is gonna manage\nthis infrastructure, we may or\n\n151\n00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.957\nmay not see evidence of\nthese connections come in.\n\n152\n00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:33.792\nAnd may or may not know that John was or\nwas not denied,\n\n153\n00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:37.903\ncuz we are not sitting next to John when\nhe or she or generally but it connects.\n\n154\n00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:40.001\nWhat we're gonna do,\nis we're gonna be on the policy side,\n\n155\n00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.193\nlet me on the server side,\nwe're gonna be looking over there.\n\n156\n00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:46.003\nSo we have to do now is flip over the\nserver, and take a look at those log files\n\n157\n00:07:46.003 --> 00:07:50.319\nand see what they don't have any evidence\nof what's going on, and boy, do we ever?\n\n158\n00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.173\nLet's take a look here.\n\n159\n00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:55.172\nSo let me go over here,\nlet us go into our server.\n\n160\n00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:56.039\nSo this is the server,\n\n161\n00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:58.878\nyou may notice the desktop looks\ndifference since last time we were here.\n\n162\n00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:02.175\nWe had it redecorated brought\nin a professional team,\n\n163\n00:08:02.175 --> 00:08:06.020\ndid a little spoofing up, and\nwe added a third party viewer.\n\n164\n00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.338\nAnd I asked LogViewer, if you remember\nfrom when I set up in one of the prior\n\n165\n00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:12.916\nepisodes the policy we\nset up the logging for\n\n166\n00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:16.766\n[INAUDIBLE] we said,\nwell different options ODBC, right, etc.\n\n167\n00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:20.801\nAnd I chose, the IAS log format and\nI have a LogViewer for that, and\n\n168\n00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:23.700\nwe will take a look at\nthat in just a minute.\n\n169\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.910\nBut I wanna show you,\nWhere these logs come from.\n\n170\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.000\nThe log is going to be the log that\nis created, you'll see here System or\n\n171\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.150\nWindows rather /System32/logfiles.\n\n172\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.340\nThat is the default path for\nlogging for the network policy server.\n\n173\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.710\nIf you remember, when we were setting this\nup, and we went in and we specified it,\n\n174\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.220\nwe decided to do logging on the machine,\nnot to the SQL Server.\n\n175\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.750\nAnd we had that default path.\n\n176\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.650\nAnd that is the log right there.\n\n177\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.150\nAnd so this log that we are looking at,\nlet me just bring this up.\n\n178\n00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.010\nIt's just a notepad file,\nis gonna show the connections for\n\n179\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.490\nall the people that we were just bringing.\n\n180\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.400\nNow this is a little tough to read,\nit's comma delimited data, and\n\n181\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.290\nit's one entry per line but\nall the way across, and this thing goes.\n\n182\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.023\nBy the way, tell me when you get tired.\n\n183\n00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Tired.\n\n184\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.500\n&gt;&gt; This is like one-tenth\nof the total log, right?\n\n185\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.578\nSo you could see,\nthis is quite a bit of information, right?\n\n186\n00:09:19.578 --> 00:09:20.722\nI mean I wanna read it this way, but, and\n\n187\n00:09:20.722 --> 00:09:22.262\nwe're gonna show you\na different way of seeing this.\n\n188\n00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:26.369\nThis is the IIS log format, but\nhaving said that, you'll notice, and\n\n189\n00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:29.120\nI did have another user I tried the-\n&gt;&gt; Lisa?\n\n190\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.112\n&gt;&gt; Tried the connection with before\nwe came on to do the episode for you.\n\n191\n00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:34.976\nJust so I'd have more than\nthe two entries that we did, and\n\n192\n00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:36.820\nthe logs you would see them, right.\n\n193\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.720\nSo I did connect with Lisa, just so\nyou know that, that's there.\n\n194\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.306\nThat's my super secret\nalias when I'm not here.\n\n195\n00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:42.430\n&gt;&gt; Alter ego.\n\n196\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.848\n&gt;&gt; That's my alter ego.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:09:43.848 --> 00:09:45.350\n&gt;&gt; That's what I run around as.\n\n198\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.395\nI run around as Lisa Scott.\n\n199\n00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:49.382\nSo you could see Lisa was\nsuccessful at connecting in.\n\n200\n00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:53.750\nYou could see John Summers, right,\nwe tried to connect with John.\n\n201\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.690\nJohn is here,\nas is Jan Regis right here, right?\n\n202\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.870\nSo we do have evidence of this,\nbut it's hard to see for\n\n203\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.220\nsure kinda what's going on and\nwhat's happening.\n\n204\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.440\nSo while it's important to see the log,\n\n205\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.080\nthis format may not be\nthe most user friendly.\n\n206\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.310\nSo that's where this tool comes in.\n\n207\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.950\nWe can actually bring in, and again,\nthis is just a third party tool.\n\n208\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.760\nYou can download a variety\nof these viewers.\n\n209\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.830\nThis just happens to be\nthe one that we're using here.\n\n210\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.280\nThis gives us the trial version, but\nyou could see that I'm able to see, and\n\n211\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.743\nit's easy, it's colored coded.\n\n212\n00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:26.640\nLisa and Jan in blue are successful.\n\n213\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.600\nWe could see they were able to connect in.\n\n214\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.616\nThey're given an IP address.\n\n215\n00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:33.540\nWe see the octets,\nthe amount of octets that are output.\n\n216\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.250\nIn other words,\njust information about them, right?\n\n217\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.020\nWe're seeing the connection request\nsuccess, connection reset finished.\n\n218\n00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.730\nYou'll see here John is rejected, right?\n\n219\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.667\nHe is not allowed in.\n\n220\n00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:48.347\nAnd so, as a result, we can see\nimmediately what's happening and\n\n221\n00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.844\nlook at the records and\npull the log data, and\n\n222\n00:10:50.844 --> 00:10:55.000\nactually see it in a little bit\neasier way to consume and understand.\n\n223\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.740\nAgain, you don't have\nto use this LogViewer.\n\n224\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.857\nBut just pointing out that we can view\nlogs in a variety of different ways.\n\n225\n00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:02.604\nIt may be easier depending\non the format you chose for\n\n226\n00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:06.860\nlogging to use a third party tool to\nactually consume and see this information.\n\n227\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.780\nBut, this does show us that\nwe were successful with two.\n\n228\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.660\nNot successful with one, but\nwe've validated that our policy is\n\n229\n00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.780\nindeed enforced and is being used in\nour routing and remote access console.\n\n230\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.740\nOur VPN gateway is being used,\n\n231\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.686\nconnected to our radius server,\neverything is working the way it should.\n\n232\n00:11:21.686 --> 00:11:22.960\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n\n233\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.620\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n234\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.170\n&gt;&gt; We can essentially block and\n\n235\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:31.280\nallow as we as predetermined\nperimeters requirements.\n\n236\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Our policy, right, just one of\nour policies absolutely correct.\n\n237\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.216\nSo we're able to do that but now we have\nempirical proof that, we are seeing that\n\n238\n00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:40.622\nthe depending on the log on, and the\nassociation of that user with the policy,\n\n239\n00:11:40.622 --> 00:11:43.172\nwe do or don't allow them in\ncan actually see the results.\n\n240\n00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:46.406\n&gt;&gt; And an easy to read format [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah in the easy to read format,\n\n241\n00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.210\nabsolutely correct, okay?\n\n242\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so is that it for\nthis particular episode?\n\n243\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.231\nHave we reached the end of our\nremote access journey [CROSSTALK]\n\n244\n00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:53.166\n&gt;&gt; That is it for\n\n245\n00:11:53.166 --> 00:11:55.210\nour remote access journey.\n\n246\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.260\nWe will come back with\nadditional episodes.\n\n247\n00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.440\nWe promised,\nwe would talk about direct access.\n\n248\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.650\nSo we do have some discussion to do there.\n\n249\n00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.790\nWe'll have some additional\nthought processes.\n\n250\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.600\nWe're gonna also talk about VPNs overall,\nkinda hint or\n\n251\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.350\ndetermine showing you how to set them up.\n\n252\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.617\nWe'll have some things to say\nabout that in upcoming episodes.\n\n253\n00:12:12.616 --> 00:12:13.199\nWhat else?\n\n254\n00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.322\nSo, lot sorts of other stuff, branch cash?\n\n255\n00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; DFS and who knows what else?\n\n256\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.371\nWe'll just make some stuff up\nthat sounds like a [INAUDIBLE].\n\n257\n00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Adam.\n\n258\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.430\nThank you so much for that.\n\n259\n00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.860\nAnd thank you for joining us as well, but\nfor this show, we are gonna go ahead and\n\n260\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.400\nsign off.\n\n261\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.300\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n262\n00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.010\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n263\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.477\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here on

00:00:08.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:12.013\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your networking\nwith Windows Server 2016 series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.480\nIn this episode,\nwe'll be taking a look at direct access.\n\n8\n00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.570\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.070\nAdam Gordon, thank you for\njoining us today Adam, how you're doing?\n\n10\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.880\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nHopefully everybody out there is\n\n11\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.800\ndoing well.\n\n12\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.777\nInteresting topic.\n\n13\n00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.924\nWe've been talking about in\nprior episodes, remote access.\n\n14\n00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:35.046\nI've spent a fair amount\nof time going through and\n\n15\n00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:37.610\nsetting up different kinds of VPNs.\n\n16\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.450\nWe talked about or\ntook a look at how to set up NAT.\n\n17\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.635\nWe've gone through the routing\nremote access server.\n\n18\n00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.650\nWe even took a look at\nthe network policy server, right?\n\n19\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.020\nAnd showed our walk through\nthat whole demo and\n\n20\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.160\nhow we could set it up and in the end\nuse the policy to allow or deny access.\n\n21\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.894\nSo we've been through a lot of what\ngoes on with remote access and\n\n22\n00:00:55.894 --> 00:01:00.194\nhow we allow external clients coming\nin and securing those connections.\n\n23\n00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.231\nBut we're gonna continue\nthat thought process.\n\n24\n00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:04.700\nDirect access is kind of\nan interesting technology.\n\n25\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.724\nI alluded to it in one\nof our prior episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:11.069\nI was talking about the fact that I\nhad used one of the precursors to this\n\n27\n00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.330\ntechnology.\n\n28\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.690\nProbably at this point close\nto a decade or so ago.\n\n29\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.678\nAnd using it internally when I was\nworking at Microsoft at the time.\n\n30\n00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:24.847\nAnd that,\n[COUGH] When we used this technology, and\n\n31\n00:01:24.847 --> 00:01:28.133\nyou can imagine what it was like\nback then versus what it is now.\n\n32\n00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:32.356\nWhat we're essentially doing is allowing\nourselves to use a variety of different\n\n33\n00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.600\ntechniques depending on what kind\nof system we connect from and\n\n34\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.145\nwhat the circumstances are.\n\n35\n00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:42.600\nTo connect into the servers or the gateway\nserver, the direct access server.\n\n36\n00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.420\nTruly just our RRAS server running\ndirect access traditionally,\n\n37\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.250\nusually either setup\nas a dedicated role or\n\n38\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.930\nthe direct access role along with the VPN\nrole maybe running on that server.\n\n39\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.705\nIt depends on how you\nchoose to configure it.\n\n40\n00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:58.090\nBut the direct access server\nacts as our inbound gateway.\n\n41\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.370\nIt's a server that's running Server\n16 with the direct access role setup.\n\n42\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.490\nIt has to be one that\nis joined to a domain.\n\n43\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.595\nSo it's gonna obviously\nhave to be a domain server.\n\n44\n00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:09.270\nNot a domain controller,\nbut a domain server.\n\n45\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.440\nBut ultimately,\nwe're then able to connect through and\n\n46\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.210\naccess as if we were\nusing a traditional VPN.\n\n47\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.910\nThe difference being that.\n\n48\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.180\nAssuming we have the right\nkind of client configuration.\n\n49\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.990\nWe're using IPv6 to drive the connection.\n\n50\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.470\nIf we don't have IPv6, we can use\none of our translation technologies,\n\n51\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.340\n6to4, Teredo, which we could use for\nthe Windows 7 clients.\n\n52\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.590\nSo we have that capability and\nwe're able to use IPv6\n\n53\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.160\ncapable apps on the back end better\nthan served up and provided.\n\n54\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.750\nAnd if we don't have that capability,\nwe even have NAT64 and\n\n55\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.570\nDNS64 that allows us\nto do the translation.\n\n56\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.370\nSo we provide those capabilities through\nthe Direct Access Server and allow us to\n\n57\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.390\nessentially have an IPsec enabled tunnel\nthat allows us to connect securely.\n\n58\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.793\nConfigure out and connect up all of\nour information management solutions,\n\n59\n00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:06.003\nto be able to do what we need to do in\nterms of keeping track of the session.\n\n60\n00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:09.126\nHave complete understanding\nof access control and\n\n61\n00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:11.311\nmonitoring of what's happening.\n\n62\n00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:16.218\nAll the things bells and whistles we think\nof, but ultimately we're doing so in\n\n63\n00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:21.139\na secure and therefore confidential and,\n[COUGH] As a result of that, safe way.\n\n64\n00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.439\nNow, sometimes we also hear people\ntalk about another tech node called\n\n65\n00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.660\nVPN Reconnect.\n\n66\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.901\nVPN Reconnect, a lot of times, people may\nconfuse the two or talk about the two and\n\n67\n00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:33.239\nsay no, direct access,\nVPN Reconnect kinda the same thing.\n\n68\n00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.830\nWell, they are similar,\nbut they're not the same.\n\n69\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.600\nVPN reconnect uses IKE tunnel, to be\nable to, or IKE as the key technology,\n\n70\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.760\nbe able to drive the reconnect to the VPN,\nshould it for some reason drop.\n\n71\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.200\nSo, if you have a Windows 7 client,\nlet's say, Windows 8 client, and you are,\n\n72\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.740\n[COUGH] Going to connect in.\n\n73\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.330\nAnd VPN is, for some reason, terminated,\n\n74\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.530\nthen VPN Reconnect with automatically\nseek to reestablish that for you.\n\n75\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.580\nSo that's a little bit of\na different technology.\n\n76\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.620\nWe do set that up and can certainly\nwork with that thought process as well.\n\n77\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.870\nVPN Reconnect's been around for\na while now.\n\n78\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.512\nServer 2008, 2008 RD, I think,\nWindows 7 on the client side,\n\n79\n00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:13.939\nso we've heard people talking about\nthat and using that for a while.\n\n80\n00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.683\nDirect Access I said in one form or\nanother been around for\n\n81\n00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:19.166\nsome time now as well.\n\n82\n00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.303\nBut this allows us to essentially set up,\nas we said,\n\n83\n00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.340\nthis IP SEC tunnel coming\nin from the outside.\n\n84\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.370\nSo we have the ability either with\nexternal resources coming in or\n\n85\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.540\ninternal resources that are connecting.\n\n86\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.450\nWe have different ways,\n\n87\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.790\ndifferent thought processes that we\nthink about people coming in from.\n\n88\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.790\nBut our external connections coming\nin will be secured and connected.\n\n89\n00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.180\nAny domain joined computer as\na client that is running can\n\n90\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.030\nhave the enterprise edition of\nthe client software running but\n\n91\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.560\ncan use it as Windows 10, Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1 and or Windows 7.\n\n92\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.470\nFor Windows 7,\n\n93\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.960\nI believe I remember correctly need to\nuse SP1 in order to make this work.\n\n94\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.119\nBut other than that you're\nessentially able to run that.\n\n95\n00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.846\nWe connect instead of using IPv6 and\nas a result of IPsec,\n\n96\n00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:09.269\nso we wanna make sure that we're\nrunning IPv6 to use direct access.\n\n97\n00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:12.879\nBut keep mind, if we're not running\non a native IPv6 network it's okay,\n\n98\n00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.980\nwe're still gonna be able to do this.\n\n99\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.020\nI bet you that's what you were just\nabout to ask about, wasn't it?\n\n100\n00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.568\nCuz I saw that look in your eye.\n\n101\n00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, what if we don't have IPv6?\n\n102\n00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.019\nCan't we use one of those cool\ntechnologies we've talked about before?\n\n103\n00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:25.145\nAnd we've talked about some of these.\n\n104\n00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:29.608\nWe've talked about IPv6 over IPv4\ntunnelling, and we could use that.\n\n105\n00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:32.770\nSo we could do the six to four\ntunnel in or the teredo adaptor,\n\n106\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.862\nwe can use different things in order to\nbe able to offset the fact that we're not\n\n107\n00:05:36.862 --> 00:05:38.862\nrunning with IPv6, as I suggested.\n\n108\n00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:41.830\nAnd the computer will do\nthe connection for us.\n\n109\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.680\nThe user may not even be logged on.\n\n110\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.270\nIn order to be able to create this\nconnection we set up and start talking or\n\n111\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.920\ninteracting.\n\n112\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.024\nSo that's nice, kinda does it for us.\n\n113\n00:05:50.024 --> 00:05:52.831\nAnd I'm gonna run down the hall,\nget a glass of water, you go ahead and\n\n114\n00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:55.700\nconnect for me, I'll come back,\nit's all set up ready to go, right?\n\n115\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.105\nSo that part is kinda nice.\n\n116\n00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:58.673\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n117\n00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:03.758\nIf we do have a firewall or proxy\nthat gets in the way of us being able\n\n118\n00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:08.566\nto setup the connection using IPv6 or\nsomething like that and\n\n119\n00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:13.113\nwe have to fall back on and or\nblock the six to four adapter.\n\n120\n00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:16.133\nOr terodo is not working because\nof connectivity concerns and\n\n121\n00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:17.475\nconfiguration concerns.\n\n122\n00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:22.947\nIf any and all that is still not\ngonna happen, we also have another\n\n123\n00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:28.910\nsolution to fall back on yet\nanother option, the IPHTTPS protocol.\n\n124\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.180\nWe essentially can tunnel through the web,\nand do a secure SSL connection.\n\n125\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.800\nSo this is gonna still\nallow us to connect,\n\n126\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.060\neven though we may not necessarily\nbe leveraging that other technology.\n\n127\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.560\nSo almost no matter what you do,\nwe can find a way to get you in and\n\n128\n00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.019\nget you connected, with this technology.\n\n129\n00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.458\nWe do need network location services, so\n\n130\n00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:51.083\nthe network location server is\ngoing to use that capability or\n\n131\n00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:55.560\nprovide that capability for us on\nthe client side to determine where we are.\n\n132\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.792\nAre we inside the network,\nbehind the firewall?\n\n133\n00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:02.210\nAre we outside and therefore need\nthe direct access capability?\n\n134\n00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.230\nCuz remember, if we're inside on the LAN,\nchances are good we don't need to punch\n\n135\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.150\na secure connection through\nthe external firewall coming in.\n\n136\n00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.397\nFor essentially, this access or\nremote access-like technology.\n\n137\n00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:15.910\nSo we have to tell where we are,\n\n138\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.245\nwhere we assume we're on the inside\nif we have certain addressing.\n\n139\n00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:21.370\nWe're on the outside,\nif we have certain addressing.\n\n140\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.039\nSo network location becomes important,\nbecause it tells us how to deploy and\n\n141\n00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.269\nuse this technology, and\nwhether it's appropriate for us or not.\n\n142\n00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:30.240\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n143\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.188\nWe will set up a network\nlocation Services or\n\n144\n00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:37.020\ntell clients where to find\nthe network location server.\n\n145\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.071\nThrough the use of a GPO,\nthrough the use of Group Policy Objects.\n\n146\n00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:43.949\nAnd so we do just wanna keep in mind\nthat one of the components here is gonna\n\n147\n00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.250\nbe the ability, and we talked about this.\n\n148\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.425\nYou have to be domain joined.\n\n149\n00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:51.802\nBut the ability not just to leverage the\ndomain for authentication, but we're gonna\n\n150\n00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:55.996\nuse policy-based deployment to at least\ngive us part of the thought process, and\n\n151\n00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:58.480\npart of the understanding\nof how this works.\n\n152\n00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.657\nCherokee I know you wanted to jump in,\nand you wanna say something.\n\n153\n00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:01.623\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, I was gonna say, so\n\n154\n00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:06.264\nthe location services will also be useful\nin a situation like we had previously\n\n155\n00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:10.694\ncovered when we were looking at our\nnetwork policy server So we could really\n\n156\n00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:16.380\nperform a type of access control depending\non the location of that individual system.\n\n157\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.949\n&gt;&gt; We can or we can kinda constrain think\nof it different ways but essentially yeah,\n\n158\n00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:21.743\nwe could say hey you're allowed or not.\n\n159\n00:08:21.743 --> 00:08:26.012\nBased on where you are or\nother capabilities into a constraints or\n\n160\n00:08:26.012 --> 00:08:28.351\nproperties that maybe we ascribe.\n\n161\n00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:30.330\nIn this case it's really gonna\nbe about location, right?\n\n162\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.650\nSo it's gonna be about subnet driven or\nIP driven decisions about where you are.\n\n163\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.260\nBut yeah,\nwe could extend that thought process.\n\n164\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.840\nWe did talk about it with the NPS Server\nwhen we took a look at different ways we\n\n165\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.820\ncould allow or\ndeny the connectivity, absolutely.\n\n166\n00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.370\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n167\n00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.854\nWe are for\ninside gonna be able to provide or\n\n168\n00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:50.442\nget access to these resources\nif we're outside, as we said,\n\n169\n00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:54.380\nget access to these resources either way,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n170\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.852\nWe do need the Active Directory\nbase domain, as I suggested.\n\n171\n00:08:57.852 --> 00:09:00.380\nMinimum, kinda interesting here\nbecause the minimum requirement for\n\n172\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.790\nAD is kinda low.\n\n173\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.820\nAt least Windows Server\n2003 functional level but\n\n174\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.260\nwe don't have to be up to 2008 or\nrunning a 2012 or even at 2016.\n\n175\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.770\nAs I said, DirectAccess has been around\nfor some time and the technology is just\n\n176\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.750\nreally another way of thinking about\ncontrolling and configuring Remote Access.\n\n177\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.370\nNothing special there, in other words,\nthat requires newer support.\n\n178\n00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.900\nSo in mixed domain environments,\n\n179\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.250\nolder domain environments,\nstill gonna work with no trouble.\n\n180\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.790\nWe do need Group Policy\nelements as we talked about.\n\n181\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.080\nWe may need PKI infrastructure.\n\n182\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.300\nDepending on what we're doing.\n\n183\n00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.500\nOn the internal side of\nthe network we don't need it but\n\n184\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.960\ncoming in from the outside\nwe will often require that.\n\n185\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.620\nBecause we're gonna be able to or\nuse requests that are sent over HTTPS for\n\n186\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.110\nKerberos proxying.\n\n187\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.530\nSo we do need certificate infrastructure\nfor us to be able to do that so\n\n188\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.920\njust keep that in mind.\n\n189\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.510\nEspecially if we're gonna do a full blown\ndeployment with two factor authentication\n\n190\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.380\nand setting up the whole nine yards.\n\n191\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.980\nWe are gonna need certificates\nregistered on our other site.\n\n192\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.760\nNow we can do our own certificates, so\n\n193\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.120\nwe can essentially have our own\nPKI issue certificates out.\n\n194\n00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.970\nWe may use third party PKIs, so\nwe may go to the VeriSigns, the RSA,\n\n195\n00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.090\nthe fleets of the world, whoever it may\nbe, we can get certificates from there.\n\n196\n00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.040\nA lot of you may have your\nown PKI infrastructure,\n\n197\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880\na lot of you may use\nthird party certificates.\n\n198\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.300\nIt's really up to you to decide\nhow you want to do that.\n\n199\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.780\nWe also would, of course, based on\nall the other things I talked about,\n\n200\n00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.560\nneed DNS because we need\nname resolution services.\n\n201\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.690\nLucky for you, we've done a whole\nset of episodes on how to run DNS,\n\n202\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.690\nand IPv6, and all the other\nsupporting technologies here.\n\n203\n00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.480\nIf you haven't seen those episodes\nup until now, maybe wanna go back,\n\n204\n00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.170\npoke your head in there.\n\n205\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.130\nTake a look at some of\nthe stuff we're talking about.\n\n206\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.990\nGet a better understanding of how some of\nthese things come together in Server 16.\n\n207\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.090\nLot of level-set stuff there,\n\n208\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.110\nin terms of stuff that's gone\non in prior versions of the OS.\n\n209\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.800\nContinues to work but\nwe've also added new features,\n\n210\n00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.110\nnew capabilities and we've tried our\nbest to dig under the covers there and\n\n211\n00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.280\ntalk about a lot of them for you in all\nthese different areas as we've gone.\n\n212\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.180\nSo the pre-reqs for\ndeploying the direct server access or\n\n213\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.110\ndirect access server role,\ngotta be a domain member.\n\n214\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.960\nI didn't mention that we\nneed network adapters.\n\n215\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.250\nThat's kind of a given but\nlet me just be clear about that.\n\n216\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.410\nWe do need network adapters,\nyou have to connect.\n\n217\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.390\nBut we're gonna need at least one\nnetwork adapter that's connected out to\n\n218\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.470\nthe domain network.\n\n219\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.300\nUsually gonna have at least one that's\nconnected out but may have more than one.\n\n220\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.290\nRemember we'll need one that faces\nthe outside world so we're gonna have\n\n221\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.680\nusually two adapters on the box and\nwe'll set it up in that particular way.\n\n222\n00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.630\nWe have different options on the topology\nwhen I run the wizard and demo this for\n\n223\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.430\nyou in just a couple of minutes.\n\n224\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.490\nYou're gonna see as we run through\nwe have some different choices.\n\n225\n00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.740\nWe have the concept of\ndeploying in the Edge,\n\n226\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.000\nwe have the concept of behind\nthe firewall with two network adapters,\n\n227\n00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.770\nbehind the firewall with\none network adapter.\n\n228\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.200\nBe up to us to decide\nhow we're gonna do this.\n\n229\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.040\nThe Edge concept, we deploy into an Edge\nserver, one that's running Server 16.\n\n230\n00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.330\nThe computer has to have\ntwo network adapters,\n\n231\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.060\nas I said one internal facing,\none external facing.\n\n232\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.490\nThe Edge would be a border\ngateway device of some kind.\n\n233\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.275\nMaybe that's in our DMZ, maybe it\nis providing external connectivity\n\n234\n00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:06.477\njust because it is that\ndevice that sits there.\n\n235\n00:12:06.477 --> 00:12:09.415\nThere's different ways of\nthinking about the logic but\n\n236\n00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:12.477\nif we're behind the firewall\nwith two network adapters,\n\n237\n00:12:12.477 --> 00:12:16.680\nwe're inside most likely again in\na parameter network, in the DMZ.\n\n238\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.870\nBut we are gonna be able to then leverage\nthe fact that the firewall provides\n\n239\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.390\nexternal connectivity.\n\n240\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.838\nAnd remember then, we may be sitting\ninside, we're in the semi-public,\n\n241\n00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:29.900\nsemi-private network and we're still\ngonna be dual home to adapters.\n\n242\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.240\nSo I won't go into the firewall on\nthe outside we're going to the internal\n\n243\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.000\nside of the network of\na normal DMZ architecture.\n\n244\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200\nSo we're gonna have that.\n\n245\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.000\nWe'll have one network adapter\nthat connects again inside,\n\n246\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.630\none that connects to the perimeter\nnetwork, not the outside.\n\n247\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.870\nRemember the perimeter network so\nthat we get to the external firewall.\n\n248\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.320\nAnd then it will ultimately\nprovide external access.\n\n249\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.880\nSo it's a slightly\ndifferent scenario there.\n\n250\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.130\nBehind the firewall is one network\nadapter, this direct access system,\n\n251\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.900\none network adapter connected\nto the internal network only.\n\n252\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.240\nWe're gonna be coming in\nfrom somewhere else and\n\n253\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.310\nwe're gonna go through the DMZ,\nall the firewalls, whatever.\n\n254\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:08.448\nWe'll be on the inside by the time\nwe have to talk to the box.\n\n255\n00:13:08.448 --> 00:13:11.672\nAnd so therefore, we just need\nthe connectivity to be able to provide\n\n256\n00:13:11.672 --> 00:13:14.180\ninternal looking or\ninternal facing information.\n\n257\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.850\nSo it's just a question of\nhow we're gonna set that up.\n\n258\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.370\nSo once we have that,\nwe have to enable the Windows Firewall for\n\n259\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.910\nall the different profiles.\n\n260\n00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.430\nThe Windows Advanced Firewall\nrunning locally\n\n261\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.580\non the server has to be configured.\n\n262\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.851\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n263\n00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:32.728\nAlso I told you that we cannot be a domain\ncontroller, not that you would normally\n\n264\n00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:35.830\nwanna install something like\nthis on a domain controller.\n\n265\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.320\nBut in case you thought hey let me\njust try that, see if it works.\n\n266\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.800\nOr if you're asked at some point,\nhey, can I do that?\n\n267\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.222\nIf you think about the logic of it,\nwe would never wanna expose a domain\n\n268\n00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:49.116\ncontroller in an environment where we're\ngiving access to the outside world.\n\n269\n00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:51.207\nAnd allowing people coming in that may or\n\n270\n00:13:51.207 --> 00:13:55.250\nmay not belong there to knock on that\ndoor and interact with the server.\n\n271\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.530\nThat's just usually recipe for\ndisaster, right.\n\n272\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.180\nSo, we don't wanna do that so\nwe're not gonna let you\n\n273\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.510\ndeploy this thought process\nonto a direct access server.\n\n274\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.990\nShould not, cannot, will not be\ndeployed onto a domain controller,\n\n275\n00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.560\njust to be clear about that, right.\n\n276\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.799\nNot a good idea.\n\n277\n00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.100\nAll right, so we have all that.\n\n278\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.660\nLet's go in and let's actually take a look\nat some of the ways in which we can\n\n279\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.190\nwork with this.\n\n280\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.070\nSo we go to my machine here.\n\n281\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.170\nWe've talked enough,\nlet's actually take a look, there we go.\n\n282\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.770\nIt's so good we just blinked our eyes and\nlook at that, it came right up.\n\n283\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.559\nAll right, so I did not mention and\n\n284\n00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:28.700\nI have mentioned in almost every other\nepisode we've done around remote access\n\n285\n00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.680\nand different kinds of technologies,\nthat there are PowerShell cmdlets.\n\n286\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.019\nWe haven't previewed them for\n\n287\n00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:37.320\nyou until this point in time in this\ngroup of episodes, but they're there.\n\n288\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.310\nYou know they're there,\nwe just haven't brought them up.\n\n289\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.140\nAnd the reason I haven't shown them to you\nis just I thought I'd throw them in here\n\n290\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.770\nright now because a lot of the commands\nthat are right up at the top here\n\n291\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.180\nhappen to deal with dDirectAccess.\n\n292\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.430\nSo, you could see there's a bunch\nthat deal with DirectAccess.\n\n293\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:55.480\nThe DA in front of client, app service or\nwhatever help us to understand that.\n\n294\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.260\nBut there are many, many commands\nthat are used with PowerShell for\n\n295\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.100\nthe RemoteAccess Module.\n\n296\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.360\nAnd as always,\nwe encourage you to take a look at them.\n\n297\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.450\nGo out to the website,\nsee what's going on.\n\n298\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.430\nYou've seen in a lot of the prior demos\nthat I've been using PowerShell to\n\n299\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.090\ninstall roles, to use NetSH,\nto configure adapters.\n\n300\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.470\nTo do all sorts of stuff.\n\n301\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.120\nWe put these commandlets to work for\nus whenever we try to do a demo.\n\n302\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.940\nAt least in some area, to give you a sense\nof the fact that we should be integrating\n\n303\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.820\nthis thought process, and trying to use\nthis wherever and whenever possible.\n\n304\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.550\nThere is some good documentation on\nNew Direct Access documents for Server 16.\n\n305\n00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.662\nHow do we set up,\nhow do we configure things like that.\n\n306\n00:15:33.662 --> 00:15:36.320\nAnd this is the landing page for that.\n\n307\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.620\nYou've got here,\nyou voted to go through and\n\n308\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.070\njust drill in to these different areas.\n\n309\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.710\nHow do we deploy a single direct access\nserver using the base of deployment to get\n\n310\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.540\nthings started in wizard?\n\n311\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.000\nI'm gonna walk you through show you\nwhat that looks like here in a minute.\n\n312\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.309\nAll right, so as I was saying, we could\ntake a look at anything that you would\n\n313\n00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:54.025\nlike in terms of the documentation here,\nany of these links.\n\n314\n00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:54.690\nYou know the drill.\n\n315\n00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.840\nYou click through them and\n\n316\n00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.290\nyou could see all the different pieces of\nthe puzzle that you may wanna read up on.\n\n317\n00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.430\nAs well as reminds you,\n\n318\n00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.089\nyou gotta look at a site like this\nsometimes the deployment options change.\n\n319\n00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:08.064\nMaybe we update something,\nmaybe something is new or\n\n320\n00:16:08.064 --> 00:16:11.236\nhas been modified to reflect\na certain kind of activity So\n\n321\n00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:14.292\nyou do you wanna take a look\nto see what's going there.\n\n322\n00:16:14.292 --> 00:16:18.128\nUnsupported configurations always good to\nfind out what you're not suppose to do,\n\n323\n00:16:18.128 --> 00:16:19.810\nso you know how to do it the right way.\n\n324\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.600\nWhat are the prereq's for\ndeploying, we've been through those,\n\n325\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.690\ntalked about what you need.\n\n326\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.450\nSo it's good to just\ntake a look at that and\n\n327\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.940\nmake sure that you understand\nhow those things are gonna work.\n\n328\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.880\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's go ahead.\n\n329\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.330\nLet me just extend our\ntime route real quick.\n\n330\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.236\nLet's go ahead and\n\n331\n00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:39.450\nlet's take a look at what we can do with\nthe direct access configuration wizard.\n\n332\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.610\nSo just to give you a background\nof what we have set up.\n\n333\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.220\nI'm on a machine,\nI've already just stood up and\n\n334\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.740\nconfigured the remote access server.\n\n335\n00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.959\nSo you can see it set up here, network\npolicy server is sitting there as well.\n\n336\n00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.407\nAnd what we gonna do is just go ahead and\n\n337\n00:16:53.407 --> 00:16:56.920\nthen turn our attention to\nsetting up direct access.\n\n338\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.235\nSo we're gonna go into\nthe tools area here and\n\n339\n00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:02.442\nwe're gonna use\nthe Remote Access Management console.\n\n340\n00:17:02.442 --> 00:17:07.270\nIf we can go full screen\ncuz I'm on right behind me,\n\n341\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.070\nit's funny we talked by yourself in the\nthird person cuz you're on the screen and\n\n342\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.925\nyou're the one who you're talking about.\n\n343\n00:17:11.925 --> 00:17:14.910\nSo you can see instead of\ngoing to the routing and\n\n344\n00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.460\nremote access management console which\nwe've been using in our prior demos.\n\n345\n00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.560\nAt one point early on in some of\nthe episodes that we started talking\n\n346\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.210\nabout remote access, I did point\nout that there are two consoles.\n\n347\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.838\nBut we haven't been in to take a look at\nthe remote access management console yet,\n\n348\n00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:30.900\nwe just kinda had it sitting there,\nhaving really done anything with it yet.\n\n349\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.440\nSo we're gonna actually go in we're\ngonna take a look at it here.\n\n350\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.160\nSo Remote Access management,\njust open this up real quick.\n\n351\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.000\nAnd we'll be able to go in\nas soon as this loads up and\n\n352\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.470\nwe'll be able to see that we can do under\nconfiguration are configuration for\n\n353\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.590\ndirect access and\nVPN when I installed the RRAS solution.\n\n354\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.958\nI specified as I installed that I wanted,\n\n355\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.940\nlet me just show you what I\ndid here with PowerShell.\n\n356\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.440\nSpecified that I wanted to add the Windows\nfeatures for network policy and\n\n357\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.160\ndirect access VPN so that way I had the\nability to go configure the RRAS solution\n\n358\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.900\nfor these two technologies, specifically\ndirect access and VPN support.\n\n359\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.100\nSo I've done this with PowerShell and\n\n360\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.520\nwhat I'm gonna do now is just run\nthe configuration right from here.\n\n361\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.410\nSo I click on this item and it brings up\na little wizard here, Remote Access Setup.\n\n362\n00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.020\nWhat is it you're looking to do?\n\n363\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.520\nConfigure Remote Access,\nrun the Getting Started Wizard.\n\n364\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.700\nYou'll see here,\nuse the wizard to configure Direct Access.\n\n365\n00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.910\nAnd VPN quickly with default\nrecommended settings, so\n\n366\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.840\nwe could do kind of a quick deploy.\n\n367\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.586\nNow this is okay and we can take a look at\nthis but keep in mind, if we do it this\n\n368\n00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:44.451\nway, one of the things we run into or\npotentially just have to think about is,\n\n369\n00:18:44.451 --> 00:18:47.130\nwe wind up with self-signed\ncertificates here.\n\n370\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.140\nWe can't specify that we wanna\nuse other kinds of certificates.\n\n371\n00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.090\nAnd so, then we have to go in later and\ndo some additional configuration, so\n\n372\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.106\nwe may wanna run the Remote Access setup\nwizard, configure direct access and\n\n373\n00:18:58.106 --> 00:18:59.552\nVPN with custom settings.\n\n374\n00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:03.435\nWe have a little more depth there in terms\nof what we can do, what we wanna specify.\n\n375\n00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.995\nI'll go through and just kinda show you\nthe thought process around each one,\n\n376\n00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.018\nthat we just get a sense of\nthe options you're interacting with.\n\n377\n00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:13.100\nIf you remember, when we walk through and\n\n378\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.623\nwe did the configuration,\nor I went through and\n\n379\n00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:21.920\nI showed you the setup on how we could\ndeploy the network policy server.\n\n380\n00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.040\nAnd we went ahead and we did that and\nI walked through the extensive setup and\n\n381\n00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.300\nbackground around all that.\n\n382\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.480\nAnd I showed you that\nwe could go ahead and\n\n383\n00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.350\nwe could look at one of the pre-made\npolicies that were there.\n\n384\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.140\nWe kinda of edited it all out, we took\na look at it, then we went ahead and\n\n385\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.950\nwe created a policy, and we saw that\nwe could specify a lot of stuff\n\n386\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.408\nby running through the wizard and\nmake choices there.\n\n387\n00:19:40.408 --> 00:19:43.360\nWe could kinda push that off and\njust leave it alone and then go back and\n\n388\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.690\nfix it after the fact.\n\n389\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.220\nSo we're dealing with\nkind of an option here.\n\n390\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.710\nIt's really a question of what we\nchoose to do, how we choose to deploy.\n\n391\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.560\nSo let's take a look at\nthe getting started wizard,\n\n392\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.110\nthe one that's just gonna be real quick,\nreal simple, kinda streamlined, and\n\n393\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.190\nthen we'll just take a look\nat the more advanced one.\n\n394\n00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.010\nWe'll go through and\njust look at the details.\n\n395\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.770\nSo we'll launch this real quick.\n\n396\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.440\nThen we have our ability here.\n\n397\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.480\nMove this over so you guys can just\nsee at the edge of the screen there,\n\n398\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.430\nwhat we're doing.\n\n399\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.930\nDeploy both direct access and\nVPN, recommended,\n\n400\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.700\nin other words,\nlet's configure both simultaneously.\n\n401\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.950\nDo direct access only,\nthis is just setting up the direct access\n\n402\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.700\nrole on the server, and\nconfiguring client support.\n\n403\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.340\nJust VPN only, so we have options.\n\n404\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:27.470\nWe can configure just the specified\nRRAS capability, in this case the VPN.\n\n405\n00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.410\nWe could specify just\nthe direct access capability or\n\n406\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.860\nwe could combine them together and\ndo both.\n\n407\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.310\nSo I'm gonna close my eyes,\nI've always wanted to do this.\n\n408\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna close my eyes,\n\n409\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.530\nI need a dart or BB gun, one or the other.\n\n410\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.130\n&gt;&gt; I've got a pen.\n\n411\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nI'm gonna throw this at the screen.\n\n412\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.980\nThis is where we have interactive 3D.\n\n413\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.855\nIt's a new future we're deploying here,\nat ITProTV.\n\n414\n00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:48.083\n&gt;&gt; Hold on,\nlet me put it to the stylus setting.\n\n415\n00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:51.820\n&gt;&gt; No, no, we want the one that's\ngonna stick in the screen and so.\n\n416\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.960\nPut on your goggles, and\n\n417\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.590\nalso duck because I'm not gonna\nbe able to see what I'm doing.\n\n418\n00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.622\nI will get to actually decide\nwhich one we're gonna deploy.\n\n419\n00:20:58.622 --> 00:21:00.405\n&gt;&gt; Right there, that one.\n\n420\n00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:01.030\n&gt;&gt; That one?\n\n421\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.860\n&gt;&gt; That one yeah, let's deploy it.\n\n422\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.900\n&gt;&gt; Based on that, I actually saw\nthis on a commercial, not this.\n\n423\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.030\nGive me a bucket to do this.\n\n424\n00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.210\nBut I saw a commercial where\nthey were going through,\n\n425\n00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.520\nhey you've got to do all the great\nstuff you have on your bucket list.\n\n426\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.790\nAll the different things you want to do.\n\n427\n00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.470\nAnd one of the things was, the woman\nwho is standing in front of a map.\n\n428\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.950\nYou'll close your eyes, throw the dart and\nthen that's where you go.\n\n429\n00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Travel there.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, travel there kind of thing,\n\n430\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.190\nI thought that was so cool.\n\n431\n00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.340\nAs long as you're good at darts.\n\n432\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.650\n&gt;&gt; What if you landed on\na really bad place though?\n\n433\n00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if you landed off the map?\n\n434\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.090\nThen you couldn't go.\n\n435\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.533\n&gt;&gt; I probably would, knowing my skill set.\n\n436\n00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:36.854\n&gt;&gt; Hit the flower pot, okay, that's where\nI'm going, so I guess you can't do that.\n\n437\n00:21:36.854 --> 00:21:41.890\nAll right so let's go back at we'll go\nahead and we'll go and we'll do both here.\n\n438\n00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.280\nWe'll take a look and\nkind of just walk through the logic.\n\n439\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.080\nWe'll remind ourselves of what\nwe have to do with VPN but\n\n440\n00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.695\nwe'll also get the direct\naccess solution set up.\n\n441\n00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:52.545\nSo we'd click there,\ndoes our prereq check.\n\n442\n00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:56.385\nInitializes, remember we talked about\nthe fact that we have three options for\n\n443\n00:21:56.385 --> 00:21:57.275\ndeployment.\n\n444\n00:21:57.275 --> 00:22:02.375\nWe have Edge, we have behind\nthe Edge device with two adapters,\n\n445\n00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:04.265\nbehind the Edge device\nwith a single adapter.\n\n446\n00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:07.985\nYou would make your choice here,\nobviously specify what you're gonna do.\n\n447\n00:22:07.985 --> 00:22:11.620\nSo either way, whatever you choose here,\n\n448\n00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.710\nyou have to specify that you're\ngonna then provide the IP address.\n\n449\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.210\nSo whatever that will be,\nthat will give you the public name and\n\n450\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.830\nor IPv4 address used by clients\nto connect to the RRAS server.\n\n451\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.990\nSo you're gonna specify what that is,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n452\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.530\nSo remote access settings will be applied.\n\n453\n00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.010\nClick here to edit the wizard settings.\n\n454\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.370\nSo if we're going to go ahead,\n\n455\n00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.340\nconfiguration setting will be\nmodified to include GPO settings,\n\n456\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.170\ndirect access client security group,\nserver adapters, DNS properties, etc.\n\n457\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.610\nIf you're not gonna edit any of those,\nyou're just gonna go for\n\n458\n00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.355\nthe default, we're done,\nthat's direct access, high five!\n\n459\n00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:47.170\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo!\n\n460\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.030\n&gt;&gt; That's all we gotta do.\n\n461\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.960\n&gt;&gt; But obviously clearly it's\na little bit more involved that that,\n\n462\n00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.760\nwe're not gonna just hit the button and\n\n463\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.160\ndeploy cuz we wanna be able to see what's\ngoing on, and then we wanna understand it.\n\n464\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.070\nBut literally,\nwhat I wanted to show you was,\n\n465\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.970\nif you just did this walk-through\nquickly with the wizard,\n\n466\n00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.450\nthe only thing we ask you to do really in\ntheory other than just accept the defaults\n\n467\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.410\nis tell us which one of the three\ndeployment options you want.\n\n468\n00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.380\nAnd give us that IPv4 public address so\n\n469\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.970\nwe know how to configure\nthe external gateway coming in.\n\n470\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.150\nAnd that's it, everything else is done for\nyou behind the scenes.\n\n471\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.550\nThat's how easy direct access could be.\n\n472\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.200\nNow, remember,\nyou may not be happy with those options.\n\n473\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.510\nYou may wanna change them.\n\n474\n00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.180\nSo clearly, there needs to be some\nthought put into how are we gonna deploy,\n\n475\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.500\nwhat are we gonna do,\ndoes this really make sense?\n\n476\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.320\nBut I'm just pointing out that it\nwould not take anything more than that\n\n477\n00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.060\nto be able to run if all we did\nwas use the startup wizard.\n\n478\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.470\nNow I didn't edit those settings, so\n\n479\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.490\nwe're gonna go through and\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n480\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.500\nAnd we're going to show you just\na couple different iterations here.\n\n481\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.548\nIf I just did deploy direct access only,\nit's essentially gonna wind up\n\n482\n00:23:49.548 --> 00:23:55.105\nbeing the same thing, again we'll\njust make our choice here, 216001.\n\n483\n00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:58.831\nThis is just an IP address I've assigned\nto one of the adapters that I'm using just\n\n484\n00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:00.640\nto specify that I have an external IP.\n\n485\n00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.030\nThat's where that comes from\nby the way just so you know.\n\n486\n00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.020\nIn the real world, that would be whatever\nIP address you're really using for\n\n487\n00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.765\nexternal access.\n\n488\n00:24:06.765 --> 00:24:08.460\nSo again, if I just choose that,\n\n489\n00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.750\nyou'll see that it does the same thing\nregardless of which one I choose here.\n\n490\n00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.033\nIt's gonna say, basically it gave me\neverything I want All I need now is\n\n491\n00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:18.239\njust literally,\nedit the settings or deploy.\n\n492\n00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:20.530\nSo no matter how we do it\nthat's where we wind up.\n\n493\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.700\nNow, if I want to edit those\nsettings click here it\n\n494\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.430\ndoes open up the RAS settings here.\n\n495\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.590\nLet me move over just so\nyou can see the edge of that so\n\n496\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.540\nyou can see on the side of the box,\nthere we go.\n\n497\n00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.090\nAnd you could see the ability to\ngo on the GPO settings and change.\n\n498\n00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.030\nIt does show me that the direct access\nserver GPO name we are creating,\n\n499\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:43.210\nmember group policy template that's used\nto provide the network location services\n\n500\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.550\nand other stuff.\n\n501\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.067\nClient GPO name, it tell us what they are,\nserver settings, client settings,\n\n502\n00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:49.734\nI can go in and change those settings.\n\n503\n00:24:49.734 --> 00:24:53.033\nRemote clients, just scroll down here.\n\n504\n00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:57.160\nDirect access settings are applied to all\nmobile computers and security groups.\n\n505\n00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.080\nSo practice labs, domain computers,\npractice labs is just our domain.\n\n506\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.280\nSo domain computers there, resource\nused to verify network connectivity.\n\n507\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.370\nA default probe, check corporate\nconnectivity's created automatically,\n\n508\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.790\ndirect access connection\nname workplace connection.\n\n509\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:11.760\nThese are all the defaults.\n\n510\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.410\nAnd by the way, all those defaults,\neverything you're looking at,\n\n511\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.070\nI've captured all that stuff for\nyou in the show notes,\n\n512\n00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.155\nso you'll be able to see, the default for\nthat, security group name is this.\n\n513\n00:25:20.155 --> 00:25:22.175\nThe default for the domain or\n\n514\n00:25:22.175 --> 00:25:24.935\nthe direct access connection is called,\nwork place connection.\n\n515\n00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:26.543\nAll that stuff,\nI put that all in the notes for you.\n\n516\n00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:27.985\nSo, you're gonna be able to read up and\n\n517\n00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:31.585\njust see all that as we're going through\nand talking about it, it's all there.\n\n518\n00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:34.325\nRemote access server,\nthe direct access config,\n\n519\n00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:36.225\nremember we specified the external.\n\n520\n00:25:36.225 --> 00:25:40.200\nWe specified the network adapter is,\nwe're gonna have two adapters,\n\n521\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.650\nso ethernet2 is my external one.\n\n522\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.720\nThat's where I bound my external address.\n\n523\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.530\nMy internal one is the other\none called the ethernet.\n\n524\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.240\nAnd you'll see my end\nthrone network subnets,\n\n525\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.220\nmy IPV6 information is right there.\n\n526\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:52.950\nYou can see that,\n\n527\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.760\neven though we didn't deploy that or\nspecify that as part of the template.\n\n528\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.380\nAnd then my infrastructures servers,\neverything is put up right here\n\n529\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.250\nwith DNS suffixes, all that's provided and\nset up as part of the template.\n\n530\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.660\nIf I do this, using the other part of the\nwizard where it says hey, go through and\n\n531\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.200\nconfigure everything yourself,\nyou're gonna have to go through and\n\n532\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.400\nmake all these choices and\nspecify all this.\n\n533\n00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.400\nNot a bad thing, it's just that\nyou're gonna have to obviously know\n\n534\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.730\nthat you can go in and do that.\n\n535\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.640\nNow, this is kinda nice down here.\n\n536\n00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.980\nA little bit hard to see,\nbut see right there.\n\n537\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.480\nSave to a file,\nI can actually grab this configuration.\n\n538\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.910\nI could also print it off by the way,\nwhich is also kinda nice.\n\n539\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.330\nBut I can save it to a file and\nI can then have a copy of it so\n\n540\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.350\nI understand what's going on.\n\n541\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.270\nSo really important from a documentation\nperspective to be thinking about that.\n\n542\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.260\nMay be a good idea to do that,\nlet's just save that off real quick.\n\n543\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.460\nSince we're talking,\nwe'll just show you what that looks like.\n\n544\n00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.710\nRemote access config summary, it's just\na web page format, traditionally HTML,\n\n545\n00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.670\nas you can see.\n\n546\n00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.170\nI could save it as an archive,\na text file, it's up to us to decide, or\n\n547\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.330\nup to me to decide what I wanna do.\n\n548\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.310\nI'll just put that out there,\nlet that be saved off.\n\n549\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.780\nThat's just gonna save the config for me,\nso I can go back and look at it later.\n\n550\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.750\nRemember, good documentation\nis your friend,\n\n551\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.090\nreally important to have\ngood documentation.\n\n552\n00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.020\nIt's nice that we get that option.\n\n553\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.430\n&gt;&gt; And not only like you mentioned for\nauditing purpose but\n\n554\n00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.550\njust putting it in like\na change management log and\n\n555\n00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.550\nkeeping it there for the rest of your\nstaff in the IT department, too.\n\n556\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.182\n&gt;&gt; Forever.\n\n557\n00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Forever [LAUGH].\n\n558\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.920\n&gt;&gt; Be there forever,\nit's never gonna go away.\n\n559\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.770\nAbsolutely, be really important.\n\n560\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.690\nSo if we wanted to change one these\nthings, just hypothetically click Change.\n\n561\n00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.130\nAnd you'll see that we can go in and\nwe can specify or\n\n562\n00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.600\nmake any changes here that we want.\n\n563\n00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.280\nYou could see just based on the particular\nscreen I chose, I may have one or\n\n564\n00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.380\nmore options that I\nwould have to go in and\n\n565\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.005\nmodify and I just make the appropriate\nchoices and do I wanna do.\n\n566\n00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:37.410\nSo you could see that I can certainly do\nthat, let's just cancel out of there.\n\n567\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.220\nIf I wanted to edit those\nsettings I could do it that way.\n\n568\n00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.930\nLet's just take a look at what\nthe wizard looks like if you run it with\n\n569\n00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.810\nmore advanced options where you have\nto go through and essentially choose or\n\n570\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.990\nmake these choices on your own and\ndo a manual deployment.\n\n571\n00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.520\nSo, again, the wizard looks the same in\nthe beginning, really no different there,\n\n572\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.730\nbut you're gonna see there is\ndifference once we get into this.\n\n573\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.666\nSo we'll click here, and\ndo our prereq check and\n\n574\n00:28:00.666 --> 00:28:05.274\ninstead of giving it that\nnice little wizard interface.\n\n575\n00:28:05.274 --> 00:28:08.482\nCould you go fullscreen for me here,\nI can't really resize that one yet,\n\n576\n00:28:08.482 --> 00:28:10.940\nso it's hard to see,\nI can't move this window around.\n\n577\n00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.450\nIt's kind of stuck there.\n\n578\n00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.890\nBut instead of having the wizard\ninterface, where I just have a screen,\n\n579\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.600\nyou'll notice I have to configure by\nclicking on these different areas.\n\n580\n00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.238\nAnd I have to start configuring one\nstep at a time, and once I do this part,\n\n581\n00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:27.783\nI then get access to this, and\nnotice it's grayed out in the meantime.\n\n582\n00:28:27.783 --> 00:28:32.385\nAnd I have to go through and I have to\nconfigure each area in sequence in order\n\n583\n00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:37.280\nto build out all that information that\nthe templated deployment, the standard\n\n584\n00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.900\ndeployment with the wizard, will already\nhave available and/or provide for me.\n\n585\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.400\nSo you'll see that it\ndoes walk me through and\n\n586\n00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.530\ndoes give me the option to do all this.\n\n587\n00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.900\nBut I have to go through and\nI have to click in each area and\n\n588\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.540\nthen I have wizard driven steps that\nI'm gonna have to obviously deploy.\n\n589\n00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.780\nSo it's almost like a Visio kinda diagram,\nit's integrated but\n\n590\n00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.550\nthen you gotta go through the steps,\nthe wizards that are attached to it.\n\n591\n00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.880\nSo it kind of an interesting\nway of doing the deployment.\n\n592\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.370\nPretty cool, right.\n\n593\n00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.260\nSo select a deployment scenario,\ndeploy full direct access for\n\n594\n00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.540\nclient with remote management, deploy\ndirect access for remote management only.\n\n595\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.420\nSo we have to make some choices here.\n\n596\n00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.010\nIt says here you can manage remotely\ndirect access client computers located on\n\n597\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.330\nthe internet with this option selected.\n\n598\n00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.930\nDirect access is not deployed for\nclient access to the internal network.\n\n599\n00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.260\nRemember we said we could\nuse it both internally and\n\n600\n00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.190\nexternally, it's a question of\nhow we choose to configure.\n\n601\n00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.265\nSo depending on the choices you make in\nthe more advanced setup, we could say,\n\n602\n00:29:35.265 --> 00:29:38.804\nwe're only using direct access for\ninbound connections outside.\n\n603\n00:29:38.804 --> 00:29:42.966\nJust remember based on network location,\nwe maybe inside and\n\n604\n00:29:42.966 --> 00:29:46.726\nwe can use direct access to\nconnect up inside on the LAN,\n\n605\n00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:50.664\nautomatically connect create\nout IPsec enabled tunnel.\n\n606\n00:29:50.664 --> 00:29:54.148\nAutomatically do the authentication\nto the LDAP directory so\n\n607\n00:29:54.148 --> 00:29:56.640\nessentually connect to Active Directory.\n\n608\n00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.350\nWe could do a lookup and\n\n609\n00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:02.550\nresolve the full qualified domain name for\na network location server, which we do.\n\n610\n00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.280\nIf we figure out that we're on\nthe inside as opposed to on the outside,\n\n611\n00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.210\nand we do that by looking at something we\ntalked about in one of the prior episodes.\n\n612\n00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:16.460\nRemember the NRPT, the network resolution\nor name resolution policy table.\n\n613\n00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.485\nWe made entries in there for the network\npolicies, so we use the NRPT function,\n\n614\n00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.720\nif the client does a lookup against it and\n\n615\n00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.450\nwe send our DNS queries out to either the\nlocal DNS server based on where we are,\n\n616\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.710\nan intranet based DNS server\nif we're on the inside.\n\n617\n00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.580\nAnd the intranet based DNS\nserver resolves the information,\n\n618\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.850\nsays, yeah, you're on the inside and\ntells us how we're connecting and\n\n619\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.030\nwhether we're using direct access or not.\n\n620\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.160\nIf we are inside and has been deployed,\nwe would use direct access for\n\n621\n00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.550\naccessing certain resources automatically.\n\n622\n00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.140\nIf it's not, we just access normally,\nif we're on the outside, and\n\n623\n00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.670\nwe connect up, we try to figure this out.\n\n624\n00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.220\nIt says, you're on the outside,\nand it throws you into or\n\n625\n00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.470\nthrows you over to\nthe direct access server.\n\n626\n00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:02.180\nSo we wanna keep in mind that this is\njust part of the overall thought process.\n\n627\n00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.640\nBut we could potentially see\nthis being deployed either way.\n\n628\n00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.970\nIf we're on the outside,\n\n629\n00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:10.010\nwe try to resolve the FQDN under\nthe network location server URL.\n\n630\n00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.480\nWe provide that,\nthat's part of what we're doing.\n\n631\n00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.265\nAnd the FQDN then says by the way,\nyou're outside, so\n\n632\n00:31:15.265 --> 00:31:17.570\nyou're outside of where\nyou would normally be.\n\n633\n00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.740\nYou're on the outside,\nyou've gotta come in.\n\n634\n00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.590\nWe don't send the DNS query\nlocally to do all of that and\n\n635\n00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.850\nfigure that out, cuz we're on the outside,\nwe use externally based internet DNS.\n\n636\n00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.190\nAnd we're gonna then resolve and say you\nneed to go to wherever you go to connect\n\n637\n00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.738\nin and direct access is creating\nthe connection at that point.\n\n638\n00:31:32.738 --> 00:31:35.653\nWe process that resolution request,\nwe examine and\n\n639\n00:31:35.653 --> 00:31:38.909\nlook at whatever rules are available for\nus to be bound by.\n\n640\n00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:43.224\nAnd ultimately, cuz we're not on the same\nnetwork as the direct access server.\n\n641\n00:31:43.224 --> 00:31:47.844\nThe network location server and us, we're\non different systems cuz we're outside\n\n642\n00:31:47.844 --> 00:31:51.292\nbehind, or in theory outside of\nthe firewall wherever we are,\n\n643\n00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:53.790\ncuz we don't see it on the same network.\n\n644\n00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.460\nWe apply, or we look at the public or\n\n645\n00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.470\nprivate firewall network profile, whatever\nwe have running on the local client.\n\n646\n00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.886\nAnd as a result of that, we setup our\nsecurity tunnel for direct access,\n\n647\n00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:06.413\nbased on whatever rules we follow,\nand we tunnel in.\n\n648\n00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:13.218\nWe essentially create our tunnel, either\nIP, HTTPS-based tunnel, Teredo, 6to4.\n\n649\n00:32:13.218 --> 00:32:15.648\nWhatever our tunneling\nsolution will be to get in, or\n\n650\n00:32:15.648 --> 00:32:18.895\nour connectivity solution will be,\nbased on IPv6.\n\n651\n00:32:18.895 --> 00:32:22.064\nOr IPv4 use, and\nthat's how we are able to connect in.\n\n652\n00:32:22.064 --> 00:32:25.431\nSo this is what we're doing, and we're\ndeciding how we're gonna deploy that,\n\n653\n00:32:25.431 --> 00:32:26.580\nby starting this process.\n\n654\n00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.320\nSo, we make some choices here, right?\n\n655\n00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.795\nWe specify, what we're gonna do,\nwhatever we would do here.\n\n656\n00:32:31.795 --> 00:32:34.160\nWe would then specify one or\nmore security groups,\n\n657\n00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.200\nthe client computers would be enabled for.\n\n658\n00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.090\nWe'd have to add them in here,\nso we would go in and Add.\n\n659\n00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.870\nAnd you've seen me do this,\nwhere we set up the network policy server.\n\n660\n00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.414\nWe had to add Groups in so\nwe could go in, Check for\n\n661\n00:32:46.414 --> 00:32:50.940\na group, we can use the global IT group or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n662\n00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.890\nAnd we would specify a group and\ndifferent groups in there if we wanted to.\n\n663\n00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.680\nEnable direct access for\nmobile computers only.\n\n664\n00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.290\nSo we can go in and specify that,\nthis is gonna be set up.\n\n665\n00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.980\nJust move this over.\n\n666\n00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.756\nThat this is gonna be set\nup as you can see here, for\n\n667\n00:33:05.756 --> 00:33:09.414\nthe specified security groups and\nset up direct access for them.\n\n668\n00:33:09.414 --> 00:33:11.602\nForced tunneling could\nbe used here as well.\n\n669\n00:33:11.602 --> 00:33:15.722\nThis connects us to the Internet or\nvia the intranet using the RAS server so\n\n670\n00:33:15.722 --> 00:33:16.922\nwe force the tunnel.\n\n671\n00:33:16.922 --> 00:33:21.003\nEven if you're on the inside, gonna force\nyou to use a secure tunnel, we do that.\n\n672\n00:33:21.003 --> 00:33:23.743\nSo we can make choices here.\n\n673\n00:33:23.743 --> 00:33:25.952\nCheck off one or more of those.\n\n674\n00:33:25.952 --> 00:33:30.651\nSpecify as you can see here, the resource\nand the type, the help desk email address,\n\n675\n00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:35.040\nthe direct access connection name, and\nallow us to use local name resolution.\n\n676\n00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.001\nThis is where we run and\nspecify all the connectivity information.\n\n677\n00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:41.948\nResources that validate connectivity\nto the internal network, so\n\n678\n00:33:41.948 --> 00:33:43.298\nwhat are we gonna put in there?\n\n679\n00:33:43.298 --> 00:33:44.732\nWe'd have to go and program all this.\n\n680\n00:33:44.732 --> 00:33:48.301\nNow remember, if we do it the other way\nand we run it through the wizard that it's\n\n681\n00:33:48.301 --> 00:33:51.783\nalready got it set up for us with the\ntemplates, all this was provided for us.\n\n682\n00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:55.864\nAnd we would have to have all this\ninformation to be able to specify how to\n\n683\n00:33:55.864 --> 00:33:58.117\ngo through, and make the connection.\n\n684\n00:33:58.117 --> 00:34:01.891\nAs we go through and set this up,\nstage by stage, we go through, and\n\n685\n00:34:01.891 --> 00:34:04.558\nwe start configuring all\nthe different areas.\n\n686\n00:34:04.558 --> 00:34:07.006\nAnd once we're done,\nwe ultimately stand up, and get or\n\n687\n00:34:07.006 --> 00:34:08.800\ndirect access solution deployed.\n\n688\n00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.720\nSo, it's a question of,\nhow you choose to do this?\n\n689\n00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.893\nThere's no right and wrong.\n\n690\n00:34:11.893 --> 00:34:15.572\nBut, unless you're gonna specify\nall of these settings and\n\n691\n00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:20.261\nhave them all setup ahead of time, and\nknow what they are, it may be easier for\n\n692\n00:34:20.261 --> 00:34:22.880\nyou to run the kind of\nquick deploy wizard.\n\n693\n00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.536\nAnd then go through after the fact, and\nedit out some of the changes once you have\n\n694\n00:34:26.536 --> 00:34:28.730\nthem stood up,\nif that makes more sense to you.\n\n695\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.989\nSo if we just get out of here for\na second.\n\n696\n00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.696\nAnd what we do is,\nwe just go back in here.\n\n697\n00:34:39.247 --> 00:34:42.480\nAnd let me just relaunch\nRemote Access console.\n\n698\n00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.222\nI just can't get to the window to\nclose it when I run that other wizard,\n\n699\n00:34:45.222 --> 00:34:47.327\nbecause there's no way to\nmove around inside the VM.\n\n700\n00:34:47.327 --> 00:34:49.520\nThat's why you see me close out of it and\ngo back in.\n\n701\n00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.061\nI can't see the control to close it,\n\n702\n00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:53.864\nit just doesn't let me I get to it\nbecause of the size of the window.\n\n703\n00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:56.260\nThat's why I had to close it out and\njust open it back up again.\n\n704\n00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:01.650\nSo if we do this real quick, we deploy\nthis, just to now finish the process,\n\n705\n00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.420\nnow that I got to show you what the more\nadvanced wizard looks like, just so\n\n706\n00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.230\nyou could see what it\nultimately stands up as.\n\n707\n00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.390\nSo let me just do this, dot,\ndot, dot, dot, dot, and\n\n708\n00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:15.600\ndo that, I'll just get that there.\n\n709\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.510\nLet's just click Finish.\n\n710\n00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.210\nYou'll see now setting up.\n\n711\n00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.410\nIf you take a look,\nit's configuring DNS entries.\n\n712\n00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.293\nIt's walking through,\nit's doing everything just so\n\n713\n00:35:23.293 --> 00:35:24.984\nyou could see the deployment\nactually finalize.\n\n714\n00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:26.340\nWe'll give that just a minute.\n\n715\n00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.770\nIt's gonna do its thing.\n\n716\n00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:32.660\nOnce it's all done, we can actually\nthen to into the RAS server, and\n\n717\n00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.080\nwe could see that it's been configured.\n\n718\n00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.300\nAnd we'll go in and\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n719\n00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.064\nThere's the web probe for\nDNS that we were just talking about.\n\n720\n00:35:38.064 --> 00:35:40.730\nIt's setting the group policies,\nit was just doing that.\n\n721\n00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.980\nBut you'll see it walks through and\nit does everything for us, so\n\n722\n00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.210\nall of this is essentially what's been\ndone based on the choices we made,\n\n723\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.500\nupdating client policies, the policies\nare being created and updated.\n\n724\n00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.860\nThe deployment state is being checked.\n\n725\n00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.580\nRight, we're making sure that all\nthe policies are ready to be applied.\n\n726\n00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.049\nUpdating VPN authentication\naddress assignments,\n\n727\n00:35:57.049 --> 00:35:59.362\nstarting the Remote Access\nManagement Service.\n\n728\n00:35:59.362 --> 00:36:03.771\nSo it's spinning up the Remote Access\nManagement console services and\n\n729\n00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:05.396\nthe RRAS configuration.\n\n730\n00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:08.216\nSo it's walking through and\ndoing everything for us and\n\n731\n00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:12.116\nmaking sure that everything is going\nto be finalized, before it finishes and\n\n732\n00:36:12.116 --> 00:36:14.162\ngives us control to go in and take a look.\n\n733\n00:36:14.162 --> 00:36:16.067\nSo we'll wait another moment for this.\n\n734\n00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:20.142\nRemember you did say, or\nI did say, I should say that.\n\n735\n00:36:20.142 --> 00:36:22.460\nAnd that happen sometimes,\nwhen we're using the remote console.\n\n736\n00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:26.860\nNot because of what our RRAS is doing,\nthat's just a drop on a connection for\n\n737\n00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.530\nme with the VM.\n\n738\n00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.500\nSo we'll just open up another window and\nreconnect, no big deal.\n\n739\n00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.240\nRemember, we're just remoting into\na VM that we're running with.\n\n740\n00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.780\nSo that does happen on occasion.\n\n741\n00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.830\nGood excuse for me to extend the timer\nout real quick, and go back in.\n\n742\n00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.770\nSo give me just a second, we'll just\nreconnect while we're waiting on that.\n\n743\n00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.480\nGood news is, I was gonna say, when\nit's running in the cloud like that, and\n\n744\n00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.450\nthat's all running.\n\n745\n00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:48.096\nThe system's actually running, and we're\nnot, just because we lose our console\n\n746\n00:36:48.096 --> 00:36:51.393\nconnectivity doesn't mean that it's\nnot doing stuff behind the scenes.\n\n747\n00:36:51.393 --> 00:36:53.190\nThe power of the cloud, right?\n\n748\n00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.590\nSo you could see it actually\nis finished right there.\n\n749\n00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.033\nSo it's almost like a little cut away,\n\n750\n00:36:57.033 --> 00:36:59.322\nexcept we did it to ourselves\ninstead of having it done for us.\n\n751\n00:36:59.322 --> 00:36:59.871\n&gt;&gt; Perfect timing.\n\n752\n00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:02.420\n&gt;&gt; So the configuration was applied\nsuccessfully, you could see there,\n\n753\n00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.250\nso no problem.\n\n754\n00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.981\nWe'll go ahead and we'll just click Close.\n\n755\n00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:08.729\nAnd you'll see now,\nthat we have this up and running,\n\n756\n00:37:08.729 --> 00:37:14.351\nwe've got our dashboard in here, so we can\nsee that we have our operation status,\n\n757\n00:37:14.351 --> 00:37:19.180\nour configuration status,\ndirect access and VPN client status.\n\n758\n00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.245\nRight now, we don't have any client,\nso clearly there's nothing going on.\n\n759\n00:37:22.245 --> 00:37:25.350\nBut you see, we can monitor,\nwe can see what's going on there.\n\n760\n00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.660\nThe operation information can be seen.\n\n761\n00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.720\nRemote client status,\nif we had any coming in could be seen.\n\n762\n00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.180\nWe have some basic reporting\nthat's available to us.\n\n763\n00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.840\nWe have to configure account and\nreporting on the Radius side,\n\n764\n00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.172\nbut we would then be able to look at that.\n\n765\n00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:41.120\nWe talked about Radius,\nwe went through and\n\n766\n00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.420\nconfigured that in one of\nour prior walkthroughs.\n\n767\n00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.672\nSo you'll see that we\nhave that information,\n\n768\n00:37:45.672 --> 00:37:48.965\nand you'll see that we could edit\nthe remote client settings here,\n\n769\n00:37:48.965 --> 00:37:51.639\nand/or any of the other areas\nif we wanted to, right?\n\n770\n00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:54.680\nAnd you'll see that, let me just click\non Edit, any one of them is available.\n\n771\n00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.990\nLike I said, we could easily go in\nafter the fact and make changes,\n\n772\n00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.150\nthat was what I was suggesting, right?\n\n773\n00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.110\nIt may actually be easier for\nyou quite honestly,\n\n774\n00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.370\nunless you have all this information at\nyour fingertips, you understand it all.\n\n775\n00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.354\nYou know everything that\nyou're gonna be doing.\n\n776\n00:38:07.354 --> 00:38:10.788\nIt may be easier to set the initial\nconfiguration of using that quick\n\n777\n00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:11.641\ndeploy wizard.\n\n778\n00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:15.254\nAnd then go in and start hacking away at\nthese areas, and changing them as you\n\n779\n00:38:15.254 --> 00:38:18.510\nfigure out exactly what you wanna do,\nand how you want it done.\n\n780\n00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.370\nCuz you could see it's\nalready pre-configured.\n\n781\n00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.170\nNow you just go in and\n\n782\n00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.260\nedit the appropriate micro-area\nto set those settings up.\n\n783\n00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.730\nYou're able to make changes as you go.\n\n784\n00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.390\nBut you're not having to\nworry about managing 5, 10,\n\n785\n00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:33.290\n15 distinct pieces of information across\nfour infrastructure areas that you may or\n\n786\n00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.710\nmay not understand and have completely\nconfigured in real time, right?\n\n787\n00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.758\nThat's the only reason\nI'm mentioning that.\n\n788\n00:38:38.758 --> 00:38:42.960\nBut you could see here tasks, remote\naccess, remote connectivity settings,\n\n789\n00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.630\nadd an application server,\nview the summary, reload the config,\n\n790\n00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.975\nopen the RRAS manager, launch the policy.\n\n791\n00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:52.710\n[INAUDIBLE] policy server right from here.\n\n792\n00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.180\nAll those things are in this console.\n\n793\n00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.530\nThis console is pretty cool.\n\n794\n00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.164\nOnce you get it stood up and running,\ncuz again, it gives you that all in one\n\n795\n00:38:59.164 --> 00:39:02.511\ncapability to manage all the different\naspects of remote routing and\n\n796\n00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:04.723\nremote access along\nwith the policy server.\n\n797\n00:39:04.723 --> 00:39:06.590\nWe could see it all right from here.\n\n798\n00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.040\nSo if I open RRAS management,\njust hypothetically, bring this up,\n\n799\n00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.510\nyou'll see our server is stood up and\nconfigured.\n\n800\n00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.612\nYou've seen that before.\n\n801\n00:39:14.612 --> 00:39:18.678\nAnd you'll see that we do have our\ncapabilities to do whatever we need to do\n\n802\n00:39:18.678 --> 00:39:19.671\nright from here.\n\n803\n00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:23.700\nWe can go in and edit, modify, manage,\nbut it just launches the console for us.\n\n804\n00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.101\nSo this is the missing console.\n\n805\n00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:25.690\n&gt;&gt; One-stop shop?\n\n806\n00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.728\n&gt;&gt; Right, the one-stop shop, the other\npiece that we haven't alluded to or\n\n807\n00:39:28.728 --> 00:39:30.898\nreally shown you until now,\nbut this is where you go,\n\n808\n00:39:30.898 --> 00:39:32.700\nthis is where you configure direct access.\n\n809\n00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.080\nThis is how you stand it up, and\n\n810\n00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.390\nthis is ultimately where\nyou would go to manage it.\n\n811\n00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.125\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool stuff, Adam.\n\n812\n00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:38.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, I tried to work\n\n813\n00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.810\nhard on that thing.\n\n814\n00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:39.627\nYou were so excited when I-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n815\n00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:40.832\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] you were gonna\n[INAUDIBLE] DirectAccess.\n\n816\n00:39:40.832 --> 00:39:41.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you were like, wow,\n\n817\n00:39:41.966 --> 00:39:43.347\nI didn't see that before,\nit's gonna be so cool.\n\n818\n00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:45.565\n&gt;&gt; Now, I know we took a little\nbit extra time in this episode, so\n\n819\n00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:47.829\nwe could get through everything,\nbut are we gonna come back and\n\n820\n00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:50.450\ntalk about DirectAccess more,\nor you think that's about it?\n\n821\n00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.390\n&gt;&gt; No,\nI think that's directed DirectAccess.\n\n822\n00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.523\n&gt;&gt; Directly,\ndirectly covered over it, all right.\n\n823\n00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:55.073\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we've\n\n824\n00:39:55.073 --> 00:39:55.623\ndirectly covered DirectAccess.\n\n825\n00:39:55.623 --> 00:39:59.772\nSo to be clear, though, and to be fair,\nthere is some additional information you\n\n826\n00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:02.290\nmay just wanna take a look\nat in the show notes.\n\n827\n00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:06.149\nWe just detailed out a lot of the steps\nthat we're showing you in the wizard,\n\n828\n00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:08.155\nkind of what Cherokee was alluding to.\n\n829\n00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:11.002\nInstead of going through each step and\neach wizard, and saying,\n\n830\n00:40:11.002 --> 00:40:14.053\nhey, let's put all this stuff in here,\nwe just did the quick config,\n\n831\n00:40:14.053 --> 00:40:16.950\nshowed you the screens,\ngave you an idea of what was there.\n\n832\n00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.410\nBut I did lay out as I told you,\nas we were walking through, the steps for\n\n833\n00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.460\neach one of those areas.\n\n834\n00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.042\nAnd I told you what the settings would be.\n\n835\n00:40:23.042 --> 00:40:25.655\nSo, as I was trying to give\nyou that detailed information,\n\n836\n00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:28.804\nso you could certainly drill down\na little bit more on those show notes.\n\n837\n00:40:28.804 --> 00:40:30.617\nJust read up a little bit\nmore about each area, so\n\n838\n00:40:30.617 --> 00:40:33.480\nyou have a better understanding of\nthe kind of things that go on there.\n\n839\n00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.350\nBut all the knowledge,\n\n840\n00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:37.320\nall the detail you need is certainly\ngonna be available for you right there.\n\n841\n00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much for that, Adam.\n\n842\n00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.620\nAnd thank you for joining us today.\n\n843\n00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.440\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n844\n00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.640\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n845\n00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:17.510\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.460\nIn this episode we're taking\na look at VPNs you may or\n\n8\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.290\nmay not have heard about them but\nI'm sure that Adam Gordon will bring\n\n9\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.340\nsomething interesting to the table in this\nparticular episode, so let's go ahead and\n\n10\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.530\nwelcome Adam, thank you for\njoining us today.\n\n11\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.450\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nalways a pleasure to be here with you, so\n\n12\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.230\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout remote access if you haven't seen\n\n13\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.060\nthe prior episodes we've\nbeen going through.\n\n14\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.660\nTalked extensively about RRS,\ntalked about how to set it up.\n\n15\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.900\nTook a look at NET,\ntook a look at the Network Policy Server.\n\n16\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.800\nTalked about DirectAccess,\neven mentioned VPN Reconnect.\n\n17\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.480\nAnd just talked about the concepts there.\n\n18\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360\nBut we're gonna round out\nthat whole body of knowledge\n\n19\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.800\naround how we deal with remote\naccess by talking about one of\n\n20\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.060\nthe most important elements of\nwhat these remote access for,\n\n21\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.810\nwhich is the VPN, right, how we deal with\nand set up virtual private networks.\n\n22\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.170\nWe've actually, in a set of prior episodes\naround general topics and remote access,\n\n23\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.590\nwalked you through a couple of\ndifferent setups for using the VPN.\n\n24\n00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.290\nI actually showed you how\nto set up the RRS Server\n\n25\n00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.940\njust as a software-based\nrouter doing LAN routing.\n\n26\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.730\nDoing a custom configuration.\n\n27\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.480\nWe also walk through as part of\nthe network policy server overview and\n\n28\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.660\ndemo, when we setup and take a look\nat that the entire thought process.\n\n29\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.860\nWe actually setup and configure our\nRRS as a VPN server dial up VPN.\n\n30\n00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.680\nWe walk you through\nthe configuration wizard.\n\n31\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.120\nShowed you how to enable\nthe VPN functionality.\n\n32\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.990\nWe actually walk through the process end\nto end, of setting it up managing within\n\n33\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.780\nour policy server and then demoing\nthe fact that we could connect through and\n\n34\n00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.145\nactually saw the VPN technology working.\n\n35\n00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:48.010\nSo that's we've been through all that,\nshowed all that already,\n\n36\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.630\nwe're gonna have some interesting demos\nand walk throughs around this topic,\n\n37\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.160\nSeparate from that coming\nup in some future episodes.\n\n38\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.140\nWe'll take a look at SSTP and setting up\na VPN connection or a client using SSTP.\n\n39\n00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.630\nUsing some certificates to drive that,\nsecure socket tunneling\n\n40\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.880\nis one of the ways, one of\nthe protocols we can use to enable VPN.\n\n41\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.170\nSo we've taken a look of that already,\nbut we're gonna through and\n\n42\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.780\njust backfill some of that knowledge.\n\n43\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.170\nMake sure we understand the logic if you\nwill, the thought process and the nuts and\n\n44\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.170\nbolts of VPNing, if we could say that,\nif that's a word.\n\n45\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.950\nIt's kind of like Googling.\n\n46\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.570\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.980\n&gt;&gt; It's never in the vocabulary until that\nbecame something else, but it does now.\n\n48\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.770\nCuz my mother reminds me\nabout that sometimes.\n\n49\n00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.745\nShe's like, I could Google that but\nyou couldn't Google when I was young.\n\n50\n00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:32.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, mom, you couldn't,\n\n51\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630\nthat's absolutely right.\n\n52\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.090\nAll right, so,\nlet's talk a little bit about VPNs.\n\n53\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.931\nSo, Cherokee,\nmaybe you could help me out with this.\n\n54\n00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.785\nSo when we think about VPNs,\nright, and we talk about, or\n\n55\n00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:45.520\nthink about the logic of virtual\nprivate network access, we're usually,\n\n56\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.202\nnot always again, but\nusually, more often than not,\n\n57\n00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:51.670\nwe're coming in remotely from\noutside of the organization, right?\n\n58\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.552\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, probably working remotely.\n\n59\n00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:56.060\nWe wanna be able to connect in,\nconnect securely.\n\n60\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.590\nWe've talked about the importance of using\nencryption usually tunneling protocols\n\n61\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.830\nwith encryption to be able to create those\nsecure connections in one form or another.\n\n62\n00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.560\nSo we've talked about all that and\n\n63\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.530\nwe've talked about the fact that a lot\nof the times VPNs will be used for\n\n64\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.880\nessentially remote access,\ncoming in from outside right?\n\n65\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.984\nBut we also have mentioned,\n\n66\n00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:17.165\nI've mentioned a few episodes you've\nagreed with me when I've mentioned them.\n\n67\n00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:22.041\nThat we may also have a reason, a need to\nuse a VPN in a non-traditional sense when\n\n68\n00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.124\nmaybe we are on the inside of the LAN,\nin other words\n\n69\n00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:29.861\nwhere perhaps in our private network but\nwe wanna connect out to another site,\n\n70\n00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.990\na secure site that is\nalso part of our network.\n\n71\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.906\nWe wanna have dedicated connectivity and\nprobably a dedicated VPN tunnel,\n\n72\n00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:40.585\nsecure communication between this\nremote location and remote sites.\n\n73\n00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:43.110\nThat would be another usage profile for\nVPN.\n\n74\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.777\nThat makes sense.\n\n75\n00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\nDive in what youknow?\n\n76\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.020\n&gt;&gt; If you think about\n&gt;&gt; The options that you had prior\n\n77\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.820\nto really the advent of VPN usage.\n\n78\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.920\nWe will have what typically just\na dedicated lease line which could be\n\n79\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.750\nexpensive depending on the distance\nbetween those two sites.\n\n80\n00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.000\nSo you see lightweight even\nnowadays VPNs being utilized.\n\n81\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.670\nIt's not even as in base\nas if I had to install.\n\n82\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.650\nA particular program on one system but\nbetween those two sites and\n\n83\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.630\nonce you go ahead and\nset that up it's just a more\n\n84\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.960\nefficient way of having\nthat communication there.\n\n85\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.390\nIt doesn't always have to be on it can be\ncircuit based where I can go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.890\nbuild it up and\ntear it down as needed basis as well.\n\n87\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.690\nSo it's just, I don't know,\nI just see benefits in using it.\n\n88\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.280\nAnd I think a lot of other companies\ndo and that's why they do it.\n\n89\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.990\n&gt;&gt; They do, could be a permanent virtual\ncircuit or a switch virtual circuit on\n\n90\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.000\ndemand, in other words, as you were\nsuggesting, or permanently in place.\n\n91\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.170\nBut the idea would be that we support\ntwo different types of VPN connectivity\n\n92\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.710\nusing Server 16,\nthe two we were just describing.\n\n93\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.730\nWe formally would call the external in\nfrom outside, traditional VPN access,\n\n94\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.030\nRemote Access, that's the type\nof VPN we label it in Server 16.\n\n95\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.440\nWe also support,\nwhat Cherokee was just describing,\n\n96\n00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.840\nthe site-to-site VPN where we\nconnect between a remote offices or\n\n97\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.940\nwhatever you may be thinking\nof what we were describing.\n\n98\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.250\nEstablishing router connections between\nthese offices and organizations, we're\n\n99\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.170\ngoing over a public network traditionally\nmaintaining secure communications, but\n\n100\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.180\nas I was suggesting we may own those\ndedicated bandwidth lengths as well.\n\n101\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.560\nAnd you were saying maybe\na circuit of some kind.\n\n102\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.640\nMaybe it's a private or\n\n103\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.550\npermanent, maybe it's a permanent\ncircuit that is on a private network.\n\n104\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.960\nOr it's an on-demand kind of always on but\navailable when we turned it on and\n\n105\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.950\nneed to connect.\n\n106\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.170\nSo it's a different ways to do this.\n\n107\n00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.530\nA lot of companies will own dedicated\nlinks between those sites and\n\n108\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.130\nused them as dedicated pathways for\ncommunications.\n\n109\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.082\nThey technically do run\nover public networks, so\n\n110\n00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:42.860\nwe want just make that clearly, yes you\nstill are in theory connecting all public\n\n111\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.656\nnetwork because the ISP who's\nalways providing that network or\n\n112\n00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:51.575\nthat bandwidth for you is technically and\nusually going to be laying those pipes for\n\n113\n00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:54.272\nyou over public networks\nlike the Internet.\n\n114\n00:05:54.272 --> 00:05:56.130\nThey're just giving you\ndedicated circuits.\n\n115\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.960\nThey're provisioning out\nas part of the broader\n\n116\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.550\ncommunication pathways they manage and\nmaintain.\n\n117\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.000\nYou really almost with that exception over\nconnecting on totally private network,\n\n118\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.300\nwhen you go in between sites unless you\nown all that infrastructure, right.\n\n119\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.370\nSo if you set up the fiber between two\nbuildings and you own it, right, and\n\n120\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.160\nyou install it and have it built for you,\nyeah you've got dedicated pathways and\n\n121\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.830\nbandwidth connectivity\nbetween remote sites.\n\n122\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.130\nAnd you own that network it's\nall private and internal.\n\n123\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.370\nBut it's very rare that companies are\nmaking those kind of investments right.\n\n124\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.680\nTraditionally, site to site is normally\ngoing to be Going over a public network,\n\n125\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.920\nbut with dedicated connections\nmore often than not.\n\n126\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.090\nSo I just wanna make sure we're aware\nof the types of VPNs that we support.\n\n127\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.940\nJust as we looked to get started,\nyeah we do have properties of VPN\n\n128\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.340\nconnections to think\nabout the logic of this.\n\n129\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.690\nWe're essentially creating a dedicated\nconnection between, as you said Cherokee,\n\n130\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.440\nan endpoint, a client, right?\n\n131\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.340\nMaybe running an application,\nold style VPN, a VPN client of some kind,\n\n132\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.670\nmaybe a slightly newer one\nlike you were alluding to.\n\n133\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.980\nMaybe it's an application-based VPN\nthrough a web application firewall or\n\n134\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.360\nsomething like that,\nwere we're tunneling IP over HTTPS.\n\n135\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.370\nAnd essentially we're just going through\nusing the web and web enabled application\n\n136\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.620\nor application that supports that as\nour front end quote unquote VPN client,\n\n137\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.830\nbecause it's able to\ninitiate the connection.\n\n138\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.470\nCreate the tunnels and the traffic while\nwe're not using a traditional standalone\n\n139\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.877\nseparate VPN client to do that.\n\n140\n00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:21.696\nBecause more often than not today,\nas you're right we pointed it out,\n\n141\n00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:24.880\nwe maybe be using more modern\ncommunication mechanisms and\n\n142\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.465\nthose VPN clients of yesterday\nare becoming less and less common.\n\n143\n00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:31.691\nWe just don't need to run them stand\nalone clients we a lot of times now have\n\n144\n00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:34.361\napplications that support that\ncapability built right in.\n\n145\n00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:38.265\nAll modern web browsers allow us in\ntheory, as long as we have an application\n\n146\n00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:42.230\nservice, a web service running on\nthe backend that provides us capability,\n\n147\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.378\nthey allow us to punch a tunnel through\njust about anything, using a web protocol\n\n148\n00:07:46.378 --> 00:07:49.733\nof some kind, HTTPS or\nsome sort of secure tunneling solution and\n\n149\n00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:54.003\nallow us to connect Microsoft's done this\nfor years for instance, with Outlook,\n\n150\n00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:56.992\nwith Outlook anywhere or\nwhatever they happen to call it,\n\n151\n00:07:56.992 --> 00:08:00.820\ngiven the version you may use based\non what version of Office you run.\n\n152\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.697\nBut using the Outlook mapping client on\nthe desktop to connect over the Internet\n\n153\n00:08:05.697 --> 00:08:10.573\nand set up a secure connection back into\nyour Exchange server is being done using\n\n154\n00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.206\nessentially VPN tunnel.\n\n155\n00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:15.244\nTunneling through RPC over HTTPS,\nOutlook anywhere,\n\n156\n00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:17.820\nthey call it different things by version.\n\n157\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.638\nBut ultimately, you're tunneling\na connection protocol through the web,\n\n158\n00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:21.729\nthat's what you're doing.\n\n159\n00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:26.100\nSo, we are able to do this with a lot\nof different solutions, options today.\n\n160\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.346\nAnd the VPN connections or the VPN\nclients are using typically either PPTP,\n\n161\n00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:33.276\nold school point-to-point\ntunneling protocol.\n\n162\n00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:38.255\nL2TP, we always wanna add IPsec on the end\nof that cuz L2TP by itself, although it\n\n163\n00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:42.900\ndoes technically, create a tunnel,\nit is capable of establishing a VPN.\n\n164\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.190\nThere's no authentication, and most\nimportantly, no encryption associated with\n\n165\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.415\nthat natively, L2TP is really\ngood at establishing a tunnel.\n\n166\n00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:53.310\nUnfortunately, nobody thought about\nwhat you do, once you have the tunnel.\n\n167\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.904\nSo as a result,\nwe don't ever really use L2TP by itself.\n\n168\n00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:59.877\nIt's always L2TP with IPSec,\nand or as I mentioned SSTP,\n\n169\n00:08:59.877 --> 00:09:02.189\nkind of a newer player to the game.\n\n170\n00:09:02.189 --> 00:09:06.630\nSSTP, a new protocol that we've been\nusing, secured socket tunneling protocol.\n\n171\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.780\nThis is now supported in Server 16,\nso this is kinda nice.\n\n172\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.024\nAnd we can set this up and use these\nparticular protocols, and we mix and\n\n173\n00:09:14.024 --> 00:09:16.382\nmatch, and we can choose what we want.\n\n174\n00:09:16.382 --> 00:09:19.390\nWhen we took a look at some of\nthe prior episodes of configuring this.\n\n175\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.351\nYou saw that we had options there,\ncould check boxes off,\n\n176\n00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:25.509\nenable a variety of things,\nbut we can encapsulate, right?\n\n177\n00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:28.613\nWe do encapsulate data in the tunnel,\nwrapping the data.\n\n178\n00:09:28.613 --> 00:09:32.501\nAnd the header of the data, specifically,\ntypically is gonna have another layer of\n\n179\n00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:35.020\ninformation associated with\nit if we're NATting, so\n\n180\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.737\nmaybe adding functionality there.\n\n181\n00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:41.050\nWe're gonna wrap that private data in\na secure cocoon of type with routing\n\n182\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.907\ninformation and usually confidentiality\nprotection is associated with it.\n\n183\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:49.875\nSo our encapsulation is all about our\nencryption in confidentiality and\n\n184\n00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:54.037\nour authentication that we use is gonna\nthen provide our different levels of\n\n185\n00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:55.090\nauthentication.\n\n186\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.712\nAre gonna provide us the capability\nof specifying who we are and\n\n187\n00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:01.460\nsignifying whether or\nnot we're authorized.\n\n188\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.438\nAnd we can authorize or\n\n189\n00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:04.868\nwe can do authentication in\nseveral different levels.\n\n190\n00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:08.757\nWe have user level authentication,\nwhere we can use point-to-point\n\n191\n00:10:08.757 --> 00:10:12.404\nauthentication so we can specify\nuser credentials for instance.\n\n192\n00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:15.828\nWe specify typically that we have\nthe appropriate authorization based on\n\n193\n00:10:15.828 --> 00:10:16.387\nwho we are.\n\n194\n00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:19.748\nAnd a group membership or something like\nthat, all I mean the remote users group\n\n195\n00:10:19.748 --> 00:10:23.120\nand this is my credential, and so\nlets use the level authentication.\n\n196\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.002\nWe can do computer level authentication,\nwe use IKE, the Internet Key Exchange\n\n197\n00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.729\nprotocol to exchange certificates and\nvalidate our identity based on that.\n\n198\n00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:34.219\nSo we have to establish\nan IPSec security association,\n\n199\n00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:38.210\na negotiated contract to\nexchange information in IPSec.\n\n200\n00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.024\nThis is our setup document that\nallows us to establish and\n\n201\n00:10:42.024 --> 00:10:46.950\nenable the IPSec connection, so\nL2TP with IPS requires the negotiation\n\n202\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.614\nof two unidirectional essays\nsecurity association.\n\n203\n00:10:50.614 --> 00:10:54.431\nSo Cherokee and\nI were gonna connect Using IPSec, so\n\n204\n00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:57.827\nusing HTTP with IPSec,\nwe were gonna do that.\n\n205\n00:10:57.827 --> 00:11:02.604\nPart of the set up process would involved\nthat, we negotiate and just because we're\n\n206\n00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:05.255\ngonna do this, I happen to have-\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n207\n00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:07.882\n&gt;&gt; It's always good, gotta have your\nsecurity associations whenever-\n\n208\n00:11:07.882 --> 00:11:08.872\n&gt;&gt; I see you spared no expense on\n\n209\n00:11:08.872 --> 00:11:10.779\nthe props-\n&gt;&gt; I did spare no expense on\n\n210\n00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:11.977\nthe props, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:16.845\nSo we have only the finest security\nassociation material here at ITProTV.\n\n212\n00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:20.227\nHey look, you gotta go with what you find\nin the bottom of the podium when you're\n\n213\n00:11:20.227 --> 00:11:20.997\ndoing this live.\n\n214\n00:11:20.997 --> 00:11:23.828\nAll right, so, what we're gonna do is\njust demonstrate quickly the concept.\n\n215\n00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:26.681\nI just have a piece of paper,\nCherokee has the same thing in her hand.\n\n216\n00:11:26.681 --> 00:11:29.680\nThe idea would be that It would\nbe a security association.\n\n217\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.453\nEssentially, it's a one-way\nnegotiated agreement,\n\n218\n00:11:32.453 --> 00:11:35.121\nas to how we're gonna agree\nto exchange information.\n\n219\n00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:36.370\nThat's what it does say it is.\n\n220\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.705\nSo I, if I'm the client initiating,\nwould have to go to Cherokee,\n\n221\n00:11:39.705 --> 00:11:41.810\nlet's just say Cherokee is the end point,\n\n222\n00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.105\nthe connection that I'm wanna\nnegotiate it's gonna be with her.\n\n223\n00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:46.300\nI'm establishing it.\n\n224\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.074\nI will say to Cherokee hey,\nas part of the set up of L2TP IPSec\n\n225\n00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:54.075\nusing [INAUDIBLE] key exchange\nbe able to exchange information.\n\n226\n00:11:54.075 --> 00:11:57.448\nSet up the keys, the passwords, all the\nstuff we have to do in the certificates,\n\n227\n00:11:57.448 --> 00:11:59.115\nwe're gonna negotiate our ASAs.\n\n228\n00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:01.834\nSo I'm gonna set one up with Cherokee,\nI'm gonna give here mine,\n\n229\n00:12:01.834 --> 00:12:04.796\nyou know what what you have to do,\nyou have to write the letter C on yours,\n\n230\n00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:07.730\nI have to write the letter A on mine so\nwe could keep track of who has what.\n\n231\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.790\nPut A on mine real quick.\n\n232\n00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.660\nYou could see this is live, we didn't set\nthis up ahead of time all right so good.\n\n233\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.302\n&gt;&gt; A.\n\n234\n00:12:13.302 --> 00:12:16.152\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go\n&gt;&gt; And see.\n\n235\n00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, good.\n\n236\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.453\nSo we're gonna exchange these, right?\n\n237\n00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:19.290\n&gt;&gt; Lord, he could see it.\n\n238\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:19.905\nOkay.\n\n239\n00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.241\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to exchange these,\nand so\n\n240\n00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.820\nnow I have the security association that\nhas the letter C on it for Cherokee.\n\n241\n00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.872\nYou have the one that has the letter A for\nAdam.\n\n242\n00:12:28.872 --> 00:12:32.840\nAnd so now we've agreed essentially\ninto unidirectional exchanges that we\n\n243\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.002\nhave the agreement, the contract,\nthe stipulations, all\n\n244\n00:12:36.002 --> 00:12:40.346\nthe settings involved to now allow us to\nestablish and exchange that information.\n\n245\n00:12:40.346 --> 00:12:41.780\nYou can throw that away now,\nwe don't need it anymore.\n\n246\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.556\nNow, we keep it for\nthe duration of our exchange, right?\n\n247\n00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.274\nThe duration of the tunnel that\nwe're gonna set up and establish.\n\n248\n00:12:47.274 --> 00:12:51.936\nSo computer level authentication involves\nthe use of IKE to do the exchange and\n\n249\n00:12:51.936 --> 00:12:54.418\nto negotiate the SAs and establish them.\n\n250\n00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:55.330\nAnd that's what we're setting up.\n\n251\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.633\nBut keep in mind, this is only\nwhen we're doing L2TP with IPSec.\n\n252\n00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.106\nWe have our pre-shared key,\nessentially our perfect seeker,\n\n253\n00:13:01.106 --> 00:13:02.320\nwe refer to it different ways.\n\n254\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.433\nAnd we're gonna be able to exchange that\ninformation or at least established that.\n\n255\n00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:09.411\nBut I keep stressing only for\nL2TP with IPSec.\n\n256\n00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:10.159\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but-\n&gt;&gt; Associated address there, right?\n\n257\n00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:13.254\n&gt;&gt; Because L2TP would work but\nyou wouldn't have that security and\n\n258\n00:13:13.254 --> 00:13:17.090\nyou just stated most of the time we're\ngonna be running over our public network.\n\n259\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.786\nSo really,\n\n260\n00:13:17.786 --> 00:13:22.665\nwhy would someone want to be transmitting\ninformation that could be compromised?\n\n261\n00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:23.207\nSo, definitely.\n\n262\n00:13:23.207 --> 00:13:27.152\n&gt;&gt; Well it is, the reason I’m stressing\nit is that computer level authentication,\n\n263\n00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:30.698\nalso data origin authentication and\ndata integrity, talk about that and\n\n264\n00:13:30.698 --> 00:13:32.560\njust been kind of third level.\n\n265\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.281\nThose two things are available with\nL2TP with IPSec connections, right?\n\n266\n00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:42.460\nSpecifically the computer level\nauthentication only with L2TP with IPSec.\n\n267\n00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.685\nUser level authentication that occurs,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:45.685 --> 00:13:48.772\nRegardless of what kind of\nprotocol we're using, PPTP,\n\n269\n00:13:48.772 --> 00:13:51.483\nwe're gonna use this user\nlevel authentication.\n\n270\n00:13:51.483 --> 00:13:52.856\nSSTP, right?\n\n271\n00:13:52.856 --> 00:13:56.900\nWe have user level authentication\nthat may or may not play a part.\n\n272\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.333\nBut we're doing different levels\nof authentication, specifically\n\n273\n00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:04.185\ncomputer-based authentication,\nis tied to this L2TP with IPSec concept.\n\n274\n00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:06.080\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we're clear on that.\n\n275\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.313\nOn data origin authentication and\ndata integrity,\n\n276\n00:14:09.313 --> 00:14:12.403\nnobody call that in just\nplain generic language.\n\n277\n00:14:12.403 --> 00:14:16.993\nAnd you've used these terms before, we've\ntalked about this when we spoke about,\n\n278\n00:14:16.993 --> 00:14:19.120\nI think in the IPv6 discussions.\n\n279\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.720\nProbably in DNS we'll do digitally\nsigning, and we talked about DNS sets,\n\n280\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.036\nspecifically in signing\nthe resource records.\n\n281\n00:14:25.036 --> 00:14:28.059\nWe went into that conversation\na little bit about how all this works.\n\n282\n00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:32.130\nAnd we talked about non repudiation, proof\nof origin, proving you sent something.\n\n283\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.312\nCherokee walked us through\nsome of the logic there.\n\n284\n00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:37.540\nAnd that's really what we're talking about\nwith data origin, authentication and\n\n285\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.410\ndata integrity.\n\n286\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.114\nWe're verifying that the data that was\nsent originated at the connection's end.\n\n287\n00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:44.832\nSo we're essentially verifying\nthat either of the two\n\n288\n00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:47.440\nparties involved did\nlegitimately send that data.\n\n289\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.613\nWe can prove that by using\nthese capabilities that\n\n290\n00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:54.549\nare associated again with L2TP and\nIPSec base connections.\n\n291\n00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:56.746\nCuz we have both authentication headers,\n\n292\n00:14:56.746 --> 00:15:00.530\nDAH as well as encapsulating security\npayload, ESP functionality, and\n\n293\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.980\nthat provides the confidentiality and\nthe integrity in authentication mechanism.\n\n294\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.764\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n295\n00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:10.212\nWe do have data encryption,\nthe ability to be able to, as I said,\n\n296\n00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:14.291\nencrypt our data securely, controlling it,\nsending it out on the wire, and\n\n297\n00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:18.500\nensuring that we are securing it as\npart of this thought process as well.\n\n298\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.875\nWhen we do our site-to-site VPN,\nthe routers are setting up the VPN, right?\n\n299\n00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:26.340\nLet's be clear about\nwhat site-to-site VPN is.\n\n300\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.504\nThis is one router calling another, right?\n\n301\n00:15:29.504 --> 00:15:33.350\nWe call one side of the router\nthe calling router, the VPN client.\n\n302\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.216\nWe call the answering router, the router\non the other side is going to be the VPN\n\n303\n00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:40.518\nserver, that is just we label them.\n\n304\n00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:45.078\nSo the VPN client in a site-to-site is\nthe router that initiates the callout.\n\n305\n00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:48.117\nThe VPN server is the router\nthat accepts the call.\n\n306\n00:15:48.117 --> 00:15:53.032\nSo we talk about the calling router and\nthe answering router Call those the VPN\n\n307\n00:15:53.032 --> 00:15:58.924\nclient, the VPN server, just when we're\ndoing site to site VPNs using routers.\n\n308\n00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:03.828\nRemember, site-to-site is essentially\nif you're familiar with doing an L2TP\n\n309\n00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:08.070\nwith IPSec solution and\nyou're familiar with transport mode or\n\n310\n00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.310\ntunnel mode and\nyou have the idea in your mind or\n\n311\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.340\nknow the thought process behind\nsetting up a tunnel mode connection.\n\n312\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.850\nTunnel mode is router to router.\n\n313\n00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.330\nI mean, we tunnel between routers.\n\n314\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.560\nWe transport on the LAN, we often say.\n\n315\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.929\nWe tunnel through the LAN.\n\n316\n00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:23.279\nAnd so we're just really talking about\nanother way of using that thought process\n\n317\n00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.985\nand establishing those connections, just\nsignifying that they're between routers.\n\n318\n00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.220\nYou just wanna make sure you\nunderstand the vocabulary.\n\n319\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.877\nBecause a lot of times,\nin either questions or in word problems or\n\n320\n00:16:33.877 --> 00:16:39.637\nscenarios, word I was looking for,\nwe will often see site-to-site routers or\n\n321\n00:16:39.637 --> 00:16:45.588\nsite-to-site VPNs rather, referred to but\nthey may not be called by their name.\n\n322\n00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:51.085\nThey may talk about the VPN client, or\nthey make talk about the calling router.\n\n323\n00:16:51.085 --> 00:16:55.485\nThey may talk about the VPN server or\nthey may talk about the answering router.\n\n324\n00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:57.195\nAnd you have to understand\nthe logic of that and\n\n325\n00:16:57.195 --> 00:16:59.150\nmake sure you understand the vocabulary.\n\n326\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.720\nVery important for\nyou to be aware of those things.\n\n327\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.015\nDid put that in the show notes for\n\n328\n00:17:03.015 --> 00:17:04.640\nyou just to make sure\nyou're familiar with that.\n\n329\n00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.020\nObviously, have a reference for\n\n330\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.950\nthat just in case you have to go back and\nlook it up.\n\n331\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.270\nDo you ever hear that, referred to\nas calling router, answering router?\n\n332\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.518\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n333\n00:17:12.518 --> 00:17:15.520\nI mean, I know that I've heard\nthe term VPN concentrator,\n\n334\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.401\nwhich is kind of gone by the way\nside in loo of the routers,\n\n335\n00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:19.790\nlike what serious-\n&gt;&gt; Just yeah,\n\n336\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.497\njust answers that aggregating our-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n337\n00:17:21.497 --> 00:17:24.167\n&gt;&gt; VPN connections inbound and doing some\nload balancing things like that for us.\n\n338\n00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.665\nBut no, this is just verbiage and\n\n339\n00:17:25.665 --> 00:17:28.781\nterminology that we use just to make\nsure that we have a sense of that.\n\n340\n00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n&gt;&gt; So just wanna think about that.\n\n341\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.810\nAnd so three types of site-to-site VPNs\nin Windows Server 16 are supported.\n\n342\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.344\nWe talked about again the idea here.\n\n343\n00:17:37.344 --> 00:17:40.290\nPPTP, just reminding you of that.\n\n344\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.710\nL2TP, and of course, IKEv2.\n\n345\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.070\nIKEv2 is gonna be used for\nthe L2TP with the IPsec\n\n346\n00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.020\nportion of our program as we discussed,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n347\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.500\nPPTP, just a couple of quick notes.\n\n348\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.319\nI think I mentioned these\none of the other episodes,\n\n349\n00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:56.025\nuses Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption.\n\n350\n00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:57.640\nI think we were setting up the VPN.\n\n351\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.191\nWe actually took a look at it in\nthe remote access episodes where we did\n\n352\n00:18:01.191 --> 00:18:01.752\nthe demo.\n\n353\n00:18:01.752 --> 00:18:03.821\nI think I pointed out that\nwe have the three options.\n\n354\n00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:07.498\nI showed them to you, but I believe that I\nwent in and just quickly highlighted and\n\n355\n00:18:07.498 --> 00:18:09.730\nsaid, look, that's MPEE.\n\n356\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.920\nSo we use Microsoft Point-to-Point\nEncryption with a PPTP site-to-site VPN.\n\n357\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.100\nWe use that for encryption and\npoint-to-point protocol.\n\n358\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.674\nPPP is used for authentication.\n\n359\n00:18:20.674 --> 00:18:23.991\nYou wanna make sure you know\nthe underlying protocols that are used to\n\n360\n00:18:23.991 --> 00:18:25.375\nachieve these end results.\n\n361\n00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.151\nL2TP, we use certificates for\n\n362\n00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:30.719\nencryption as we talked about\nintegrity data authentication.\n\n363\n00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:31.943\nWe do all that.\n\n364\n00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:36.122\nPPP, point-to-point, is used for\nauthentication there as well potentially,\n\n365\n00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:38.720\nand IKEv2 for\nsetting up an IKEv2 solution.\n\n366\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.082\nWe'll use AES, which is the Advanced\nEncryption Standard algorithm.\n\n367\n00:18:42.082 --> 00:18:46.142\nGot varying factors there,\nvarying sizes, 256, 192,\n\n368\n00:18:46.142 --> 00:18:51.043\n128-bit for the different strengths\nof the algorithm implementation.\n\n369\n00:18:51.043 --> 00:18:54.451\nWe can also use Triple DES,\nalthough that's not recommended.\n\n370\n00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:58.985\nAES is usually the preferred option there\nfor encryption, so just be aware of that.\n\n371\n00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:02.155\nAnd you mentioned that with these can\nbe either persistent or On Demand.\n\n372\n00:19:02.155 --> 00:19:05.317\nWe talked about the fact that we can\nhave essentially either a dedicated\n\n373\n00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:08.740\ncircuit that's just always on or\none that's On Demand that we spin up, use,\n\n374\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.920\nand then tear down,\nthe way you described that.\n\n375\n00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.640\nI liked that a lot because that\nwould be the On Demand VPN\n\n376\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.557\nconnection as we refer to it formally\nversus the persistent VPN connections.\n\n377\n00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:20.428\nIt's just a matter of how we\nchoose to establish these.\n\n378\n00:19:20.428 --> 00:19:23.550\nPretty standard thought\nprocess with regards to how\n\n379\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.730\nwe see these solutions being set up,\nwhether they're On Demand or persistent.\n\n380\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.390\nA lot of times, and we talked about this,\nbusinesses are using\n\n381\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.320\nthese dedicated circuits to remote\na site access and connectivity.\n\n382\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.120\nIt may make sense for them to leave\nthem on and have permanent connections.\n\n383\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.379\nBut if we have unreliable bandwidth, a lot\nof latency, or one side of the other is\n\n384\n00:19:42.379 --> 00:19:46.265\npaying a premium to use that bandwidth\nbecause of the fact that we're just\n\n385\n00:19:46.265 --> 00:19:50.674\nconnecting into some remote areas where\nmaybe there isn't good infrastructure.\n\n386\n00:19:50.674 --> 00:19:53.945\nAnd we may have to literary be paying for\nevery minute we're connected.\n\n387\n00:19:53.945 --> 00:19:57.700\nYou imagine, for instance, that we're\nusing a satellite relay to drive our\n\n388\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.629\nconnection into a remote field office out\nin the middle of the jungle somewhere,\n\n389\n00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:02.640\nwhich just happen.\n\n390\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.937\nThis is not unusual in\ncertain countries and\n\n391\n00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:09.344\nparts of the world where you're dealing\nwith infrastructure that's being used and\n\n392\n00:20:09.344 --> 00:20:12.820\nperhaps, being situated out in\nthe middle of outside of the city,\n\n393\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.520\noutside of a capital, out in\nthe rural areas, for instance, right.\n\n394\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.760\nI've worked in some countries\nwhere you got the capital city.\n\n395\n00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.710\nYou've got the other main city and\nthere's four hours of just literally just\n\n396\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.560\nsavanna or brush or desert or jungle or\nwhatever may be that's rural in between.\n\n397\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.682\nAnd there are people who live out there\nand you do need to have infrastructure,\n\n398\n00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:35.473\nbut it's probably not as developed,\nlet's say, hypothetically,\n\n399\n00:20:35.473 --> 00:20:38.424\nas it would be in the capital city\nwhere there may be more infrastructure.\n\n400\n00:20:38.424 --> 00:20:42.816\nAnd so you have to use long distance\npoint-to-point communication mechanisms to\n\n401\n00:20:42.816 --> 00:20:43.450\ntransmit.\n\n402\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.571\nYou can't just say, well, just jump on\nthat fiber line that somebody drilled and\n\n403\n00:20:47.571 --> 00:20:51.594\nlaid for us because there may not be fiber\nrunning across the rainforest, right.\n\n404\n00:20:51.594 --> 00:20:54.939\nYou just may not have that or\nout in the savannah or on the plain or\n\n405\n00:20:54.939 --> 00:20:55.835\nwhatever it is.\n\n406\n00:20:55.835 --> 00:20:59.915\nAnd so you're gonna have to use things\nlike microwave relays or satellite relays\n\n407\n00:20:59.915 --> 00:21:04.295\nto shoot your bandwidth signals 20, 30,\n40 miles straight line the side down to\n\n408\n00:21:04.295 --> 00:21:07.668\na relay station that propagates\nat across several hundred miles.\n\n409\n00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.983\nAnd when you're doing this kind of stuff,\n\n410\n00:21:09.983 --> 00:21:12.762\nyou're paying the premium\nwhenever you connect.\n\n411\n00:21:12.762 --> 00:21:16.477\nAnd so the reality is that you may not\nwant these connections to be always on.\n\n412\n00:21:16.477 --> 00:21:18.020\nYou may want them to be On Demand.\n\n413\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.080\nSo it's important just to be aware of the\nfact that we do have these capabilities.\n\n414\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.450\nAlso, I put a little chart\ninto the show notes for you.\n\n415\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.412\nIf we could just go here for one second,\njust on my screen, to see you could see,\n\n416\n00:21:29.412 --> 00:21:33.770\nit is supposed to be like that just so\nit lines up nicely, right?\n\n417\n00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.600\nBut in the notes, you could see,\nI just put together a little VPN tunneling\n\n418\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.120\nprotocol option list here with\nthe firewall configurations.\n\n419\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.773\nI just wanted you to see this\ninstead of rattling them off and\n\n420\n00:21:42.773 --> 00:21:45.334\nyou're not being able to keep\ntrack of them in your head.\n\n421\n00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:50.140\nPPTP requires TCP using port 1723 when\nyou're opening up and configuring\n\n422\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.100\nfirewall connections, so important just\nto be aware of that and know that.\n\n423\n00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.580\nIf you're doing L2TP with IPSec,\nyou'll see,\n\n424\n00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.020\nwe have a couple different\nrequirements here.\n\n425\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:05.933\nUDP port 500, 1701 and 4500,\nas well as IP Protocol ID 50.\n\n426\n00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:08.051\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n427\n00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:12.301\nSSTP is going to run on TCP port 443.\n\n428\n00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:13.449\nThat should look familiar to you.\n\n429\n00:22:13.449 --> 00:22:18.284\nWe're tunneling through essentially\nthe web protocol secure HTTPS, right?\n\n430\n00:22:18.284 --> 00:22:22.511\nAnd then, IKEv2 uses UDP port 500.\n\n431\n00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:24.938\nNotice L2TP with IPSec UDP port 500,\nright?\n\n432\n00:22:24.938 --> 00:22:28.560\nSo we talked about the fact that\nthose things are traditionally\n\n433\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.800\nreferred to in the same breath.\n\n434\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.490\nSo just make sure you're familiar with\nthis, the Tunneling Protocols and\n\n435\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.430\nthe Firewall Configuration\nwould be really important.\n\n436\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:40.284\nLove to ask those questions about\nFirewall ports, and making sure you\n\n437\n00:22:40.284 --> 00:22:44.216\nknow what protocol is being used,\nespecially if it's TCP versus UDP.\n\n438\n00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:46.440\nA lot of times,\nyou get asked about that kinda stuff.\n\n439\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.870\nWanna make sure you know that.\n\n440\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.780\nWhen you see a protocol ID pop\nin there from time to time,\n\n441\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.600\nthat's usually an indicator of\nsomething else you may get asked about.\n\n442\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.620\nSo there's some good information\njust sitting there in the chart\n\n443\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.650\nthat may be important for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n444\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.230\nJust wanna make sure you're\nfamiliar with that, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.710\nAll right, very good, so there you go.\n\n446\n00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so probably a good place for\n\n447\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.690\nus to at least stop for our first episode.\n\n448\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.620\nI know, just looking at the clock,\nthat we're getting close to running out of\n\n449\n00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.730\ntime and we do have a lot of\nadditional stuff we wanna discuss.\n\n450\n00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.190\nBut probably a good place for\nus to at least begin our journey and say,\n\n451\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.152\nmaybe we'll take a brief\nrespite before we continue.\n\n452\n00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a plan.\n\n453\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.190\nAnd I know Adam's got some more\nsurprises headed our way with VPN.\n\n454\n00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.069\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n455\n00:23:26.069 --> 00:23:28.109\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n456\n00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:29.090\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n457\n00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.975\n&gt;&gt;

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.030\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.055\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:13.566\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.809\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.590\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.057\nAnd in this episode, well,\nwe're back with more on our 70-741.\n\n10\n00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:24.583\nThat's right, 741 series.\n\n11\n00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.670\nHopefully, that's what you're here to\nsee cuz that's what we're doing today.\n\n12\n00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.410\nAnd joining us in the studio our\ngood friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.090\nAdam, welcome back, and how's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Going well, going well, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.212\nGreat dramatic pause there\nas you did our intro.\n\n16\n00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:39.120\nI always like a little drama when\nwe get started, that was good.\n\n17\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.630\nSo we are going to continue our\ndiscussions around Server 2016 networking.\n\n18\n00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.790\nDelve a little deeper into\nsome of the more esoteric and\n\n19\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.850\nadvanced features around\nserver networking.\n\n20\n00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.800\nNot so much advanced, not so\n\n21\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.390\nmuch esoteric,\na little overstatement on my part.\n\n22\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.790\nBut as I said,\nwe need a little drama as we get started.\n\n23\n00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.110\nBut they are kind of interesting features.\n\n24\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350\nAnd they are features that we probably\ntake for granted in some respects.\n\n25\n00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.470\nWe certainly talk about it a lot.\n\n26\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.500\nWe use, but we may not always\nunderstand how to set up.\n\n27\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.960\nThey're actually pretty\nstraightforward and easy.\n\n28\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590\nWe'll walk you through\na couple of quick hands on\n\n29\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.140\nsolutions around how to enable\nsome of these features.\n\n30\n00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.010\nBut we'll delve a little\ndeeper under the hood and\n\n31\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800\njust talk about some of\nthe things that go on with them.\n\n32\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.650\nSo we're gonna start by talking about\nsomething that really has become so\n\n33\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.270\nimportant for what we do with regards to\nnetworking, with regards to cloud and\n\n34\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.960\nvirtualized environments.\n\n35\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.290\nWhen we think about bandwidth,\n\n36\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.845\nbandwidth management, the ability to\nbe able to create an opportunity for\n\n37\n00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:37.915\nus to do what's called aggregating our\nconnections up so that we can bond them.\n\n38\n00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:43.825\nAnd as a result of that have the sum of\nthose connections together for us to use.\n\n39\n00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:46.375\nWe are talking about something\nknown as NIC Teaming, and\n\n40\n00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.175\nthis is one of the really cool\nfeatures we've had for some time now.\n\n41\n00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.815\nIt's not brand new in\nServer 16 by any means.\n\n42\n00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:55.690\nWe've had this with Hyper-V, and\nHyper-V networking capabilities for\n\n43\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.300\na little while, and now we have it\nacross the major vendor stacks.\n\n44\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.060\nVMware provides NIC Teaming capabilities,\nCitrix does, Microsoft does.\n\n45\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.530\nYou can do this on any platform.\n\n46\n00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.580\nIt's not unique to Microsoft by any means.\n\n47\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.490\nBut we can combine multiple adapters\ntogether, get the benefit of essentially\n\n48\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.030\na multipathing scenario, so that if one\nof the adapters were to fail in the team,\n\n49\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.150\nwe have alternate paths available\nto continue sending and receiving.\n\n50\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.070\nVery important from a BCDR\nperspective with regards to that,\n\n51\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.250\nBusiness Continuity Disaster Recovery.\n\n52\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.714\nVery important from a highly available and\nfault tolerance environment perspective in\n\n53\n00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:32.289\nterms of managing our connectivity and\nour continued availability.\n\n54\n00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.992\nAnd we can also get the benefit of\naggregating up the bandwidth around those\n\n55\n00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:39.340\nadapters so that we get the sum total\nof all of that connectivity, so\n\n56\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.280\nthat we're able to not only communicate,\nbut communicate more effectively,\n\n57\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.720\nmore efficiently, and of course, with the\nbenefit of all of that extra bandwidth.\n\n58\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.050\nSo we can bond together and\ncreate a NIC Team, or\n\n59\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.550\ncreate a NIC Team out of grouping\nnetwork adapters together.\n\n60\n00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.553\nUp to 32 of them could be used as\na single network interface in Server 16.\n\n61\n00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:00.826\nThat's a fairly large number if you\nthink about the fact that we would\n\n62\n00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.326\nbe able to provide redundancy, and\nallow for enhanced communication and\n\n63\n00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.600\nmanagement across those interfaces.\n\n64\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.120\nNow that sounds like a large number,\nand it is.\n\n65\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.760\nAnd you have to keep in mind that many\nhosts will probably not provide 32\n\n66\n00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.780\nphysical network adapters\nthat you can team together.\n\n67\n00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.360\nBut you may have cabinet based solutions,\nwhere you've got blades that are providing\n\n68\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.460\ninfrastructure hosting, and\nyou may have the ability to essentially\n\n69\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.090\naggregate up and use a large number of\nadapters in those kind of environments.\n\n70\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.140\nYears ago, when you were working\nin private environments,\n\n71\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.900\nyou were doing this kind of stuff and\nI see it a lot these days.\n\n72\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.130\nBut when you were doing this years ago you\nprobably didn't see hosts that would have\n\n73\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.830\nanywhere that kind of number,\nI would think, of adapters.\n\n74\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.123\nI mean,\nmaybe two would certainly be normal\n\n75\n00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:43.691\n&gt;&gt; Maybe four.\n\n76\n00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.547\n&gt;&gt; Maybe four.\n\n77\n00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n78\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.201\n&gt;&gt; Maybe eight,\nif it was a really high end host, but\n\n79\n00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.330\nyou probably didn't get\nmuch further than that.\n\n80\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.180\nThat was a lot, and it was probably a\nfairly complex solution if you have that.\n\n81\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.190\nBut we can see certainly\ntoday very large numbers of\n\n82\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.222\nthese adapters being combined together.\n\n83\n00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:01.710\nThe Hyper-V host as\nwell as the Hyper-V VMs\n\n84\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.830\ncan take advantage of\nthe NIC Teaming feature.\n\n85\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.470\nSo it is something that's kind of cool.\n\n86\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.490\nWe could also use something known\nas Switch Embedded Teaming,\n\n87\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.500\ncommonly referred to as SET as an acronym,\nwithin the Hyper-V virtual switch.\n\n88\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.152\nWe could team up to eight physical\nadapters using SET together, so\n\n89\n00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:19.360\nthat we create one or more software\nbased virtual network adapters.\n\n90\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.010\nAs a result, this is a newer feature,\nand this is something that has become\n\n91\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.050\nrelatively commonplace in\nthe brand new network stacks and\n\n92\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.460\nbrand new virtualization\nenhancements that we're seeing, but\n\n93\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.340\nit is something that's also interesting.\n\n94\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.220\nWe can do this and we are then able to\nuse that technology or leverage that\n\n95\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.195\nparticular technology for a NIC Team, and\nyou also have dynamic NIC Teaming as well.\n\n96\n00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:46.105\nThis is a new load balancing option\nstarting in 12R2 that's become available\n\n97\n00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:49.745\nand is now being used where we\ncan actually load balance across.\n\n98\n00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:53.692\nYou can almost think of this as\na software-based load balancing solution\n\n99\n00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:57.502\nmuch like, and it's not exactly like NLB,\nthe traditional Windows software load\n\n100\n00:04:57.502 --> 00:05:01.012\nbalancing solution, but\nit operates similarly.\n\n101\n00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:01.742\nSay that-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:03.820\n&gt;&gt; Quickly without tongue-tying yourself.\n\n103\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.692\nBut essentially dynamic NIC Teaming\nwatches the flow of inbound traffic and\n\n104\n00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.360\nadjusts the capabilities of\nthe team as a result of that.\n\n105\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.468\nAnd we evaluate the traffic and\nwe move the flow around so\n\n106\n00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:19.850\nthat we're balancing across members of\nthe team as we have peaks and valleys.\n\n107\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.590\nSo we're balancing out the load,\n\n108\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.860\nand this makes it obviously a little\nbit easier to manage the traffic flow.\n\n109\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.980\nMakes it smoother for us,\nmakes it more optimized, and\n\n110\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.655\ncontinues to describe towards, that not\nonly software defined solution that we'll\n\n111\n00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:36.525\nbe talking about in some upcoming episodes\naround automation and really removing\n\n112\n00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:41.325\nthe human from the mix in favor of trying\nto standardize and manage that process.\n\n113\n00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:45.132\nBut it also gives us the ability\nbecause of the constant monitoring to\n\n114\n00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:48.812\ntake advantage of opportunities with\npeaks and valleys in the traffic flow,\n\n115\n00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:52.212\nto better optimize and\nbalance across all members of the team.\n\n116\n00:05:52.212 --> 00:05:55.642\nSo that we're evenly, for\nthe most part anyway, sharing that burden,\n\n117\n00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:58.962\nand we're not overwhelming and\nunderwhelming adapters.\n\n118\n00:05:58.962 --> 00:06:01.122\nAnd as a result,\nwe have unbalanced and uneven flow.\n\n119\n00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:04.479\nSo dynamic NIC Teaming is\nalso pretty important.\n\n120\n00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.335\nSo why don't we go in quickly,\nwe'll just take a look at NIC Teaming and\n\n121\n00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.310\nhow we set it up.\n\n122\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.540\nIt's actually a cool little thought\nprocess and we'll go ahead and\n\n123\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.340\nshow you what to do right here.\n\n124\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.280\nJust give me one second,\n\n125\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.560\nI just have to make sure that I'm gonna\nbe on the right machine to demo for you.\n\n126\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.400\nSo when we take a look at this machine,\n\n127\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.720\nthis is a machine that's\nhosting our Hyper-V solution.\n\n128\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.239\nSo I've got the Hyper-V manager up and\nrunning, my PLAD DM-01 machine,\n\n129\n00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:28.750\ngot some VMs running there.\n\n130\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.140\nWe'll take a look at one, take a look\nat some things like DHCP guard,\n\n131\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.660\nrouter guard, things like that.\n\n132\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.060\nWe'll take a look at those in a little\nbit, single root I/O virtualization.\n\n133\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.110\nWe'll talk about how to enable those.\n\n134\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.250\nThose are essentially just features that\nwe activate based on the networking stack\n\n135\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.130\nin the VM.\n\n136\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.494\nBut for NIC Teaming, we're actually doing\nthis through the host, so we're gonna take\n\n137\n00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:51.440\na look at the host, and you'll see that\nwe can go into our Server Manager.\n\n138\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.984\nSo let me just bring this up here and\non the local server so\n\n139\n00:06:53.984 --> 00:06:56.130\nwe're looking at the machine itself.\n\n140\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.510\nYou'll see here NIC Teaming is one\nof the options that's available.\n\n141\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.290\nYou'll notice it's disabled right now so\nI can go in and activate it from here.\n\n142\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.250\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nbuild the team real quick.\n\n143\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nclick on the hyperlink.\n\n144\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.832\nJust do this, we'll bring up our little\nwizard, NIC Teaming wizard interface here.\n\n145\n00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:17.290\nLet me move this up so\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n146\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.260\nAnd we'll see under Teams we have\nnothing over here on the left.\n\n147\n00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.370\nActually, speaking of being on the left,\nlet me move that over just a wee bit.\n\n148\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.700\nAnd that way we can see what's going on,\nand you can see that.\n\n149\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.440\nLet's go full screen.\n\n150\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.120\nIt's a little bit hard to see that I know.\n\n151\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.260\nI'm kind of squinting trying\nto see what's on there.\n\n152\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.608\nDaniel's trying to do his\nCaptain Ahab imitation.\n\n153\n00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:37.810\nHe's trying to look and\nsee what's going on and\n\n154\n00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.990\nsee from the lights in the studio and kind\nof block that glare, what's on the screen.\n\n155\n00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.500\nSo you can see here we have available to\nbe added to a team of four adapters here.\n\n156\n00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.134\nAnd so\nwe do have the ability to create a team.\n\n157\n00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:52.447\nWe do show that there are adapters\navailable, but we have not created one.\n\n158\n00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:54.180\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n159\n00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.455\nWe go to Tasks.\n\n160\n00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.097\nPull down new team right here,\nso we could see that.\n\n161\n00:07:59.097 --> 00:08:01.332\nWe got a little ways\nthat opens up new team.\n\n162\n00:08:01.332 --> 00:08:04.086\nWe have given a name, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n163\n00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:11.838\nLet me just give this a name\nhere PlumbDM01 dash Nick team.\n\n164\n00:08:11.838 --> 00:08:16.040\nNow you could call this anything\nyou would like as most names are.\n\n165\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.662\nThis is just descriptive metadata.\n\n166\n00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:21.214\nWe don't need to worry necessarily\nabout calling it Nick team five or\n\n167\n00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:25.376\nwhatever the case maybe, what you do is\ntalk about we stock about wanna name it's\n\n168\n00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:29.752\nsomething relevant to the organisation,\nrelevant to the operating environment.\n\n169\n00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:32.260\nYou don't wanna call it\nsomething random in other words.\n\n170\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.920\nCuz you are then, we have other one team\nand may be hard to differentiate what\n\n171\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.720\nthe are and what machine they're on,\nwhat they are doing.\n\n172\n00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.570\nSo give a little fact to the naming\nconventions is what I'm suggesting to you,\n\n173\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.150\nbut it's up to you to decide\nultimately what you do there.\n\n174\n00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.660\nWe then have to choose the member\nadapters of the four that are available.\n\n175\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.510\nWe have to figure out which\nones we wanna join to the team,\n\n176\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.440\nso we're gonna go in and figure that out.\n\n177\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.540\nI'm gonna select Ethernet 1 and\nEthernet 2.\n\n178\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.477\nWe will see, by the way that\nthey're one gigabyte in speed,\n\n179\n00:08:58.477 --> 00:08:59.927\nwe could see the speed there.\n\n180\n00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:04.672\nYou'll see there have an internal\nthe V-Ethernet adapter that's 10 GB,\n\n181\n00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:06.424\nthat's gonna be running for\n\n182\n00:09:06.424 --> 00:09:11.520\nthe VMs on the Hyper-V stack, so we could\nchoose whichever ones we wanna use.\n\n183\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.000\nWe'll just grab these,\nso we're gonna get that.\n\n184\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.470\nJust look under additional\nproperties here.\n\n185\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.370\nWe'll just pull this up, give me a second.\n\n186\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.090\nJust make that a little bit higher,\njust you can see that.\n\n187\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.410\nAnd you'll see down here\nwe have teaming mode.\n\n188\n00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.780\nWe have load balancing mode,\nstandby adapter, right?\n\n189\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.410\nNone, all adapters will be active.\n\n190\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.890\nWe can specify one will be active.\n\n191\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.560\nWe'd have to have at least three\nin the stack to do this, but\n\n192\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.270\nwe could specify that, let's say one\nof them would be in stand-by mode.\n\n193\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.540\nThink of an active-passive solution\nif you're familiar with clustering.\n\n194\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.340\nThe idea would be that we have, let's\nsay two of the three or two of the four\n\n195\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.420\nin the team that are active, or three of\nthe four, whatever you want to think of.\n\n196\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.580\nOne that's in stand-by mode, and\nif one of the active ones fails,\n\n197\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.465\nthe stand-by one comes up and\njoins the team and is brought up.\n\n198\n00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:57.810\nThere's a miniscule delay\nwhile we activate that and\n\n199\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.530\nessentially put it in, so\nwe can decide how we're gonna do that.\n\n200\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.180\nThat way we're not necessarily using\nall the adapters all the time.\n\n201\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.153\nAnd we're deciding how to modify or\nmanage that.\n\n202\n00:10:08.153 --> 00:10:10.946\nWe may for\ninstance have multiple adapters that are,\n\n203\n00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:14.810\nlet's just hypothetically say for\na minute, 10 GB as opposed to 1 GB.\n\n204\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.517\nAnd we have a lower end adapter that's\nmaybe the built-in adapter on the host\n\n205\n00:10:19.517 --> 00:10:21.047\nchassis that's a 1GB.\n\n206\n00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:25.837\nTraditionally, the built-in adapters\nare gonna be 1GB whereas the adapte rs\n\n207\n00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:30.768\nyou go out and buy the high speed adapters\nfor your storage area network access, or\n\n208\n00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:34.700\naccess to your network system or\nwhatever especially the fiber or\n\n209\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.654\nfiber of ether net\nare gonna probably be 10GB.\n\n210\n00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:40.795\nThese days maybe even 40 GB,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n211\n00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:43.755\nAnd can you imagine by the way,\nthis is our random aside for\n\n212\n00:10:43.755 --> 00:10:44.785\nour episode, by the way.\n\n213\n00:10:44.785 --> 00:10:48.475\nBut we're at 40 GB most\nlikely now on the back plan,\n\n214\n00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:49.815\nespecially in the data center, right?\n\n215\n00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:52.600\nIf we're doing,\nusing data center bridging protocols.\n\n216\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.650\nIf we're doing fiber for instance,\nwe're probably running 40 GB.\n\n217\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.070\nAt least in high-end systems,\n\n218\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.300\nwe'd be running 10 to 40\nGB somewhere around there.\n\n219\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.280\nAnd that's a very small amount of\ndistance, a couple hundred feet,\n\n220\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.382\nsomething like that, but very fast, right?\n\n221\n00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:06.088\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But we're moving towards 100 GB.\n\n222\n00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:07.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n&gt;&gt; I mean on the back plan,\n\n223\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.770\non fiber for these kind of networks and\n\n224\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.030\nthat's really not even the limit,\nbecause we're moving beyond that.\n\n225\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.470\nWe'll eventually be way beyond that,\n100 GB.\n\n226\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.880\nBack in the day, right?\n\n227\n00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.580\nI remember I go back a long way, but\n\n228\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.160\nI mean I remember when we were at\nthe very, very low end of that scale.\n\n229\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:32.742\n[CROSSTALK] I remember even older networks\nthat would have run on 4 MB initially.\n\n230\n00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:35.846\nSome of the early, early, early token\nring networks that were 4 MB and\n\n231\n00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:36.892\nthen jumped to 16 MB.\n\n232\n00:11:36.892 --> 00:11:40.502\n&gt;&gt; Come quite the long way,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n233\n00:11:40.502 --> 00:11:41.039\n&gt;&gt; I have, I have.\n\n234\n00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:43.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But when I do some of this stuff and\n\n235\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.700\nI think about this, and\nI look and say, it's 1GB.\n\n236\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.140\nIt's pretty standard today.\n\n237\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.890\nEven 10 GB pretty standard depending\non the networks you're looking at.\n\n238\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.240\nBut you'll see 100 GB,\nthere are very few of them.\n\n239\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.630\nI think you would see 40 or\n\n240\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.800\n100 GB adapters when you're dealing with\nhigh-end data centers and fiber networks.\n\n241\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.200\nThat's impressive amounts to me.\n\n242\n00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.223\n&gt;&gt; We just can't move\nthe data fast enough anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.289\n&gt;&gt; And there's so much of it.\n\n244\n00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:05.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so much of it\n\n245\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.435\nis totally irrelevant that its even funny,\ncuz we're spending all this time and\n\n246\n00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:11.042\nmoney to move just ridiculous\ngarbage that nobody cares about.\n\n247\n00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:12.040\n&gt;&gt; You two on YouTube.\n\n248\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.080\n&gt;&gt; You two on YouTube,\nthat would be one thing.\n\n249\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.050\nThat's not irrelevant that's actually\nimportant, but you get my idea.\n\n250\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.290\nAnyway we digress, so\nlet's go back to what we're doing.\n\n251\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.640\nSo just showing you some\nadvance settings here, and\n\n252\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.540\nyou'll see that we can go through\nobviously and specify what we wanna do.\n\n253\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.650\nThe load balancing method here.\n\n254\n00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.240\nWe're not able to change since\nit's address hashing, but\n\n255\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.120\nthe idea is that we're going to be able\nto load balance based on the address,\n\n256\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.458\nthe hash of the address.\n\n257\n00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:40.010\nSo we're gonna take a hash\nof every adapter, and\n\n258\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.850\nthen we're gonna be able to\nload balance across that.\n\n259\n00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.000\nSo it tells us what the methodology is,\nand\n\n260\n00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.980\nwe're able to just look at\nthese additional items.\n\n261\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.306\nSo we could see these here.\n\n262\n00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:51.111\nWe're gonna go ahead create this,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n263\n00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:52.560\nGive that just a second.\n\n264\n00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.310\nWe've got that set up.\n\n265\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.090\nWe have our team there now.\n\n266\n00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.033\nAnd so once we've done that,\nWhat we're gonna do is,\n\n267\n00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:05.053\nnow let me just point something\nout as we create this.\n\n268\n00:13:05.053 --> 00:13:08.383\nYou'll see we have a warning state here,\nthis little yellow caution flag.\n\n269\n00:13:08.383 --> 00:13:10.372\nYou probably see it right there.\n\n270\n00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:14.080\nIt will take about a minute on average\nto refresh and come out of warning.\n\n271\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.250\nWe've only been talking about this,\n\n272\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.032\nprobably 15 to 30 seconds\nwhile we've been doing it.\n\n273\n00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:20.040\nIt will take about another 30 seconds,\nwe can refresh.\n\n274\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.070\nThat will go away, so\ndon't get put off by that.\n\n275\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.861\nThat's normal.\n\n276\n00:13:22.861 --> 00:13:27.092\nAs the team sets up, we bind\nthe adapters together, we reconfigure.\n\n277\n00:13:27.092 --> 00:13:28.534\nThere's a period where they're not,\n\n278\n00:13:28.534 --> 00:13:30.490\nyou can see it just changed\nwhile I was talking.\n\n279\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.239\nThere's a period where they're not\nshowing up as completely active and\n\n280\n00:13:34.239 --> 00:13:37.814\nfunctioning normally,\nwhile we're essentially reconfiguring.\n\n281\n00:13:37.814 --> 00:13:40.944\nAnd as soon as that is done, and\nthat actually takes just a few seconds.\n\n282\n00:13:40.944 --> 00:13:42.985\nBut as always, it does take some time for\n\n283\n00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:46.300\nthat to then propagate back into\nthe interface, update itself.\n\n284\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:52.261\nYou can see that while we've been talking,\nit goes from warning to okay.\n\n285\n00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:53.401\nWhite circle, green arrow.\n\n286\n00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:56.030\nAnd you could see the status,\nso I just want you to see that.\n\n287\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.753\nDon't get worried about that,\ndon't be concerned.\n\n288\n00:13:58.753 --> 00:14:02.403\nIf you saw an error there,\nbecause the bonding was not done properly.\n\n289\n00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:04.049\nThe configuration was screwed up, or\n\n290\n00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:07.502\nyou tried to bind to an adapter that was\nin a failed state or something like that.\n\n291\n00:14:07.502 --> 00:14:08.526\nThat would be different and\n\n292\n00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:11.340\nthat can happen if you're not paying\nattention to what's going on there.\n\n293\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.430\nBut something like that where we\nget a warning, no big deal at all.\n\n294\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.560\nOnce we see the okay status, and if you\ndon't see it by the way, if it doesn't\n\n295\n00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.490\nshow up right away, close the interface,\nrefresh the server manager, go back in.\n\n296\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.040\nThere are times where the server\nmanager in any interface as you know\n\n297\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.630\nmay not update automatically, there may be\na delay because of a service or an issue.\n\n298\n00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.900\nIt doesn't mean it's not working, right,\ndon't take that stuff at face value.\n\n299\n00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.860\nJust close out, go back in,\nthat alone typically forces a refresh and\n\n300\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.990\nmore often then not will fix the problem.\n\n301\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.510\nIn rare cases I've seen it not\nupdate even though we can validate\n\n302\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.960\nthat the configuration is good.\n\n303\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.050\nRestart the machine, and\n\n304\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.700\nI understand in production that\nmay be a bit of a challenge.\n\n305\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.520\nBut restart the machine, that normally\nwill clear whatever issues you have there.\n\n306\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.240\nAnd that will normally\nmake it come back up.\n\n307\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.710\nSo just come real world\nguidance about that, just so\n\n308\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.852\nyou know but we may see that occur.\n\n309\n00:14:59.852 --> 00:15:01.600\nSo I just want you to be aware of that.\n\n310\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.415\nAnd notice by the way, once we've\ndone that the available numbers of\n\n311\n00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:09.175\nadapters that are now available to add\nto an initial team has been decremented.\n\n312\n00:15:09.175 --> 00:15:12.125\nWe've gone down by two,\nbecause we've added two to the team.\n\n313\n00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:13.685\nSo then we have two available, and\n\n314\n00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:16.595\nwe now have a team that is\nsitting here ready to go.\n\n315\n00:15:16.595 --> 00:15:18.265\nWe could see the team right over here.\n\n316\n00:15:18.265 --> 00:15:20.660\nWe can right click, go in,\nlook at properties.\n\n317\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.615\nThere's nothing to look at, but\nwhat we already configured,\n\n318\n00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:24.115\nbut we certainly can see that.\n\n319\n00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:26.200\nWe do see now that status is active.\n\n320\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.520\nSo we see the two are bound together, and\n\n321\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.700\nthey are creating a Nick team force both\nactive meaning we did not standby or\n\n322\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.790\nset one to standby, we set both to active,\nboth are sending and receiving traffic.\n\n323\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.855\nSo we're able to see that set that up.\n\n324\n00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.215\nNow that's the first part of this.\n\n325\n00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:45.065\nBut if we then wanna go ahead and assign\na static IP address to the Nick team,\n\n326\n00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:46.195\nwe could do that.\n\n327\n00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.495\nYou may need to do that at some point.\n\n328\n00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:52.682\nI will freely admit I cheated a little bit\nhere, because of my mad typing skills.\n\n329\n00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:54.527\nI went ahead and\ntyped this out ahead of time,\n\n330\n00:15:54.527 --> 00:15:57.145\nbecause you don't wanna\nwatch me type in real time.\n\n331\n00:15:57.145 --> 00:15:59.406\nBut you could see,\nI just opened up a command prompt with.\n\n332\n00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:00.720\nAn admin capability there,\n\n333\n00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.122\nchange the background as we always do\njust to make it easier for you to see.\n\n334\n00:16:04.122 --> 00:16:07.758\nIn case you're wondering why it's white\nwith blue text just literally all\n\n335\n00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.345\nof a sudden, it's always that way so\nyou could see it a little bit easier.\n\n336\n00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:14.380\nNetsh is our tool of choice here,\nvery good tool.\n\n337\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.400\nIf you're not familiar with Netsh\nby the way, can't highly and\n\n338\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.080\nstrongly recommend to you enough\nthat you go read up on Netsh.\n\n339\n00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.210\nLook at the help file.\n\n340\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.780\nTake a look at what's going on in there.\n\n341\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.690\nYou've seen me use it if you were\nwatching the other episodes in\n\n342\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.170\nthis whole series of topics\naround networking with Server 16.\n\n343\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.510\nI've used it to configure and\n\n344\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.970\ndo all sorts of stuff throughout all\nthe different demos we're doing.\n\n345\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.470\nI can't think of one demo we did\nwhere I didn't use it for something.\n\n346\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.440\nEven if you didn't see me use it on camera\nas we were showing you stuff, I used it\n\n347\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.190\nbehind the scenes to configure things\nbefore we actually did the demo for you.\n\n348\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.330\nIt's such a versatile command line tool,\nbeen around forever and a day.\n\n349\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.789\nThe thing's been there since the earliest,\nearliest, earliest days of Windows.\n\n350\n00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:59.573\nAnd it's really something as a tool that\nendures because it's such an important\n\n351\n00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:02.190\ntool, but it's also such a flexible tool.\n\n352\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.418\nWe can run tools like\nthis through PowerShell.\n\n353\n00:17:04.418 --> 00:17:07.850\nSo PowerShell's capable of running\nany program that we have access to,\n\n354\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.160\nas long as it's in the path for execution.\n\n355\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.670\nSo things like Netsh and all these\ndifferent tools are still viable and\n\n356\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.900\nstill very, very important to us today.\n\n357\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.820\nSo just reminding you of that.\n\n358\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.980\nLove to see people using tools like this.\n\n359\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.610\nWe've talked about the value of\nscripting and all that kind of stuff.\n\n360\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.160\nOn Microsoft, I hear rumors that\n\n361\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.970\nthey love to ask questions about things\nlike Netsh and all sorts of tools.\n\n362\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.870\nAnd remember, it's easy to do\nsomething in the GUI, right?\n\n363\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.860\nThere's always more than one way to do\nthe same thing we're talking about with\n\n364\n00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.420\nMicrosoft.\n\n365\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.300\nUsually at least three ways, minimally,\nto achieve the same end result.\n\n366\n00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.390\nAnd they love to ask\nthose out of the blue,\n\n367\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.110\nleft field questions like hey, we could\ngo into this interface but it's broken.\n\n368\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.040\nYou need to troubleshoot.\n\n369\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.230\nIt's not working.\n\n370\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.688\nHow would you set a static IP address\non a NIC Team if you can't go in and\n\n371\n00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:52.832\ndo it this or that way?\n\n372\n00:17:52.832 --> 00:17:54.617\nWell, there's always the command line.\n\n373\n00:17:54.617 --> 00:17:57.140\nNo matter what you do,\nthat's always gonna be an option for you.\n\n374\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.900\nSo making sure you're familiar with\nthat is gonna be really important.\n\n375\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.670\nSo let's just go back here real quick.\n\n376\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:07.470\nSo Netsh interface, we had validated, or\nexcuse me, identified the interface IPv4.\n\n377\n00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.430\nSet address,\nwe're setting it for the team.\n\n378\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.320\nI named the team PLADDM01-NICKTeam.\n\n379\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.470\nSo we call it out.\n\n380\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.010\nSo the name here, the name string,\nthe value has to be the same.\n\n381\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:22.650\nStatic IP, we specify static, whatever\nwe want it to be with our subnet mask.\n\n382\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.530\nSo we've got that, we just click there.\n\n383\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.660\nWhoops, one second, hold on.\n\n384\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.670\nI forgot we're in the, There we go.\n\n385\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.410\nIn the crazy lab environment\nwhere we have to do that\n\n386\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.760\nbefore we click cuz it\ndoesn't go active otherwise.\n\n387\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.240\nAnd by the way, with Netsh, I'm sure I've\nsaid this at some point in other shows,\n\n388\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.840\nbut you don't typically\nget feedback using Netsh.\n\n389\n00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.393\nSo if you just get that command prompt\njust like I did with no error, nothing,\n\n390\n00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:47.825\nthat means it worked, right?\n\n391\n00:18:47.825 --> 00:18:51.926\nSo just understand, we're not looking at\nan interface where you're gonna get back\n\n392\n00:18:51.926 --> 00:18:54.480\nsome sort of success marker or\nsomething like that.\n\n393\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.180\nYou're looking at an interface where\nessentially it just comes back and\n\n394\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.540\ndoesn't even say, yeah, I did it.\n\n395\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.290\nIt just does it, you don't even know that.\n\n396\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.499\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n397\n00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:07.079\nAll right, so we can go in, and\nonce we've done that, we're then able to,\n\n398\n00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:10.315\nif we wanted to do something like this,\nwhat'd I do?\n\n399\n00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.493\n192.68.0.20, right?\n\n400\n00:19:12.493 --> 00:19:16.070\nSo 192.68.0.20, all right.\n\n401\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.130\nSo we can go and\njust validate that the address is working.\n\n402\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.150\nYou could see I set it there.\n\n403\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.180\nYou'll see that it is now answering.\n\n404\n00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.090\nAnd so we can see that we\nhave the NIC Team working.\n\n405\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.340\nWe get back one answer from that.\n\n406\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.430\nBut there's two adapters\nthat essentially are bound,\n\n407\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.350\nand are using that address, right?\n\n408\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.200\nCuz remember, we're now creating multiple\nmembers of that group, that essentially\n\n409\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.010\nanswer the door regardless of who knocks\non the door and where it comes from.\n\n410\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.630\nThat's the common front end.\n\n411\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.800\nThis is like the routable external\nIP on the outside of the router that\n\n412\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.550\nwill translate inbound and nats and\nunwinds all that traffic and\n\n413\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.810\ndistributes it out to whoever\nmay be sitting behind it.\n\n414\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.610\nIt's the concept of the NIC Team.\n\n415\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.670\nNot that a NIC Team is a NAT.\n\n416\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.030\nDon't want to confuse anybody.\n\n417\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.070\nJust using it as an analogy to refer to\nthe fact that that common IP would just\n\n418\n00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.470\nbound that static IP is referenced by\nall the members of the team, right?\n\n419\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.720\nAnd that's what we're talking about.\n\n420\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.190\nSo setting up a NIC Team really\nis not more involved than that.\n\n421\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.120\nYou would do this on all the hosts,\nof course,\n\n422\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.566\nthat you want to have NIC Teams on.\n\n423\n00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:13.380\nYou would add the appropriate\nnumber of adapters in, and\n\n424\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.422\nonce you've done all that, you then would\nbe able to take advantage of the NIC Team\n\n425\n00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:20.840\nand/or whatever resources you\nwanna be able to use with it.\n\n426\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.810\nSo NIC Teaming,\n\n427\n00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.400\nvery important concept, something that\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of.\n\n428\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Adam,\na really quick question about NIC Teaming.\n\n429\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.850\nIf I have a physical server,\n\n430\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.535\nI've got however many NICs\ninvolved on the NIC Teaming.\n\n431\n00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:37.320\nAnd one of them goes, dies on me or\nloses the cable connection or\n\n432\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.150\nsomething to that effect.\n\n433\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Just fails, for whatever reason.\n\n434\n00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.206\n&gt;&gt; Just fails to perform.\nDoes that kill the whole team,\n\n435\n00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:44.608\nor does it just reduce the amounts of-\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n436\n00:20:44.608 --> 00:20:46.030\nno, no, definitely will not kill the team.\n\n437\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.210\nNow if all of them fail, that would.\n\n438\n00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, obviously.\n\n439\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.050\nOn that if you only have, let's say\na two member team, and one was active,\n\n440\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.130\none was standby-\n&gt;&gt; And then, yes.\n\n441\n00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.680\n&gt;&gt; And you lost that one.\n\n442\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.580\n&gt;&gt; Then, in theory,\nyou would lose capabilities for, again,\n\n443\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.280\nit's a relatively short period of time.\n\n444\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.590\nIt depends on the hardware and\n\n445\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.880\na couple of variables that we\ndon't really go into here.\n\n446\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.480\nBut ultimately the idea would be that\nthe standby adapter would come up, and\n\n447\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.450\nit would provide continuity.\n\n448\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.490\nThere may be a very brief interruption\nof the capability to send and receive.\n\n449\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.870\nYou don't lose really anything.\n\n450\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.060\nYou're just essentially reconnected as\nsoon as the adapter comes back online.\n\n451\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.610\nBut if you were to experience\na catastrophic cascading failure, yes,\n\n452\n00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.740\nyou would lose the team.\n\n453\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.202\nBut with one or even multiple members of\na team, as long as there's at least one\n\n454\n00:21:28.202 --> 00:21:31.519\nsurviving interface that's active,\nthe team will continue to operate.\n\n455\n00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:32.803\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's just gonna be\n\n456\n00:21:32.803 --> 00:21:34.841\ndiminished in the sense\nthat if you point it out.\n\n457\n00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:35.730\n&gt;&gt; Its capacity.\n\n458\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.830\n&gt;&gt; The capacity,\nmeaning the bandwidth, would be lower.\n\n459\n00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.310\nIf you had ten members of a team,\neach at one gig, and\n\n460\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.170\nwe had them all together and essentially\nhad a ten gig connection and we lost two,\n\n461\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.060\nwe'd be down eight gigs in theory, but\nwe'd still be able to send and receive.\n\n462\n00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.730\nJust may do that a little more\nslowly than we would before.\n\n463\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, a very robust solution.\n\n464\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.800\n&gt;&gt; It is, and it has been for some time.\n\n465\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.025\nThe thing to remember there is we'd then\nhave to service that team by fixing,\n\n466\n00:22:00.025 --> 00:22:02.655\nlet's say,\nyou had that catastrophic failure adapter.\n\n467\n00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:06.235\nAnd when was the last time you saw\nan adapter fail where it actually,\n\n468\n00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:07.265\nthe hardware itself failed.\n\n469\n00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:10.835\nYou'll often see it fail where,\nlike you said, the cable comes undone,\n\n470\n00:22:10.835 --> 00:22:12.232\nsomething weird.\n\n471\n00:22:12.232 --> 00:22:15.282\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the adapter comes,\nas crazy as it is, these days,\n\n472\n00:22:15.282 --> 00:22:17.432\nagain this is one of those\ngenerational things.\n\n473\n00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:21.462\nFor you and me, and people out there\nthat may be a little bit older\n\n474\n00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:24.841\nas opposed to slightly younger, if you're\njust starting out in this business.\n\n475\n00:22:24.841 --> 00:22:28.001\nYears ago, I mean, I could vividly\nremember, I'm sure you do as well.\n\n476\n00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.791\nYou had to move a lot of boxes around,\n\n477\n00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:33.481\nwe had a lot of physical infrastructure,\nespecially data centers, right?\n\n478\n00:22:33.481 --> 00:22:37.811\nYou have a lot of stuff out on the floor\nif you're moving desktops around.\n\n479\n00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:41.491\nAnd yeah, I can remember moving stuff\naround and jarring hardware loose.\n\n480\n00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:45.402\nNetwork cards would come unbound all\nthe time in the actual chassis because\n\n481\n00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:49.500\nyou're moving that box around,\nyou're banging that stuff and carrying it,\n\n482\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.883\nand they pop out, right?\n\n483\n00:22:50.883 --> 00:22:53.746\nEven if they were screwed down,\na lot of times you'd screw them in, but\n\n484\n00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:54.478\nthey were loose.\n\n485\n00:22:54.478 --> 00:22:56.530\nYou'd have a little bit of\nplay on the back end of that.\n\n486\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.130\nAnd that thing would pop up just enough\nto essentially ride up and down,\n\n487\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.780\nand the connection would be intermittent,\nso\n\n488\n00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.690\nthe adapter would look\nlike it was failing.\n\n489\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.740\nBut it really just had to be reseated.\n\n490\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.290\nToday almost got accepted because\nalmost everything is virtualized.\n\n491\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.960\nIt's all wrapped and stacked.\n\n492\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.658\nIt's not really being moved,\nif at all, very often.\n\n493\n00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:14.336\nWe just don't really have those\nkind of issues for the most part.\n\n494\n00:23:14.336 --> 00:23:15.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's very rare, right?\n\n495\n00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:19.630\nI don't even think I can remember\nthe last time I saw a network card\n\n496\n00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:24.610\nphysically actually fail, the hardware\nitself just burn up and stop working.\n\n497\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.590\nI mean, hard drives fail.\n\n498\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.860\nWe see that certainly.\n\n499\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.720\nMemory fails, CPUs fail.\n\n500\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.630\nI can't remember the last time I saw a,\nI know adapters fail.\n\n501\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.200\nDon't get me wrong, but\n\n502\n00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.840\nI can't remember the last time I\nsaw one fail because of hardware.\n\n503\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.561\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I've seen them fail for other reasons.\n\n504\n00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:39.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm just trying to think if I've,\nI probably have seen one fail.\n\n505\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.400\n&gt;&gt; I've seen overheat scenarios where\nlike the fan's gone out on the chassis or\n\n506\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.230\nsomething like that.\n\n507\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.496\nOr for whatever reason, you have\na catastrophic failure in the cooling,\n\n508\n00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:47.294\nthe HVAC system.\n\n509\n00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:50.511\nI've seen all sorts of hardware\nfail because of overheating, but\n\n510\n00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:54.532\nnot because the hardware itself went bad,\njust because the operating environment\n\n511\n00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:58.496\nwas just Totally messed up because of the\ntemperature, so it's very rare that you\n\n512\n00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:02.459\nget adopters that do fail that's why\nteams are really a good idea but there\n\n513\n00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:06.750\nare proactive solution that addresses\na problem legitimately they can occur.\n\n514\n00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.900\nBut it's rare that that problem occurs.\n\n515\n00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.535\nIt's very often, as you were suggesting.\n\n516\n00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:11.538\n&gt;&gt; Um-huh.\n&gt;&gt; That somebody,\n\n517\n00:24:11.538 --> 00:24:15.158\nmesses something up in the stack and\nthey uncable something, right.\n\n518\n00:24:15.158 --> 00:24:18.540\nOr they cross-cable something where\nit goes to the wrong interconnect and\n\n519\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.270\nit's just not set up the right way,\nand that can be a problem.\n\n520\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.030\nBut, that's probably the,\nmore often than not,\n\n521\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.440\nthe legitimate reason\nwhy those things happen.\n\n522\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.310\nThat, and you give rights to somebody to\nadminister [LAUGH] when they don't belong\n\n523\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.860\nin there, and they disable interface.\n\n524\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's another thing that\n\n525\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.960\ntends to go wrong.\n\n526\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.470\nWe don't need that.\n\n527\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.080\nLet me just.\n\n528\n00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.963\nWhy is that on.\n\n529\n00:24:34.963 --> 00:24:36.000\nLet me get rid of that.\n\n530\n00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.070\nSo that's the kind of\nthe thing that could go wrong.\n\n531\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.980\nAll right so we talked a little bit about\nnet teaming, what about SMB, silver\n\n532\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.840\nmessage block, an oldie but a goodie,\nbeen around forever and a day as well.\n\n533\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.480\nJust no matter how hard we try to kill it,\nit's always there, it sticks around.\n\n534\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.638\nWe do have the implementation\nof SMB 3.1.1 in server 16,\n\n535\n00:24:52.638 --> 00:24:54.665\njust a newer updated version.\n\n536\n00:24:54.665 --> 00:25:00.190\n3.0 was the major leap flower\n3.11 is an incremental leap.\n\n537\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.960\nBut we do have some capabilities there.\n\n538\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.880\nWe support the AES, the Advanced\nEncryption Standard Algorithm.\n\n539\n00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.660\nThe Rijndael Algorithm rebranded as a AES,\n\n540\n00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.320\nwhen the United States Government decided\nthey were going to start using it.\n\n541\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.740\nSo we use that capability\ngives us enhanced encryption,\n\n542\n00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.580\nenhanced cryptographic\ncapabilities also we have that.\n\n543\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.880\nWe also are going to have pre\nauthentication integrity,\n\n544\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.080\nchecking using the shy algorithm for\nhashing, we use shy 5.12 for that.\n\n545\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.690\nSo that's important.\n\n546\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.990\nAnd we are able to add additional\nincremental security features,\n\n547\n00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.870\nthat give us some capabilities.\n\n548\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.780\nJust a quick hit list of some of\nthe new 3.11 features for server 16.\n\n549\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.160\nI mentioned pre-auth integrity,\nvery important.\n\n550\n00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.070\nThat helps prevent man in\nthe middle attacks, for instance,\n\n551\n00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:51.080\nbecause we're not able to spoof and\nto tap and to\n\n552\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.230\nmasquerade because of the authentication\nhappening with the integrity check.\n\n553\n00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.760\nSo if I was trying to\ntransmit to Daniel and\n\n554\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.260\nlet's say Taylor tried to get in the way\nof that, and read that traffic and\n\n555\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.200\npretend to be Daniel or pretend to be me,\nthis would prevent that.\n\n556\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.475\nUnless Taylor, our third party bad actor,\n\n557\n00:26:08.475 --> 00:26:11.740\nbecause he's always shifty guy\nyou got to watch it, right.\n\n558\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.090\nSo somebody like that,\nthey potentially, you know what it is?\n\n559\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:15.960\nIt's the beard.\n\n560\n00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's the beard.\n\n561\n00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.080\nThat's what makes you shifty,\nwhen you have a beard.\n\n562\n00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.977\nI'm saying that of course, but.\n\n563\n00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:22.530\n&gt;&gt; It's funny,\nwe were looking at him the other day.\n\n564\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.060\nHe was standing in the sunlight.\n\n565\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.690\nAnd his shadow was cast on the wall.\n\n566\n00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.310\nHe looks just like\nAbe Lincoln in his profile.\n\n567\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; He's honest Abe, man.\n\n568\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.141\nYou can't, yeah.\n\n569\n00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:32.899\n&gt;&gt; So well then we can't say he's shifty,\nand then a bad actor, so\n\n570\n00:26:32.899 --> 00:26:34.240\nwe have to pick somebody else.\n\n571\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We could pick on Peter.\n\n572\n00:26:35.577 --> 00:26:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Titus.\n&gt;&gt; Titus?\n\n573\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.202\nWe can go with Titus.\n\n574\n00:26:37.202 --> 00:26:38.623\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me get you, so\n\n575\n00:26:38.623 --> 00:26:42.236\nwhoever it may be, right If we're\ntrying to get in the middle there and\n\n576\n00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:46.280\ngrab that traffic the idea with\nthe pre-authentication integrity check is,\n\n577\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.116\nthe hash is going to have to match for\n\n578\n00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:52.220\nus to identify and allow that sender\nto unequivocally know who they are.\n\n579\n00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.460\nAnd while we can get around this\nthere are ways to break this,\n\n580\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.770\nand we talk about this in\nother episodes in other shows.\n\n581\n00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.460\nSee us for all the security stuff Daniel\nand I, Mike and I, Cherokee and I and\n\n582\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.570\nothers have done.\n\n583\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.360\n&gt;&gt; But the idea would be that\npre-authentication integrity,\n\n584\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.990\nnew to SMB 311, is going to give us\nthat enhanced capability to prevent,\n\n585\n00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.420\nor potentially prevent man-in-the-middle\nattacks, so just be aware of that.\n\n586\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.411\nThe encryption improvements I\nmentioned already, we use AES 128 bit.\n\n587\n00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:18.050\nSo that's good.\n\n588\n00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:23.050\nCluster dialect fencing, the idea of\nproviding cluster rolling updates for\n\n589\n00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.970\nour storage scale and file servers, so\nwe can patch those in a rolling way,\n\n590\n00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.950\nso we don't have to take them all down, or\nrather, excuse me, one at a time, rather.\n\n591\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.240\nBut you'll kind of roll through and\ndo a good percentage or\n\n592\n00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.930\nportion of those in real time.\n\n593\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.347\nThat's if we're running SMB, and\nwe're using it on the array.\n\n594\n00:27:40.347 --> 00:27:44.695\nWe get rid of require secure negotiate\nsetting, which is nice because this causes\n\n595\n00:27:44.695 --> 00:27:47.830\nthird-party systems to not\nbe able to work with us.\n\n596\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.220\nThe require secure negotiate, doesn't\nalways work with older versions and\n\n597\n00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.866\nthird party versions\nof SMB implementation.\n\n598\n00:27:54.866 --> 00:27:57.905\nAnd so this is something where we\ncan actually now turn this off.\n\n599\n00:27:57.905 --> 00:27:59.725\nWe disable the security negotiate feature.\n\n600\n00:27:59.725 --> 00:28:01.745\nWe have a switch that disables it.\n\n601\n00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:05.565\nAnd as a result of that, we're able\nto then broaden our availability and\n\n602\n00:28:05.565 --> 00:28:08.065\nour use of SMB across the stack,\nwhich is nice.\n\n603\n00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:11.346\nThis is like a backwards compatibility,\ninteroperability thing, so that's good.\n\n604\n00:28:11.346 --> 00:28:16.387\nAnd we have the ability to use the 3.1.1,\nin other words three character,\n\n605\n00:28:16.387 --> 00:28:20.440\nthree point notation, so\nwe can specify the exact version.\n\n606\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.290\nGives us better version matching,\nwith third party systems.\n\n607\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.910\nAllows us to more properly negotiate and\nvalidate security features and\n\n608\n00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.130\nto interact appropriately.\n\n609\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.950\nSo, this is kinda nice.\n\n610\n00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.870\nSo that's good.\n\n611\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.428\nWe also have high availability\ncapabilities with SMB that are built in.\n\n612\n00:28:35.428 --> 00:28:38.655\nWe have some remote storage enhancements\nin other words around the stack.\n\n613\n00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:42.560\nHyper-V over SMB allows us to\nstore virtual machine files,\n\n614\n00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.960\nall that kind of stuff,\non SMB file shares.\n\n615\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.990\nSo that's good, so\nwe can use the SMB file shares for that.\n\n616\n00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.670\nWe have the to be able to encrypt\nthe that we talked about.\n\n617\n00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:56.300\nSo hardening for SYSVOL and\nNetlogon connections,\n\n618\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.190\nbecause we're able to now use those with\nSMB signing and mutual authentication.\n\n619\n00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.450\nSo we're able to do that.\n\n620\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.980\nThis is in Windows 10 and Server 16, so\n\n621\n00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.590\nwe have to have the latest versions of\nthe OS running to take advantage of that.\n\n622\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.790\nBut that will add additional\ncapabilities and additional security.\n\n623\n00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.030\nSo that way it's hard for people to\npick off, that authentication traffic.\n\n624\n00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.250\nThat AD traffic that's going back and\nforth.\n\n625\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.370\nWhen was the last time you talked about\nSYSVOL and NETLOGON that is like an oldie.\n\n626\n00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That goes all the back.\n\n627\n00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.000\nWe've had that since Windows 2000.\n\n628\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.365\nThat's how we setup and\nmaintained the Active Directory.\n\n629\n00:29:25.365 --> 00:29:29.550\nNTDS.dit is in you know the SYSVOL\nfolder and all of that kind of stuff,\n\n630\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.420\nbut You don't often think about that\nunless you're doing the kind of the one on\n\n631\n00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.650\none network AD stuff you're really talk\nabout that, but that's actually out there.\n\n632\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.640\n&gt;&gt; I don't think I've had to\ndeal with that as a problem or\n\n633\n00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:47.020\nsomething that I was like that's\nthe problem, net logon 10 years.\n\n634\n00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.540\n&gt;&gt; It does just kind\nof take care of itself\n\n635\n00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.940\n&gt;&gt; Backups and things like that and\n\n636\n00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.720\neverything's good but\nwe just don't think about it that much.\n\n637\n00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI mean, back in the day-\n\n638\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.700\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, yeah.\n\n639\n00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.790\n&gt;&gt; We used to have to\nworry about it a lot more.\n\n640\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.390\nToday it's just not that big of a deal.\n\n641\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.650\nWe do have SMB multichannel as well.\n\n642\n00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.130\nThis allows us to aggregate bandwidths,\nset up fault tolerance for multi-pathing.\n\n643\n00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.340\nSo playing on that new teaming concept,\nSMB supports that,\n\n644\n00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.390\nallows us to take full advantage of that.\n\n645\n00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:13.330\nWe can run SQL server over SMB, so we can\ndo cluster SQL server support using this,\n\n646\n00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.740\nso that's good because it\nallows us to scale out.\n\n647\n00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.740\nWe can use storage spaces,\nthat's newer technology for\n\n648\n00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.430\nhighly available scalable storage\nsystems built on local storage.\n\n649\n00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.400\nEssentially the idea of, we call this\ngenerically of the poor man's sand.\n\n650\n00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.430\nRight?\nWhere you are using\n\n651\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.430\nlocally attached storage to build out\nsomething like a RAID 5 stripe set with\n\n652\n00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.040\nparody to be able to create a local\nSAN against the storage on the system.\n\n653\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.121\nInstead of paying $100,000 for\n\n654\n00:30:38.121 --> 00:30:41.920\na network-based SAN, you could use\nthe storage that's on the host's.\n\n655\n00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.876\nThis is a growing trend in\nthe industry around virtualization.\n\n656\n00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:49.510\nVMR implements this with VSAM technology,\nvirtual sand.\n\n657\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.616\nEvery vendor has something like this, and\n\n658\n00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:54.905\nstorage spaces direct is what\nMicrosoft essentially calls that.\n\n659\n00:30:54.905 --> 00:30:57.990\nCompetitive technology It's\nthe same idea of VM or VSAM.\n\n660\n00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.420\nWe can use storage\nreplicas to be able to do\n\n661\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.740\nblock level synchronist replication\nbetween servers using SMB.\n\n662\n00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.870\nTalked a bit about this when\nwe talked about DFS and\n\n663\n00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.860\nstorage replication the difference\nbetween those technologies how they work.\n\n664\n00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.005\nOne to one replication versus\nscattering that out with DFS.\n\n665\n00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:20.165\nAnd we have storage QS,\nwhich is nice, QOS quality of service\n\n666\n00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:22.885\naround the use of storage, and\nthe policy based management and\n\n667\n00:31:22.885 --> 00:31:27.005\noptimization of storage traffic,\nmonitoring end to end performance, and\n\n668\n00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:32.820\npolicies that can then can then be applied\nboth to the hyper v hosts and the scale\n\n669\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.260\nout file service in server 16 to optimize\nstorage is going to be very helpful.\n\n670\n00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.600\nSo QoS is a really good set\nof technologies and benefits.\n\n671\n00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.840\nYou've got QoS on\nthe routing side forever.\n\n672\n00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.140\nPretty standard for managing traffic,\n\n673\n00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.520\nit's not unusual to apply to different\nkinds of traffic and we're just applying\n\n674\n00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.270\nit here that allow to the storage\nstack in particular using S.M.B.\n\n675\n00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.880\nenabling us to essentially monitor,\nmanage performance, optimize.\n\n676\n00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.860\nAnd to maintain those things.\n\n677\n00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.344\nSo we have classification in\ntagging around the use of QOS,\n\n678\n00:32:03.344 --> 00:32:06.413\npriority-based flow control,\npolicy-based and\n\n679\n00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:11.520\nHyper-V-based QOS as I mentioned already,\nstorage QOS as I mentioned already.\n\n680\n00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.190\nSo we have a lot of different\ntechnologies on the QOS side,\n\n681\n00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.720\nthat allow us to take advantage\nof those capabilities.\n\n682\n00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.056\nAnd Storage QOS is the one that\nSpecific to the SMB of Thought Process.\n\n683\n00:32:22.056 --> 00:32:23.559\n&gt;&gt; Lot of interesting technology so\n\n684\n00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:26.840\nfar when it comes to some advance\nnetworking inside of Server 2016.\n\n685\n00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.890\nObviously the NIC Teaming\nthing is extremely cool.\n\n686\n00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; We can aggregate some band width and\n\n687\n00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.280\nreally jack up performance,\nthat's always a nice thing.\n\n688\n00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.670\nAnd then new features that\nthey've added onto SMB.\n\n689\n00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.810\nAnd QOS, awesome stuff.\n\n690\n00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.590\nDefinitely take a look at those things.\n\n691\n00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:43.050\nMake sure you understand each one\nof those and how they work, so\n\n692\n00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.570\nthat you can answer those pesky\nquestions that they ask us on the exam.\n\n693\n00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.570\nI just thought because I read the book\nthey were just going to give me\n\n694\n00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.130\na certification but\napparently it doesn't work that way.\n\n695\n00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.250\n&gt;&gt; It depends on the book you read.\n\n696\n00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.550\n&gt;&gt; That's true,\nit depends on the book you read.\n\n697\n00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.990\nSo this one yeah,\nthey're going to have you take an exam.\n\n698\n00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.730\nSo, be familiar with those concepts,\n\n699\n00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.660\nhave them understood in\ntheir proper priorities.\n\n700\n00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.470\nAnd that being said, Adam,\nI know you've got some more to go, but\n\n701\n00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.050\nwe are a bit out of time for this episode.\n\n702\n00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:12.615\nSo, our famous part twos, threes,\nfives, nines, and twelves,\n\n703\n00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:16.150\nas we love to do,\nwill be in the future on order.\n\n704\n00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.460\nThat being said,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n705\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.730\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n706\n00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.894\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon and together we\nmake a [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK] team.\n\n707\n00:33:23.894 --> 00:33:24.796\n&gt;&gt; All right, see you guys next time.\n\n708\n00:33:24.796 --> 00:33:25.379\nHave a good one.\n\n709\n00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:33.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n710\n00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:35.632\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I\nwas going to put on a mask and\n\n13\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.530\npretend to be Mike or somebody.\n\n14\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.500\nHave to be a little shorter,\nbut then I'd be Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.660\nBut anyway, it is going well.\n\n16\n00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.910\nHopefully, you are doing well out there.\n\n17\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.070\nAlso, we are here to talk about\na very interesting topic.\n\n18\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.030\nRounding out our conversations\naround Networking in Server 16.\n\n19\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.420\nAnd what conversation, what group\nof conversations, would be complete\n\n20\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.630\nwithout at least a nod towards the idea\nof software defined networking.\n\n21\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.930\nGonna spend some time with you,\n\n22\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.310\ngo through some of the high level thought\nprocesses around these topics, introduce\n\n23\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.220\nsome new ideas to you, something called\nthe network controller that we alluded to.\n\n24\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.100\nIn our advanced networking conversations\nfrom the prior episodes we did.\n\n25\n00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.820\nAt least talked about the theory of it.\n\n26\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.570\nIt's brand new to service 16.\n\n27\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.320\nWe'll take a look at it.\n\n28\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.140\nIt's a new role you can install.\n\n29\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.160\nAnd then you gotta manage it.\n\n30\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.710\nWe'll just talked a bit about that.\n\n31\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.670\nTalk about the ideas behind what software\ndefined networking really means,\n\n32\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.050\nboth from the perspective of just what\nis the technology, how does it work,\n\n33\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.840\nhow does it help us.\n\n34\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430\nBut also, equally importantly, how do we\nuse that and really scale that concept up\n\n35\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.830\nto automate and manage and optimize\nour networking across the private or\n\n36\n00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.650\npublic or hybrid cloud stack because the\ntechnology platform is really designed for\n\n37\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.390\nvirtualized and in this case,\ncloud based virtualized environments.\n\n38\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.440\nThat's really where we see software\ndefinition of any kind taking shape and\n\n39\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.620\nbecoming meaningful whether we\nare software defining the network,\n\n40\n00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.020\nsoftware defining the data center,\nsoftware defining storage.\n\n41\n00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.260\nAnything that we can do\ntoday we can define up and\n\n42\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.830\ndown the data center stack and up and\ndown virtualization cloud stack.\n\n43\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.940\nThrough the concept of\nsoftware definition.\n\n44\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.160\nBut the idea is that we can\napply this thought process and\n\n45\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.310\nI refer to it often as just extracting\nthe human from the mix, right.\n\n46\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.780\nWe were just chatting off camera a little\nbit about this whole idea of Planet of\n\n47\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.770\nthe Apes and how that it really was\na seminal movie at the time, the original.\n\n48\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.060\nNot the stuff you see these days because\nthe original one was much better,\n\n49\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.820\nas we both agreed.\n\n50\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.750\nBut ya know, just thinking about\nthe groundbreaking thought process behind\n\n51\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.830\na movie like that and\nwhat it meant at the time has\n\n52\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.250\nabsolutely no bearing about what we're\ntalking about here, just a random aside.\n\n53\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.380\nThere actually is a relationship\nhere if you follow my logic.\n\n54\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Connect the dots.\n\n55\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.240\n&gt;&gt; Connect the dots.\n\n56\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.100\nWhat I just gonna talk about was\nthe idea of software defined networking.\n\n57\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.285\nThis idea of trying to remove the human\nfrom the mix and really standardize and\n\n58\n00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:47.905\nautomate the thought process,\nin this case around networking or\n\n59\n00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:49.585\nstorage or whatever the case maybe.\n\n60\n00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:51.655\nBut really, removing the human and\n\n61\n00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:56.450\nresetting the environment at allowing\nus to automate and oversee and manage.\n\n62\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.590\nNot a direct correlation to Planet of the\nApes, but indirectly with the regards to\n\n63\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.490\nremoving the human and switching, or\nflipping around the narrative around that.\n\n64\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.150\nYou can kind of connect the dots.\n\n65\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.890\nYou doubted I could\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.053\n&gt;&gt; I actually, I did reach for\n\n67\n00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:09.830\nthat connection.\n\n68\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.106\n&gt;&gt; Well played sir, well played.\n\n69\n00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:13.103\n&gt;&gt; It is a tenuous one,\nbut it is one nonetheless.\n\n70\n00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:14.046\n&gt;&gt; We'll give it to you.\n\n71\n00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:14.878\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate that.\n\n72\n00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:17.095\nIt was a hard one to figure\nout how to make work but\n\n73\n00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:19.090\nit did hopefully come together for it.\n\n74\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.300\nBut let's actually talk about software\nto find our working from standardized\n\n75\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.820\nperspective.\n\n76\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.780\nYou join me here because the minute\nprobably the place to go to\n\n77\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.200\nbegin our conversations.\n\n78\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.880\nAnd by the way,\nas always this URL is in the shown it for\n\n79\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.740\nencourage you to go out, take a look.\n\n80\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.630\nThe open networking foundation probably\nthe best site out there on the internet to\n\n81\n00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.070\ntalk about Software-Defined Networking and\nreally give you a standardized definition.\n\n82\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.750\nHelp you to understand what\nsoftware defined networking is.\n\n83\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.480\nThe idea here and we talk about it and\nit is what is SDN.\n\n84\n00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.060\nIf you go full screen you can\nprobably see the one statement.\n\n85\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.050\nI'm just going to highlight it there for\nyou for a minute.\n\n86\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.760\nNot that you can see it any\nbetter when I do that but\n\n87\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.360\nif I do that you hopefully can.\n\n88\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.760\nPhysical separation in the network control\nplane from the forwarding plane and\n\n89\n00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.980\nwhere a control plane\ncontrols several devices.\n\n90\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.970\nReally what we mean by that ultimately\nis the idea of being about to create\n\n91\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.040\na directly programmable, and agile,\ncentrally managed, programmatically\n\n92\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.500\nconfigured and open standards and\nneutral or vender neutral based solution.\n\n93\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.700\nThat allows us to standardize\nthe way we configure and\n\n94\n00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.630\ndeploy networking technology.\n\n95\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.200\nAllows us to replicate and\nautomate that process.\n\n96\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.280\nSo that almost at a push of a button, with\nminimal to little additional oversight and\n\n97\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.410\ninteraction from one or more people\ninvolved, being able to then deploy\n\n98\n00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.200\ncontinuously and replicate that\ndeployment in a standardized way.\n\n99\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.090\nAnd to as a result, minimize errors,\nmaximize our scalability,\n\n100\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.220\nour ability to scale quickly, scale up,\n\n101\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.540\nscale out, or scale down depending\non what we're doing around cloud and\n\n102\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.620\nvirtualization, but to replicate and\nstandardize that configuration so\n\n103\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.650\nthat the first time, the 20th time,\nthe 100th time, it's gonna be the same.\n\n104\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.920\nThat's really what software defining\nanything will be regardless of what we're\n\n105\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.780\ndoing, is the idea of being able to come\nup with the best configuration solution.\n\n106\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.590\nFreeze it, capture it,\nand then reproduce it.\n\n107\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.610\nUsually with some sort of scripting or\nelement involved to automate that process\n\n108\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.850\nin some sort of a push button\nlike deployment or fashion or\n\n109\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.590\nwhatever that maybe.\n\n110\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.140\n&gt;&gt; I'll add more.\n\n111\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.580\nWhat we're talking about here is just\nbasically saying, okay, I need this to be\n\n112\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.520\nnetworked and I Ccick a button and it\nsays, okay, networking is now configured.\n\n113\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.420\nBecause it's always done\nthe same way every time.\n\n114\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Very similar, not quite exactly.\n\n115\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.710\nIt's not let's push this\nbig red button right here.\n\n116\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.140\n&gt;&gt; That says, network my system.\n\n117\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Let me get this right.\n\n118\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.640\nThis button right, whoop, where is it?\n\n119\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.890\n&gt;&gt; Almost there.\n&gt;&gt; Right there,\n\n120\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.315\npush that button right there.\n\n121\n00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:40.893\n[SOUND] Wait, I did it the wrong way.\n\n122\n00:05:40.893 --> 00:05:41.920\nAnyway Get the idea.\n\n123\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.290\nPush that button right there and\nwe get an error.\n\n124\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar, it's not\n\n125\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Not quite sound.\n\n126\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.210\n&gt;&gt; I don't mean to make it sound overly\nsimplistic than what it really is.\n\n127\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.690\nIt's not a push button solution literally.\n\n128\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.920\nWhat we mean is using technologies and\ntools like PowerShell,\n\n129\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.080\nwe've talked a lot about this.\n\n130\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And scripting out and\n\n131\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.350\nautomating the deployment through\ntemplating and cloning and the use of\n\n132\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.415\na scripting language like Power Shell to\nbe able to automate our provisioning.\n\n133\n00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:07.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So a real world example of this\n\n134\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.050\nwould be and we do this all the time\nin cloud and virtual environments.\n\n135\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.470\nLet's say that you want to spin\nup three server instances.\n\n136\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.510\nMaybe server 16 instances we need to\ndefine them to make into file servers,\n\n137\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.790\nor web servers, or\nwho knows what that'll be.\n\n138\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.330\nInstead of the old fashion way.\n\n139\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.520\nWhen I say old fashion way,\nyou know, one generation ago.\n\n140\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.900\n10 to 15 years ago, which is a lifetime\nin our discussions around networking.\n\n141\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.330\nWhen we would build these by hand,\nsomebody would sit down and\n\n142\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.010\ninstall physical hardware.\n\n143\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.500\nYou would configure and\ncraft each machine.\n\n144\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.120\nYou may have a standardized\nbuild guide that you would use.\n\n145\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.590\nBut it was all done by hand and somebody,\n\n146\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.510\nwhoever that was,\nwas in charge of doing that.\n\n147\n00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.000\nIf three different people\nbuilt those serves,\n\n148\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.830\nat built them at different times they may\nnot turn out exactly the same way, right.\n\n149\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.850\nThe naming convention may or\nmay not have been followed properly.\n\n150\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.970\nThe configuration of services and\n\n151\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.500\nadd ons and whatever the case may be\nmay or may not have been standardized.\n\n152\n00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.440\nAnd we would have had slight variances,\nright.\n\n153\n00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240\nSo we would expect that not\neverything would be identical.\n\n154\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.150\nWhen we get into the idea of software\ndefining something we would create what we\n\n155\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.240\ngenerically call a template, today.\n\n156\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.010\nSo a baseline,\nif you wanna think of it that way.\n\n157\n00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.260\nAnother word that often is used here.\n\n158\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.015\nAnd the template or the baseline\nwould say here's the configuration\n\n159\n00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.825\nthat we expect this machine to have.\n\n160\n00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:26.295\nYou would then apply that base line or\napply that template,\n\n161\n00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:29.165\nand you would deploy instances from there.\n\n162\n00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:32.500\nAnd those instances should all be\nthe same, regardless of whose hands\n\n163\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.110\nOn the button who hits start or\ntypes and go or whatever.\n\n164\n00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.630\nIt should come out the same way.\n\n165\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.310\nNow, we've been able to automate\nthe appointments for many,\n\n166\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.790\nmany cycles now on a 10.txt,\non a 10.xml to do scripted and or\n\n167\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.480\nautomated appointments of Windows through\nwe talked about older technology risks,\n\n168\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.780\nremote install services, newer versions,\nWDS when its deployment services.\n\n169\n00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.794\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n170\n00:07:56.794 --> 00:08:00.287\nThis goes all the way back to NT4,\nwe could script and automate.\n\n171\n00:08:00.287 --> 00:08:02.137\nWasn't the same thing\nas software defining.\n\n172\n00:08:02.137 --> 00:08:04.371\nBut it was the precursor technology and\n\n173\n00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:08.440\nthe thought processes around it\nthat really allowed us to do that.\n\n174\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.450\nBut again,\nsomebody had to write that answer file.\n\n175\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.240\nSomebody had to then\ndeploy that answer file.\n\n176\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.790\nAnd if five different people\ndeployed that file and\n\n177\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.900\ndidn't deploy it the same exact way,\nyou would get different results.\n\n178\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.920\nSo the technology in one form or\nanother has been there for awhile.\n\n179\n00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.360\nBut the idea of software defining, I enjoy\ntaking this to the next level through\n\n180\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.310\nlarge scale automation and\nstandardization across the networking.\n\n181\n00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.634\nAnd as well literally, across the data\ncenter stack today, we're bringing this\n\n182\n00:08:35.634 --> 00:08:39.457\nidea of automation and standardization\nout of the shadows, out of the,\n\n183\n00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:43.358\nhey let me just deploy the OS, into\nthe let me configure the entire stack.\n\n184\n00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:47.498\nAnd standardize the way we do that with\nusually unattended scripted installs that\n\n185\n00:08:47.498 --> 00:08:50.386\nwill reproduce that across\nour management interfaces.\n\n186\n00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:53.770\nThrough SCVMM,\nSystem Central Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n187\n00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.018\nSystem Center Config Manager, SCCM,\nthrough System Center Ops Manager.\n\n188\n00:08:59.018 --> 00:08:59.860\nIn the VMware world,\n\n189\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.870\neven though we're here to talk about\nMicrosoft, with V Center with Power CLI.\n\n190\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.915\nThe PowerShell scripted enabled language\nand the command line interface and VMware.\n\n191\n00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:13.315\nAny of those interfaces,\nany of those technologies, in Citrix,\n\n192\n00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:16.545\nin the Zen platform,\nWe could do this across interfaces.\n\n193\n00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:20.825\nCisco has led the charge for software\ndefining in the networking stack and\n\n194\n00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:23.825\nin the data center stack and all\nthe other vendors have really fallen in\n\n195\n00:09:23.825 --> 00:09:26.265\nline over the last decade or\nso and followed suit.\n\n196\n00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:30.025\nSo, this is not an old thought process or\na new thought process.\n\n197\n00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:33.240\nIt's an ongoing maturing of technology and\nthought processes.\n\n198\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.153\nIt's been around for decades at this\npoint in terms of scripting and\n\n199\n00:09:36.153 --> 00:09:37.132\nall things that we do.\n\n200\n00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:42.500\nSo, it is important to consider what do we\nneed to be able to do this in Server 16.\n\n201\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.121\nWhat we need to be running server 16.\n\n202\n00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:46.190\nSo, certainly we want to have that there.\n\n203\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.030\nWe need the Hyper-V role enabler\nbecause remember we are focusing on\n\n204\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.500\nvirtualization, we're focusing on cloud\nbased infrastructure traditionally.\n\n205\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.550\nYou have to have an external\nHyper-V virtual switch available\n\n206\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.870\nwith at least one physical adapter\nleading out to the outside world\n\n207\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.220\nto be able to do the networking-specific\nversion of software defining.\n\n208\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.210\nAnd you have to have the ability to be\nable to manage the VMs that are running,\n\n209\n00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:07.920\nstandard stuff.\n\n210\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.420\nYou deploy Hyper-V on Server 16 today,\nyou've got all the bells and whistles and\n\n211\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.380\nall the building blocks already available.\n\n212\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.540\nAnd we've shown you most of this in\nother discussions, other demonstrations,\n\n213\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.415\nother areas, as we've been running\nthrough and talking about the technology.\n\n214\n00:10:20.415 --> 00:10:23.921\nWhat I wanna do is just delve\na little deeper into what is there.\n\n215\n00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:28.088\nWhat are some of the building blocks, what\nare some of the pieces associated with how\n\n216\n00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:31.265\nwe would do or plan for and\ndeploy a software-defined network?\n\n217\n00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:36.432\nAnd so if you join me here, planning\na software-defined network infrastructure.\n\n218\n00:10:36.432 --> 00:10:38.192\nAgain, URLs are in the show notes.\n\n219\n00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:41.522\nI encourage you to go take a look, that\nway you could do a little more research.\n\n220\n00:10:41.522 --> 00:10:42.482\nDo your due diligence,\n\n221\n00:10:42.482 --> 00:10:45.586\nread up and follow the links to\nwhatever you're interested in.\n\n222\n00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:50.437\nBut you can see here that we do have\na nice site specific to Windows Server 16.\n\n223\n00:10:50.437 --> 00:10:53.876\nThe prereqs are here, the physical\nnetwork, the physical compute host.\n\n224\n00:10:53.876 --> 00:10:57.056\nThat's just the generic host\nthat we install Server 16 on,\n\n225\n00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.696\nrun Hyper-V on top of.\n\n226\n00:10:58.696 --> 00:11:02.626\nPhysical network configuration, so\ntalks to us about what we need here.\n\n227\n00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:05.086\nNotice that for instance,\nimportant to know,\n\n228\n00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:09.346\nServer 16 SDN supports IPv4 addressing for\nthe under and overlay.\n\n229\n00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:13.920\nMeaning the networks that we're using,\nIPv6 is not supported currently.\n\n230\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.010\nIt's not to say that in the future,\nwe can't do that.\n\n231\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.020\nBut it is to say that right now,\nIPv4 support is supported or\n\n232\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.210\nIPv support is there, and\nwe could do software to find network and\n\n233\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.275\ncross our IPv4 interfaces, not with IPv6.\n\n234\n00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:29.831\nMaybe important to know that\nwith regards to things like,\n\n235\n00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:34.341\nI don't know, questions perhaps come\nup in the future, you never know.\n\n236\n00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.830\n&gt;&gt; We did a survey about things\nthat you may wanna know.\n\n237\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.251\n&gt;&gt; I just heard rumors that those\nkinds of things tend to show up,\n\n238\n00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:41.960\nthat's all I’m suggesting.\n\n239\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.150\nBut I can't verify or deny those rumors.\n\n240\n00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.421\nI can simply just point them out to you.\n\n241\n00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:48.520\nManagement and HVN, HNV rather.\n\n242\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.415\nWe see this Hyper-V Network Virtualization\njust so you know what the acronyms are.\n\n243\n00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:56.491\nSo, when we're talking about Hyper-V\nNetwork Virtualization, we're talking\n\n244\n00:11:56.491 --> 00:12:00.521\nabout the ability to be able to use the\nvirtualized network environment, NVGRE.\n\n245\n00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:04.470\nWe'll talk about Network Virtualization\nusing Generic Routing Encapsulation.\n\n246\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.460\nAnd talk about some of the technologies\nthat support this over\n\n247\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.600\nthe next few minutes.\n\n248\n00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.610\nBut you'll see here we\nneed our management and or\n\n249\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.640\nprovider logical networks,\npretty standard once we set that up.\n\n250\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.069\nWe have the ability to able to just take\na look that shows a sample topology,\n\n251\n00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.380\nwhat would it look like.\n\n252\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.770\nThere's our management network,\nthere's a subnet,\n\n253\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.348\nthere's our VLAN ID that just show us what\nthese kind of things would look like.\n\n254\n00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:26.660\nThere's our Hyper-V Network virtualized.\n\n255\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.960\nProvider network.\n\n256\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.490\nNeed your logical networks,\nyour SLB, software load balancers.\n\n257\n00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.610\nRemember we talked about some of this\ntechnology in the advanced networking\n\n258\n00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.150\nconversations from prior episodes.\n\n259\n00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.880\nIf you haven't seen those,\ngo back and take a look.\n\n260\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.950\nWe talked about NIC Teaming.\n\n261\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.610\nWe talked about all the different\nthings associated with this.\n\n262\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.960\nTalked about the different technologies\nthat enable load balancing.\n\n263\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.193\nWe talked about RSS and\nall the different ways in which we can\n\n264\n00:12:48.193 --> 00:12:51.827\nuse these networking technologies\nto enable better management.\n\n265\n00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:55.026\nSo, it would be helpful for you to just\nbe thinking about those things and\n\n266\n00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:56.480\nbring them forward.\n\n267\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.780\nThe RAS Gateway, we'll have some more to\nsay about this towards the end of our\n\n268\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.530\nconversations in this group of episodes.\n\n269\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.890\nMeaning there will be a part two, so\n\n270\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.310\nstay tuned because we're\ngonna have more than one.\n\n271\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.435\nBut we'll talk about the RAS Gateway,\nwhy it's so important and\n\n272\n00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:12.585\nthe scenarios associated\nwith RAS Gateway usage.\n\n273\n00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:18.026\nI did a whole set of conversation early on\nin this area for Server 16 networking for\n\n274\n00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:21.758\n741 with Cherokee on remote\naccess services on RAS and\n\n275\n00:13:21.758 --> 00:13:23.485\nhow to set everything up.\n\n276\n00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:26.672\nBut we didn't talk about specifically\nabout some scenario for gateway usage.\n\n277\n00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:29.812\nAnd we'll bring that conversation\nback here and loop it back in and\n\n278\n00:13:29.812 --> 00:13:32.072\ncomplete the life cycle\nthere around the network.\n\n279\n00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:33.642\nOkay, so\nwe've got all the different things.\n\n280\n00:13:33.642 --> 00:13:39.060\nThe virtual IPs that are created that\nwe can use, both public and private.\n\n281\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.356\nWe'll talk about this extensively.\n\n282\n00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.913\nAnd actually, if you want to\ngo deeper into some of this.\n\n283\n00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:48.105\nGoing back and taking a look at\nthe MCOC private cloud shows that\n\n284\n00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:52.694\nwe did specifically for\nthe System Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n285\n00:13:52.694 --> 00:13:58.336\nthe 7247 which is the networking and\nconfiguration and monitoring was 246.\n\n286\n00:13:58.336 --> 00:14:01.552\nAnd the 247 was actually around\nSCVMM content, the networking,\n\n287\n00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:05.310\nsetting up the virtual switches,\nthe virtual networks, all that stuff.\n\n288\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.250\nDo a very, very good deep dive on all\nthese things and where they come from.\n\n289\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.337\nThat group of shows will actually put\na lot of this into perspective for you and\n\n290\n00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:13.584\nhelp you to go a little deeper.\n\n291\n00:14:13.584 --> 00:14:16.930\nSo, you may want to just take a look at\nthat and walk through the library there.\n\n292\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.910\nBut we've got all the different pieces and\n\n293\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.442\nthey just walk us through\nwhat the networks look like.\n\n294\n00:14:21.442 --> 00:14:23.510\nThe routing infrastructure here.\n\n295\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.820\nThere is a set of scripts that can be\nused, they reference number right there.\n\n296\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.900\nIf you're deploying your SDM\ninfrastructure using scripts and\n\n297\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.640\nthe scripts are gonna be downloaded,\nand it's interesting.\n\n298\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.155\nMicrosoft's really gone towards more\nof the open source solution lately.\n\n299\n00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:39.670\nThey're really starting to play\nnice with everybody around them.\n\n300\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.035\nAnd these scripts,\nwhich are all preconfigured available,\n\n301\n00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:42.998\nare out there in GitHub.\n\n302\n00:14:42.998 --> 00:14:47.225\nYou can actually go ahead and download\nthem all and you can then actually get a,\n\n303\n00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:49.154\nliterally an SDN solution in a box.\n\n304\n00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.970\nYou've got a whole set of\npreconfigured scripts.\n\n305\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.290\nYou just plug in the variables that you\nneed for your own localization of this and\n\n306\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.206\nyou can throw out and\ndeploy the entire SDN solution.\n\n307\n00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:00.103\nSo, it's kind of nice\nbecause you can go out and\n\n308\n00:15:00.103 --> 00:15:02.020\ndownload all this stuff right from there.\n\n309\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.220\nI think there's actually a download link\nsomewhere towards the bottom here for\n\n310\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.440\nthe scripts if I remember correctly.\n\n311\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.430\nThere may or may not be.\n\n312\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.820\nI may have to go to a different one, but\nthey give you some nice graphics here\n\n313\n00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.550\njust around how this is all gonna\nplay out what it looks like.\n\n314\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.447\nThe Network Controller role on\nhow you're gonna set up and\n\n315\n00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:21.530\ndeploy the Network Controller, which is\ngonna be the centralized interface that\n\n316\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.501\nallows us to link to things like SCVMM.\n\n317\n00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:27.441\nOr a System Center Configuration Manager\nor whatever and actually manage and deploy\n\n318\n00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:31.180\nthe networking and to monitor all the host\nand the VMs and all that kind of stuff.\n\n319\n00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.220\nI'm gonna show you how to install the\nNetwork Controller role on a server here.\n\n320\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.060\nThis is a quick hands-on demo,\nit's very straight forward.\n\n321\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.397\nAnd I'll talk about the PowerShell cmdlets\nwith associated management of it in\n\n322\n00:15:41.397 --> 00:15:44.500\na couple of minutes, but we could see\nthe deployment capabilities here.\n\n323\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.730\nSo just give us some nice information.\n\n324\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.760\nYeah, the Microsoft SDN GitHub\nrepository right here.\n\n325\n00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.010\nThis is where the models,\nthe vendor information for switches and\n\n326\n00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.471\nthe deployment scripts are.\n\n327\n00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:58.472\nSo, there's a link right there\nwhere you can download everything I\n\n328\n00:15:58.472 --> 00:16:01.384\nwas just talking about,\nyou can go out to the GitHub repository.\n\n329\n00:16:01.384 --> 00:16:05.132\nLet's just, Go there real quickly,\nand you can see,\n\n330\n00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:10.220\nyou've got a Cisco nexus switch,\nthe Dell force switch there as well.\n\n331\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.470\nThere's all this different\nstuff that you can get, and\n\n332\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.260\nyou can get some configuration\nexamples right from here.\n\n333\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.660\nSo it's nice that they've got all this\nstuff just sitting right out there for\n\n334\n00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.010\nyou, and there's other scripts as well.\n\n335\n00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.940\nYou just have to follow\nthe links to grab them.\n\n336\n00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.380\nSo they just have you walk through and\nset this all up.\n\n337\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.780\nThe host compute requirements,\npretty straightforward.\n\n338\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.830\nPhysical Hyper-V host,\nwhatever will be used to run Server 16.\n\n339\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.280\nSo there's not a lot of mystery there.\n\n340\n00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.150\nYou just need to have Hyper-V and\n\n341\n00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.370\nobviously enough resources\nto be able to host VMs.\n\n342\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.870\nSo enough CPU, enough RAM,\nenough storage, enough networking.\n\n343\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.090\nBut very basic, you'll see there.\n\n344\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.290\nAnd then the infrastructure\nvirtual machine role requirements.\n\n345\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.340\nFor the network controller you need\nto have 4 virtual CPUs available,\n\n346\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.240\n4 gigs of RAM, 8 gigs required.\n\n347\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.740\nSo you can figure that out.\n\n348\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.210\n75 gigs overall for\ndisk space just on the OS.\n\n349\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.760\nFor the SLB, the software load balancer,\nmultiplexer, again 8 virtual CPUs.\n\n350\n00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.750\nYou can just kind of walk down the list,\nsee all the various pieces,\n\n351\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.010\nthe RAS Gateway.\n\n352\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.140\nAnd you set all this up.\n\n353\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.920\nThere's not a lot of stuff here\nthat's really complicated.\n\n354\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.338\nIt's a matter of understanding all\nthe build-out requirements and\n\n355\n00:17:12.338 --> 00:17:15.089\nthen how you're gonna set that up and\nhost those if they're virtual, more and\n\n356\n00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.648\nmore of this today is\nbeing done virtually.\n\n357\n00:17:16.648 --> 00:17:18.960\nSo a lot of this will be virtual machines.\n\n358\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.770\nAnd so they've got the minimum\nhardware requirements here, right, so\n\n359\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:22.670\nyou can see that.\n\n360\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.280\nDon't let some of the links here about\nthings like the preview throw you off.\n\n361\n00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.220\nSome of this stuff may have been\nwritten as Server 16 was just\n\n362\n00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.606\ngetting ready to be released.\n\n363\n00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:33.930\nSystem Center 2016 was getting\nready to be released, and\n\n364\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.780\nthose links just may not have been\nupdated to final release product.\n\n365\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.820\nBut the information on stuff like hardware\nrequirements minimum is got to be the same\n\n366\n00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.329\nwhether it's a tactical preview,\nrelease candidate or the final product.\n\n367\n00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:47.152\nThose things don't really change\nonce you get to that point.\n\n368\n00:17:47.152 --> 00:17:50.811\nSo some of that stuff may not necessarily\nbe quote and quote the most recent when\n\n369\n00:17:50.811 --> 00:17:53.928\nyou look at the link but\nit actually will be accurate information.\n\n370\n00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:54.940\nJust as you know.\n\n371\n00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.560\nSo we have the capability to go in there.\n\n372\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.410\nIt also tells us how to deploy the\nsoftware to find networking controller.\n\n373\n00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.850\nI'm gonna take a look at how\nto do that in just a minute.\n\n374\n00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.458\nBut you can go in here and\nyou can see how to set that up.\n\n375\n00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:10.260\nAnd then Hyper-V Network Virtualization\non server 16, again, don't\n\n376\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.780\nlet the information here throw you\noff in one direction or another.\n\n377\n00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.870\nAgain something might reference earlier\nversions of Server 16 before it\n\n378\n00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.640\nwas released.\n\n379\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.370\nNo big deal,\nit's all gonna be accurate and up to date.\n\n380\n00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.810\nYou can see they've got a nice\nlittle just graphic here, right.\n\n381\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.810\nThe server virtualization over\nthe Hyper-V Network Virtualization.\n\n382\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.460\nBeing able to run the physical network,\nand\n\n383\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.550\nthen all the different infrastructure\nit's gonna virtualize out for us.\n\n384\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.030\nSo the concepts are here.\n\n385\n00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.940\nThe reason I like this particular one\nis it walks you through the logic\n\n386\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.870\nof defining some of the terms if\nyou're not familiar with them.\n\n387\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.740\nWhat's the management in Hyper-V Network\nVirtualization provider, logical network?\n\n388\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.480\nIf you're not familiar with those things,\nwe'll walk you through there.\n\n389\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.520\nWhat are the logical\nnetworks that we need?\n\n390\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.260\nWhat are the different kinds\nof gateways that exists for\n\n391\n00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.030\nthe software load balancer?\n\n392\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.770\nWe have the transit logical network,\nthe public virtual IP and\n\n393\n00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.520\nprivate virtual IP networks.\n\n394\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.522\nSo you'll see those.\n\n395\n00:19:00.522 --> 00:19:04.451\nThe jury VIP logical network,\nvirtual IP network for generic routing and\n\n396\n00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:05.500\ncapsulation.\n\n397\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.010\nWe go through and document all that and\ntalk about what they are, so\n\n398\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.515\nyou have the capabilities or\n\n399\n00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:14.037\nthe knowledge to extract and\nunderstand all the building blocks.\n\n400\n00:19:14.037 --> 00:19:17.698\nYou've got the routing infrastructure,\nthe default gateways,\n\n401\n00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:22.141\nwalks you through the logic of making sure\nthat we understand how all those things\n\n402\n00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.970\ncome together really helps us to see\nall the moving parts and pieces.\n\n403\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.240\nSo let me just scroll down over here for\njust a second.\n\n404\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.280\nSo you could see all of this virtual\nnetwork, talks about the virtual subnets.\n\n405\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.300\nGot a lot of nice diagrams in here.\n\n406\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.730\nShows you where things are.\n\n407\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.700\nShows you how they're labeled,\nright, and what's going on with them.\n\n408\n00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.350\nSo it's a really good overview.\n\n409\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.080\nTalks about layer II forwarding.\n\n410\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.430\nLayer III routing as in the OSI model.\n\n411\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.020\nAll the things you just wanna know and\nmake sure you're aware of.\n\n412\n00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.880\nGets into switching and\n\n413\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.175\nrouting specifically,\nwalks you through the implementation here.\n\n414\n00:19:52.175 --> 00:19:55.820\nAll right, so it's gonna give you\nall the information that you need\n\n415\n00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.730\nin order to better understand\nthe logic of this, and to better\n\n416\n00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.810\nunderstand just the thought process behind\ngenerically software defined networking.\n\n417\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.590\nSDN is one of those things that's coming.\n\n418\n00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.870\nIt's much like PowerShell.\n\n419\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.120\nWe often talk about it as being something\nthat's an emerging technology, and\n\n420\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.500\nindeed being something that's here and\n\n421\n00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.980\nsomething we encourage you to spend\nmore time on and learn more about.\n\n422\n00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.130\nThis is the future, and\n\n423\n00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.400\nthis is the kind of thing that\nultimately you need to learn more about.\n\n424\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.180\nBecause starting with Server 16 going\nforward, we're gonna see more and\n\n425\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.190\nmore of this, and less and\nless of traditional manually defined,\n\n426\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.270\nor persondefined networking that's done\nthe old fashion way where you're in there\n\n427\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.530\nhacking away at stuff and\ndefining everything as you go.\n\n428\n00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.048\nSo this is all gonna come from\na series of configuration scripts.\n\n429\n00:20:37.048 --> 00:20:40.790\nYou literally [INAUDIBLE] push a couple\nof buttons, type a couple of things, and\n\n430\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.100\nout pops the network.\n\n431\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.885\nAnd if you've gone through and used\nSCVMM and set up a service template, and\n\n432\n00:20:46.885 --> 00:20:49.600\ndeployed that to them with\na hardware profile to actually\n\n433\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.350\ndeploy a network solution.\n\n434\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.768\nYou see as I suggest it, if you go and\n\n435\n00:20:53.768 --> 00:20:58.830\nwatch the MCCE Cloud 7247\ncontent that we put together,\n\n436\n00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.600\nyou see me do all these things in demos\nand walked through the logic of that.\n\n437\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.288\nIf you've done any of that, you've\ndone software-defined networking and\n\n438\n00:21:06.288 --> 00:21:08.830\nsoftware-defined management\nat the stack level.\n\n439\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.000\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing here.\n\n440\n00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.520\nMore and more of this infrastructure\nis running virtualized.\n\n441\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.753\nAnd regardless of vendor,\nthe concepts are the same.\n\n442\n00:21:17.753 --> 00:21:21.260\nMicrosoft doesn't have a lock on software\ndefined networking as I suggested as\n\n443\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.872\nwe started this conversation but they are\ncertainly helping to lead the charge and\n\n444\n00:21:24.872 --> 00:21:27.562\nspread the knowledge around\nhow this is being implemented.\n\n445\n00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:29.923\nAnd this technology is being\npushed more and more front and\n\n446\n00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:31.560\ncenter to everything we do.\n\n447\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.270\nBecause more and more of our\ninfrastructure is being virtualized,\n\n448\n00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.130\nmore and more of it is being\nmanaged in these environments.\n\n449\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.220\nAnd as a result, these skills become very,\nvery important for us.\n\n450\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.990\nSo it is something to be aware of.\n\n451\n00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.380\n&gt;&gt; Adam, it looks like I have some\nlinks to follow and reading to do.\n\n452\n00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.190\nDefinitely gave me my homework for\ntoday, that's for\n\n453\n00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.900\nsure because this is some\nvery interesting technology.\n\n454\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.800\nAnd like you said, it is the future.\n\n455\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.310\nThis is the way people are doing a lot\nof different things inside of IT, and\n\n456\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:00.510\nit was just a natural progression to say,\nwhy aren't we doing that with networking?\n\n457\n00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.380\nI don't know, why not?\n\n458\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.930\nAnd they started answering\nthat question with,\n\n459\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.760\nthere is no good reason\nwe shouldn't do that.\n\n460\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.620\nLet's start implementing it.\n\n461\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.470\nAnd now you're seeing it come to\nfruition here inside of Server 2016,\n\n462\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.930\nvery, very cool stuff.\n\n463\n00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.520\nAdam, anything else we need to go over?\n\n464\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.585\nI know that we've got\n[CROSSTALK] demonstration\n\n465\n00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:19.170\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Sure, well, there are some other topics\n\n466\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.626\nwhere I think maybe for a part II, we're\ngonna talk a little bit more about we\n\n467\n00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:25.870\njust wanna peel back the layer with SDN,\nkinda put that in context.\n\n468\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:26.680\nBut there's some other stuff.\n\n469\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.030\nNetwork virtualization,\nas I alluded to overall.\n\n470\n00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.330\nSpecifically NVGRE, network virtualization\ngeneric routing encapsulation,\n\n471\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.200\nwhat a customer and provider address is.\n\n472\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.530\nYou may or\nmay not have heard of these things.\n\n473\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.620\nWe're gonna go talk a little\nbit more about them.\n\n474\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.330\nWe'll go through that.\n\n475\n00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.860\nI wanna show you how to install and\ndeal with the network controller role, so\n\n476\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.940\nwe're gonna walk you through\na little bit around that.\n\n477\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.685\nTalk about the RAS gateway\nusage scenarios, mention those,\n\n478\n00:22:47.685 --> 00:22:48.802\ngotta go through those.\n\n479\n00:22:48.802 --> 00:22:52.020\nSo definitely enough material to come\nback and have at least a part II.\n\n480\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n481\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.470\nI think definitely wanna save those\nthings and entice you to come on back.\n\n482\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Spend some more time with\n\n483\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.280\nus to wrap that up.\n\n484\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.240\nSo that's what we're gonna talk about.\n\n485\n00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.239\n&gt;&gt; Dangle the carrot out in front\nof the audience as it were.\n\n486\n00:23:01.239 --> 00:23:02.226\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n487\n00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:06.050\n&gt;&gt; That virtual carrot.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's not a real carrot.\n\n488\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.060\n&gt;&gt; It's purple slime.\n\n489\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.150\n&gt;&gt; It's in the ether.\n\n490\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.810\nPink slime.\n\n491\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:09.853\n&gt;&gt; Pink slime.\n\n492\n00:23:09.853 --> 00:23:12.998\n&gt;&gt; All right everyone, so that looks\nlike we have our marching orders,\n\n493\n00:23:12.998 --> 00:23:16.552\ndefinitely read up on software defined\nnetworking and come back for part II.\n\n494\n00:23:16.552 --> 00:23:18.920\nWe're gonna look at some\nother key concepts and\n\n495\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.620\nmaybe even some show and tell.\n\n496\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.058\nThat being said, this episode\nlooks like it has come to an end,\n\n497\n00:23:23.058 --> 00:23:23.932\nthanks for watching.\n\n498\n00:23:23.932 --> 00:23:26.618\nSigning off for ITPRO TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n499\n00:23:26.618 -->
