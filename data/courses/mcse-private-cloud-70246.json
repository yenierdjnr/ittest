private\ncloud, introducing private cloud and\n\n17\n00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:41.245\nthe idea of private cloud is what we're\ngonna focus on, at least right now.\n\n18\n00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:45.755\nWe will talk much more broadly throughout\nthe various episodes that we're\n\n19\n00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:48.030\nputting together around the 72 46.\n\n20\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.250\nPart one if you will of the MCSE\nprivate cloud certification.\n\n21\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.530\nAbout System Center but we're gonna focus\non the monitoring certainly with SCOM but\n\n22\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.270\nalso focus on the hosting of\nthe private cloud fabric so the SCVMM,\n\n23\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.940\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager\npiece.\n\n24\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.470\nWe're gonna be taking look at how\nthose two products in particular\n\n25\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.920\nare used together to be able to form\nthe basis, the bedrock if you will or\n\n26\n00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.240\nthe baseline for how we build out\nthe private cloud in the organization,\n\n27\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.440\nor throughout the enterprise.\n\n28\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.010\nWe're gonna start by talking\na little bit about what cloud is.\n\n29\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.120\nThe cloud model conceptually has\nbeen around for a while now.\n\n30\n00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.790\nWhen we think about cloud, and we think\nabout what a private cloud, a public\n\n31\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.810\ncloud, a hybrid cloud, even a community\ncloud maybe, yet we used terminology in\n\n32\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.870\nthought processes that we don't always\nnecessarily define very strictly but\n\n33\n00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.470\nrather, we use them based on what\nwe think those definitions, maybe.\n\n34\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.030\nAnd we're gonna walk you through\nwhat those definitions are here in\n\n35\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.980\njust a minute.\n\n36\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.010\nBut, when we think of cloud,\nwe're really thinking today\n\n37\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.250\nof the mixture and\nthe configuration, the management,\n\n38\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.650\nthe oversight, and the usage of two\ndistinctly different technologies.\n\n39\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.711\nThe idea of virtualization which has\nformed the underlying foundation of what\n\n40\n00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.689\nwe think of as cloud computing today.\n\n41\n00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.999\nAnd then the ability to be able\nto use network infrastructure,\n\n42\n00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.985\ntypically with some sort of\nsoftware defined interface or\n\n43\n00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:13.640\nsoftware defined management\nthought process.\n\n44\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.430\nTrying to abstract and\nremove the human from the mix if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.340\nDefining and automating processes so that\nwe can replicate them and make sure that\n\n46\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.850\nthey are done correctly with minimal time\nand effort and we can scale massively.\n\n47\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.330\nAnd t his is what the primary driver for\nsoftware definition is.\n\n48\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.866\nIn terms of what it does for us in the\norganization and across the enterprise.\n\n49\n00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:39.514\nAnd so when we think of bringing\nsoftware defined, networking, storage,\n\n50\n00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.945\nconfiguration management, software\ndefining up and down the stack and\n\n51\n00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:48.592\ndata center and we bring that to bear\nalong with virtualization, we develop\n\n52\n00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:52.832\nthe stack process that ultimately\nbecomes the defined as the cloud.\n\n53\n00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:58.300\nAnd what we think of as the cloud today\nis really the extension of traditional\n\n54\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.001\non-prem privately managed,\nprivately hosted infrastructure\n\n55\n00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:07.872\ninto either a co-hosted model where\nwe essentially pay somebody or\n\n56\n00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:12.742\nask a third party-provider or\na cloud source provider Microsoft,\n\n57\n00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:18.110\nfor instance, Amazon,\nVMware whoever the provider may be.\n\n58\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.980\nWe ask them to host our private\ninfrastructure on our behalf\n\n59\n00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.620\ndedicated to us,\nthat would be a hosted private cloud.\n\n60\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.990\nWe ask our own IT teams to\nhost that infrastructure,\n\n61\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.690\nthe traditional model we've always used,\nbut we simply rebrand it as private cloud.\n\n62\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.064\nThis would be the internal networks,\nthe LANs that we know of,\n\n63\n00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:41.490\nthe internal data center infrastructure,\nour messaging platforms,\n\n64\n00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.180\nour file servers, our data servers,\nour web servers, all the stuff we know and\n\n65\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.760\nwe have, but, we just look at\nit from a different perspective.\n\n66\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.490\nWe don't really change anything.\n\n67\n00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.790\nWe may underlying that architecture change\nthe thought process and use virtualization\n\n68\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.060\nto host some of those machines but\nin general it's the same concept, right?\n\n69\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.475\nIt's just that we are now using a new\nmarketing slogans to refer to it, right?\n\n70\n00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.739\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe physical placement of those machines.\n\n71\n00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, the physical placement in\nthe sense that they're still in the data\n\n72\n00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.170\ncenter.\n\n73\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.560\nThey really haven't changed\nin the physical placement.\n\n74\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.787\nCan also now, really refer to not just,\nhey, are they sitting in a rack, right,\n\n75\n00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:20.283\nhypothetically where it would have\nbeen for decades in many cases or\n\n76\n00:04:20.283 --> 00:04:24.146\nsitting at data centers as for standing\nmachines if they were mainframes or\n\n77\n00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:25.343\nmidframe computers.\n\n78\n00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:29.640\nBut rather, are they running now as guest\noperating system instances where we\n\n79\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.340\ncommonly referred to as virtual machines?\n\n80\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.865\nAre they running as guest OS instances on\none or more of those rack-mounted pizza\n\n81\n00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:40.669\nboxes or blades or whatever they\nmay be sitting in that data center?\n\n82\n00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.629\nWhat we've essentially done is swapped out\nthe physical back-end infrastructure and\n\n83\n00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.583\nwe've collaborated in such way would\nvarious technology vendors and\n\n84\n00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.746\ncoordinated all of these\ntechnology coming together.\n\n85\n00:04:52.746 --> 00:04:58.171\nSo that now we can use that infrastructure\nto scale the number of machines we run for\n\n86\n00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:02.170\nthis particular organization or\nfor this enterprise.\n\n87\n00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.980\nAnd we go from having a one to one ratio.\n\n88\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.680\nOne resource, one server let's say,\nrunning one application workload with\n\n89\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.980\none operating system dedicated\nto a certain thought process.\n\n90\n00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.520\nSo I need an exchange server.\n\n91\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.838\nWell, let me go build that CAS,\nthat client access server.\n\n92\n00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:21.169\nLet me go build that back-end\nwhere my database is gonna be.\n\n93\n00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.901\nLet me go build the directories server,\nthe domain controller and\n\n94\n00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:26.948\nthose are one-off machines essentially,\nright, physical machines.\n\n95\n00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:30.541\nInstead, what we see now,\nwe have what we call a host and\n\n96\n00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:34.220\nthen I'm sure most of you if\nnot all of you know that.\n\n97\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.590\nAnd the host is gonna simply be that\nback-end machine that we often think about\n\n98\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.000\nperhaps since running\nServer 12 R2 with Hyper-V.\n\n99\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.990\nMaybe it's running Server\n16 with Hyper-V or\n\n100\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.490\nwhatever operating system we're running.\n\n101\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.150\nIt doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a Microsoft OS.\n\n102\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.615\nBut, in this case, cuz we're\ntalking about Microsoft technology,\n\n103\n00:05:51.615 --> 00:05:53.132\nwe're gonna assume it's a Microsoft OS.\n\n104\n00:05:53.132 --> 00:05:56.644\nSo let's say,\nwe're running Server 12 R2 with Hyper-V,\n\n105\n00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:58.439\nthat's gonna become our host.\n\n106\n00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.727\nAnd then that host through Hyper-V,\nthrough abstraction,\n\n107\n00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:06.024\nthrough the hypervisor layer is gonna be\nable to run multiple virtual machines,\n\n108\n00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:10.764\nguest operating system that represent this\nexchange server, this domain controller,\n\n109\n00:06:10.764 --> 00:06:12.780\nthis file and print server.\n\n110\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.600\nBut they're running as configuration\nfiles and VHDX files that represent\n\n111\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.360\ndata from a storage network and with\nnetworking and with all the things we need\n\n112\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.890\nassociated with it, through a common host,\nand that's how we create private clouds.\n\n113\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.040\nWe simply do that with our inside,\ninternal to the data center,\n\n114\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.440\nowned by us private infrastructure\nmanagement solution.\n\n115\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.780\nAnd System Center is gonna be\nable to as a suite of products\n\n116\n00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.325\nallow us to do all the things necessary to\nbe able to spin this infrastructure up but\n\n117\n00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:46.040\nwe can do it totally on-prem,\nwe can do it in combination\n\n118\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.410\nwith a cloud provider,\nhave them host it, have us manage it.\n\n119\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.533\nWe can use tools from the on-prem site,\nSystem Center Ops Manager, for instance.\n\n120\n00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:59.226\nOther tools in the System Center suite to\nbe able to link to that cloud fabric that\n\n121\n00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:02.935\nMicrosoft or\nanother providers giving us some monitor.\n\n122\n00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:06.265\nWe can monitor from the cloud side, we\ncan monitor from the data center's side.\n\n123\n00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:07.555\nWe could do that either way.\n\n124\n00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:09.588\nSo private clouds can be created and\nhosted,\n\n125\n00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:12.382\nright your point about location\nin either place, Cherokee.\n\n126\n00:07:12.382 --> 00:07:13.706\nIt really wouldn't matter where it is.\n\n127\n00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:17.022\nThe goal is that we just have to\nfigure out what's most cost-effective\n\n128\n00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:21.050\nfirst of all, is it cheaper for us to\nbuild it ourselves or host it ourselves?\n\n129\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.030\nOr is it cheaper for us and essentially\npay as you go monthly fee model, right?\n\n130\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.994\nHey, I want this, this and this,\nI need five machines, configured this way,\n\n131\n00:07:29.994 --> 00:07:31.957\nwith this infrastructure backing it.\n\n132\n00:07:31.957 --> 00:07:35.206\nMr and Mrs call provider,\nhow much is that gonna cost me?\n\n133\n00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:38.866\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what I mean, the host\noperating system being one of your\n\n134\n00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:42.415\ninternal resources versus outsourcing\nit to one of those providers.\n\n135\n00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:45.716\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, so\nwhatever it would be, wherever we go,\n\n136\n00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:49.676\nthe smart administrator is gonna\nbe doing cost benefit analysis.\n\n137\n00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:53.341\nBut also doing a risk assessment right on\ntop of that to understand the security\n\n138\n00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:57.231\nimplications and the BCDR, Business\nContinuity Disaster Recovery applications\n\n139\n00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:59.695\nOf what we're gonna do and\nhow we're gonna do that.\n\n140\n00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:01.670\nSo we're gonna be thinking\nabout those things and\n\n141\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.418\ntrying to understand them as we go.\n\n142\n00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:06.820\nWe're also gonna be talking about\nthe fact we may have hybrid clouds where\n\n143\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.580\nwe are hosting certain resources locally.\n\n144\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.990\nWe're hosting other resources at the data\ncenter provider and we are gonna co-mingle\n\n145\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.020\nthat thought process and again manage\nthrough and across the cloud interface.\n\n146\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.615\nBut however we get there,\n\n147\n00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:24.411\nthe idea of the cloud model is really\nthis idea blending these hosting models.\n\n148\n00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.389\nAnd we'll talk about what they are and\ndefine them in a minute but\n\n149\n00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:29.996\ninfrastructure as a service,\nit's what they call IS.\n\n150\n00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:34.290\nPlatforms as a service, what they call PS,\nsoftware as a service, or SaaS.\n\n151\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.260\nThese are the three accepted,\nwell thought-out, well-defined, and\n\n152\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.600\nwhat we would call universal\ncloud service models.\n\n153\n00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.280\nThere are many other as\na service models today.\n\n154\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.630\nYou can come up with almost\nanything as a service, and\n\n155\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.476\ndrop it into the vernacular and the\nvocabulary matrix of hey, this is cloud.\n\n156\n00:08:53.476 --> 00:08:56.990\nWe have DB as a service or\nDBaaS, database as a service.\n\n157\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.630\nYou have DRAS, DR as a service.\n\n158\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.208\n&gt;&gt; Security as a service.\n\n159\n00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:03.421\n&gt;&gt; SAC right so CCAS, SAC as a service or\nsecurity as a service,\n\n160\n00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.560\nyou've got all sorts of things.\n\n161\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.796\nDesktop is a service, so\nwe traditionally would,\n\n162\n00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:11.745\nyou'll think of that as a form of VDI,\nright.\n\n163\n00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:16.985\nSo we have all those kind of\ninfrastructure and software and managerial\n\n164\n00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:20.425\noverlays with regards to defining what\nsomething as a service looks like.\n\n165\n00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:24.005\nBut the only three that\nare universally accepted today\n\n166\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.390\nwith regards to\nthe standardized definition.\n\n167\n00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.100\nThat one or more vendors are not saying,\nthis is what call this offering.\n\n168\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.190\nUse this definition, but\nrather everybody agrees, hey,\n\n169\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.170\nwhen you define platform as a service,\nit's this, these three.\n\n170\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.580\nIaaS, PaaS and SaaS are the only three\nthat really fall into that category.\n\n171\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.540\nSo we're gonna show you the standard\nformalized definitions for\n\n172\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.342\nthose from NIST, actually.\n\n173\n00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:49.920\nTalk about where they come from, give\nyou a little bit of background on that.\n\n174\n00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.180\nWe're also gonna talk about\nthe idea behind, just in general,\n\n175\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.170\nhow cloud gets implemented through the\nMicrosoft stack in using System Center.\n\n176\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.260\nWalk you through all these\nmoving parts and pieces.\n\n177\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.670\nSo if we could start just by taking\na quick look right here for a moment.\n\n178\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.029\nWanna bring my machine up and show you\ncouple of the things that we're gonna be\n\n179\n00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:12.800\nable to do with regards to looking\nat the Microsoft private cloud.\n\n180\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.910\nWhat's sitting out there on\nthe Microsoft website today.\n\n181\n00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.370\nWhen we go out and take a look for\n\n182\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.640\nor search for Microsoft cloud,\nthis is where we traditionally wind up.\n\n183\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.880\nWe wind up at the, or on I should say,\n\n184\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.630\nthe cloud platform website see\nMicrosoft.com, enuscloud platform.\n\n185\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.890\nRight, and when we go there, although\nthe background changes, the materials so\n\n186\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.765\nto speak will change with time,\nthe thought process is still the same.\n\n187\n00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:41.271\nUnder products, we'll have a listing\nof all the current products,\n\n188\n00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:42.602\nwe'll have server 16,\n\n189\n00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:46.840\nmost recent operating system Microsoft\nhas out in market on the server side.\n\n190\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.688\nWe have the Azure platform, so Microsoft's\nleading-edge cloud fabric platform\n\n191\n00:10:51.688 --> 00:10:56.053\nthat they are hosting in their data\ncenters worldwide making available for\n\n192\n00:10:56.053 --> 00:10:57.451\nus as customers to use.\n\n193\n00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:02.073\nAnd we'll talk about leveraging, hosting\nin Azure with your private cloud on prem.\n\n194\n00:11:02.073 --> 00:11:06.917\nWe'll go through some of those scenarios\nfor you throughout our discussions using\n\n195\n00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:11.761\nthe Azure Management Pack, using Azure\nDeath Disaster Recovery, Azure Backup,\n\n196\n00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.939\nAzure Loggins, Azure Analytics Stacks,\nso we can do the monitoring.\n\n197\n00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:18.927\nThese are things that will become\nimportant and we'll be talking about them\n\n198\n00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:21.690\nand you can see this information\nassociated with them here.\n\n199\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.270\nOur primary focus will be around system\ncenter, so the system center stack.\n\n200\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.220\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat system center 2012 R 2.\n\n201\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.212\nSo we'll be talking about\nthe Config Manager which you see there,\n\n202\n00:11:32.212 --> 00:11:35.360\nwe'll be talking about SCOM,\nSystems Center Ops Manager.\n\n203\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.590\nThe SCVMM products\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n204\n00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.470\nservice manager our help desk\nservice management product.\n\n205\n00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.265\nWe'll talk about DPM, the Data Protection\nManager, we'll talk about the app\n\n206\n00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:50.180\ncontroller, how we manage,\nconfigure, deploy apps and services.\n\n207\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.170\nWe'll take a look at that,\nor at least talk about, and\n\n208\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.110\nmention endpoint protection with regards\nto system center config manager.\n\n209\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.080\nAnd we'll talk about orchestrator which\nis our workflow product that allows us to\n\n210\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.650\nautomate, process and automate deployment\nand management of cloud infrastructure.\n\n211\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.320\nSo we'll see all that.\n\n212\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.500\nWouldn't be a cloud discussion without\ntalking about our backend databases\n\n213\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.390\nat some point.\n\n214\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.820\nWhere do we host all that data?\n\n215\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.860\nSQL Server,\nflagship Microsoft database product.\n\n216\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.819\nWhether it is 12, whether it's 14, whether\nit's 16, whatever version of the database\n\n217\n00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:22.589\nyou may use,\nSQL plays an integral part in what we do.\n\n218\n00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:26.140\nGotta put all the data we capture\nfrom SCOM when we do monitoring.\n\n219\n00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.930\nAll the data for configuration when\nwe use configuration management.\n\n220\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.700\nAll the data, for instance,\nin a problem management and\n\n221\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.340\nresolution from the service manager,\nall that stuff's gotta go somewhere.\n\n222\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.380\nIt's all gonna go into one or\nmore databases, one or more instances and\n\n223\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.710\ndatabases running in SQL.\n\n224\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.402\nAnd so we don't wanna forget that.\n\n225\n00:12:42.402 --> 00:12:45.130\nWe have our cloud platform system.\n\n226\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.435\nThis is the overarching architecture and\nthought process, and\n\n227\n00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.631\njust resources around that from\nthe Microsoft perspective.\n\n228\n00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:53.690\nAnd we do have supporting products.\n\n229\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.630\nWe have the analytics as we talked about.\n\n230\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.336\nThere's Intune, there's Identity Manager,\nthere's all sorts of other stuff.\n\n231\n00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:02.265\nIt's not only pertinent per se to the\nconversation we're having with regards to\n\n232\n00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:05.962\nthe MCSC Private Cloud, and with regards\nto introducing the cloud model and\n\n233\n00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:08.122\nmonitoring and operating a private cloud.\n\n234\n00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:11.290\nBut they do sneak in in certain\nplace from time to time.\n\n235\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.687\nVisual Studio for instance, will be\nan important product in the backend\n\n236\n00:13:14.687 --> 00:13:17.817\nwhen we're doing things like\ncreating our own management packs.\n\n237\n00:13:17.817 --> 00:13:21.896\nWhen we perhaps are doing and\nlooking at debugging and\n\n238\n00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:27.720\nlooking at IntelliTrace looking at\nlogged data that's coming out of SCOM.\n\n239\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.690\nAnd how we're aggregating that and looking\nat perhaps spinning up workflows and\n\n240\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.950\nsolving problems with\nTeam FoundationServices.\n\n241\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.620\nThis kinda stuff becomes important on\nthe backend as we look at scaling.\n\n242\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.110\nBut these products are in\nthe background and\n\n243\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.610\nthey're really not the primary\nfocus of what we do.\n\n244\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.740\nSo when we think about this,\nthis is gonna be just some real estate for\n\n245\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.570\nyou to look at.\n\n246\n00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.130\nThe other interesting thing that\nmay be of value to you would\n\n247\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.330\nbe to look at the Cloud Platform roadmap.\n\n248\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.460\nThis really gives you a look ahead to\nwhere Microsoft's going, what are we doing\n\n249\n00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.630\nwith cloud, what do we come to expect or\nanticipate will be updates and releases.\n\n250\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.440\nAnd what's that two to four year, maybe\nthree to five year picture look like.\n\n251\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.200\nAs we look out ahead and\nlook at upcoming technologies.\n\n252\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.630\nSo it's always nice to look ahead and get\na sense of where we're going, but remember\n\n253\n00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.870\nwe're really talking about what we're\ndoing right now in the modern day and\n\n254\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.660\nwe're gonna modern time.\n\n255\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.686\n&gt;&gt; Sure, this is pretty cutting edge for\na lot of companies.\n\n256\n00:14:16.686 --> 00:14:21.560\nI mean being able to implement it and\njust make that change, make that shift.\n\n257\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.450\n&gt;&gt; It will be but\n\n258\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.860\nI'm just pointing out that the idea will\nbe that you can really just in your mind.\n\n259\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.090\nIf you wanna be thinking hey,\nI'm in System Server 2012 R2.\n\n260\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.905\nAnd I'm looking ahead [CROSSTALK].\n\n261\n00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:34.531\nI'm looking ahead already to 16, but\n\n262\n00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:39.100\nbeyond that what would I be looking\nat beyond System Center 2016.\n\n263\n00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.860\nIs there, will there be and of course\nwe know there will be, another release,\n\n264\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.990\nbut what is it gonna look\nlike out beyond that?\n\n265\n00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.730\nIf I'm thinking in other words in my mind\nas an administrator hey I'm sitting here\n\n266\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:54.860\nin 12R2 and by making the decision to\nmigrate and jump ahead to 16 today.\n\n267\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.909\nInvest 20, 30, 40, 50,000, $100,000,\n\n268\n00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:03.390\nwhatever it will be in your EA with\nsoftware assurance to be able to upgrade\n\n269\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.469\nthat technology platform or\ndo I wait another six months, a year.\n\n270\n00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:08.820\nWhenever it is.\n\n271\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.809\nAnd do I jump over do I leapfrog\nover that technology platform\n\n272\n00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:14.616\ninto the newest platform?\n\n273\n00:15:14.616 --> 00:15:18.944\nThe roadmap may actually help you to make\nsome of those decisions just based on\n\n274\n00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:21.480\ntiming, availability, feature set.\n\n275\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.639\nYou maybe sitting there saying I'm running\nor I'm trying to run SQL on Linux and\n\n276\n00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:30.335\nI'm trying to run,\nwhich is an option that we can do now,\n\n277\n00:15:30.335 --> 00:15:33.435\nI'm trying to run a lot\nof the Microsoft Stack.\n\n278\n00:15:33.435 --> 00:15:37.872\nOr as much of it has been ported anyway\nat the time into the Linux environment,\n\n279\n00:15:37.872 --> 00:15:41.151\nbecause I really wanna be able\nto do the primary hosting,\n\n280\n00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:44.035\nthat primarily do the hosting doing there.\n\n281\n00:15:44.035 --> 00:15:47.133\nPerhaps more stable, perhaps were\nfunctional, depending on your stack.\n\n282\n00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:50.091\nAnd I wanna see what else, what other\nproducts are moving in that direction.\n\n283\n00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:54.747\nMicrosoft's made a significant commitment\nto go down the road with open source,\n\n284\n00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:56.572\nto really open up the code base.\n\n285\n00:15:56.572 --> 00:15:59.232\nTo do a lot of things that five or\nten years ago,\n\n286\n00:15:59.232 --> 00:16:03.160\nwe just never would have even\nenvisioned or thought possible.\n\n287\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.010\nAnd yet had you paid attention\nto some of the roadmapping and\n\n288\n00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.770\nsome of the documents and things that\nare there, we would have seen early\n\n289\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.550\nindications of the fact that this was\nthe direction Microsoft was taking.\n\n290\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.650\n&gt;&gt; A little preplanning would\nreally help you out there.\n\n291\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.410\n&gt;&gt; It certainly can.\n\n292\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:17.260\nAnd it would something that would\nbe important for us to, at least,\n\n293\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.695\nbe considering, let's put it that way.\n\n294\n00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:19.810\nThe definition and\n\n295\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.730\nthe defining characteristic of cloud\nis that it's always available,\n\n296\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.110\nit's ubiquitous, so it's always there,\nit's ready for us whenever we wanted.\n\n297\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.660\nIt's essentially, endlessly scalable.\n\n298\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.690\nIt's a pay-as-you-go model, it's on\ndemand, but it is also ever-changing.\n\n299\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.750\nRight, because the technology\nis constantly updating and\n\n300\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.360\nwe're constantly adding new features and\ncapabilities.\n\n301\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.890\nAnd so, when we think about\nthe ability to project ahead,\n\n302\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.130\nit's gonna become very important for\nus to do that.\n\n303\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.350\nIf we go back, we take a look,\njust wanted to show you where we can find\n\n304\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.280\nthe System Center 2012 R2,\nSystem Center 2012, 2012 SP1, all\n\n305\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.200\nthe different versions of the last three\niterations of the product prior to 2016.\n\n306\n00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.980\nWe could see a listing of all these\nproducts that I was just rattling off\n\n307\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.730\nsince we're talking about and\nthis way you can jump in.\n\n308\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.340\nIf you're interested, let me just\nscroll down while we're talking.\n\n309\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.660\nYou can jump in if you're interested and\nyou can click on any one of this links and\n\n310\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.530\nfind out more about all the products\nthat I was just mentioning.\n\n311\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.290\nYou've got the app controller, the config\nmanager, the data protection manager and\n\n312\n00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.170\npoint protection which is our antivirus,\nantimalware.\n\n313\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:26.230\nReally more antimalware than antivirus,\nbut antimalware and firewall control with\n\n314\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.980\nsystems and config manager down to the\ndesktop endpoints through group policy,\n\n315\n00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.890\nright, but you've got go through and\ntake a look at all these different things.\n\n316\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.180\nYou've got the apps managers, CF scum,\nyou've got the orchestrators, I mentioned,\n\n317\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.450\nyou've got the service manager, and\nyou've got the virtual machine manager.\n\n318\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.030\nSo, anyone of this are gonna be a good\nplace for you to jump in and we're putting\n\n319\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.601\nthe URLs for all these websites to\ntake care up to into the show notes.\n\n320\n00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.610\nI encourage you to go take\na look if you haven't already.\n\n321\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.370\nIf we go out for\n\n322\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.410\ninstance the virtual machine manager,\njust click on this one link.\n\n323\n00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:01.860\nYou'll see that we can drill down, find\nout more about Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n324\n00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.970\nhow are we gonna configure it,\nhow are we gonna set up scripting for\n\n325\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.440\nit if we wanna automate it,\nyou could do that.\n\n326\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.610\nWe'll talk about PowerShell as we go\nthrough and look at various things.\n\n327\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.440\nHow do we get it deployed, how do we\nupgrade if we're running an earlier\n\n328\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.010\nversion, what are our options\nthere we'll be talking about that,\n\n329\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.740\nhow to do some troubleshooting How\ndo we use the commandlets available,\n\n330\n00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.390\nas I mentioned, for PowerShell specific\nto VMM in the management shell,\n\n331\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.380\ntake a look at all these different things.\n\n332\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.250\nOne of the most important things you can\ndo, two most important things you can do,\n\n333\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.670\nwith regards to a product like this.\n\n334\n00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.900\nAnd let me just scroll down and\n\n335\n00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.160\nput this kind of up towards\nthe center of the screen.\n\n336\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.500\nWe tend to have a glossary of vocabulary\nassociated with most of the technology\n\n337\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.665\nareas, or in this case,\nthe products that we use.\n\n338\n00:18:41.665 --> 00:18:46.015\nWe encourage you to think about looking at\nthe glossary, getting familiar with some\n\n339\n00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:49.335\nof the language, the definitions,\nthe terms that we use.\n\n340\n00:18:49.335 --> 00:18:53.975\nWhat is private cloud,\nwhat is fabric, what is NVGRE,\n\n341\n00:18:53.975 --> 00:18:55.577\nwe'll be talking about that.\n\n342\n00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:57.947\nHow do we use, or\nhow do we think about software definition?\n\n343\n00:18:57.947 --> 00:18:58.927\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome.\n\n344\n00:18:58.927 --> 00:18:59.747\nI'm excited.\n\n345\n00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:00.377\n&gt;&gt; For the glossary.\n\n346\n00:19:00.377 --> 00:19:01.017\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n347\n00:19:01.017 --> 00:19:02.157\nSo, the glossary's very valuable.\n\n348\n00:19:02.157 --> 00:19:03.167\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for showing that, yeah.\n\n349\n00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:07.267\n&gt;&gt; Because the glossary will give us,\nany of us, myself for instance,\n\n350\n00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:07.873\nCherokee, all of us.\n\n351\n00:19:07.873 --> 00:19:10.128\nPlus, I gotta look stuff\nup from time to time.\n\n352\n00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:12.163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Remember what it is or figure it out.\n\n353\n00:19:12.163 --> 00:19:15.343\nAnd so you shouldn't have a problem\ndoing that because that's how you find\n\n354\n00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.203\nthe right information.\n\n355\n00:19:16.203 --> 00:19:18.803\nSo, going out to the glossary,\nreally valuable,\n\n356\n00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:20.783\nreally helpful resource as we get started.\n\n357\n00:19:20.783 --> 00:19:23.663\nAnd I always talk about it and\nalways try to focus your attention on at\n\n358\n00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:27.673\nleast in one of the episode we do around\na product or a suite of products or\n\n359\n00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:29.320\na body of knowledge like this.\n\n360\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.650\nAlways read the released notes for\n\n361\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.400\nthe product,\nspecially by version as they come out.\n\n362\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.410\nIt is so helpful to you to understand and\n\n363\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.020\nthe feature sets,\nto understand how we're doing something.\n\n364\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.640\nAlso understand what we're not doing\nanymore, because a lot of times product\n\n365\n00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.490\nversion to version, release to release,\nthere always be new things that come out.\n\n366\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.570\nBut as a result if the product is gonna\nbe so big, we got to swap things out and\n\n367\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.010\ndo what's called deprecating them,\nessentially, marking them for removal.\n\n368\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.320\nIn the future release, say, hey,\nwe're not longer gonna develop this stuff,\n\n369\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.920\nI'll process, we're gonna support it\nin maybe only one more generation or\n\n370\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.010\nguess what, it was deprecated to releases\na go and we said in two releases it's\n\n371\n00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.820\ngoing away, now we're at that\nsecond release and guess what?\n\n372\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.670\nIt's not longer here, so\nit will be helpful for you to know that.\n\n373\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.070\nSo, those release notes are very\nvaluable for you as you go through and\n\n374\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.330\nstart to learn about a new\ngeneration of a product or\n\n375\n00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.530\nif this is your first time using\nthe product, really helpful for you,\n\n376\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.070\njust get a better sense on what that\nproduct is gonna be able to do for you.\n\n377\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.210\nSo, you definitely wanna take a look at\nthose, I think it will be valuable and\n\n378\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.310\nhelpful for you.\n\n379\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.240\nThe other nice thing, if we just go back\nhere for a minute, you could see down\n\n380\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.940\nat the bottom of the page, we have\nthe end yes, page is always helpful.\n\n381\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.480\nSo, you always wanna say yes, right?\n\n382\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.160\nBut right below or right above it I\nshould say, downloadable documentation.\n\n383\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.880\nYou'll get a copy of the documentation\nfrom the Microsoft Download Center,\n\n384\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.700\nyou should go out,\nyou should follow this link.\n\n385\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.520\nAnd when you do this, and again, this link\nmay be in a slightly different place.\n\n386\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.130\nBy the time you actually watch this\nepisode, if we put it together,\n\n387\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.080\nyou know in early 2017 you're\nwatching it at the end of 2017 or\n\n388\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.790\nwhatever that timeline is for you,\nthe reality is we show you those, or\n\n389\n00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.900\ngive the URLs to give\nyou the starting point.\n\n390\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.760\nBut always validate them, always\ncheck out that they are still valid.\n\n391\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.180\nOccasionally, Microsoft moves stuff\naround here and there and you know,\n\n392\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.790\nthat's normal.\n\n393\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.285\nBut you'll probably be\nin the general place and\n\n394\n00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:17.445\nif the download link's no longer\nat the bottom of the screen, but\n\n395\n00:21:17.445 --> 00:21:20.165\nit's off to the side,\njust adjust in RealTime and go get it.\n\n396\n00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:23.645\nYou'll figure it out, and\nyou can see here we can download\n\n397\n00:21:23.645 --> 00:21:27.735\na list of all the documentation\nassociated with virtual machine manager.\n\n398\n00:21:27.735 --> 00:21:29.550\nAlways take a look here.\n\n399\n00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.610\nApp details,\nit'll tell you what you're gonna get.\n\n400\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.460\nYou'll be able to go in and\nyou'll see, we've got some stuff on\n\n401\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.300\nthe VMM documentation, typically,\nboth in a dock and PDF format.\n\n402\n00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.620\nMicrosoft usually gives you both options.\n\n403\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.350\nAnd then, there's some stuff on\nfiber channel with using the brocade\n\n404\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.680\nsolution to be able to do this,\nhow do we set that up, what do we do.\n\n405\n00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.010\nAnd so,\nyou could download this very simple.\n\n406\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.830\nYou just choose what you want, right.\n\n407\n00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.150\nAnd then,\nwhen you're done just click, next.\n\n408\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.420\nYou go in,\nit just prompts you to do the downloads.\n\n409\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.390\nDo a little save as,\nright throw it out here on the desktop.\n\n410\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:11.160\nAnd then once you're done, you know\nthe drill, you'll have your documentation,\n\n411\n00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.490\nyou can bring it up and of course you can\ngo through and you can take a look at it.\n\n412\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.060\nJust one thing, I was gonna show you\nhere real quick while we do that.\n\n413\n00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.000\nLet me just go in there,\n\n414\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.330\njust highlight this really quick,\ngive it just one second to open.\n\n415\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.840\nAnd when you go through and\nlook at this documentation,\n\n416\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.940\nit will be fairly,\ndepending on the product of course.\n\n417\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.010\nThere may be more or\nless documentation at any one time.\n\n418\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.850\nBut there's gonna be a fair amount\nof stuff you may have to go through.\n\n419\n00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:41.120\nAnd as a result, just converting\nit from one version to another.\n\n420\n00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.710\nWhat I just wanted to show you was,\neven though it says 2012 on the website,\n\n421\n00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.580\neven though it says 2012 on the download,\ndon't get thrown by that.\n\n422\n00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.450\nThe download is for\nthe most recent version.\n\n423\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.340\nIn this case, 12 R2, so\njust to understand when you download that,\n\n424\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.710\nyou're actually gonna get\nthe 12 R2 documentation.\n\n425\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Don't do a good job of saying,\n\n426\n00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.460\nby the way, it's 12 R2 it's\nall labelled 12, but it's for\n\n427\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.470\nentire 12 family, so\nit's 12, 12SP1, 12 R2.\n\n428\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.600\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou'll notice it applies to all three.\n\n429\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.150\nRight down here, tells you that,\nright on the landing page of the document.\n\n430\n00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:14.950\nSo, it applies to every release in the 12\nseries, so just to understand that.\n\n431\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:20.047\nThe 2016 version, of course, you go out to\nthe 2016 System Center TechNet Library and\n\n432\n00:23:20.047 --> 00:23:22.470\ndownload the more recent version for that.\n\n433\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.180\nBut you can see, this is all here.\n\n434\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.610\nAnd when you go through, aside from\nall just the copyright information,\n\n435\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.780\nthe change updates, etcetera.\n\n436\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.180\nYou got your nice documentation list,\nor rather your, what do they call them,\n\n437\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.200\ntable of contents, right.\n\n438\n00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.870\nYou got your table of contents here.\n\n439\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.620\nSo, we can go through and\nwe can see everything,\n\n440\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.220\nand it's got everything you may be looking\nfor with regards to, in this case, SeVMM.\n\n441\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.710\nSo, you just wanna go in, wanna make sure\nyou take the time to take a look at that.\n\n442\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.930\nMake sure that you're familiar with\nthe fact that we can download that\n\n443\n00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:49.950\ninformation.\n\n444\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.530\nAnd that way, you're gonna have a handy\nreference both for studying purposes.\n\n445\n00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.800\nYou go through, mark that up,\nmake notes on what you need.\n\n446\n00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.954\nIt'll be good for you if you're actually\nmanaging the product in production,\n\n447\n00:23:58.954 --> 00:24:02.024\nyou got a good reference guide for getting\nall the kind of stuff you need done.\n\n448\n00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:05.097\nAnd it's readily available to you and\nit's searchable, it's right there.\n\n449\n00:24:05.097 --> 00:24:08.052\nYou don't have to worry about going out\nand finding it everytime you wanna use it.\n\n450\n00:24:08.052 --> 00:24:11.540\nSo maybe just something for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n451\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.050\nI mentioned the cloud definitions.\n\n452\n00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.202\nWanna go through them with you quickly.\n\n453\n00:24:16.202 --> 00:24:17.450\nAuthoritative resource for\n\n454\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.360\nthis would be the NIST definition\nof cloud computing documents.\n\n455\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.030\nYou see it up on the screen NIST\nuses a publication numbering system\n\n456\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.050\nthat goes like this.\n\n457\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.100\nNIST SP, short for special publication,\n800 dash whatever.\n\n458\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.620\nIn this case, 800-145.\n\n459\n00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.696\nAnd what this will do is this\nwill tell you if you go out and\n\n460\n00:24:35.696 --> 00:24:38.850\nGoogle or search for it,\nhow to find the exact document.\n\n461\n00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.750\nNow, there's different\nnumbering areas in this field.\n\n462\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.010\nThe 800 series, you have the 1500 series.\n\n463\n00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.240\nThere's different series based on\nthe kind of information you want.\n\n464\n00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.629\nThe 800 series deals with computer\nsecurity broadly, and we'll certainly deal\n\n465\n00:24:51.629 --> 00:24:55.350\nwith cloud computing as a subset of that,\nwith regards to defining it.\n\n466\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.105\nSo, 800-145 is a little baby,\nshort seven page version of this document\n\n467\n00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:05.570\n800-146 is the big brother to this\ndocument, it's about 80 some odd pages.\n\n468\n00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.361\nLays out not just the definitions and\nthe models, but\n\n469\n00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:11.100\ngoes in depth into the concepts\nof Cloud Computing.\n\n470\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.855\nYou're gonna for purposes of getting ready\nfor the exam, for purposes of just general\n\n471\n00:25:14.855 --> 00:25:18.050\noverview Cloud knowledge,\ngonna wanna stick with this document.\n\n472\n00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:23.570\nWe're not a NIST centric specification\nthought process when we're going ahead and\n\n473\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.580\nwe're testing from Microsoft perspective.\n\n474\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.280\nSo you don't need to read\nthe broad document but\n\n475\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.650\nMicrosoft's cloud platform and all the\nother vendors cloud platforms all align\n\n476\n00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.720\nwith these definitions in these standards.\n\n477\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.060\nAnd so this is what the base on,\nyou do wanna understand the basics.\n\n478\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.650\nWhen we look for the definitions I'm just\ngonna scroll through the first few pages\n\n479\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:46.640\nof the document don't really have much\nof anything in them but we get in here.\n\n480\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.840\nWe get to section two and\nthis definition of cloud computing,\n\n481\n00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.930\nyou could see the essential\ncharacteristics sitting up on the screen,\n\n482\n00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.930\nthe five key characteristics\nwe use to define cloud,\n\n483\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.600\nI just ran through them with you at\na high level as we were talking.\n\n484\n00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.382\nBut on demand self service,\nbroad network access, resource pulling,\n\n485\n00:26:03.382 --> 00:26:07.722\nrapid elasticity, and measured services,\nin other words the ability to be able to\n\n486\n00:26:07.722 --> 00:26:10.900\nmeasure and pay as you go that's\nwhat we talked about there.\n\n487\n00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.365\nSo you wanted to just be familiar with\nthose, but in addition, we then have\n\n488\n00:26:14.365 --> 00:26:17.890\nour service models down at the bottom\nhere on page two and page three.\n\n489\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.300\nSoftware as a service,\nplatform as a service and\n\n490\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.660\nof course as we scroll down,\nwe have infrastructure as a service.\n\n491\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.665\nLet's start with infrastructure as service\nat the bottom bottom of the stack.\n\n492\n00:26:26.665 --> 00:26:31.121\nLet's work our way up, because that's\nwhen we build the basic foundation and\n\n493\n00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:34.305\nthat's where we start\ntypically with our access.\n\n494\n00:26:34.305 --> 00:26:38.535\nInfrastructure as a service allows\nthe customer go to a cloud vendor.\n\n495\n00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:43.610\nAnd to say to the cloud vendor,\nI need to rent from you on a pay as I go,\n\n496\n00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.438\nor rather pay as I use basis,\non a monthly basis traditionally.\n\n497\n00:26:48.438 --> 00:26:53.145\nI need to rent this amount of\ninfrastructures, specifically, I want\n\n498\n00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:59.410\na server that's gonna be configured with\n4 terabytes of memory, pretty big server.\n\n499\n00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:04.330\nI wanna a server that's gonna be\nconfigured with 128 virtual CPUs.\n\n500\n00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.858\nI wanna a server that is going to, excuse\nme, not virtual CPUs, but physical CPUs.\n\n501\n00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:15.270\nI wanna a server that's gonna be\nconfigured with ten gigabyte network\n\n502\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.240\nadapters and\n\n503\n00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.400\nI want two terabytes of storage on\nthe backend on my storage network.\n\n504\n00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.708\nI wanna be able to rent this physical\nserver from you and I want three of these,\n\n505\n00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:26.590\nso that I can stand them up.\n\n506\n00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.890\nI can create a hosting environment and\n\n507\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.950\nI can run by Virtual Machines\non top of these servers.\n\n508\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:37.080\nSo with infrastructure as a service,\nyou go to the cloud service provider,\n\n509\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.070\nthe CSP, Google, Amazon,\nMicrosoft, Oracle, VMware,\n\n510\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.070\nwhoever it is, it doesn't matter and\nyou then tell them this is what I want.\n\n511\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:49.045\nYou put your order in and then they\nwill say to you, great, no problem,\n\n512\n00:27:49.045 --> 00:27:54.080\nlet's just do some quick calculations,\nthis is gonna be $1,000 US a month so,\n\n513\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.030\nyou're gonna sign a 12 month contract\nwith us to guarantee you're gonna\n\n514\n00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.180\nuse these resources, and\nyou're gonna pay monthly as you go.\n\n515\n00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.080\nOr, you'll pay a little extra premium and\nyou'll go month to month.\n\n516\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.880\nYou can do this different ways just\ndepending on what you wanna do, and\n\n517\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.420\nas a result of that, we're then\ngonna provision this infrastructure.\n\n518\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.960\nWe're gonna rack it up for\nyou we're gonna set it up.\n\n519\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.940\nWe're gonna then turn it over to you.\n\n520\n00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:21.180\nAnd you mister and miss customer are then\ngonna manage this infrastructure 90% of\n\n521\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.800\nit anyway and the cloud provider is\ngonna maintain it in their data centers.\n\n522\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.800\nSo, the physical location\nthe geography and\n\n523\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.120\nthe physical security surrounding that and\nthe management of that, the utility,\n\n524\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.870\nthe power, the 24 by 7 monitoring,\nthe cooling, the HVAC.\n\n525\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.880\nAll the stuff that goes into\nphysical structuring, managing and\n\n526\n00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.790\ndeploying that infrastructure belongs\nto the cloud service provider.\n\n527\n00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.830\nThat's what they do in their data centers.\n\n528\n00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:53.055\nYou don't in other words as a customer\ntend to go visit your servers very\n\n529\n00:28:53.055 --> 00:28:53.820\noften, right.\n\n530\n00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.010\nThat's not something you would\ntraditionally do in the cloud model\n\n531\n00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.220\nbecause your datacenter\nmaybe 5,000 miles away and\n\n532\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.400\nyou're connecting to it remotely or could\nbe next door, it doesn't really matter.\n\n533\n00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.214\nBut either way, you're traditionally\nnot going there to be able to see your\n\n534\n00:29:07.214 --> 00:29:09.845\nservers, you're remotely\nconnecting into them.\n\n535\n00:29:09.845 --> 00:29:13.950\nAnd administering over a VPN or\nsome sort secure connection.\n\n536\n00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.070\nAnd as a result the Cloud provider\ndoes bear some responsibility and some\n\n537\n00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:22.810\nliability in this relationship, there's\na clear distinct split between the two.\n\n538\n00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:28.280\nBut the burden, the bulk of management and\nresponsibility are beyond initial standing\n\n539\n00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.580\nup and provisioning and swapping out of\ninfrastructure if something were to fail.\n\n540\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.600\nSo managing a hard drive if\nit fails on a storage array,\n\n541\n00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.350\nmanaging a power supply were it to go\ndown and we failover to backup power,\n\n542\n00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.900\nswap out the power supply, bring that\nback up, whatever the case may be.\n\n543\n00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.110\nAll that stuff that goes on on\nthe backend, it's all the management\n\n544\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.200\nresponsibility of the data center manager,\nthe cloud service provider.\n\n545\n00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.290\nBut you as the customer\nare contracting for\n\n546\n00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.380\nrights to get that white\nbox infrastructure.\n\n547\n00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.810\nNo operating system, nothing beyond\nthe basic, physical hardware, and\n\n548\n00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.860\nthe network connectivity to be\nable to get into it to set it up.\n\n549\n00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.161\nAnd you then are installing the OS's,\n\n550\n00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:13.150\nyou're doing the base configuration\nto install patch and manage.\n\n551\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.693\nAnd you are then running\nthat infrastructure for\n\n552\n00:30:15.693 --> 00:30:17.990\nwhatever period of time you contract for.\n\n553\n00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.790\nAnd you are doing patch management,\nyou're doing your application workloads,\n\n554\n00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.750\nyou're AppDev environment Your virtual\nmachine hosting, whatever you wanna do,\n\n555\n00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.200\nall that stuff on top of\nwhat you are getting, and\n\n556\n00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.810\nthat's all the responsibility\nof the customer in IS.\n\n557\n00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.200\n&gt;&gt; That's really important to understand\nthese different models where see\n\n558\n00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.090\nyou no question about who is responsible\nfor the different components such as\n\n559\n00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.620\nyou said the hardware versus\nthe management, the patch management.\n\n560\n00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.090\nBecause you don't wanna any kind of guess\nwork when it comes to something like that.\n\n561\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.980\n&gt;&gt; No, no, we definitely don't\nwanna be saying who did that or\n\n562\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.180\nwho was going to do that.\n\n563\n00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.860\nShould have been done and now it\nwasn't and now look at what happened,\n\n564\n00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.760\nnobody did it.\n\n565\n00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.470\nSo we definitely don't want to\nhave any unanswered questions,\n\n566\n00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.970\nthat's a very good point to raise.\n\n567\n00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.530\nSo, when we're talking about\ninfrastructure as a service\n\n568\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.490\nwe're talking about that idea of hey,\nI wanna rent that infrastructure and\n\n569\n00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.940\nI then want to be able to\nmanage it myself, although.\n\n570\n00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.570\nManagement is an elastic term because part\nof that management responsibility falls to\n\n571\n00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.400\nthe vendor part falls primarily\nmost of it falls to customer,\n\n572\n00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.198\nas we move up to stacking the past.\n\n573\n00:31:16.198 --> 00:31:19.700\nPlatform as a service what we're\nlooking at here I'm walking\n\n574\n00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.930\nback up the document from the top\npage three up to page two,\n\n575\n00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.060\nbecause past kinda straddles\nboth as you can see.\n\n576\n00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.045\nWhen we look at platform as a service,\n\n577\n00:31:28.045 --> 00:31:32.388\nwhat we're looking at is building on\ninfrastructure, so we're building on IIS,\n\n578\n00:31:32.388 --> 00:31:36.810\nwe have all those capabilities, all that\nsplit of responsibility we just defined.\n\n579\n00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.899\nCustomer shows up and says I need that\nsame three set of servers provisioned\n\n580\n00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:47.260\nthe same way, but what I also need on\ntop of that Mr. and Mrs. Cloud provider.\n\n581\n00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.937\nI want you to be able to provision for\nme the hardware,\n\n582\n00:31:50.937 --> 00:31:56.270\nset it up install the operating system and\nhand it to me ready to go configure.\n\n583\n00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.292\nSo I don't just say I want three severs.\n\n584\n00:31:58.292 --> 00:32:01.820\nI say I want three servers running,\nServer 2016.\n\n585\n00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.552\nOr I want three servers running\nDebian Linux or Ubuntu Linux or\n\n586\n00:32:05.552 --> 00:32:10.361\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux Build 7.5, and\nthen the cloud provider has to stand\n\n587\n00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:15.061\nup that infrastructure, install and\nconfigure the base operating system.\n\n588\n00:32:15.061 --> 00:32:19.903\nAnd then hand it to me, so that I can\nthen, on top of that, put my application\n\n589\n00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:24.767\nworkloads, build my ABDev environments,\ndo my virtual machine hosting.\n\n590\n00:32:24.767 --> 00:32:29.510\nBut, the installation and configuration\nof the OS along with the configuration of\n\n591\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.032\nthe hardware is done\nby the cloud provider.\n\n592\n00:32:32.032 --> 00:32:36.875\nAnd the cloud provider as a result\nof that, will then have to deal with\n\n593\n00:32:36.875 --> 00:32:41.051\nmaking sure that,\nthat operating system is maintained and\n\n594\n00:32:41.051 --> 00:32:45.000\nis provided for\nfrom a licensing perspective, right?\n\n595\n00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.320\nSo, they're not going to,\nwe're not going to rather as a customer\n\n596\n00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.550\nhave to deal with the liability associated\nwith buying a license and maintaining it.\n\n597\n00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.217\nCloud provider gives us that as\npart of installation of ELS so\n\n598\n00:32:55.217 --> 00:32:57.427\nwe want to make sure we\nunderstand the split here.\n\n599\n00:32:57.427 --> 00:33:02.246\nSo, it's roughly about 50/50 because\nnow we run the environment on top\n\n600\n00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:03.600\nof the hardware.\n\n601\n00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.080\nBut the cloud provider is managing\nthat environment underneath the hood.\n\n602\n00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.330\nWe're not configuring and managing access\nto storage, the cloud provider is.\n\n603\n00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.710\nWe're just using the storage\nwhen we do pass.\n\n604\n00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.070\nWe may have some oversight\nof maybe able to see it,\n\n605\n00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.800\nwe may be able to provision and\nmanage certain aspects of it, but\n\n606\n00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.840\nthe networking on the back-end, the base\nconfiguration, all that stuff's done by\n\n607\n00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.830\nthe cloud providers part of standing\nup the pass cloud platform for us.\n\n608\n00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.185\nAnd then we have SaaS,\nsoftware as a service.\n\n609\n00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:34.320\nSaaS, the very top of the stack, up at\nthe top of page two there as we go up,\n\n610\n00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.260\nright, so right here under service models.\n\n611\n00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.810\nSoftware as a service is just that,\nwe are renting, and remember, this is\n\n612\n00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.160\nalways a pay as you go rented for a period\nof time as opposed to buy it model.\n\n613\n00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.360\nWhen we're talking about SaaS,\nwe're talking about software as a service.\n\n614\n00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.900\nWe are renting either applications,\nindividually, or\n\n615\n00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.890\nwe are renting the ability to be able\nto use that entire application stack.\n\n616\n00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.955\nWe may just want Office\ninstalled on our desktops and\n\n617\n00:33:58.955 --> 00:34:03.215\nfor $5 a month,\nwe get Microsoft Office from Microsoft.\n\n618\n00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:07.703\nAnd we can get that indefinitely or,\nwe maybe saying to the vendor,\n\n619\n00:34:07.703 --> 00:34:12.693\nI want something like PeopleSoft,\nor Salesforce.com or Office 365.\n\n620\n00:34:12.693 --> 00:34:18.030\nI want you Mr and Mrs cloud vendor, I\nwant you to host the applications for me.\n\n621\n00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:22.022\nAnd as a user, all I want as\nthe customer is the responsibility and\n\n622\n00:34:22.022 --> 00:34:26.014\nthe ability to have a web front\nend with a secure API, typically,\n\n623\n00:34:26.014 --> 00:34:30.607\nthat's how we do it, we go in through\na web browser sometime today.\n\n624\n00:34:30.607 --> 00:34:33.352\nI wanna be able to load\nmy data into the system.\n\n625\n00:34:33.352 --> 00:34:35.646\nI wanna be able to control security and\n\n626\n00:34:35.646 --> 00:34:39.243\noversee user access in management\nof access to the system.\n\n627\n00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:44.090\nBut the back end management of\nthe infrastructure, the platform,\n\n628\n00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.120\nand the software itself is all gonna\nbe done by the cloud provider.\n\n629\n00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.608\nSo when you contract with Salesforce.com\nor Microsoft Office 365 has an IT shop and\n\n630\n00:34:54.608 --> 00:34:58.232\nyou want everything in\nthe cloud through Office 365.\n\n631\n00:34:58.232 --> 00:35:02.135\nMessaging, enterprise content management,\ncollaboration, so\n\n632\n00:35:02.135 --> 00:35:06.175\nyou want Exchange Online,\nSharePoint Online, Skype for Business,\n\n633\n00:35:06.175 --> 00:35:11.043\nyou want the unified communication stack,\nyou wanted Azure AD, you want all that.\n\n634\n00:35:11.043 --> 00:35:14.724\nThat's all software as a service and\nall your doing is saying, for\n\n635\n00:35:14.724 --> 00:35:19.910\n25 or $30 a month for user, let me just\nput down my credit card, keep charging me.\n\n636\n00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.300\nI want Microsoft to host all that,\nconfigure it all,\n\n637\n00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.880\ngive me management interfaces so\nI can manage user access, manage data.\n\n638\n00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.003\nBut I'm not gonna stand up exchange,\nI'm not gonna back it up.\n\n639\n00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:32.860\nI'm not gonna worry about patch managing.\n\n640\n00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.510\nI'm not gonna worry about.\n\n641\n00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.061\nAll that stuff's done by the cloud\nprovider when we do SaaS.\n\n642\n00:35:37.061 --> 00:35:42.350\nSo all we need to do is show up and\nadminister and maintain our data.\n\n643\n00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.330\nAnd the cloud provider is\ndoing everything else.\n\n644\n00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.740\nSo it's a sliding scale depending\non what's side we're on.\n\n645\n00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.255\nCloud provider versus customer and\nthen SaaS, right, which\n\n646\n00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:55.986\nis heavy cloud provider, minimal customer\ninteraction, platform as a service,\n\n647\n00:35:55.986 --> 00:35:59.634\nroughly both more or less equal,\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n648\n00:35:59.634 --> 00:36:02.965\nwhere it's heavy customer\nvery minimal cloud provider.\n\n649\n00:36:02.965 --> 00:36:07.020\nAnd we have your kind of inverted\nscale depending on what your doing.\n\n650\n00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, what do we need\nto have for that client side?\n\n651\n00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.288\nYou'd need your client connecting devices,\nso your workstation, your-\n\n652\n00:36:12.288 --> 00:36:13.523\n&gt;&gt; To connect out and to manage?\n\n653\n00:36:13.523 --> 00:36:15.438\n&gt;&gt; Right, you-\n&gt;&gt; For us, all we need is network,\n\n654\n00:36:15.438 --> 00:36:17.148\nwe basically just need\nan Internet connection.\n\n655\n00:36:17.148 --> 00:36:17.890\n&gt;&gt; You'd need your capabilities, yeah.\n\n656\n00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.082\n&gt;&gt; And we need a secure OS.\n\n657\n00:36:19.082 --> 00:36:22.815\nA secure browser of some kind some sort\nof secure communication capability.\n\n658\n00:36:22.815 --> 00:36:26.342\nAs I said, typically these days,\nit's all done through secure web API.\n\n659\n00:36:26.342 --> 00:36:30.528\nSo we're not in VPN in the traditional\nsense with a separate VPN client.\n\n660\n00:36:30.528 --> 00:36:34.131\nWe're VPN again, but we're doing so\nthrough a web API today.\n\n661\n00:36:34.131 --> 00:36:40.404\nSo, you're connecting securely and using\nthe capabilities of SSLTLS to be able to\n\n662\n00:36:40.404 --> 00:36:45.973\ngo through a web browser and connect\nto a published front-end public IP.\n\n663\n00:36:45.973 --> 00:36:50.361\nAnd go in through that cloud provider\ngateway into your tenet isolated stack in\n\n664\n00:36:50.361 --> 00:36:54.084\nthe sense we just managed that\ninfrastructure using their tools,\n\n665\n00:36:54.084 --> 00:36:58.080\nwhatever the provider gives you,\nwhatever those tools maybe.\n\n666\n00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.600\n&gt;&gt; And one consider it's very appealing or\nattractive for this model because there's\n\n667\n00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.790\nnot really, especially if it's a maybe\neven a new company, a startup business.\n\n668\n00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.020\nThey don't have to have\nthat initial investment for\n\n669\n00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.340\nall that on-site hardware, to pay for\nall those subscriptions and setting it up.\n\n670\n00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.280\nAnd, you never know if your company's\ngonna make it past that first year, so\n\n671\n00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.850\nthis is a very, I can see how it's so\ntrendy and popular right now.\n\n672\n00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.225\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, trendy may not be the exact\nthing I would think of and it is,\n\n673\n00:37:23.225 --> 00:37:25.445\nyeah, I think it was trendy five,\nsix years ago.\n\n674\n00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:26.186\nI think we've gotten past trendy.\n\n675\n00:37:26.186 --> 00:37:28.855\nI think it's definitely here to stay,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n676\n00:37:28.855 --> 00:37:29.395\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n677\n00:37:29.395 --> 00:37:31.885\n&gt;&gt; When I hear trendy, what I think of is-\n&gt;&gt; Temporary, like a fad?\n\n678\n00:37:31.885 --> 00:37:33.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kinda here today,\ngone tomorrow, fad thing.\n\n679\n00:37:33.385 --> 00:37:36.502\nAnd I don't think we could classify\nif cloud that way anymore.\n\n680\n00:37:36.502 --> 00:37:40.228\nI think, if this was six,\nseven, eight years ago,\n\n681\n00:37:40.228 --> 00:37:45.314\nwe were talking about this in you\nknow 2007 as opposed to 2017,\n\n682\n00:37:45.314 --> 00:37:49.744\n2010 instead of 2017,\n2011, whatever it was.\n\n683\n00:37:49.744 --> 00:37:53.904\nIf you're talking about this right at\nthe beginning of the admin of this whole\n\n684\n00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.912\nthought processes,\ncloud really came out of the dark,\n\n685\n00:37:56.912 --> 00:38:00.240\nrecesses in the data center and\nbecame this commercialized,\n\n686\n00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.310\nconsumerized thing that\neverybody talks about.\n\n687\n00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.800\nI mean, I think it would be a challenge\ntoday to go almost anywhere\n\n688\n00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.370\nin the IT world,\nnot the consumer world, right?\n\n689\n00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:13.170\nBut the IT world, anywhere in any country,\nwhere there is IT infrastructure,\n\n690\n00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:17.600\nqualified IT professionals like you,\nlike myself like anybody who's watching us\n\n691\n00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.520\nfrom anywhere, and say to them, hey,\ndo you, what do you think about the cloud?\n\n692\n00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.192\nDo you know about it?\n\n693\n00:38:22.192 --> 00:38:25.885\nI think you'll be challenged then to find\npeople that don't have, not only sense,\n\n694\n00:38:25.885 --> 00:38:29.910\nbut don't have a vested interest in\nthe cloud because of what it does for\n\n695\n00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.670\nthe business as you're suggesting.\n\n696\n00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.440\nAnd I don't, that's why I don't think\nit's really a trend or here today and\n\n697\n00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.817\ngone tomorrow kind of thing anymore.\n\n698\n00:38:35.817 --> 00:38:40.831\nI think we're really looking at the shift\nand this is one of those your once in your\n\n699\n00:38:40.831 --> 00:38:46.293\nlifetime generational kinda of things that\noccurs, the major shift of technology from\n\n700\n00:38:46.293 --> 00:38:51.570\none paradigm to another that the cloud\nhas brought about with virtualization.\n\n701\n00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:57.160\nYou'll be talked about the fact that you\ncan do the cloud in a limited way, right?\n\n702\n00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.268\nWith or without the scale\nability that we talked about.\n\n703\n00:39:00.268 --> 00:39:03.120\nYou could do cloud on unlimited\nway on your own, on your laptop.\n\n704\n00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.810\nI mean, we run virtual machines.\n\n705\n00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.710\nWe can connect them up and do things and\nwe can do this for a limited scale.\n\n706\n00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.891\nWe could do this massive\nglobal infrastructure.\n\n707\n00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:14.826\nThe cloud is everything to anybody that\nneeds it because it's truly elastic and\n\n708\n00:39:14.826 --> 00:39:15.713\ntruly scalable.\n\n709\n00:39:15.713 --> 00:39:19.506\nYeah, you could do virtualization without\nthe cloud but you can't do the cloud\n\n710\n00:39:19.506 --> 00:39:22.687\nwithout virtualization,\nat least in the way we think of it today.\n\n711\n00:39:22.687 --> 00:39:26.968\nThe massive scalability, the enterprise\nlevel of architectures we engaged in.\n\n712\n00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:31.429\nAnd because these two things have become\nlocked together, really, there's no way to\n\n713\n00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:35.359\nbreak them apart given the models we\nuse today, virtualization and cloud.\n\n714\n00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:39.966\nAnd because they're marching together into\nwhatever this is gonna change into and\n\n715\n00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:44.540\nultimately become, as we continue\nto morph these platforms over time.\n\n716\n00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.490\nI think not only is it here to stay,\nbut I think it's here to stay and\n\n717\n00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.300\nalthough we may not realize it,\n\n718\n00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:53.720\nit's changed radically the way we\napproach talking about technology.\n\n719\n00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.321\nBecause, technologists in the next five\nto ten years are beyond what we're doing\n\n720\n00:39:57.321 --> 00:40:00.763\ntoday, are gonna be looking at, and\nwe've talked about this in other shows,\n\n721\n00:40:00.763 --> 00:40:01.725\nquantum computing.\n\n722\n00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:02.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Some of the other\n\n723\n00:40:02.768 --> 00:40:05.689\nthings that are coming down the road\nthat in many respects are already here.\n\n724\n00:40:05.689 --> 00:40:10.004\nAnd the advent of the ability\nto run a cloud-based platform\n\n725\n00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:12.514\nregardless of operating system.\n\n726\n00:40:12.514 --> 00:40:18.480\nThat does what you need it to do, from a\ncommon front-end, that is hosted anywhere.\n\n727\n00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.116\nI mean it's only a matter of time,\nit may not be in our lifetimes, but\n\n728\n00:40:21.116 --> 00:40:23.767\nyou're gonna have data centers\nbeing hosted on orbital platforms.\n\n729\n00:40:23.767 --> 00:40:25.251\nYou're gonna have them\nhosted up on the moon,\n\n730\n00:40:25.251 --> 00:40:27.160\nyou're gonna have them\nhosted on other planets.\n\n731\n00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.378\nWe're not gonna be talking\nabout just connecting here,\n\n732\n00:40:29.378 --> 00:40:32.429\nwe're gonna be talking about connecting\nout to infrastructure that's light\n\n733\n00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:34.220\nyears away at some point in the future.\n\n734\n00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.540\nAnd this is all gonna happen because\nof what we've started to do with this\n\n735\n00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.940\nkind of technology now.\n\n736\n00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.930\nSo remember when you see it here.\n\n737\n00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.753\nOr see it later and then come back here.\n\n738\n00:40:42.753 --> 00:40:45.795\nCrystal ball, Cherokee was the one who\nsaid you're gonna see data centers\n\n739\n00:40:45.795 --> 00:40:47.399\non the moon at some point in the future.\n\n740\n00:40:47.399 --> 00:40:49.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But think about it.\n\n741\n00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.450\nIt's not that farfetched.\n\n742\n00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.940\nWe've been using satellite technology for\ndecades to be able to connect and\n\n743\n00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.940\nto be able to do stuff.\n\n744\n00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.570\nWe use it to communicate with\nspaceships when they are far away.\n\n745\n00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.080\nIt's just that it takes a very\nlong time to push data out there.\n\n746\n00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.950\nBut when you start colonizing and moving\nout beyond where we are today you're\n\n747\n00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.300\ngonna have to put data centers\nin all these different places.\n\n748\n00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.130\nMicrosoft and other vendors have\nbeen building them already,\n\n749\n00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.450\nnot on the moon, but they've been\nbuilding them, we have data centers that\n\n750\n00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.930\nare running in submersibles in\nthe water underneath the ocean.\n\n751\n00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.520\nMicrosoft, within the last year or two,\nran a pilot project very successfully and\n\n752\n00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.970\nis putting data centers\ninto those environments\n\n753\n00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.940\nusing the ambient water temperature and\nmovement to generate power and cool it.\n\n754\n00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.910\nSo it changes the dynamic.\n\n755\n00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.230\nGoogle and many others, Amazon,\nare running data centers that use no HVac\n\n756\n00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.180\nsystems but simply use the outside\nairflow and environmental design\n\n757\n00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.840\nto be able to run and run cleanly with\nzero carbon footprint and zero emissions.\n\n758\n00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.306\nI mean these are things happening today.\n\n759\n00:41:44.306 --> 00:41:46.540\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So when you see this kind of stuff\n\n760\n00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.128\nprogressing out,\ncloud is the driver for all this.\n\n761\n00:41:49.128 --> 00:41:52.705\nAnd we wouldn't have no reason to think\nabout any of this kind of technology scale\n\n762\n00:41:52.705 --> 00:41:55.456\nif cloud computing and\nvirtualization not gotten together.\n\n763\n00:41:55.456 --> 00:41:57.093\nIt's kinda like Reese's peanut butter and\nchocolate.\n\n764\n00:41:57.093 --> 00:41:59.618\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And how they got together and\n\n765\n00:41:59.618 --> 00:42:04.600\nthe fact that now just everything we do\nis just becoming more massively scaled.\n\n766\n00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.860\nSo this is kind of a really cool thing and\na cool time to be talking about it.\n\n767\n00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.010\nBut you do wanna know, do make sure you\nunderstand those standardized definitions\n\n768\n00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.850\nfor the different service models.\n\n769\n00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.740\nRight below that in\nthe document on page three and\n\n770\n00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.850\nonto page four, you'll see that we also\nlist the definition of private cloud,\n\n771\n00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:23.060\npublic cloud, hybrid cloud,\nand community cloud.\n\n772\n00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.680\nI would recommend you go through\nthose before you sit for the exam.\n\n773\n00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.820\nAgain, not because we're gonna be asking\nyou what does this say about this and\n\n774\n00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.840\nthat, but because these are standardized,\naccepted, industry-accepted standardized\n\n775\n00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.650\ndefinitions that every vendor uses to\ndiscuss and to document their cloud.\n\n776\n00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.983\nAnd you are asked\ndefinitional questions and\n\n777\n00:42:40.983 --> 00:42:43.877\ncriteria questions on most\nof the exams for Microsoft.\n\n778\n00:42:43.877 --> 00:42:47.853\nAnd it would not be surprising to see\nthe conceptual ideas of SaaS, PaaS, or\n\n779\n00:42:47.853 --> 00:42:51.647\nIaaS integrated into case study\nquestions or something like that and for\n\n780\n00:42:51.647 --> 00:42:53.340\nyou to be asked about them.\n\n781\n00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.013\nThis is after all\nan MCSE Private Cloud certification.\n\n782\n00:42:57.013 --> 00:42:59.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would be helpful if you could define\n\n783\n00:42:59.074 --> 00:43:02.430\nwhat cloud means before you become\nan MCSE is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n784\n00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.590\nSo you may just want to think\nabout that as we start here.\n\n785\n00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.290\nAnd of course as we continue our\ndiscussions in upcoming episodes\n\n786\n00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:12.240\nwe'll get much more focused and\nspecific into the technology stack.\n\n787\n00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.420\nBut it's important to have the general\nbroad overview as we get started so\n\n788\n00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.090\nyou have a better idea of\nwhere we're coming from.\n\n789\n00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.633\nAnd by starting out broad, we do,\nI always get my directions confused.\n\n790\n00:43:20.633 --> 00:43:22.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Starting out broad, right,\n\n791\n00:43:22.283 --> 00:43:24.011\nI need like one of those guides,\n\n792\n00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:27.540\nI'm almost like a child that's\nnot quite good on their legs yet.\n\n793\n00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.065\nI'm like wobbling.\n\n794\n00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:28.955\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Trying to get to stand?\n\n795\n00:43:28.955 --> 00:43:30.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like I need training wheels.\n\n796\n00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:31.760\nWe gotta put up like a grid or\n\n797\n00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.000\nsomething so when I do this,\nI know I can't go any further.\n\n798\n00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.220\nAll right, so anyway, what we need is,\nwe need to start broad and\n\n799\n00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.577\nthen start narrowing the focus in\ntowards the product stack, right?\n\n800\n00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:43.318\nSCOM, SCVMM, etc.\n\n801\n00:43:43.318 --> 00:43:46.355\nAnd that's what we're gonna be doing\nas we continue discussing this and\n\n802\n00:43:46.355 --> 00:43:49.040\ndeveloping these ideas\nmore in upcoming episodes.\n\n803\n00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that was a perfect\nintroduction and even just a little bit\n\n804\n00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.750\nfurther out into the future for our\nprivate cloud and computing environments.\n\n805\n00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.830\nSo thank you for that Adam and thank\nyou ladies and gentlemen for tuning in.\n\n806\n00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.560\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n807\n00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.824\nFor this show, I'll go ahead and\nsign out as your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n808\n00:44:04.824 --> 00:44:05.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n809\n00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.015\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n810\n00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:15.101\n[MUSIC]\n\n811\n00:44:15.101 --> 00:44:17.060\nThank you for

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:06.462 --> 00:00:07.151\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:08.321\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:11.978\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud Series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.180\nThis is actually a part two of our\nintroduction where we're looking\n\n9\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.260\nat an intro to the cloud model.\n\n10\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.100\nAnd with is today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.805\nThank you for joining is today Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Hello again.\n\n13\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.820\nWe're gonna continue\ntalking about the overview.\n\n14\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.820\nThe thought process behind\nthe cloud platform.\n\n15\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.383\nWhat is it?\n\n16\n00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:37.770\nHow do we link it back to what we're\ntalking about specifically with Microsoft\n\n17\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.810\ntechnology.\n\n18\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.840\nWe talked a bit in the last episode just\na very broad level, broad brush strokes.\n\n19\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.080\nWhat is private cloud?\n\n20\n00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.320\nHow do we define the service models,\ninfrastructure, platform and\n\n21\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.670\nsoftware as a service?\n\n22\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.150\nLooking at the NIST documentation\nto help you figure that out.\n\n23\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.010\nWe took a a look at the overview of\nthe system center suite of products.\n\n24\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.515\nWe took a look at the individual\ncomponents, talked a bit about what each\n\n25\n00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:03.035\none does and why they're important\nto the overall process of the cloud.\n\n26\n00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:07.123\nAnd we spoke about, looked a little bit\nmore in depth at virtual machines manager\n\n27\n00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:10.309\nis one example of a product that's\ngonna be front and center for\n\n28\n00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:14.668\nour conversations about being able to\noperate and monitor the private cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:17.140\nWhat I thought we would continue to do\nis talk a little bit more about how we\n\n30\n00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.120\nmaintain the health of a cloud.\n\n31\n00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.340\nWe have to do monitoring and\n\n32\n00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.710\nproactively monitoring is gonna be\na very important part of what we do.\n\n33\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.950\nUsing System Center Ops Manager\nto be able to do that\n\n34\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.070\nwould be the way to go with\nthe system center suite of products.\n\n35\n00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.130\nOur built in lot of trick capabilities,\n\n36\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.560\nwe'll be able to be extended\nthrough the use of connectors.\n\n37\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.339\nAnd the use of some of\nthe ability to be able to\n\n38\n00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:43.037\nmove information proactively\nacross those connectors.\n\n39\n00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:47.551\nI'm using matters from pacts and the\nability to be able to communicate about\n\n40\n00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.098\nthe status of events and\nalerts that go on.\n\n41\n00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:54.686\nWe're able to actually monitor in one\narea and then send information back and\n\n42\n00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:57.800\nforth to various other\nparts of the platform.\n\n43\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.356\nAnd by doing that we're\nable to take action,\n\n44\n00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:04.339\nwe're able to either solve a problem,\ndeal with an issue or concern.\n\n45\n00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:07.464\nOpen up a workflow,\nopen up a ticket, open up and\n\n46\n00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:12.270\ntrack an incident through an escalation\npath according to our SLAs.\n\n47\n00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.360\nAnd then once we've resolved,\ncommunicate back that,\n\n48\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.190\nthat has happened to\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.583\nAnd even if we resolve on the SCOM\nside communicate out to all these\n\n50\n00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:23.506\nother products that we've done so.\n\n51\n00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:25.771\nSo there's bidirectional,\nbilateral communication.\n\n52\n00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.600\nWe're also able to manage things like\nputting servers into maintenance mode.\n\n53\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.470\nMigrating virtual machine infrastructure,\nusing our live migration thought process.\n\n54\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.210\nYou would think of that as\nVMotion on the VMware side,\n\n55\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.600\nif you're familiar with VMotion,\nperhaps not a Hyper-V equivalent.\n\n56\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.704\nBut we'll be moving,\nrunning virtual machines off of servers.\n\n57\n00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:49.653\nAnd then either collapsing those servers\ndown into other infrastructure, patch\n\n58\n00:02:49.653 --> 00:02:53.690\nmanaging them, doing whatever we need\nto do, and then bringing them back up.\n\n59\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.226\nSo SCOM, System Center Ops Manager\nis gonna form a communication hub in\n\n60\n00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:02.699\nthe central portion of our management and\nmonitoring capabilities.\n\n61\n00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.212\nSo wanna make sure we're thinking about\nthat, but when we pose the question,\n\n62\n00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:09.510\nwhat should I monitor, and\nwhat should I be thinking about?\n\n63\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.260\nThe general answer is well, you should\nmonitor everything clearly, right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.140\nBecause no matter what you monitor,\n\n65\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.510\nthere's value in understanding\nthat information.\n\n66\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.700\nBut what we really need to do is try to\nbe a little selective because monitoring\n\n67\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.720\neverything is gonna\nunfortunately be too broad.\n\n68\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.510\nWe're gonna get too much knowledge and\n\n69\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.840\nwe will suffer from\nan embarrassment of riches.\n\n70\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.870\nAnd what we need to do is filter and\nreally focus our attention and ability\n\n71\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.244\nwith monitoring onto things that are\nspecific enough that they give us value.\n\n72\n00:03:35.244 --> 00:03:39.469\nBut not so specific that they don't allow\nus to see the broader context of what's\n\n73\n00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.810\nhappening within the organization.\n\n74\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.690\nAnd this is the challenge and the tight\nrope we walk with regards to monitoring,\n\n75\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.810\nwith regards to operating private cloud.\n\n76\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.888\nWe have to be broad enough that\nwe can see what's happening.\n\n77\n00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:55.065\nBut able also to be specific enough in our\nfocus that we understand the impact of\n\n78\n00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:59.720\nwhat's happening with regards to the\nsystem or systems that may be affected.\n\n79\n00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.346\nSo things like operating systems\nthat's gonna be important to monitor.\n\n80\n00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:06.420\nWhat's the health of the OS, how much\nprocessor memory that we're using,\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.760\nhow much storage do we have available?\n\n82\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.056\nAre we at the right patch level,\nare we seeing unusual or\n\n83\n00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:16.619\nsuspicious behavior running, service\nsystems like that in the OS that may or\n\n84\n00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:18.811\nmay not be what we would like it to be.\n\n85\n00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:22.820\nWe can use proactive application\nmonitoring to do that, for instance.\n\n86\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.511\nWe have the key services that we may\nidentify that through a business impact\n\n87\n00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.330\nanalysis and\n\n88\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.325\nor another method that we may use that\nare going to be mission critical, right?\n\n89\n00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:37.264\nLike line of business systems,\nexchange may fall under this category,\n\n90\n00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:40.090\nSharePoint may fall under this category.\n\n91\n00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.896\nActive Directory and DNS and\nDHCP may fall into this category.\n\n92\n00:04:43.896 --> 00:04:45.894\nAnd there will be services\nthat are critical,\n\n93\n00:04:45.894 --> 00:04:48.580\nthat if we do not have them\nthings will not work right.\n\n94\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.900\nOthers maybe not so much,\n\n95\n00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.170\nwe may not necessarily be as concerned\nabout whether we can run, file and\n\n96\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.740\nprint services as we are about whether we\ncan run directory services in other words.\n\n97\n00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.117\nBoth are important, but on the scale\nof one to ten uber important to,\n\n98\n00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:06.768\nI can live without it for\na bit if I need to.\n\n99\n00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:09.480\nWe're gonna see a sliding scale and\na differentiation there.\n\n100\n00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.200\nWe have to understand how to figure that\nout, and business impact analysis and\n\n101\n00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.670\nother mechanisms to assess risk and\n\n102\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.450\nunderstand how to prioritize\nneed are helpful.\n\n103\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.670\nBut ultimately we wanna focus in and\nmanage those key focus in on,\n\n104\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.550\nand manage those key services.\n\n105\n00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.690\nWhat about operational databases, right?\n\n106\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.150\nThings like are System Center Ops Manager,\noperational database or\n\n107\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.435\nsystems that are Ops Manager.\n\n108\n00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:35.251\nData warehouse database or\nshare point backend databases or\n\n109\n00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:40.048\nexchange backend databases or\nsystems that are config manager databases.\n\n110\n00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.559\nThere's all this different area and\nentry points for\n\n111\n00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.490\ndata that we need to think about.\n\n112\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.676\nAudit Collection Services on SCOM\nhas its own set of databases.\n\n113\n00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:52.082\nSQL Server Reporting Services uses its\nown set of databases to drive reporting.\n\n114\n00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:55.600\nThis kind of stuff is gonna be\nimportant for us to think about.\n\n115\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.847\nNot every database is as\nimportant as every other one.\n\n116\n00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:00.237\nBut all of them are in need of monitoring,\nmaintenance, care and\n\n117\n00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:01.414\nfeeding in order to be healthy.\n\n118\n00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:04.510\nSo you'll want to think\nabout that as well.\n\n119\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.901\nWeb services, IoS and related websites.\n\n120\n00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:08.368\nThese are gonna be important for\nus to think about.\n\n121\n00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:12.397\nToday, more and more almost without\nexception I would think, it would be very\n\n122\n00:06:12.397 --> 00:06:15.990\nhard for us to think about instances\nwhere this is not the case.\n\n123\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.090\nHave some sort of web service running\nsomewhere in our organization.\n\n124\n00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.920\nEven if it's just limited to do something\nlike directory services management with\n\n125\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.693\ncertificates.\n\n126\n00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:29.912\nWhere we have to issue certificates to the\nActive Directory Certificate Services plug\n\n127\n00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:31.890\nin if we're Microsoft centric.\n\n128\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.232\nWe need a website, the certificate server\nwebsite is up and running to do that.\n\n129\n00:06:35.232 --> 00:06:39.594\nIf we are using the,\n[COUGH] IIS platform to be able to\n\n130\n00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:44.600\ninteract with things like\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n131\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.775\nWe're gonna be hosting certain\nwebsites that are available for\n\n132\n00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:51.960\nus through the web console for instance,\nthe application, diagnostics console.\n\n133\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.971\nThe application assessments\nthat we in trouble shooting we\n\n134\n00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:56.410\ndo as a result to that.\n\n135\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.580\nThese console rely on web services and\nhave to be hosted in an IIS platform.\n\n136\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.860\nSo these kinds of consults are important.\n\n137\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.180\nSo web consults in general or\nwebsites that we're connecting into.\n\n138\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.730\nSo we're gonna have a lot of these needs,\n\n139\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.625\nand web services are gonna\nbe fairly ubiquitous today.\n\n140\n00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.305\nYou may not think about that and\nyou may not realize that.\n\n141\n00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:16.415\nYou may not stop and say, wow,\nI am really running web servers.\n\n142\n00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:19.605\nBut more often than not, we find a few\nthat are running as we start to look.\n\n143\n00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:23.079\nSo we may need to worry about that and\nfigure out what the supported sites.\n\n144\n00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:27.621\nCertainly hardware, so memory,\nCPU, network cards, storage,\n\n145\n00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:32.165\nthe fundamental underlying elements\nof the fabric that we create to\n\n146\n00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:35.642\nbe able to run and\nto maintain infrastructure.\n\n147\n00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:37.179\nThis stuff all has to be monitored.\n\n148\n00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.441\nApplication workloads running on top,\n\n149\n00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.820\nthose operating systems\nhave to be monitored.\n\n150\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.111\nYou my laugh when somebody says to you\nhey, how many instances of Notepad,\n\n151\n00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.420\nor how many instances of this or\nthat are we running?\n\n152\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.534\nAnd I'm not suggesting you wanna monitor\nall of the instances of Notepad,\n\n153\n00:07:51.534 --> 00:07:53.423\ncuz there's no value in that,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n154\n00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:57.313\nBut what I'm just simply pointing out\nis you would wanna understand how many\n\n155\n00:07:57.313 --> 00:08:00.305\ninstances of IIS are running,\nand IIS is an application.\n\n156\n00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:04.244\nYou would wanna understand how many\ninstances of that .NET application That\n\n157\n00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:07.708\ncode that you're running,\nthat web app or whatever it is, right?\n\n158\n00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.820\nYou'd wanna understand how many\ninstances of those are running.\n\n159\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.427\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n160\n00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:13.960\nyou wanna be able to monitor those because\nthey may not all behave the same way.\n\n161\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.099\nThey may not all be equal, so to speak.\n\n162\n00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:19.001\nAnd even if they are, right,\neverybody has about day from time to time.\n\n163\n00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:21.840\nLook at me, I'm having a bad hair day,\ntoday, and I'm still here.\n\n164\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.978\n&gt;&gt; You and me both, Adam.\n\n165\n00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:23.848\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n166\n00:08:23.848 --> 00:08:25.328\nI\"m just taking the bullet on that one.\n\n167\n00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:26.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n168\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.158\n&gt;&gt; I'm front and center.\n\n169\n00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:29.268\nPeople aren't seeing you except for\na quick cut away.\n\n170\n00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:33.072\nWhen they do you're always doing this\nbefore and you look nice when you come on.\n\n171\n00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:34.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do that once, in the beginning.\n\n172\n00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:37.248\n30 minutes later, I look like I\nwas driving in a convertible for\n\n173\n00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:38.318\n10 minutes, right?\n\n174\n00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:40.076\nSo the reality is, and by the way,\n\n175\n00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:43.178\nyou never want to see me with my\nhair actually down and [SOUND].\n\n176\n00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:44.092\nNot a pretty sight.\n\n177\n00:08:44.092 --> 00:08:46.923\nRandom aside, this is my random aside for\nthe episode, by the way.\n\n178\n00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:51.205\nSo we've talked a little bit off-camera\nabout my varied background, the fact that\n\n179\n00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:54.840\nI was in the music business and\nyou know we've done a variety of things.\n\n180\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.925\nSo I had a friend years ago,\nwho had one of these-\n\n181\n00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:00.738\n&gt;&gt; Perm?\n\n182\n00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:01.753\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess you could call it a perm.\n\n183\n00:09:01.753 --> 00:09:05.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was a big kind of big springy.\n\n184\n00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:07.478\nYou know the people that are naturally,\ntheir hair is kinda naturally curly?\n\n185\n00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.929\n&gt;&gt; Like the big, it would become like he\nhad huge hair is what I'm trying to say.\n\n187\n00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:14.306\nI'm just over complicating everything.\n\n188\n00:09:14.306 --> 00:09:15.581\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n189\n00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:19.902\nhe had just a really really like puffy,\nbig, kinda springy head of hair.\n\n190\n00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:22.694\nAnd so when he would blow it out, right?\n\n191\n00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:24.718\nCuz he would he would kinda blowing out.\n\n192\n00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:27.598\nAnd so when you would see it all teased,\nblown out and stuff.\n\n193\n00:09:27.598 --> 00:09:30.543\nAnd literally,\nit look like one of those big, again,\n\n194\n00:09:30.543 --> 00:09:32.792\nI need those safety guard by rail things.\n\n195\n00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:35.323\n[LAUGH] Look at my hands they're\nlike they're gone I'm like.\n\n196\n00:09:35.323 --> 00:09:37.545\nIt would be great if they came\nout on the other monitor and\n\n197\n00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:39.069\nlike you would see them at the bottom.\n\n198\n00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:42.930\nSo I would do this, and then you would\nsee like one coming up from here.\n\n199\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.320\nBut it would have to be over here.\n\n200\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.329\nSo it looked,\nyou wouldn't be able to see my arm.\n\n201\n00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:49.515\nSo it looked almost like that, right?\n\n202\n00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:50.329\nThat would be freaky.\n\n203\n00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:51.189\n&gt;&gt; That would.\n&gt;&gt; That would be kind of\n\n204\n00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:51.980\ncool, we could do that.\n\n205\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.740\nSo anyway,\nhe would have this huge head of hair.\n\n206\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.955\nYou would see him with it, and\nit was just like a bird's nest.\n\n207\n00:09:57.955 --> 00:09:59.742\nAnd it was just kinda crazy\nwhen that would happen.\n\n208\n00:09:59.742 --> 00:10:01.405\nI have no idea why we're\ntalking about this, by the way.\n\n209\n00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:02.365\nIt's totally random.\n\n210\n00:10:02.365 --> 00:10:04.255\nWe're gonna get back talking\nabout important stuff.\n\n211\n00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:07.225\nSo when we think about\napplication monitoring, and\n\n212\n00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:09.595\nwe think about this overall\nthought process, right?\n\n213\n00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:11.860\nWith regards to monitoring in the cloud.\n\n214\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.600\nWe have to think about the fact,\nwe talked about this in the last episode,\n\n215\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.350\nthat our cloud may be on-prem, right?\n\n216\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.260\nSo private on-prem hosted ourselves.\n\n217\n00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.300\nWe obviously,\nclearly can do all the monitoring for\n\n218\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.260\nthat because we have the capabilities.\n\n219\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.870\nWe've been talking about all the things\nthat would be available to this.\n\n220\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.710\nWe may be doing private cloud but\nhosted off-prem.\n\n221\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.130\nMicrosoft may be running it for\n\n222\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.020\nus in the Azure fabric up in\none of their data centers.\n\n223\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.070\nCan we monitor there?\n\n224\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.930\nWell, of course we can.\n\n225\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.980\nWe can use Azure based monitoring.\n\n226\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.530\nAzure Analytics, for instance,\nwould be used, one of the Azure products.\n\n227\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.740\nBut we may be to monitor from\non-prem into our private cloud.\n\n228\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.760\nWe may have an instance of System Center\nOps Manager running on Prem monitoring our\n\n229\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.991\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n230\n00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:52.820\nWe can integrate the usual management\npack, and we can be doing that.\n\n231\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.482\nWe also are gonna use what's called\nOMS the Operations Manager Suite which\n\n232\n00:10:56.482 --> 00:10:58.642\nessentially Ops Manager online for Azure.\n\n233\n00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:00.938\nAnd we can monitor through the cloud, and\n\n234\n00:11:00.938 --> 00:11:04.890\neither back down into our on prem\ninfrastructure or either way.\n\n235\n00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.303\nSo we have a lot of flexibility, a lot of\ncapabilities today with this platform and\n\n236\n00:11:08.303 --> 00:11:09.203\nthe things we can do.\n\n237\n00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:10.538\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good, I mean, Notepad,\n\n238\n00:11:10.538 --> 00:11:13.433\nlike you've mentioned, is probably not\nsomething you're wanting to monitor.\n\n239\n00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:16.784\nBut I've been in situations where I've\nbeen responsible with complying with\n\n240\n00:11:16.784 --> 00:11:20.300\nlicensing, and so you might wanna keep\nan eye on things like that, as well maybe?\n\n241\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, cuz you want to know\nusage or at least license instances,\n\n242\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.860\nlicense installs.\n\n243\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.450\nAnd that would be a function of what\nwe do, broader in terms of its overall\n\n244\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.910\nmonitoring and not a specific to hey,\nis it running healthy all the time.\n\n245\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.210\nBut rather are we running licensed and\nwe should certainly be able to do that and\n\n246\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.550\nbe thinking about that as part\nof a good risk management,\n\n247\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.850\nrisk mitigation strategy overall.\n\n248\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.640\nWe are thinking broadly about him,\nalthough we haven't called him out as\n\n249\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.400\nsuch, but we're talking broadly about what\nwe would commonly refer to as KPIs, right.\n\n250\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.350\nThings that we're gonna monitor,\nthings that we want to be aware of and\n\n251\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.100\nwhat's that level set for us?\n\n252\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.780\nWhat's that baseline that says healthy?\n\n253\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.100\nPerhaps our operational\nparameters within are healthy and\n\n254\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.050\nthen outside on the other side is good or\nbad.\n\n255\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.185\nWe're talking about defining KPIs,\nkey performance indicators.\n\n256\n00:12:02.185 --> 00:12:06.327\nAnd the KPIs are gonna vary, depending on\nwhat the infrastructure is, what we're\n\n257\n00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:10.750\nmonitoring, what our usage of it is, what\nthe context locally for what we need is.\n\n258\n00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.060\nWe often talk about the idea\nof having one size fits one.\n\n259\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.137\nBut a lot of times, industry,\nbeing what it is and people talking and\n\n260\n00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.330\nhearing things over and over again.\n\n261\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.469\nWe keep hearing,\nit's the best practice to do this.\n\n262\n00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:26.301\nOr you have to do this, and\nthis is what you need to be successful.\n\n263\n00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:28.789\nAnd I have this conversation\nwith customers all the time.\n\n264\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.090\nIt's important to be aware of the hey,\ndo it this way so\n\n265\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.200\nit's run correctly, thought process.\n\n266\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.670\nHey, this is the best practice,\nthought process.\n\n267\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.400\nBut, what you don't want to do is get so\ntied into that.\n\n268\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.700\nThat you think that if it's not that way,\nthat it's not right for you.\n\n269\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.260\nIt may very well not be right for you.\n\n270\n00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.980\nThat may actually be the right outcome.\n\n271\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.880\nBut it also may actually\nbe perfectly acceptable for\n\n272\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.060\nyou to be out beyond that thought\nprocess of the context of your usage.\n\n273\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.060\nAnd the organizational parameters,\nthe business requirements you're driving\n\n274\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.040\ntowards, are different than the case\nstudy that that standard is based on.\n\n275\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.920\nAnd a lot of times, those best practices\nare important to be aware of, they should\n\n276\n00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.250\nbe taking and distilled internalized,\nbut they have to then be applied through\n\n277\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.790\nthe lens, through the context, through\nthe filter of your organizational needs.\n\n278\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.970\nAnd that's the part a lot of customers,\na lot of people miss.\n\n279\n00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.482\nAnd they get hung up on things that\njust don't make a lot of sense.\n\n280\n00:13:21.482 --> 00:13:24.219\nAnd make life a lot harder for\nthemselves I find ultimately, right,\n\n281\n00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:25.270\nthan it should be.\n\n282\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.407\nDefine your KPIs, don't be afraid to say,\ndefinitively the line in the sand,\n\n283\n00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:30.909\nhey this what we're doing.\n\n284\n00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:33.968\nBut at the same time, make sure they're\nrelevant, make sure they're contextual.\n\n285\n00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:38.367\nMake sure they make sense, make sure that\noperationally you can live up to them.\n\n286\n00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:41.891\nThat you're SLAs or\nservice level agreements define them, and\n\n287\n00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:45.229\nthat you can hold yourself and\nothers accountable for them.\n\n288\n00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:48.415\nBecause if you don't put them in writing,\nyou don't document them,\n\n289\n00:13:48.415 --> 00:13:49.934\nyou can't manage against them.\n\n290\n00:13:49.934 --> 00:13:52.833\nThen there's really no way to define\nwhether you've been successful or\n\n291\n00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:53.790\nnot at achieving them.\n\n292\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.354\nAll the metrics and dashboards in the\nworld are not gonna definitively tell you\n\n293\n00:13:57.354 --> 00:14:01.249\nsomething, if you can't look at a standard\nthat says, and this is what we expected.\n\n294\n00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:04.590\nOr by extension, this is what we didn't\nexpect, because we didn't get it.\n\n295\n00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.150\nSo, keep that in mind and\ndo understand that.\n\n296\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.300\nCreating those SLAs,\nthose Service Level Agreements and\n\n297\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.410\nunderstanding how to manage against them,\nis such an important part of cloud.\n\n298\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.340\nSuch an important part of operating and\nmanaging a data center and\n\n299\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.200\ncloud infrastructure today.\n\n300\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.090\nYou really can't do this and do this the\nright way without having SLAs in place and\n\n301\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.930\nagain customers I talk with all the time,\nstudents I talk to in classes\n\n302\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.620\nwhen I'm on site working with\ncustomers as a consultant.\n\n303\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.740\nI get this all the time.\n\n304\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.610\nI'm sure you've seen this or\nheard about this or had to deal with this.\n\n305\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.893\nAs you've been doing things and\n\n306\n00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:39.659\nyou know you were working in various\nplaces working with companies.\n\n307\n00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:44.071\nYou know a lot of times when it's\nprivate on print we own our own cloud\n\n308\n00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:45.620\ninfrastructure.\n\n309\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.470\nIt's essentially our data center,\nwe're doing everything ourselves.\n\n310\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.730\nWe tend to forget that SLAs\nare equally applicable\n\n311\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.330\nto us as an organization internally.\n\n312\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.171\nWe may call them something different,\n\n313\n00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:58.620\nITIL is a formal framework if\nyou're familiar with ITIL.\n\n314\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.299\nOr if you prefer IT IL, right?\n\n315\n00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.419\nEither way, because I've heard\nit pronounced both ways.\n\n316\n00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:02.017\n&gt;&gt; Like a Skittle?\n\n317\n00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:03.247\n&gt;&gt; Like a Skittle.\n\n318\n00:15:03.247 --> 00:15:04.460\nThat's the first time I've heard ittle.\n\n319\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hear it pronounced Ittle,\n\n320\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.553\neven though that may not necessarily\nbe the way you hear it pronounced.\n\n321\n00:15:08.553 --> 00:15:09.162\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:15:09.162 --> 00:15:10.289\n&gt;&gt; I've heard it'll,\n\n323\n00:15:10.289 --> 00:15:12.362\nI've heard I til, I've heard it ill.\n\n324\n00:15:12.362 --> 00:15:14.338\nI've heard all sorts of things, but\n\n325\n00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:18.305\nI-T-I-L I-T is an Information\nTechnology Infrastructure Library.\n\n326\n00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:20.700\nIt's what ITIL as a acronym stands for.\n\n327\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.510\nIt is a service management framework\nan IT Centric Service Centric Framework,\n\n328\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.570\nvery popular in the world been around for\nmany many years now.\n\n329\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.616\nAnd when I do a lot of work in the ITIL\nframework, do a lot of ITIL work help\n\n330\n00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:36.743\ncustomers understand how to implement and\nbuild out their frameworks.\n\n331\n00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:40.386\nBut when I talk to customers about\nthe fact that when you own your own\n\n332\n00:15:40.386 --> 00:15:43.055\ndata center,\nyou own your own infrastructure,\n\n333\n00:15:43.055 --> 00:15:47.506\nyour doing your own private cloud hosted\ninternally, managed by your company.\n\n334\n00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:50.317\nEssentially, IT has become\nthe cloud service provider, right?\n\n335\n00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:51.455\nI mean, we've just swapped out the name.\n\n336\n00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; We just, you know, they say it's IT.\n\n337\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.161\nThe reality is IT is now\na cloud service provider.\n\n338\n00:15:56.161 --> 00:16:00.073\nAnd if you don't have the tools and\ntechnology to manage that cloud,\n\n339\n00:16:00.073 --> 00:16:02.911\nyou're gonna go out of\nbusiness really quickly.\n\n340\n00:16:02.911 --> 00:16:06.391\nAnd then you come and say we're not\ngonna outsource our IT infrastructure,\n\n341\n00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:07.878\nI'm not suggesting you should.\n\n342\n00:16:07.878 --> 00:16:11.047\nBut what I'm simply pointing out is\nthat if you're gonna call it a cloud and\n\n343\n00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:13.916\nmanage it internally, you better\nhave the tools and techniques and\n\n344\n00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:15.820\ntechnology to do it the right way.\n\n345\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.729\nYou may not refer to these documents and\nthese agreements and\n\n346\n00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:21.311\nthese baselines as SLAs,\nbut that's what they are.\n\n347\n00:16:21.311 --> 00:16:25.468\nITIL calls them OLAs, operational-level\nagreements when they're internal to\n\n348\n00:16:25.468 --> 00:16:29.756\nthe organization, internal facing SLAs\nare called OLAs, in the language of ITIL.\n\n349\n00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:32.070\nYou don't have to call them OLAs, right?\n\n350\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.734\nBut you gotta call them something, and\n\n351\n00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:36.020\nwhen I talk to customers I\ndo audit work I show up.\n\n352\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.637\nYou say hey, we're gonna do an audit,\nlet's take a look at your documentation.\n\n353\n00:16:38.637 --> 00:16:41.344\nDo a lot of that kind of work\nas you've heard me talk about,\n\n354\n00:16:41.344 --> 00:16:45.320\nsometimes with Cherokee, sometimes with\nothers in our security focus shows.\n\n355\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.530\nWhen we go through these stuff,\nwe expect to be able to see hey,\n\n356\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.236\nit's written down, this is what's\nbeing used, it's standardized.\n\n357\n00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:55.589\nEverybody agrees to it and\nwe hold ourselves accountable, and\n\n358\n00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:58.440\nwe hold people responsible\nto these standards.\n\n359\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.177\nIf you can't produce that documentation,\nyou're not doing something the right way.\n\n360\n00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:05.746\nAnd you don't wanna start down the path\nof managing your own private Cloud,\n\n361\n00:17:05.746 --> 00:17:07.530\noptimizing and maintaining it.\n\n362\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.687\nIf you don't know what\nthe requirements are to be successful,\n\n363\n00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:11.816\nhow are you gonna know whether\nyou're doing a good job or not?\n\n364\n00:17:11.816 --> 00:17:14.710\nSo I don't care what you're\ncall it at the end of the day.\n\n365\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.959\nI would like you to call it an SLA,\nbut I don't care what you call it.\n\n366\n00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:21.656\nWhat I care about is that you have\na published standard that says this equals\n\n367\n00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:24.620\nsuccess, and\nyou're managing to that standard.\n\n368\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.896\nAnd hopefully achieving success as\na result of being able to implement that\n\n369\n00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:29.515\nstandard across the organization.\n\n370\n00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:33.410\nAnd then create monitoring and create\ninfrastructure management systems and\n\n371\n00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.240\ntools that allow you to show that that\nsuccess is actually taking place.\n\n372\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.346\nThis is the value of he SLA,\nthis is why this is so important.\n\n373\n00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:44.518\nTo that end, and speaking of Cloud-related\nservices and how we do this in the Cloud\n\n374\n00:17:44.518 --> 00:17:48.571\nwith Microsoft, with Azure for instance,\nhosted external to our data center,\n\n375\n00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:51.930\nif we take a look back here,\nI just wanna show you some of the stuff.\n\n376\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.737\nWe talked about this a little\nbit in the last episode, but\n\n377\n00:17:54.737 --> 00:17:58.716\nAzure and the Azure fabric, specifically\nPowerShell's gonna become such a key\n\n378\n00:17:58.716 --> 00:18:02.363\ncomponent of what we do, it's already\na very big component of what we do.\n\n379\n00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:07.172\nBut being able to automate, being able to\nscript out the things you wanna have done,\n\n380\n00:18:07.172 --> 00:18:10.966\nand use an operational shell of\nsome kind to manage infrastructure\n\n381\n00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:14.710\nis becoming the standard and\nthe norm for most of what we do.\n\n382\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.745\nEspecially if you're gonna interact with\nthe Cloud through Azure in our Cloud\n\n383\n00:18:18.745 --> 00:18:21.137\nfabric up at the Microsoft\ndata center level.\n\n384\n00:18:21.137 --> 00:18:25.640\nYou've gotta be using PowerShell because\nthe consoles we give you, the capabilities\n\n385\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.320\nwe give you are typically driven through\nmanagement shells as opposed to through.\n\n386\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.702\nAnd we do have graphical interfaces,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n387\n00:18:32.702 --> 00:18:35.520\nOffice 365 has a graphical interface.\n\n388\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.143\nWe have a whole portal that you can\nuse and dashboards for everything, but\n\n389\n00:18:39.143 --> 00:18:40.897\nthere's also a management pack for\n\n390\n00:18:40.897 --> 00:18:44.535\nWindows Azure AD that you can use to\nbe able to manage the infrastructure.\n\n391\n00:18:44.535 --> 00:18:47.092\nThere is a PowerShell module,\nI should say,\n\n392\n00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:51.870\nthat allows you to give that capability,\nso you do wanna be familiar with this.\n\n393\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.357\nThis page here will give us some guidance\non the Azure PowerShell cmdlets,\n\n394\n00:18:56.357 --> 00:18:57.290\nas you can see.\n\n395\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.224\nWe do have the ability to be able\nto get some information about them.\n\n396\n00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:05.742\nWe've got the ability to understand how to\nuse them, how to install and configure and\n\n397\n00:19:05.742 --> 00:19:07.270\nuse Azure PowerShell.\n\n398\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.384\nSo if you're not familiar with it, we've\ngot a little video here which you can go\n\n399\n00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:14.851\nin, or not a video rather, but\na little how-to which you can go in.\n\n400\n00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:17.159\nJust click here one second.\n\n401\n00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:20.141\nWe can go through,\nwe can learn how to do this.\n\n402\n00:19:20.141 --> 00:19:23.492\nYou'll install the Azure PowerShell,\nthey've got the links here,\n\n403\n00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:25.510\nthey tell you how to go in and do this.\n\n404\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.571\nYou install module Azure RM for rights\nmanagement, and then you go through,\n\n405\n00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:31.268\nconnect to your Azure account.\n\n406\n00:19:31.268 --> 00:19:34.730\nSo you set up your Azure subscription,\nand then you connect to it.\n\n407\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.167\nYou then can go ahead, and\nonce you've done this as you'll see,\n\n408\n00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:42.103\nrun the Azure PowerShell cmdlets so\nyou can log in, then you can go ahead and\n\n409\n00:19:42.103 --> 00:19:43.435\nget your subscription.\n\n410\n00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:47.022\nThen you can go ahead and specify or\nauthenticate into the specific tenant or\n\n411\n00:19:47.022 --> 00:19:50.104\nsubscription you need to use, and\nthen you're able to go in, and\n\n412\n00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:51.688\nyou're able to start managing.\n\n413\n00:19:51.688 --> 00:19:55.114\nAs you go down and go through here,\nit gives you some information.\n\n414\n00:19:55.114 --> 00:19:59.425\nWe talk about versioning a little bit, we\ntalk about the Azure PowerShell modules,\n\n415\n00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:03.410\nthe Azure resource manager,\nservice management, the Azure storage.\n\n416\n00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.657\nAnd you can go through and see all\nthe different areas you need to work in.\n\n417\n00:20:06.657 --> 00:20:08.893\nSo you'll be able to get documentation and\n\n418\n00:20:08.893 --> 00:20:11.750\nguidance on how to connect\ninto the Microsoft Cloud and\n\n419\n00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.380\nmanage the infrastructure that\nyou're gonna stand up there.\n\n420\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.975\nOr link that infrastructure and\nmanage it from the on-prem side,\n\n421\n00:20:18.975 --> 00:20:23.416\nbecause now you can connect to any, you'll\nkind of coordinate the usage of this.\n\n422\n00:20:23.416 --> 00:20:26.170\nSo it's gonna be important for\nyou to be thinking about this.\n\n423\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.634\nGoing out we just go back up here.\n\n424\n00:20:27.634 --> 00:20:31.877\nGoing out into the Microsoft Azure area,\nsetting up maybe a free account and\n\n425\n00:20:31.877 --> 00:20:36.300\ndemoing how you can get this stood up and\nusing it would be valuable for you.\n\n426\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.843\nAnd you can do that,\nit's not very difficult to do.\n\n427\n00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:42.976\nIf you go in here, you could set up\na free Azure account as you can see,\n\n428\n00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:45.921\nyou get $200 in hosting credits currently.\n\n429\n00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:47.733\nYou could try different services.\n\n430\n00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:49.860\nThat's a pretty cool dashboard\nas you can see there.\n\n431\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.590\nThis is what the fabric management\ninterface looks like behind the scenes.\n\n432\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.912\nSo you could see, this is just an animated\nwalk through that's just on the page that\n\n433\n00:20:58.912 --> 00:21:00.440\nrolls and just cycles.\n\n434\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.287\nBut this is the management interface\nbehind the scenes, it's what you're using.\n\n435\n00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:06.980\nAnd we can go ahead, you just click\nStart for free, it's very easy.\n\n436\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.104\nYou just go ahead and log in.\n\n437\n00:21:08.104 --> 00:21:10.906\nIf you don't have an account,\nI know it's kind of hard to see, but\n\n438\n00:21:10.906 --> 00:21:13.609\ndown here you can create a new\nMicrosoft account right here, and\n\n439\n00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:16.334\nthen you just walk through the steps\nof being able to set this up.\n\n440\n00:21:16.334 --> 00:21:18.577\nIt's very, very simple, very easy to do.\n\n441\n00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:21.768\nBut then you have all the solutions,\nthe products, the documentation,\n\n442\n00:21:21.768 --> 00:21:23.580\neverything right up here on the website.\n\n443\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.607\nSo integrating Systems Center\nwith Azure is very simple to do.\n\n444\n00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:30.915\nYou need the Azure management packs,\nyou need the Azure subscription.\n\n445\n00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:34.175\nBut once you have those pieces in place,\nbeing able to go in and\n\n446\n00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:38.328\ndownload and use the Systems Center\nmonitoring pack for Azure applications.\n\n447\n00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:41.306\nIf you're hosting your\napplications on the Cloud stack,\n\n448\n00:21:41.306 --> 00:21:45.497\nthe Microsoft Azure Management Pack as\nI mentioned as well, downloading those,\n\n449\n00:21:45.497 --> 00:21:48.718\nintegrating those into SCOM,\nthe System Center Ops Manager,\n\n450\n00:21:48.718 --> 00:21:52.270\nit's just a matter of importing\nthe appropriate management packs.\n\n451\n00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.637\nYou can do it from the catalog directly\nonline, you can do it downloading and\n\n452\n00:21:55.637 --> 00:21:56.696\nadding them from disk.\n\n453\n00:21:56.696 --> 00:21:59.220\nYou go out and grab the .MP or .MPB files,\n\n454\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.300\nthe Management Pack or\nManagement Pack Bundle extended files.\n\n455\n00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.875\nYou load them up, you then have the\ncapability that the Management Pack brings\n\n456\n00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:10.392\nin all the objects are loaded into\nthe System Center Ops Manager console, and\n\n457\n00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:13.609\nyou could then go through and\nuse them and manage them with no trouble.\n\n458\n00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:17.101\nWe can also leverage as I said,\nthings like Azure site recovery, so\n\n459\n00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:20.104\nwe can use the Azure fabric to\ndo our data center recovery or\n\n460\n00:22:20.104 --> 00:22:22.649\ndata center level recovery\nof infrastructure.\n\n461\n00:22:22.649 --> 00:22:27.477\nWe have the Azure Integration Pack for\nOrchestrator, so we have the Azure fabric\n\n462\n00:22:27.477 --> 00:22:32.021\nactivities that can be integrated into\nOrchestrator to create workflows.\n\n463\n00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:34.997\nThat we can then link to Azure and\nlaunch workflows there.\n\n464\n00:22:34.997 --> 00:22:39.522\nOrchestrator, as a product,\ndoes its importation of management\n\n465\n00:22:39.522 --> 00:22:43.498\ncapabilities through what it\ncalled integration packs.\n\n466\n00:22:43.498 --> 00:22:47.386\nYou import those management capabilities\ninto Systems Center Ops Manager as\n\n467\n00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:48.870\nmanagement packs.\n\n468\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.208\nSlightly different name but ultimately\nthey mean roughly the same thing.\n\n469\n00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:56.119\nIn integration, or in the integration\npack you're getting the activities\n\n470\n00:22:56.119 --> 00:23:00.407\nthat Orchestrator will use to represent\nworkflow with System Center Ops Manager.\n\n471\n00:23:00.407 --> 00:23:03.628\nWith management pack you're getting\nthe objects that represent monitoring\n\n472\n00:23:03.628 --> 00:23:07.062\ncapabilities that SCOM will use and deploy\nto be able to monitor infrastructure.\n\n473\n00:23:07.062 --> 00:23:10.156\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and you see the subtle but\n\n474\n00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:13.440\nimportant differences in how we\nbring that infrastructure in.\n\n475\n00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.777\nBut we're gonna add in\ncapabilities along the way.\n\n476\n00:23:15.777 --> 00:23:20.492\nWe have Orchestrator integration packs for\nsystem set of Virtual Machine Manager, for\n\n477\n00:23:20.492 --> 00:23:23.650\nall the different areas of\nthe system center suite.\n\n478\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.044\nAnd we bring those in so that we can\nthen use the Orchestrator products\n\n479\n00:23:27.044 --> 00:23:30.396\nto do workflow and to create workflow\nautomation across the stack.\n\n480\n00:23:30.396 --> 00:23:32.145\nSo we have a lot of\ndifferent capabilities,\n\n481\n00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.668\njust depending on what we're doing.\n\n482\n00:23:33.668 --> 00:23:36.478\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n483\n00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:38.368\nDid you have any other final thoughts?\n\n484\n00:23:38.368 --> 00:23:40.256\n&gt;&gt; Well, you already told them that\nthere's nothing else I can say, so\n\n485\n00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:41.050\nit would be inappropriate.\n\n486\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.977\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm giving you an opportunity.\n\n487\n00:23:43.977 --> 00:23:44.666\n&gt;&gt; Inappropriate for\n\n488\n00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:47.380\nme to say something now because\nyou've already said we're done.\n\n489\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.440\nI do actually have just one other thing\nquickly, which is to remind you if you're\n\n490\n00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.563\nwatching this episode, and\njust to give you a preview.\n\n491\n00:23:52.563 --> 00:23:55.482\nThat we are gonna be doing a whole series\nof episodes that will follow this, and\n\n492\n00:23:55.482 --> 00:23:56.956\nhopefully you will take a look at them.\n\n493\n00:23:56.956 --> 00:23:59.701\nWith hands-on installation of\nall the different aspects of\n\n494\n00:23:59.701 --> 00:24:02.820\nthe System Center Suite,\nwe're gonna go through the products, and\n\n495\n00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.600\nwe're gonna implement each one.\n\n496\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.036\nShow you how to install them, and\nwalk through the installation of those\n\n497\n00:24:08.036 --> 00:24:10.638\nparticular products and\nshow you how to stand them up.\n\n498\n00:24:10.638 --> 00:24:13.705\nSo we'll stand up SCOM,\nwe'll send up Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n499\n00:24:13.705 --> 00:24:17.780\nwe'll take a look at Orchestrator, stand\nthat up, take a look at service manager.\n\n500\n00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.817\nSo we're gonna go through and set up and\n\n501\n00:24:19.817 --> 00:24:24.016\nconfigure how all these products are going\nto be out of the box kind of installed,\n\n502\n00:24:24.016 --> 00:24:27.076\nand given to you so\nyou can start monitoring and managing.\n\n503\n00:24:27.076 --> 00:24:30.210\nAnd then based on that,\nwe'll have a good platform to build on.\n\n504\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.787\nSo as we continue talking about\nhow to actually operate and\n\n505\n00:24:32.787 --> 00:24:35.942\nmonitor your private cloud,\nyou'll have seen all the moving parts and\n\n506\n00:24:35.942 --> 00:24:38.887\nyou'll understand what all those\nreferences are we keep using for\n\n507\n00:24:38.887 --> 00:24:41.539\nall these products that you may or\nmay not have seen before.\n\n508\n00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:44.161\nSo I invite you to go take a look at\nthose if you haven't had a chance,\n\n509\n00:24:44.161 --> 00:24:47.005\nbecause you've been watching our\nepisodes in order up until now.\n\n510\n00:24:47.005 --> 00:24:50.555\nThey're gonna be coming up after this, and\nif you have already seen them, well good\n\n511\n00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:53.811\nfor you cuz you're an over-achiever and\nwe like that, that's important.\n\n512\n00:24:53.811 --> 00:24:56.221\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Adam for\nproviding a framework and\n\n513\n00:24:56.221 --> 00:24:59.191\nfoundational understanding of\nwhat the Cloud concept is, and\n\n514\n00:24:59.191 --> 00:25:03.310\nalso those tools that you provided us\nwith all links and extra information.\n\n515\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.797\nBut like Adam promised, we do want\nyou guys to stay tuned because we\n\n516\n00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:10.058\nhave some hands-on demonstrations\ncoming up very shortly.\n\n517\n00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:11.786\nSo make sure you hang around for that.\n\n518\n00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:13.809\nOtherwise, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign

I'm your show host\n\n8\n00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:18.144\nCherokee Boose.\nIn this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:20.193\nwe'll looking at how to configure and\noperate a private cloud environment.\n\n10\n00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.460\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.340\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody,\nhope you're doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.980\nWe're gonna be talking about and\ncontinuing our conversations with regards\n\n14\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.740\nto how to set up, as Cherokee was saying,\nconfiguring private cloud environments.\n\n15\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.920\nRemember private cloud with regards\nto what we're talking about here\n\n16\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.490\nis primarily gonna be focusing\naround the use of system center\n\n17\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.060\nvirtual machine manager to\ndo our cloud fabric for us.\n\n18\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.180\nThink of that as being our blank\ncanvas that we're going to paint\n\n19\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.040\nour beautiful virtual environment,\nthe cloud, upon.\n\n20\n00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.550\nWe're gonna be doing that with\na number two fine line paintbrush.\n\n21\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.720\n&gt;&gt; Lots of happy trees.\n\n22\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Lots of happy trees.\n\n23\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.230\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat all that in a little bit.\n\n24\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.360\nWe are gonna take you into the console,\nshow you a little bit more about VMM.\n\n25\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.075\nIf you haven't seen the episodes where\nwe did the System Center installation\n\n26\n00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.470\nwalk-through on all\nthe different suite of products,\n\n27\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.690\nyou probably wanna go back to\ntake a quick look at that.\n\n28\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.550\nWe did a pretty extensive\nwalk-through of how to install and\n\n29\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.180\nconfigure all the various components\nin System Center, VMM was among them.\n\n30\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.860\nShowed you how to stand that product\nup and make sure it was working.\n\n31\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.320\nWe also talked about and stood up SCOM,\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n32\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.060\nAnd we will be referring to that\nproduct and occasionally go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910\ntake a look there for\nthe monitoring piece.\n\n34\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.880\nBut we're gonna primarily in this\nset of this discussions anyway\n\n35\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.460\nreally be focusing our attention in on\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager and\n\n36\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.690\nwhat VMM can do for\nus with regards to private cloud.\n\n37\n00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.720\nSo when we think about monitoring and\noperating the private cloud,\n\n38\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.750\nwe think about setting up the enablement\nof our private cloud infrastructure,\n\n39\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.230\nwe think about VMM.\n\n40\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.254\nVMM has a lot of key features\nthat are included with it,\n\n41\n00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:55.250\nwe've hinted at some of these, talked\nabout some of them in prior episodes.\n\n42\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.490\nThe ability to be able to set\nup our host environments so\n\n43\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.380\nat our host in and be able to see them.\n\n44\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.930\nManager across the fabric,\nbe able to setup storage networking,\n\n45\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.582\nsomething called library service\nwe'll talk more about what those are.\n\n46\n00:02:08.582 --> 00:02:10.300\nThink file structures and\n\n47\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.300\nfile server I capabilities in term of\narchiving storing things for later usage.\n\n48\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.560\nIt's what a library server primarily does.\n\n49\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.740\nBut we haven't really drilled down and\n\n50\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.070\ntalked specifically about\nsome of these features.\n\n51\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.390\nSo let's just name them off here.\n\n52\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.240\nWe've talked about the ability to\nhave multi host hyper visor support\n\n53\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.490\nin the sense that we have as we did our\ninstallation of VMM and spun it up.\n\n54\n00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.160\nTalked a little bit about the fact that we\ncan host, and the interesting thing about\n\n55\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.370\nMicrosoft System Center product line,\nspecifically SCVMM, it is the only virtual\n\n56\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.350\nmachine fabric manager in market\nright now of the three biggies.\n\n57\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.400\nWe have VMWare, we have Microsoft,\nand we have Citrix.\n\n58\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.130\nSo of those three that are kind\nof the leaders in that space,\n\n59\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.070\nthis is the only product that\nmanages across all three platforms.\n\n60\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.224\nSo we will be able to pull in\nMicrosoft HyperV Hosts and manage HyperV.\n\n61\n00:02:58.224 --> 00:03:02.820\nWe'll be able to pull in and\nmanage VMware V Center and VMware ESXI\n\n62\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.710\nhosts as a result of that, and we can pull\nin Citrix Zen servers and manage them.\n\n63\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.200\nAnd when I say manage,\nwe are not going to have\n\n64\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.380\ncomplete stack capabilities in the way\nwe would if we were using VCenter and\n\n65\n00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.310\nVSphere ESXI and the web client, yet\nwe would obviously much richer and\n\n66\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.120\nmore full management capabilities in\nthe native stack from the vendor.\n\n67\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.240\nBut we do have awareness of those\nproducts, we can see them at a high level.\n\n68\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.140\nWe can you know poke our\ntoe in the water there\n\n69\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.490\nlook under the hood see\nwhat's going on in Vcenter.\n\n70\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.898\nSee what's going on with Zen\nservers directly from VMM.\n\n71\n00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.423\nWe also can and\nindeed do have the ability through SCOM,\n\n72\n00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:43.770\nthrough the extension into System Center\nOps Manager of using management packs.\n\n73\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.910\nThat will let us reach out and\nmanage VM ware infrastructure.\n\n74\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.420\nWe can manage Vcenter.\n\n75\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.250\nWe can manage hosts, we can manage our,\nthe horizon view environment or\n\n76\n00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.420\nVDI or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure\nenvironments.\n\n77\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.130\nSo we have a lot of\ncross-platform capabilities.\n\n78\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.020\nNot to mention the Unix Linux\nmonitoring that goes on in SCOM and\n\n79\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.030\nthe ability to be able to do all of that.\n\n80\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.510\nSo we do have a very rich feature set\nassociated with the use of this product.\n\n81\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.970\nWe also have Power Shell integration.\n\n82\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.230\nSpoke a little about that.\n\n83\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.510\nSome of our prior episodes\nwe showed you the Azure.\n\n84\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.160\nA Commandlets for\nPowerShell that can be used to monitor and\n\n85\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.502\nto manage across SCOM and with SCVMM.\n\n86\n00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:19.966\nSo we've talked a little bit about that.\n\n87\n00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.450\nAnd we'll see some more\nabout that as we go.\n\n88\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.960\nWe mentioned performance and\nresource optimization,\n\n89\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.770\nwhat we will call Pro, the acronym for it.\n\n90\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.170\nPerformance and resource optimization\nis technology that sits in SCVMM,\n\n91\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.540\nthat if you're familiar with VMware,\nyou would know probably is DRS,\n\n92\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.250\nDistributed Resource Scheduling.\n\n93\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.390\nOr even just generically,\nOracle's hosting environment for\n\n94\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.830\ntheir virtual infrastructure\nhas a form of DRS as well.\n\n95\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.310\nThe idea is,\nthat we can look at resource usage, and\n\n96\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.450\nattempt to load balance, and/or scale that\nresource usage, so it is evenly spread, or\n\n97\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.370\nmore evenly spread, across the members\nof that resource pool or cluster.\n\n98\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.120\nAs opposed to front-loading one machine,\njust piling on\n\n99\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.425\nall the VMs in the requirements for\nhosting and leaving the other members,\n\n100\n00:05:06.425 --> 00:05:09.995\nthe other hosts in that resource pool or\ncluster, under-utilized.\n\n101\n00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:12.895\nWe don't wanna have an imbalance,\nin other words, and performance and\n\n102\n00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.965\nresource optimization is technology that\nallows us to try to proactively monitor\n\n103\n00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:20.470\nfor that and balance out if possible\nwhat those loads may look like.\n\n104\n00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.800\nWe have intelligent placement, the idea\npaired with PRO being able to understand\n\n105\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.190\nwhere we're going to put virtual machines\nupon power on and also throughout their\n\n106\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.850\nmanagement lifecycle as they're running\nacross resource pools or clusters.\n\n107\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.380\nWe can then be able to move them\naround with live migration so\n\n108\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.880\nthat way they stay running but they're\nrunning on different hosts and they're\n\n109\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.990\nmore balanced as a result of that based\non need and based on available resources.\n\n110\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.675\nSo this would be for us in the real world,\nthis would be similar to saying,\n\n111\n00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:53.715\nwe have a team of people, and\neverybody needs to pitch in and more or\n\n112\n00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:57.625\nless you'll do something to contribute to\nthe betterment of our little group here.\n\n113\n00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.705\nEverybody's got a job or a responsibility.\n\n114\n00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:03.805\nBut if somebody finishes early and maybe\nis idling and has time on their hands.\n\n115\n00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:06.195\nInstead of just going and\nsitting down and taking a break.\n\n116\n00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:08.845\nWe'll say,\nhey why don't you come along and chip in.\n\n117\n00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:10.760\nLet's redistribute the remaining load.\n\n118\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.040\nLet's let everybody else finish a little\nbit earlier by you helping out.\n\n119\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.770\nSo, no slackers,\nis what we would say there.\n\n120\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.140\nMake sure that everybody pulls their\nweight and does what they need to do.\n\n121\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.539\nSo that's good, if you think about\nthe thought process here and\n\n122\n00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:23.670\nthe logic of this.\n\n123\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.200\nAnd all the major vendors have\nthis technology in one form or\n\n124\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.170\nanother, as I was suggesting, but\nit's good to know that we have it here and\n\n125\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.610\nwe'll be taking a look at it.\n\n126\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.809\nWe have live migrations,\n\n127\n00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:34.861\nas I mentioned, we will call this\nVmotion on the VMware platform.\n\n128\n00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.970\nIf you're familiar with that technology\nit's what we refer to it there.\n\n129\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.460\nWe have storage migration.\n\n130\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.260\nWe will call that SV Motion or\nStorage V Motion in the VMware platform so\n\n131\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.370\nyou know what that is.\n\n132\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.100\nBut we can move with live migration\na running virtual machine\n\n133\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.900\nbetween two hosts in real-time\nwith no loss of continuity.\n\n134\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.125\nSo imagine you're running\na virtualized instance,\n\n135\n00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:57.030\nwhat we call a guest operating system.\n\n136\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.564\nYou're running a VM on my\nlaptop right over here.\n\n137\n00:07:00.564 --> 00:07:04.049\nI wanna move it over to this laptop over\nhere, but I don't wanna turn it off,\n\n138\n00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.387\nwhich is what we'd have to do in\nthe old-fashioned way of doing things.\n\n139\n00:07:07.387 --> 00:07:09.388\nSo we hosted all of our infrastructure,\nphysically.\n\n140\n00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:13.521\nI'd have to power it off,\nunrack it, move it, rack it back up,\n\n141\n00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.059\ncable it all back up, power it back on.\n\n142\n00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:19.654\nThere's a delay in time, there is\ninfrastructure management concerns,\n\n143\n00:07:19.654 --> 00:07:23.418\nmaybe I don't re-cable that thing\nthe right way, maybe I forget something,\n\n144\n00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:25.900\nmaybe I turned it off the wrong way,\nand I crash it.\n\n145\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.002\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you drop it while\nyou're moving it on over.\n\n146\n00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:29.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Could drop it hurt,\n\n147\n00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:32.360\nmy foot cuz I don't have\nmy steel-toed work boots.\n\n148\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.671\nAll these things can go wrong.\n\n149\n00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.840\nAnd so there is a lot of concern.\n\n150\n00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.166\nBut if we can move it in\nreal-time while it's running.\n\n151\n00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.814\nNever shut it off and\nnever bother to actually change out,\n\n152\n00:07:41.814 --> 00:07:46.506\nin the sense that we have to unrack and\nrerack and un-cable and re-cable,\n\n153\n00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:51.067\nall the physical and logical\nconnectivity and supporting mechanisms.\n\n154\n00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:55.090\nAll we have to do is obviously\nprogram in some stuff in the console.\n\n155\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.992\nMake sure everything is good.\n\n156\n00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:57.856\nWe have to have network connectivity,\n\n157\n00:07:57.856 --> 00:08:01.190\nwe've gotta be able to see the resource\nfrom both sides of the divide.\n\n158\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.930\nWe have to have common storage\narea in common or capable for\n\n159\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.590\naccess so the hosts can take control of\nthe VM as it moves from one to the other.\n\n160\n00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.260\nWe need a common network to do that.\n\n161\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.560\nYou know, there's obviously\nthings that have to happen.\n\n162\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.530\nBut assuming all that's in place,\nwe push a couple of buttons,\n\n163\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.870\nthis is the value of work flow,\nthis is the value of automation.\n\n164\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.940\nAnd that VM zips across and\nwe never turn it off.\n\n165\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.690\nUsers attach to it,\nnever know they're being moved.\n\n166\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.800\nAnd literally we go, and I'm gonna\nget this right, we go from here, now\n\n167\n00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.640\nwatch carefully cuz I barely, normally I'm\nable to do this but I'm gonna do it right.\n\n168\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.290\nWe're not gonna go this way cuz\nthat will be bad I go off camera,\n\n169\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.220\ninstead what are we gonna do?\n\n170\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.820\nWe're gonna go from here and it's like I'm\nhere one minute and I'm here the next.\n\n171\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.670\nIf you close your eyes and\nopen them up really quick like that.\n\n172\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.610\nYou may see me\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.740\n&gt;&gt; One place among the other and\n\n174\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.680\nnever know that I moved and\nthat's exactly what we're talking.\n\n175\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.260\nWe're gonna be able to do this migration.\n\n176\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.930\nThis live migration in real time.\n\n177\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.930\nSo did you close your eyes.\n\n178\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.060\nDid you see me.\nI can do it again if you,\n\n179\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.970\nif you open your eyes really quick and\nthen turn around,\n\n180\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.610\nit's like I went backwards you\nseem me go back the other way.\n\n181\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.050\nSo we can storage migration, same idea.\n\n182\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.010\nStorage migration allows\nme instead of moving\n\n183\n00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.330\nthe running VM between\ntwo hosts in real time.\n\n184\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.710\nWe stay on the host we're on, so we're\ngonna was stored migration stay here.\n\n185\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.220\nThe VM stays running here.\n\n186\n00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.430\nBut the backend data storage, wherever\nthat is, the data store on the SAN or\n\n187\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.200\non the NAS, wherever it is,\nis gonna get shifted.\n\n188\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.970\nAnd we're gonna take the files that make\nthe VM up and allow us to run them, and\n\n189\n00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.560\nmove them from one data store and\n\n190\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.380\nput them in another data store\nwhile the VM stays running.\n\n191\n00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.880\nAgain, no loss of continuity,\nno turning off, no need to recycle,\n\n192\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.380\nno worry about downtime,\n\n193\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.500\nno worry about maintenance windows,\nnow worry about violating our SLA.\n\n194\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.440\nAll that's good because none\nof that happens cuz we do this\n\n195\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.150\nin realtime with no loss of usage or\ncontinuity.\n\n196\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.450\nThis is the strength, this is the value,\nthis is what we get by virtualizing and\n\n197\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.830\nrunning cloud infrastructure today.\n\n198\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.210\nAnd again, to be fair and\nbe clear, certainly clearly,\n\n199\n00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.330\nwe're talking about it on\nMicrosoft infrastructure.\n\n200\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.890\nWorks well, great set of products.\n\n201\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.570\nLove the infrastructure,\ncan't say enough good things about it.\n\n202\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.250\nBut we can do this across any\nvirtualization stack vendor today.\n\n203\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.570\nI've referenced VMware for\nyou, Zen on the Citric side.\n\n204\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.720\nAny of these programs,\n\n205\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.270\nany of these products give us the same\ncapabilities in one form or another.\n\n206\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.140\nSo we have live migration,\n\n207\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.810\nstorage migration,\ndynamic optimization along with pro.\n\n208\n00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.830\nThese are the DRS like products that\nI was mentioning and referring to.\n\n209\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.610\nThere's elements of DRS in both pro and\ndynamic optimization,\n\n210\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.470\nbut we have those capabilities there.\n\n211\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.090\nNetwork virtualization, the ability to\nvirtualize the networking stack, software\n\n212\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.260\ndefining is sometimes what people refer\nto this as, so we'll be able to do that.\n\n213\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.160\nAnd we have sever\napplication virtualization,\n\n214\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.810\nwhat's called server App-V.\n\n215\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.830\nThat also is a capability and\none of our upcoming episodes\n\n216\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.880\nyou're actually gonna see me do\na demo to set it up to configured.\n\n217\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.800\nOr we're gonna go through and talk about\nit but it's an interesting feature and\n\n218\n00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.960\nit's obvious we want to make sure\nyou're joining us for that and\n\n219\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.020\nwe'll be in interest for sure.\n\n220\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.510\nBut we'll when we think about what's\nnew in SCVMM, we wanna take a look and\n\n221\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.580\nwe have as we often try to do bring\nup some web infrastructure for you.\n\n222\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.490\nMicrosoft has got some great\ndocumentation on TechNet where\n\n223\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.820\nyou can find about these things.\n\n224\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.535\nSo, take a look and my machine real quick\nwe'll see here we have the What's New in\n\n225\n00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:15.385\nVMM SC VMM 2012 R2 webpage and\nyou can see right here as we scroll down,\n\n226\n00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:19.260\nwe've got information about how to\nset up and create virtual machines.\n\n227\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.960\nHow to add Windows Gateways in and those\ndifferent things that we may need to do.\n\n228\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.130\nAlthough we have feature\ninformation about setting up and\n\n229\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.080\nusing various aspects of VMM.\n\n230\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.550\nYou will see off to the side here\n\n231\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.690\non the right there is this Nav Bar\nwith all the different links.\n\n232\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.010\nFabric, the storage, services, etc.\n\n233\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.770\nAnd so all these different elements that\nI was talking about as I scroll down\n\n234\n00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.330\nare things we've been mentioning.\n\n235\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.490\nAnd you could see all\nthe information here.\n\n236\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.540\nAnd if you need to look up in\nearlier version of SCVMM, or\n\n237\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.050\nSystem Center in general,\nif you're using 12 SP1, not 12 or 2 yet.\n\n238\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.980\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout how to migrate, so\n\n239\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.490\nwe'll be talking about upgrading and\nmigrating upcoming episode.\n\n240\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.160\nBut assuming you're not on 12 or\n2 right now, but you're on 12 or\n\n241\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.890\n12SP1 and you wanna find out more about\nthose, we have links at the bottom there,\n\n242\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.870\nyou can have seek on and find out about\nthat as well, so would be good for\n\n243\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.150\nyou just to take a look.\n\n244\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.100\nSpeaking of links and finding out\nabout things, I showed you this.\n\n245\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.660\nIn the last set of episodes as we get our,\n\n246\n00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.070\nhey let's get introduced\nto the cloud discussion.\n\n247\n00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.980\nWhat is the cloud.\n\n248\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.010\nHow do we talk about it.\n\n249\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.630\nWhat are some of the moving parts and\n\n250\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.360\nwe did a little focus on SCVm\na couple minutes is one element\n\n251\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.830\nof the cloud strategy and\nfabric and I showed you this step.\n\n252\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.960\nI thought we could bring it up again here\njust because it is relevant to what we're\n\n253\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.700\ntalking about the ability to download\ntechnical documentation in this case\n\n254\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.790\nspecific VMM When we download [INAUDIBLE]\nWord or PDF document you're gonna be\n\n255\n00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.530\nable to go through when you get several\nhundreds page guide on how to monitor,\n\n256\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.680\nmanage and maintain this infrastructure\nthat applies to all three versions, 12,\n\n257\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.410\n12SP1 and 12 R2 as we talked about so I\njust want to remind you about and show you\n\n258\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.120\nthat this was here, all but speaking of\nshowing you, thought it would also be good\n\n259\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.820\nfor us to go in and actually take a look\nat this product we keep referring to,\n\n260\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.980\nyou're beginning to think it may not\nactually exist cuz I never show you, all\n\n261\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.130\nwe do is talk about it but I thought it\nwould actually be good we did in the last\n\n262\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.070\nset of episodes if you saw them in our\nhands on walk throughs install the product\n\n263\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.070\nbut we didn't really spend too much time\nthere we logged in said hey, look we have\n\n264\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.270\na console and we're gonna come back talk\nabout it that was about the end of it.\n\n265\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.720\nSo let's actually go in and\nlet's take a look,\n\n266\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.440\nand let's go under the hood a little bit,\nlet's look at some of the features in\n\n267\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.780\nthere, I mentioned a bunch of different\nthings, probably wanna see where they are,\n\n268\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.080\ntalk a little bit about them and\nmake sure we're comfortable with them.\n\n269\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.250\nSo we're gonna go ahead we're\ngonna grab our SCVMM console icon,\n\n270\n00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.580\njust highlight that there.\n\n271\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.050\nRemember to spring that up for a second.\n\n272\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.830\nLet that get ready, we're going to log in\nand just a quick word about the reality of\n\n273\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.140\nthe world versus what sometimes may look\nlike it works normally with no trouble\n\n274\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.870\nwhen we set everything up and\nit's all hunky dory as they say.\n\n275\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.720\nAnd I'm not suggesting for a minute that\nthe product will not work in the real\n\n276\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.460\nworld, I'm just giving you some real world\nexperience about a little issue that is\n\n277\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.960\nknown, to happen and in case it does\njust want you to be aware of it and\n\n278\n00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.940\nbe able to be prepared to deal with it.\n\n279\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.510\nYou may go in when you spin up\nyour virtual machine manager or\n\n280\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.020\nif you've installed VMM.\n\n281\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.630\nI've talked about during the install\ndemo that you do have to do\n\n282\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.470\na restart typically, especially as you\ncould see on the desktop here we've piled\n\n283\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.770\non several different versions of system\ncenter infrastructure into one machine.\n\n284\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.800\nThere are some dos and don'ts, certain\nthings you don't wanna run together.\n\n285\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.970\nService manager.\n\n286\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.080\nAnd SCOM for instance,\ncannot coexist on the same machine, so\n\n287\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.160\nyou just have to be aware of that and\nknow that.\n\n288\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.030\nBut in general, you could put most\nthings with most other things.\n\n289\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.140\nSo you can see, virtual machine manager,\napp controller, and ops,\n\n290\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.160\nthe ops console are all together in\none machine, no big deal there at all.\n\n291\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.100\nBut what can happen is especially if\nwhen you do the install number one,\n\n292\n00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.510\nyou don't restart.\n\n293\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.990\nAnd then,\nat some point later you do go to restart\n\n294\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.080\nis the virtual machine manager\nservice has a nasty habit of sticking.\n\n295\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.140\nSometimes and it doesn't always start\nup even though it's suppose to.\n\n296\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.430\nIt's set to auto start and it should come\nup normally with no trouble but it's been\n\n297\n00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.880\nknown to be a little impertinent and not\npay attention of what it's supposed to do.\n\n298\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.380\nIt's got a mind of it's own as they say so\nwhen that happens if you go to launch\n\n299\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.860\na console and the console doesn't spin up,\nyou get an error so say something like\n\n300\n00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.850\nhey, can't connect or instance is not\navailable or something like that.\n\n301\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.030\nDon't panic probably not a big deal,\n\n302\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.310\nmore often than not what it is it's\njust that that service has not started.\n\n303\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.470\nIt's easy enough to fix,\njust go into the control panel\n\n304\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.990\njust go take a look while\nwe're talking just show you.\n\n305\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.640\nOur service is running by the way so\nwe're not gonna find a problem with it but\n\n306\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.590\njust in case just so you know should go\nto the control panel here real quick.\n\n307\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.520\nWe'll go in.\nI don't know if I'm only one\n\n308\n00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.060\nin the world that doesn't like\ncategory view, but I can's stand it.\n\n309\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.840\nSo I'm gonna change it.\n\n310\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.550\nWe're gonna go in.\n\n311\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.300\nWe're gonna go to Administrative Tools.\n\n312\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.520\nI think what exactly the case,\n\n313\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.465\nI'm the only one brave enough\nto admit that on camera.\n\n314\n00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:32.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But when you talk to\n\n315\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.910\nmost people off-camera\n&gt;&gt; Where kind of in an aside and\n\n316\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.380\nnot in front of people that\nwill hold them accountable.\n\n317\n00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.560\nThey'll say yeah I don't\nlike category view either.\n\n318\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.388\nBut then when they're on camera\nthey'll say no I love category view.\n\n319\n00:15:42.388 --> 00:15:45.917\nBut I'm keeping it real here at ITProTV,\nguys.\n\n320\n00:15:45.917 --> 00:15:49.460\nSo, let's just load up our\nservices console here.\n\n321\n00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.240\nJust give me one second to bring that up.\n\n322\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.215\nAnd what we're going to find is that\nif we go down and we take a look, or\n\n323\n00:15:55.215 --> 00:15:59.350\ngo up as the case may be, because\nwe're sorted on an inverted way here.\n\n324\n00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.115\nLet me just alphabetize the right way and\ngo down here.\n\n325\n00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:07.975\nSo what we'll see is as we're looking,\nand I just wanna show you do this.\n\n326\n00:16:07.975 --> 00:16:12.545\nWhat you don't wanna get stuck thinking\nis, you don't wanna get stuck looking for\n\n327\n00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.355\nthe service in the wrong place here.\n\n328\n00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:16.505\nSo we got some Hyper-V services.\n\n329\n00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:18.905\nWe'll come back to those in just a second.\n\n330\n00:16:18.905 --> 00:16:22.115\nSometimes we get system\ncenter services and\n\n331\n00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:25.100\nwe've got some system center\nservices here as well.\n\n332\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.540\nAnd you'll see that\nthe service we're looking for\n\n333\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.030\nis System Center Virtual Machine Manager,\nnot the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n334\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.520\nThere's two services,\nsound almost similar to one another.\n\n335\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.510\nThe Hyper-V service is going to be for\n\n336\n00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:43.070\nmanaging Hyper-V on the box, not for\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n337\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.610\nIf you blow the wrong service up or\n\n338\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.790\nrestart the wrong one-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.480\n&gt;&gt; You may or may not get\n\n340\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.640\nthe right results.\n\n341\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.880\nSo you want to make sure you're looking\nfor system center virtual machine manager.\n\n342\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.670\nThat's the service were looking for.\n\n343\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.340\nThat's the one that\ntends to hang sometimes.\n\n344\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.440\nIt doesn't always start.\n\n345\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.050\nIt is on automatic, but\nit's on automatic delayed, and\n\n346\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.520\nsometimes you could see\nthere's some hovering.\n\n347\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.010\nIt doesn't always start up when it should.\n\n348\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.980\nSo if you have that problem,\njust go ahead and restart that.\n\n349\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.160\nNo big deal, or start it depending\non what's going on with it.\n\n350\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.030\nBut when you do that,\nit should come up Window shell.\n\n351\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.720\nYou shouldn't have\na problem at that point.\n\n352\n00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.180\nSo let's just get rid of that,\nlet's just get rid of that.\n\n353\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.320\nAnd so we're here, we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna connect.\n\n354\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.360\nNow, we're gonna use our current Windows\nsession identity, as you can see here,\n\n355\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.410\nthe credentials we're\ncurrently logged on under.\n\n356\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.340\nOur specify credentials option is there\nif we're gonna log in as somebody else.\n\n357\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.460\nMaybe we have a normal user account,\nas we should do.\n\n358\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.380\nIt's a best practice that most companies,\nhopefully, are enforcing these days.\n\n359\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.180\nAnd then we have a pseudo option,\nessentially a super user or\n\n360\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.430\nsome sort of admin account\nthat we would use.\n\n361\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.010\nSo we may be logged on on our admin\nwork station on our laptop or\n\n362\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.140\nour desktop, whatever, as a normal user.\n\n363\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.780\nAnd then we have to become you know,\nClark Kent in the phone booth.\n\n364\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.156\nRip off the clothes and you know-\n&gt;&gt; There you go, [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:46.473\n&gt;&gt; Become super administrator!\n\n366\n00:17:46.473 --> 00:17:47.710\nSuper IT person, right?\n\n367\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.330\nAnd so we may have to specify\nan alternate credential,\n\n368\n00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.720\nwhich is a lot of the times the case.\n\n369\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.235\nSo you do have that option.\n\n370\n00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:53.950\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n371\n00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.870\nBecause your normal user account may not\nactually have rights to the SCVMM console.\n\n372\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.070\nSo you may not be able to run it that way.\n\n373\n00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.940\nBut in our case here, our user account\nthat we're logged in with has admin.\n\n374\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.270\nSo we're just gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n375\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.610\nJust give that a second, we'll log in.\n\n376\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.780\nOnce this comes up, we're just gonna\ndo a little guided tour here through\n\n377\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.290\nthe console, talk about the work spaces\nat a high level, what's in each of them,\n\n378\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.730\nget acquainted here, talk about virtual\nmachine managers, security a little bit.\n\n379\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.200\nWe'll take a look at the roles.\n\n380\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.990\nYo just up there in the security area, so\n\n381\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.850\nwe will hit on some of the highlights\nof things you want to be aware of here\n\n382\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.560\njust so that you are better equipped to\nunderstand how to interact with this.\n\n383\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.500\nWe will take a look at\nthe Virtual Machine environment and\n\n384\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.640\nthe favored resources and just talk\nabout all of the little moving parts and\n\n385\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.380\nthings I already mentioned and\npoint out where they are.\n\n386\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.600\nSo let's start here, we're in\nthe settings area right down here.\n\n387\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.300\nThe Settings workspace as\nyou can see at the bottom.\n\n388\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.300\nWe have a jobs workspace,\nlibrary, fabric, VMs and services.\n\n389\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.700\nWe'll go through each one and\nwalk through over the next few minutes.\n\n390\n00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.060\nBut let's start with settings.\n\n391\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.500\nPretty important because obviously\na lot of things we have to set up there\n\n392\n00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.600\nare gonna control elements of how the rest\nof the infrastructure is managed.\n\n393\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.430\nThings that are gonna be like your\ndatabase connection out to where we're\n\n394\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.950\nstoring our information.\n\n395\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.270\nOur remote control capability or\nmode VMs or remote into VMs.\n\n396\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.210\nThings like that are set here so we wanna\nmake sure we're comfortable with this.\n\n397\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.030\nSo under general settings you can\nsee I've got a group of items here,\n\n398\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.310\nwe'll just start down here at the bottom,\nkind of take a look, network settings.\n\n399\n00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.250\nAny one of these right click go to\nProperties, go to Properties up here.\n\n400\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.100\nWe have alternate ways\nof getting into things.\n\n401\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.700\nMicrosoft's good about\ngiving us at least two or\n\n402\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.830\nthree different ways to get into\na console function more often that not.\n\n403\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.550\nSo we're just gonna scroll this over\na little bit so you can see this and\n\n404\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.740\nget away from our box-in-box window so\nwe can see what's happening there.\n\n405\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.320\nAnd we'll see network settings.\n\n406\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.160\nAnd we'll see that we have logical\nnetwork matching and you could see here,\n\n407\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.590\nwe have the ability to be able to\nspecify some different settings for\n\n408\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.130\nthis first DNF, DNS suffix label.\n\n409\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.990\nWe have virtual network switch\nname network connection.\n\n410\n00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.290\nIf any of the above fail, match by.\n\n411\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.870\nWe're kind of setting up how we're going\nto deal with our network settings for\n\n412\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.390\nour logical networks and\nour virtual switches here.\n\n413\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.930\nWe'll be doing some deep dive discussions\non networking as part of the overall\n\n414\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:05.870\nfabric discussion.\n\n415\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.140\nSo I'll be coming back to\nthat in future episodes.\n\n416\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.560\nWe have our automatic\ncreation of logical networks.\n\n417\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.040\nSo as we set things up where we're going\nto be able to go in, and it says here,\n\n418\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.540\nin case the host adapter is not\nassociated with a logical network,\n\n419\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.600\na new one gets created for\nit automatically.\n\n420\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.720\nSo we can then go ahead based on the above\ninformation that we are specifying for\n\n421\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.920\nnetwork matching, then create a logical\nnetwork that binds the host adapter.\n\n422\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.528\nThe host adapter is our path out of\nthe physical machine where we're hosting\n\n423\n00:20:32.528 --> 00:20:34.330\nthe VMs to the outside world.\n\n424\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.360\nSo we need that.\n\n425\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.510\nWe have to be able to work with that.\n\n426\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.480\nSo we have those capabilities here.\n\n427\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.200\nWe have remote control settings here.\n\n428\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.650\nWe'll go in, we'll take a look.\n\n429\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.860\nThis is our remote connection port\nto be able to interact with our\n\n430\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.840\nVMs that are running on the host,\n2179 by default.\n\n431\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.040\nWe can modify that of course.\n\n432\n00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.520\nIt will be up to us to decide.\n\n433\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.230\nFor VM connect we have\nour library settings.\n\n434\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.551\nTake a look here, enable library refresh,\n\n435\n00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.300\nyou know whatever\nthe interval is in hours.\n\n436\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.545\nSo this is how often we're gonna go\nthrough and refresh so that we can see\n\n437\n00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:11.910\nan index what's going on with our stored\ninformation libraries in the shares.\n\n438\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.430\nSo that way we know what is there,\nwe can show accurately and\n\n439\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.150\nupdate accurately into the console\nin our library work space here,\n\n440\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.700\nall the information\nthat's available to us.\n\n441\n00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.360\nThis is our default refresh cycle.\n\n442\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.340\nAgain, modifiable.\n\n443\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.900\nWe can go in and change these.\n\n444\n00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.120\nOur database connection.\n\n445\n00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.130\nGo to properties here.\n\n446\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.260\nThis is hard coded and grayed out\nbecause we specify this during install.\n\n447\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.250\nRight, but you can see that we\nhave our database server name.\n\n448\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.240\nWe have our database instance name and the\nport that we're connecting across, 1433,\n\n449\n00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.530\nour standard default port for SQL.\n\n450\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.550\nAnd we have our database name,\na virtual machine manager,\n\n451\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.520\ndb the default database name.\n\n452\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.430\nUsually go with that\nwhen we do our install.\n\n453\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.530\nAnd so we have all of that along\nwith our instance in the domain,\n\n454\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.970\nour fully qualified string.\n\n455\n00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.530\nSo we have all of those things here.\n\n456\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.270\nWe can opt in or\n\n457\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.220\nopt out of the customer experience\nimprovement program if we choose to.\n\n458\n00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.270\nNormally we opt out when we do our\ndemos as we've been talking about.\n\n459\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.920\nWe do our installs, but in the real world\nwe encourage you to say yes to that and\n\n460\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.530\nshare information with Microsoft from\nthe running of your infrastructure.\n\n461\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.840\nThat makes their ability to be\nable to diagnose problems and\n\n462\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.840\nupdate the system in a way that would be\nbeneficial to everybody by solving issues\n\n463\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.870\na little bit easier so\nI encourage you to think doing that.\n\n464\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.910\nWe've got our security settings here,\nlet's just open up and take a look.\n\n465\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.770\nWe have our user roles,\n\n466\n00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.610\nthis is where we can go in to\nsee our admin user role is here.\n\n467\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.780\nWe can go in and create or modify or\nwork with our user roles as needed.\n\n468\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.500\nNotice up here on the tab\ncontextually are options changes.\n\n469\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.030\nWe start selecting things so we can go\nin and we have the ability to do this.\n\n470\n00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.200\nWe have our user roles.\n\n471\n00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.045\nWe can go in here.\n\n472\n00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:42.750\nYou'll see this user role,\n\n473\n00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.140\nother role members are listed\ndown here as you can see.\n\n474\n00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.090\nSo we have the ability here to be able to\ngo in, look at properties of the user role\n\n475\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.510\nif we need to, we could add or\nmodify membership here, so\n\n476\n00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.450\nwe can come over here to members, and\nwe can add or remove members as needed.\n\n477\n00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.910\nObviously the admin role gives us full\ncapabilities, and full monitoring and\n\n478\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.460\nmanagement capabilities in here.\n\n479\n00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.800\nMembers are users,\nmembers or try it again,\n\n480\n00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.280\nmembers are user accounts or\nactive directory groups.\n\n481\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.857\nSo if we're domain-integrated obviously,\n\n482\n00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:15.130\nwe'd be able to bring in\nthose domain members.\n\n483\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.240\nWe could just click Add, and you'll see\nwe have a standard search interface.\n\n484\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.810\nNothing that we're probably\nnot used to seeing.\n\n485\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.300\nClick Cancel here.\n\n486\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.680\nWe can create a brand new role.\n\n487\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.410\nCome up here, create a role.\n\n488\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.820\nWanna see quickly how we do this.\n\n489\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.830\nLet's call this our Cherokee role.\n\n490\n00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.140\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo!\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n491\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.220\nYou're like cleaning up.\n\n492\n00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.316\nYou got the Cherokee app,\nnow you got the Cherokee role.\n\n493\n00:23:34.316 --> 00:23:35.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah moving up in the world.\n\n494\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.010\n&gt;&gt; You've got a great agent.\n\n495\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n496\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.270\nI got to hook myself up with one of\nthose people that does all that for me.\n\n497\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.500\nSo we see here select a user profile for\nthis user role.\n\n498\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.342\nWhat profile are we gonna be using?\n\n499\n00:23:45.342 --> 00:23:49.338\nIn other words what are the premade\ntemplate settings in our mind of things\n\n500\n00:23:49.338 --> 00:23:50.893\nwe want this to be able to do.\n\n501\n00:23:50.893 --> 00:23:55.535\nAre we gonna be a fabric admin, read only\nadmin, tenant admin, an application admin,\n\n502\n00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:56.967\nself service user, etc.\n\n503\n00:23:56.967 --> 00:23:58.310\nSubdue fabric admin,\n\n504\n00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.330\nright, that's gonna give us some\nmajority of the rights we would like.\n\n505\n00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.230\nSo let's just do that one,\n\n506\n00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.750\njust to start with, we'll then come\nin here, we specify our members.\n\n507\n00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.880\nSo you already saw me do this\nwe'll just do add here, and not\n\n508\n00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.580\nthat you would ever do this in the real\nworld, but we'll choose our guest account.\n\n509\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.070\nPlease don't do this in the real\nworld we've talked about this before,\n\n510\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.360\nbut we do have a guest user in the domain,\nwe know it's always there.\n\n511\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.570\nSo we describe that one,\nmake them a tenant and\n\n512\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.370\na fabric administrator in this case.\n\n513\n00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.477\nBut you wouldn't wanna make a guest\naccount normally an administrator, but\n\n514\n00:24:29.477 --> 00:24:30.300\nwe'll click Next.\n\n515\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.547\nWe then have to scope it,\nso we have to specify hey,\n\n516\n00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:37.030\nthis roll is gonna be able to\nwork on the all host scope.\n\n517\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.080\nSo it's gonna have access\nto all the hosts, and\n\n518\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.840\nall the information contained around and\nwithin them.\n\n519\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.800\nWe have to specify what\nlibrary servers are available,\n\n520\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.720\nso we go in, and\nwe would add in our library server.\n\n521\n00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.110\nYou can see our virtual machine\nmanager server is our library server,\n\n522\n00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.390\nwe'd add that in.\n\n523\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.597\nWe could then specify our run as accounts\nhaven't shown you run as accounts, yet\n\n524\n00:24:55.597 --> 00:24:56.504\nthey're down there.\n\n525\n00:24:56.504 --> 00:25:00.439\nBut our run as accounts, we talked about\nthis during the installation demo when we\n\n526\n00:25:00.439 --> 00:25:04.210\nwalk through in general all the products\nwe create a run as accounts for them.\n\n527\n00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.205\nA run as account it's gonna be an account\nthat's used to do administration behind\n\n528\n00:25:08.205 --> 00:25:11.685\nthe scenes, or carry out a variety of\nactivities, whatever the case may be.\n\n529\n00:25:11.685 --> 00:25:14.545\nSo we would have pre\ndefined these typically, so\n\n530\n00:25:14.545 --> 00:25:17.015\nwe can go through let's just\nsee what they are here.\n\n531\n00:25:18.412 --> 00:25:20.652\nYou'll see we're using\nthe NT authority accounts,\n\n532\n00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:24.012\nwe have local accounts that are being\nused, we may have created our own as well.\n\n533\n00:25:24.012 --> 00:25:27.152\nWe have our network service,\nlocal service, and or system,\n\n534\n00:25:27.152 --> 00:25:29.262\nwe can create a run as account our self.\n\n535\n00:25:29.262 --> 00:25:31.652\nIf we don't have one that\nwe wanna use right there,\n\n536\n00:25:31.652 --> 00:25:34.152\nany of these three local ones,\nwe can create one.\n\n537\n00:25:34.152 --> 00:25:35.572\nWe may go use our create and run as.\n\n538\n00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:38.712\nI'll just bring this over here so\nyou can see this.\n\n539\n00:25:38.712 --> 00:25:40.812\nAnd we would go in, give this a name.\n\n540\n00:25:40.812 --> 00:25:47.390\nSo we'll call this CherokeeRunAs,\nso we know what it is.\n\n541\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.560\nWe'll give this a user name.\n\n542\n00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.280\nSo we'll do our practice labs, and\n\n543\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.520\nwe'll do administrator.\n\n544\n00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.590\nSo we'll use the admin account, so\nthat account has rights as you can see, or\n\n545\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.640\nwe could use guest or whatever account we\nwant, it doesn't really matter, right.\n\n546\n00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; It would be consistent\n\n547\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.120\nwe'll have to provide our passwords,\nso whatever our password would be,\n\n548\n00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.510\nlet me just confirm that.\n\n549\n00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.420\nAnd then validate the domain credential,\nmeaning go out and\n\n550\n00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.040\ncheck make sure it's actually real.\n\n551\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.859\nNow before I do this,\nwe'll do this in just a second.\n\n552\n00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.330\nNotice the view script button\nthat's sitting right down here, and\n\n553\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.840\nlet me just change the format here and\nmake the font a little bigger so\n\n554\n00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.668\nyou can see this,\ncuz sometimes it's a little hard to see.\n\n555\n00:26:30.668 --> 00:26:37.175\nI want\n\n556\n00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:41.940\nto do that just so you can see it.\n\n557\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.778\nAnd remember I was talking about\nPowerShell, and the importance of\n\n558\n00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:48.528\nPowerShell, and everything we're doing in\nthese consoles almost without exception.\n\n559\n00:26:48.528 --> 00:26:50.176\n&gt;&gt; It's very nice that they show us this.\n\n560\n00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's always a view\nscript button that you can see.\n\n561\n00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.860\nTypically it's at the lower left,\nlower right,\n\n562\n00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.560\nit may be grayed out in certain instances.\n\n563\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.630\nIt was in all the other settings boxes\nI went into as I was editing things for\n\n564\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.580\nthe database connection,\nthe network connections, all that.\n\n565\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.640\nIt was grayed out because we're\nnot scripting it anymore,\n\n566\n00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.450\nwe're not doing anything there,\n\n567\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.410\nwe're just looking at information\nthat's already been set.\n\n568\n00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.490\nBut in almost every instance you're\ngonna see there is a v script button.\n\n569\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.390\nAnd if you wanna start getting more\nknowledgeable about PowerShell,\n\n570\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.490\nwhat we're doing specific to VMM or\nany of the products,\n\n571\n00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.690\nas all the products pretty\nmuch work the same way.\n\n572\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.860\nThey all have PowerShell underlying them,\nand\n\n573\n00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.460\nwe use PowerShell scripting\nto be able to do things.\n\n574\n00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.101\nSo yeah,\nwe're in the GUI humming along thinking,\n\n575\n00:27:28.101 --> 00:27:29.271\nthis is great I'm pushing buttons.\n\n576\n00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:31.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And wow, this is gonna get done.\n\n577\n00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.600\nBut what really is happening\nbehind the scenes is,\n\n578\n00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.870\nwe're automating all those choices you're\nmaking into a configuration script.\n\n579\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.430\nAnd will then just run in the script,\n\n580\n00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.190\nand that's what actually does\nthe work force in many cases.\n\n581\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.200\nSo we're just seeing this one here, but\n\n582\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.430\nyou can see you declare a variable called\ncredential = Get-Credential command so\n\n583\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.990\nthe output of Get-Credential will be\npassed to the credential variable.\n\n584\n00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.580\nAnd then we can call the credential\nvariable here, and specify a name for\n\n585\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.380\nthat, and you know whatever we need and\ndescription and all that kind of stuff.\n\n586\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.210\nAnd so you were able to do that and\nthen output that as the run house account.\n\n587\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.250\nAnd so this is what the script that's\nactually gonna execute and off and\n\n588\n00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.040\ndo this for us is gonna look like.\n\n589\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.740\nAnd this is why we keep talking\nabout the fact that power shell and\n\n590\n00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.650\nunderstanding more about it well\nbecome a very valuable part of your\n\n591\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.690\nknowledge base here it's\ngonna be helpful for you.\n\n592\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.810\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n593\n00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.800\nGive that just a second to do its work.\n\n594\n00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.040\nWe now have our CherokeeRunAs account now,\nso we're gonna be able to go ahead select\n\n595\n00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.680\nthat, click OK we'll specify our run\nas account, we'll hit next here, and\n\n596\n00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.870\nI've talked about this in other episodes,\nfor other shows, for other products.\n\n597\n00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.000\nI'll make the same\nreference here that I have\n\n598\n00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.540\nusing the confirm settings screen here,\nand using the documentation or\n\n599\n00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.670\nrather creating this screen capture for\ndocumentation is what I mean.\n\n600\n00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.330\nTaking a capture of this taking\na picture whatever the case may be,\n\n601\n00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.360\nand then being able to use this putting it\ninto your documentation is so important,\n\n602\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.330\nbecause it's gonna give you\nan accurate read on what's been done.\n\n603\n00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.200\nAnd then if you have to go back, and\nrefer six months later, who knows when?\n\n604\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.950\nSomebody shows up for an audit they\nwanna be able to see what you did, and\n\n605\n00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.160\nyou can show it to them and\nsay, this is what we're doing.\n\n606\n00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.810\nAnd they could validate easily,\nit's so much better for you.\n\n607\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.660\nAnd then also along with BCDR\nconfigurations that we need for\n\n608\n00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.400\nbeing able to do that.\n\n609\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.040\nHaving all this documentation,\nit's really a good idea.\n\n610\n00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.640\nIt's such an easy way to get that\ncaptured authoritatively, unequivocally,\n\n611\n00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.830\nthis is what we did.\n\n612\n00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.550\nTake a quick screen capture here,\nliterally,\n\n613\n00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.750\njust have to take a little snippet, put\nit into your documentation, paste it into\n\n614\n00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.620\nyour runbook and you're set to go, so\njust think about the value of that.\n\n615\n00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.810\nWe're gonna click finish here,\ngive this just a second to do its thing.\n\n616\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.580\nLet me just open this up full-screen so\nyou can see the job here,\n\n617\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.190\nand you'll see that\nthe job monitor is done.\n\n618\n00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.390\nAnd you'll see that\n\n619\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.560\nwe have been able to successfully\ncreate our new run OS account.\n\n620\n00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.660\nOur new user role we have those\nthings they're Cherokee role.\n\n621\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.790\nCherokee run as so we could see both, so\n\n622\n00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.200\nwe were successful we have\na job monitor and others right.\n\n623\n00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.060\nWe could see what's happening with those.\n\n624\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.920\nThere may or may not be details\nassociated with each one of these.\n\n625\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.809\nWe can click on it we can see\nyou know how long it took,\n\n626\n00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:04.490\nwhat the details were the summary that\nkind of thing, so we can do details here.\n\n627\n00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.280\nWe could see, yes it was completed,\nhow long the step took.\n\n628\n00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.290\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just close out of this.\n\n629\n00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.670\nBy the way, if you want to bring that back\nup, if you ever close that window and\n\n630\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.370\nyou're monitoring, you say, what happened?\n\n631\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.220\nI want to see it's not done or\nit seems like it's taking a long time.\n\n632\n00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.840\nNo problem, just go up to Jobs up there.\n\n633\n00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.540\nAnd you'll be able to see that window,\nit's just a matter of going back in.\n\n634\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.370\nAnd it even tells you when to do it and\nclose it, and\n\n635\n00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.110\nyou can always bring it\nback up if you want to.\n\n636\n00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.720\nSo, it's easy enough to get that back if\nyou need to, so we've gone ahead, and\n\n637\n00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.840\nwe've created a user role,\nwe now have our Cherokee role there.\n\n638\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.470\nAs you can see so for using that we\nhave to assign that, that's gonna have\n\n639\n00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.280\nfabric admin rights, but we can then\ngo in and use that in other places.\n\n640\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.960\nWe have the Run As accounts here we just\ntalked about that, you saw I created one.\n\n641\n00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.339\nYou see how those two things\nare bound together, so\n\n642\n00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:48.898\nwe're able to see that we\nhave our servicing windows.\n\n643\n00:30:48.898 --> 00:30:52.586\nOur servicing windows, you would think\nof this essentially as our maintenance\n\n644\n00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:55.622\nwindows that's generically what\nwe call them, we manage SLAs.\n\n645\n00:30:55.622 --> 00:30:59.598\nOur servicing window is going to allow us\nto be able to go in as we right up here,\n\n646\n00:30:59.598 --> 00:31:01.925\ncreate servicing window,\nto be able to go and\n\n647\n00:31:01.925 --> 00:31:05.811\nspecify what our maintenance window\nwill be or our service window will be.\n\n648\n00:31:05.811 --> 00:31:09.890\nJust pull this down here, and\nwe program the SIM, give it a name,\n\n649\n00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.710\ntell it what day of the week, how often\nwe do this, what the time will be.\n\n650\n00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.280\nAnd as a result of that we have\nthe ability to use that servicing window\n\n651\n00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.525\nto then put some systems\nin a maintenance mode or\n\n652\n00:31:20.525 --> 00:31:22.675\ndo work in the systems\nby taking them down.\n\n653\n00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:25.405\nMoving them to other or moving\ninfrastructure around to allow us to\n\n654\n00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:28.825\nactively host in some areas, but\nthen take others offline and work with it.\n\n655\n00:31:28.825 --> 00:31:31.365\nSo we'd be able to do this we\nwould just create a simple one.\n\n656\n00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:35.463\nSo we'll call this you know\n\n657\n00:31:35.463 --> 00:31:40.627\nservice me IT Pro TV SLA Window 1,\n\n658\n00:31:40.627 --> 00:31:44.736\nright so we'll have that.\n\n659\n00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.466\nWe have our description category,\nwe'll either be normal or\n\n660\n00:31:47.466 --> 00:31:49.310\nwhatever are the categories we created.\n\n661\n00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.168\nWe haven't created any, but\nyeah we could go in and add other ones.\n\n662\n00:31:52.168 --> 00:31:54.705\nSo we're not gonna worry\nabout how to do that now but\n\n663\n00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:58.068\nLet's just use normal as our standard one,\nwe have our start time,\n\n664\n00:31:58.068 --> 00:32:00.590\nwe have our time offset here for\nwhere we are.\n\n665\n00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.406\nSo, Cherokee, where do you wanna go today?\n\n666\n00:32:01.406 --> 00:32:03.429\nYou want me to go anywhere in particular?\n\n667\n00:32:03.429 --> 00:32:04.439\n&gt;&gt; Let's go somewhere tropical.\n\n668\n00:32:04.439 --> 00:32:06.570\n&gt;&gt; Tropical.\n\n669\n00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.840\nCasablanca's tropical.\n\n670\n00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.935\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; They made a good movie there.\n\n671\n00:32:09.935 --> 00:32:11.899\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n672\n00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:13.940\nwe could go anywhere in the world,\nwe just set our time zone up.\n\n673\n00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.686\nWould be cool if that was the case, right?\n\n674\n00:32:15.686 --> 00:32:16.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you said hey,\n\n675\n00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:18.969\nlet me pull down my little\nselector on my desktop.\n\n676\n00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:22.130\nYeah, I wanna go there today and all of\nthe sudden, boom, that's where I wind up.\n\n677\n00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.943\nThat would be cool.\nWhat is our duration?\n\n678\n00:32:23.943 --> 00:32:26.680\nIn other words,\nhow long will this service window match?\n\n679\n00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.600\nOr how long will it run for?\n\n680\n00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.120\nI just wanna make sure we have that.\n\n681\n00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.060\nSo we could specify that.\n\n682\n00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.560\nYou'll see here we have hours or\nminutes, it's up to us to decide.\n\n683\n00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.040\nSo we'll make it a two\nhour service window.\n\n684\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.363\nAnd is it gonna recur or recur frequently?\n\n685\n00:32:39.363 --> 00:32:42.351\nProbably, so weekly,\nonce a week on Sunday.\n\n686\n00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.955\nOr what's our window for maintenance?\n\n687\n00:32:44.955 --> 00:32:48.390\nWould be timed to send to our change\nmanagement process most likely, so\n\n688\n00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.170\nwe'd be following along there.\n\n689\n00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.375\nJust move this over so\nyou could see that a little bit.\n\n690\n00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:54.979\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nspin this up, click OK.\n\n691\n00:32:54.979 --> 00:32:59.312\nAnd we'll see our service window\nis now instantiated in there.\n\n692\n00:32:59.312 --> 00:33:01.850\nAnd we have and\nwe could see the information about it.\n\n693\n00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.769\nSo it's all set up for us.\n\n694\n00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:05.805\nWe have information that\nwe then can leverage.\n\n695\n00:33:05.805 --> 00:33:08.594\nWe can then go in and use the service\nwindow to drive maintenance.\n\n696\n00:33:08.594 --> 00:33:11.240\nWe have configuration providers here.\n\n697\n00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.680\nLet's just click over here.\n\n698\n00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.444\nAnd because two clicks is not enough,\nwe'll click three times.\n\n699\n00:33:16.444 --> 00:33:20.058\nMy mouse sometimes doesn't register\nthe click as you have probably heard me\n\n700\n00:33:20.058 --> 00:33:21.421\ndiscuss in other episodes.\n\n701\n00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:24.146\nYou'll continue to hear me talk about it,\nbecause I'm not smart enough to just\n\n702\n00:33:24.146 --> 00:33:26.353\nswitch the mouse out, so\nI'm gonna keep complaining about it.\n\n703\n00:33:26.353 --> 00:33:27.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n704\n00:33:27.147 --> 00:33:30.510\nyou could see that we do have\nconfiguration providers here.\n\n705\n00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.000\nAgain, we'll be talking more\nabout this in upcoming episodes,\n\n706\n00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.470\nreally just giving you\nan overview into these areas,\n\n707\n00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.335\ngiving you a sense what's happening,\ndemoing a few things along the way,\n\n708\n00:33:38.335 --> 00:33:42.165\nbecause obviously it's helpful to see\nsome of these things for the first time.\n\n709\n00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:46.575\nBut we have our providers here for\nnetwork service, for load balancers, and\n\n710\n00:33:46.575 --> 00:33:49.615\nwe have different up\nproviders that can be used.\n\n711\n00:33:49.615 --> 00:33:50.302\nI like this one here.\n\n712\n00:33:50.302 --> 00:33:51.806\nYou'll see that we can go in.\n\n713\n00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:57.416\nReally not much to show you down here,\nother than just the fact that this is.\n\n714\n00:33:57.416 --> 00:34:00.095\nIf I can just get this to move over.\n\n715\n00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:01.970\nThere we go.\n\n716\n00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.723\nWe have our IP address management\nprovider, what's called IPAM.\n\n717\n00:34:04.723 --> 00:34:07.271\nSo our IPAM provider,\nour switch profile provider,\n\n718\n00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:11.009\nour network load balancing provider,\nthese and our gateway provider, these\n\n719\n00:34:11.009 --> 00:34:14.877\nare the building blocks that we use to\nbuild out our networking infrastructure.\n\n720\n00:34:14.877 --> 00:34:18.270\nSo this is part of the building blocks for\nthat.\n\n721\n00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.850\nWe have our system center settings.\n\n722\n00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.920\nThis is where we go in and\nlink to ops manager and\n\n723\n00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.310\nlink the system center virtual machine\nmanager and ops manager together.\n\n724\n00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.630\nSo we have that capability for ops\nmanager to manage the VMM infrastructure.\n\n725\n00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.438\nAnd so we come in here, we have to\nright-click, I have to go to Properties.\n\n726\n00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.059\nThere's a wizard we have to run.\n\n727\n00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:38.897\nThere are certain management packs that\nhave to be imported on the SCOM side so\n\n728\n00:34:38.897 --> 00:34:42.039\nthat we can manage VMM, and\nthen the connection has to be made.\n\n729\n00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:46.359\nWe give the ops manager instance here and\nwe specify how we're gonna connect and\n\n730\n00:34:46.359 --> 00:34:48.368\nwhat kind of communication we want.\n\n731\n00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:52.123\nAnd then when we've done all of this, it\ntakes about 15 to 20 minutes to configure,\n\n732\n00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:55.091\nwe actually then are spun up and\nwe link these two products together.\n\n733\n00:34:55.091 --> 00:34:59.228\nNow if you haven't seen this done,\nif you take a look at the Microsoft SCOM\n\n734\n00:34:59.228 --> 00:35:03.586\nseries that we put together, and Cherokee\nhelped me with that as did Daniel.\n\n735\n00:35:03.586 --> 00:35:06.884\nWe went through and\ndid a top to bottom on monitoring and\n\n736\n00:35:06.884 --> 00:35:10.543\nmanaging the data center and\nthe cloud with Microsoft SCOM,\n\n737\n00:35:10.543 --> 00:35:13.890\nMicrosoft course 10964,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n738\n00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.490\nIf you go take a look\nat all that material,\n\n739\n00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.270\nwe actually do a demo of this exact thing\nas one of the walk-throughs there, and\n\n740\n00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.900\ntalk about how to link these\ntwo products together.\n\n741\n00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.658\nAnd you'll actually see it happen.\n\n742\n00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:26.092\nSo if you haven't seen it done, cuz we're\nnot gonna demo it here, just pointing it\n\n743\n00:35:26.092 --> 00:35:28.789\nout to you, but if you haven't seen\nit you wanna take a look at it,\n\n744\n00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:32.357\nwatch us walk through that and we actually\ndo the configuration and the integration.\n\n745\n00:35:32.357 --> 00:35:33.976\nWe show you how the whole process works.\n\n746\n00:35:33.976 --> 00:35:35.592\nSo you could see that as well.\n\n747\n00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:37.356\nBut we'll just cancel out of this for now,\n\n748\n00:35:37.356 --> 00:35:39.670\nwe're not gonna actually go through and\ndo this.\n\n749\n00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.446\nAnd then just in this area, finally, for\nour general settings walk-through, and\n\n750\n00:35:43.446 --> 00:35:45.414\nwe're obviously gonna\nhave to come back and\n\n751\n00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:48.869\nshow you the rest of the workspaces when\nwe get done with this, cuz there's so\n\n752\n00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:52.219\nmuch to go through that we are gonna\nobviously gonna have to have a part two,\n\n753\n00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:54.537\nas they say,\nassociated with this conversation.\n\n754\n00:35:54.537 --> 00:35:57.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But for console add-ins, just this is\n\n755\n00:35:57.116 --> 00:36:01.222\nlast area under Settings so we can round\nup this one topic and just make sure we do\n\n756\n00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:05.040\nall the things for it, you'll see\nwe can import console add-ins here.\n\n757\n00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.369\nSo we have the ability to be able to come\nin and we can go out and add in additional\n\n758\n00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:13.982\ncapabilities that maybe a third-party\nprovider, or Microsoft, has given us.\n\n759\n00:36:13.982 --> 00:36:17.980\nSo these will be functional elements\nthat are added in and bringing in.\n\n760\n00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.170\nYou can think of the moments like it's\nupdate packs or things like that.\n\n761\n00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.070\nWe'd go out and we grab them,\nwe'd have to download them, of course, and\n\n762\n00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.090\nbring them in so we would browse for them.\n\n763\n00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.600\nYou'll see here, typically zip files\nhow they are gonna be presented so\n\n764\n00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.720\nwe'd open that up, bring them in,\nload the appropriate files.\n\n765\n00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.780\nWe would be adding\nfunctionality into the console\n\n766\n00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.150\nif there are those things\nthat will be available.\n\n767\n00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.340\nAnd, from time to time, there are updates\nthat Microsoft puts out that may be added\n\n768\n00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.108\nas a component or a console add-in.\n\n769\n00:36:44.108 --> 00:36:47.980\nThere are third-party vendors that will\nintegrate some of their functionality and\n\n770\n00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.742\noccasionally provide a console add-in, so\nmaybe something for you to take a look at.\n\n771\n00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:57.242\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I may or may not be\na fortune teller but as Adam said,\n\n772\n00:36:57.242 --> 00:37:01.654\nthere may be a part two for\nthis episode in the cards.\n\n773\n00:37:01.654 --> 00:37:04.975\nSo stay tuned, and that's because we\njust want you to have a really strong\n\n774\n00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:08.560\nfoundation when it comes to setting\nup your private cloud environment.\n\n775\n00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.650\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n776\n00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.960\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n777\n00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.985\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n778\n00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:20.905\n[MUSIC]\n\n779\n00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:24.511\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.329\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.741\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your monitoring and\noperating on private cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.420\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.810\nThis is actually continuation of part two\nwhere we're looking at how to create and\n\n8\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.300\nconfigure a private cloud environment.\n\n9\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.740\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.573\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:30.950\n&gt;&gt; In studios, I'm good,\nthank you for being here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.659\nWe're gonna talk like\nthis the whole episode.\n\n13\n00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.673\nBoy is that really annoying\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n14\n00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:36.763\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, hopefully you guys are doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:39.520\nThank you for joining us again.\n\n16\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.670\nWe are in part two.\n\n17\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.952\nWe've been doing a walk-thru\non the SCVMM console.\n\n18\n00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.960\nWe're gonna continue that thought\nprocess by way of talking about and\n\n19\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.460\nexpounding on how we configure\na private cloud, set it up.\n\n20\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.204\nReally the key building block,\none of the two anyway,\n\n21\n00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:56.977\nthe one we're focusing on in this\nparticular set of discussions is SCVMM.\n\n22\n00:00:56.977 --> 00:01:00.690\nSo we're gonna be taking a look at\nsystem center virtual machine manager.\n\n23\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.325\nA part duey as they say.\n\n24\n00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:04.398\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We left off in the console at\n\n25\n00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.468\nthe end of the last episode having walk\nthrough all the general settings and\n\n26\n00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.490\nthe specific settings associated\nwith configuring and orchestrating.\n\n27\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.910\nWe talked about and\ntook a look at security, looked at use,\n\n28\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.560\nuser roles rather and run as accounts.\n\n29\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.396\nWe talked about some of\nthe intricacies of setting that up and\n\n30\n00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:21.296\nbinding those two together.\n\n31\n00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:25.195\nWe're gonna continue that journey so\nif you join me back over,\n\n32\n00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.110\nI almost had that right, right over there.\n\n33\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.831\nClose enough I was in the general\nscreen area so that kinda counts,\n\n34\n00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.757\nit's like playing darts I was not\nquite in the bullseye but I was close.\n\n35\n00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:37.252\nSo what we're gonna do is just pick\nup where we left off, we're gonna\n\n36\n00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:42.070\nmove into the jobs work area here, not a\nlot to talk about here it's really simple.\n\n37\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.980\nThis is where we see the jobs\nthat may be running.\n\n38\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.120\nWe may see and can see the historical\njobs if we have any running.\n\n39\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.773\nWe don't have any jobs that\nare running right now but.\n\n40\n00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:53.611\nBut we did do that, hey let's create\nthe run as account, let's create the real\n\n41\n00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.730\nthing and we set up the Cherokee\nrun as account of Cherokee roll.\n\n42\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.500\nAnd we saw the job monitor while\nwe were doing that so quick and\n\n43\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.720\nby the time we put it up and opened it it\nwas basically done, but essentially we\n\n44\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.640\ncould shut that down, bring it back up,\nwith the jobs items right up here.\n\n45\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.440\nAnd so we can certainly go on and do that.\n\n46\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.910\nAnd what that allows us to do is go in and\n\n47\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.450\nsee the historical jobs\nthat have been run.\n\n48\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.100\nAnd so we could see the Cherokee\nroll sitting right there.\n\n49\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.008\nWe could also see any critical failures\nif we have any jobs that have just\n\n50\n00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.034\nspectacularly failed.\n\n51\n00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:25.440\nNot just failed,\nfailed spectacularly right?\n\n52\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.180\nLike really bad failures, right.\n\n53\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.710\nWe would see them here, and we can go in\nand you'll see that when we do have a job\n\n54\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.190\nhere or a line that goes back over time.\n\n55\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Historical?\n\n56\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much yes that thing,\n\n57\n00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.980\nif we have a historical reference\nto jobs then we can go back and\n\n58\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.700\nyou'll see we have the ability to look\nat recent, last 24 hours, last 7 days.\n\n59\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.940\n30 days so we can go back over a period\nof time looking historically at the data\n\n60\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.810\nthat's managed for us and archived and\nstored in the data base if we need to.\n\n61\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.590\nSo we can interact with stuff here.\n\n62\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.630\nSo the job there is\npretty straight forward.\n\n63\n00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.120\nWe do have our library area.\n\n64\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.838\nThis opens up some interesting\nopportunities for us to take a look at\n\n65\n00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:08.615\nbuilding blocks and elements and\nwe'll spend a few minutes in here.\n\n66\n00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:12.191\nTake a look at the fabric\nresources that are associated as\n\n67\n00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.064\nwell with our capabilities.\n\n68\n00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:16.704\nWe'll talk about fabric here\nin just a few minutes but\n\n69\n00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:18.770\nlet's start with our library area.\n\n70\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.430\nWe do have our templates and so\nwe can we see up here that we do have,\n\n71\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.540\nlet me see if I can open this up\njust a bit so you can see that.\n\n72\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.970\nWe do have our service\ndeployment configurations,\n\n73\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.680\nwe do have our service templates,\nour VM templates,\n\n74\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.170\nwe're gonna be getting in and\ntake you look at all these.\n\n75\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.788\nBut essentially we can go in, you'll\nsee we have the ability to create a new\n\n76\n00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:42.522\nservice template, a VM template,\ncreate and you could see we have different\n\n77\n00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.465\nprofiles that are available\nhere from profile area as well.\n\n78\n00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:49.843\nWe're gonna be using these as building\nblocks to start bundling together\n\n79\n00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:52.596\nservices into our\ninformation that we need and\n\n80\n00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:56.478\nbe able to bring together the things\nthat we wanna be able to use and\n\n81\n00:03:56.478 --> 00:04:01.160\ndo in order to accomplish the hosting and\nthe management of the private cloud.\n\n82\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.420\nAnd so an application profile,\ncapability profile, a guest OS profile,\n\n83\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.770\na hardware profile, either a physical\ncomputer or SQL Server profile allow us,\n\n84\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.068\nand let's just look randomly at one here,\nto be able to go in and specify that\n\n85\n00:04:15.068 --> 00:04:20.290\nwe have our ITProTV HW1\n\n86\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.086\nhardware one or Gen1 profile and Gen2.\n\n87\n00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:28.625\nWe'll wanna create a profile for virtual\nmachine creation using either Gen1 or\n\n88\n00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:29.902\nGen2 capabilities.\n\n89\n00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:32.345\nAnd we'll talk more about what\nthese are in upcoming episodes.\n\n90\n00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:37.090\nWe can do this have this ready to go so\nwe'll do a Gen1 here.\n\n91\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.020\nAnd then we'll go ahead,\nwe'll click on Hardware profile, and\n\n92\n00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.460\nthis essentially like going in and\nediting out the settings on a VM.\n\n93\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.160\nAnd having it all built out ahead of time,\nbut then using this profile, so\n\n94\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.890\nthat when we apply the profile to a VM\nto create it, it's already preset.\n\n95\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.760\nSo you can think of it like a template\nin the sense that it really is\n\n96\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.220\nin most vendors, infrastructure called\na template more often than not.\n\n97\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.252\nBut we're just differentiating here\nbetween templates that are used\n\n98\n00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:09.040\nspecifically up there you see\nwe have a VM template as well.\n\n99\n00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.530\nWe can use templates in\na slightly different way.\n\n100\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.556\nThe profile just gets supplied so\nit can preconfigure or reconfigure for\n\n101\n00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:17.213\nus what we wanna have happen.\n\n102\n00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.156\nAnd so we could go in,\nspecify hey we have to many processor,\n\n103\n00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.908\nso much memory, whatever the case may be,\nwe're not gonna bother to go in and\n\n104\n00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.438\nconfigure all this right now.\n\n105\n00:05:25.438 --> 00:05:30.380\nBut let's just go ahead, we'll say OK\nwe'll just add this in so we have it.\n\n106\n00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.970\nAnd this will jump in here and\nbe available to us right here\n\n107\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.790\nunder our hardware profiles\nwe'll see it right there.\n\n108\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.986\nWe come over here to VM templates and\nwe go in and create a VM template.\n\n109\n00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:44.030\nOver here same idea, let's just go and\n\n110\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.717\npull this down for just one second.\n\n111\n00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:53.400\nActually, let me do this and bring this\nup in a way that I can actually see it.\n\n112\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.810\nSo, give me just a second to do this.\n\n113\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.800\nI'm just gonna do it this way.\n\n114\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.720\nSo when the wizard loads, that's still\nloading up the top of the screen.\n\n115\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.600\nAll right, not a big deal.\n\n116\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.970\nWe'll do it this way.\n\n117\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.713\nSo I just can't get to the very top of it\nto pull it down to actually maneuver it.\n\n118\n00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:07.394\nBut no big deal,\nwe'll be able to do it this way.\n\n119\n00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:12.000\nSo use an existing VM template or virtual\nhard drive that is stored in the library.\n\n120\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.910\nWe're talking about libraries, so\nit's already stored, available for\n\n121\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.120\nus as a VGDX for instance.\n\n122\n00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.520\nIf it's a virtual hard drive or VHD,\ndepending on the version we're using, or\n\n123\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.580\nfrom an existing VM that\nis deployed on a host.\n\n124\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.920\nSo go grab one.\n\n125\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.612\nIn other words, it's already there, just\nstandardized and used or go get one from\n\n126\n00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:33.119\nan existing VM and let's use that as our\nbaseline right, we have a choice here.\n\n127\n00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.186\nSo we'll be able to do this\nif we're gonna browse out and\n\n128\n00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:40.494\nuse an existing VM template we would have\nto go grab one that's available, and\n\n129\n00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:44.413\nyou'll see we have a blank disk large,\nblank disk small capability for\n\n130\n00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:47.250\nVHDX and for VHD, your older and\nnewer VHD format.\n\n131\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.440\nOlder VHDX format newer, so we're\nspecifying essentially what format our\n\n132\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.490\nhard drive will be, our data drive for\nthe VM small or large, we'll go ahead,\n\n133\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.400\nwe'll just do a small one just for\npurposes of getting this done and\n\n134\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.450\nwe will then click OK down there,\nlet me just hide my task bar.\n\n135\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.690\nWe have to do that sometimes while\nwe're doing the demonstrations.\n\n136\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.835\nSo you could see like that lower\narea where the button shows up.\n\n137\n00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:13.792\nSo give me just a second to do that,\n\n138\n00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:16.560\nforgot to do that while\nwe were getting started.\n\n139\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.510\nAll right so we'll do that,\ngot OK there so we'll just grab that so\n\n140\n00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.256\nwe can see that.\n\n141\n00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:24.029\nWe'll then click Next,\nspecify the identity so\n\n142\n00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.613\nwe'll give this a name ITProTV.\n\n143\n00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:30.179\nAnd we're doing a VM TMP1 for\nVM template 1,\n\n144\n00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:35.577\ngive it a little demonstration\nrather the little description there,\n\n145\n00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:39.800\nthen again we'll do gen 1\nversus gen 2 here, right.\n\n146\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.600\nSo we'll specify what\ngeneration VMs we want.\n\n147\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.034\nSo it says gen 1 VMs have capabilities\nthat were previously supported\n\n148\n00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:49.366\nby Windows 7 earlier if you can see\nthat at the bottom of the screen.\n\n149\n00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:51.828\nCan we go full screen just you guys\ncould see what I'm looking at while\n\n150\n00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:52.469\nwe're talking?\n\n151\n00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:57.791\nAnd then if we do gen 2 You'll see\nthat changes, let me just click there.\n\n152\n00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:00.168\nAnd you'll see Gen2 uses UEFI BIOS and\n\n153\n00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:03.350\nthe newer capabilities for\n12 R2 going forward.\n\n154\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.460\nSo depends on what we're looking to do and\nhow we're looking to host.\n\n155\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.600\nWe'll do a Gen2 on this one, we did a Gen1\non the other one, we'll click Next.\n\n156\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.090\nWe then have our hardware profile, and\n\n157\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.840\nyou could see, this is where\nour hardware profile comes in.\n\n158\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.070\nBecause the hardware profile is\na component of the overall template.\n\n159\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.590\nSo the hardware profile lets us spec out,\n\n160\n00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.420\nif we choose to do it ahead of time and\nwe have it.\n\n161\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.510\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nimport it, right?\n\n162\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.680\nWe're gonna use it, in other words,\nthe one we just created.\n\n163\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.312\nBut it lets us cheat a little bit and\npreconfigure all the settings for\n\n164\n00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:35.515\nthe VM as part of the broader template to\napply all the settings for deployment.\n\n165\n00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.720\nNow, the hardware profile's just one\nelement of this because you look.\n\n166\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.770\nAnd we're gonna go through and we'll see\nthe others here, but we have our operating\n\n167\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.870\nsystem configuration, application\nworkload, SQL server if necessary.\n\n168\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.900\nWe can create profiles for all these\nthings we haven't done that but you saw\n\n169\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.050\nthey were all there in the profile list\nand if we have all those profiles created.\n\n170\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:58.511\nWhat profiles allow us to do is add in\nthe preset elements into the template.\n\n171\n00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:01.110\nThe template becomes the master\ncontainer in other words.\n\n172\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.424\n&gt;&gt; Very modular design.\n\n173\n00:09:02.424 --> 00:09:04.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanna think of it, it's\na great way to think about it actually,\n\n174\n00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:05.972\nit's a very modular design.\n\n175\n00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:08.550\nIt's kinda like the IKEA of\noperating systems virtual machines\n\n176\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.465\ndeployment, right.\n\n177\n00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:10.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man.\n\n178\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.078\n&gt;&gt; Skitz and Gerber number five and\nOS number two,\n\n179\n00:09:13.078 --> 00:09:15.330\nyou ever do that when you go to like IKEA?\n\n180\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.540\nYou're in browsing on the shelves, and\nyou gotta go down these random aisles,\n\n181\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.750\nbecause logic would dictate hey\nlet's put everything together.\n\n182\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.254\nBut maybe it's just the stuff I buy,\nI don't know.\n\n183\n00:09:22.254 --> 00:09:22.815\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n184\n00:09:22.815 --> 00:09:26.598\nin general the stuff I buy winds up being\nin like five locations on opposite ends\n\n185\n00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:29.360\nof the building,\nit's never all in one place.\n\n186\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.470\nIt may just be me,\nmy wife says it's my face,\n\n187\n00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.870\nthat's what causes it, but I don't know.\n\n188\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.510\nI think it's just her.\n\n189\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.429\nDo I say I blame her?\n\n190\n00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:37.600\nBecause it never happens\nto me when I'm with her.\n\n191\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.160\nThat's the thing, if I go,\nshe sends me with my girls,\n\n192\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.150\nwe go get something,\nI will be in and out in five minutes.\n\n193\n00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.990\nNo problem.\nI go with her,\n\n194\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.120\nit becomes a four hour journey, and\nit's literally no matter what I do,\n\n195\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.115\nit's always like I gotta\ngo to four separate places.\n\n196\n00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:51.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So she maintains it's me,\n\n197\n00:09:51.706 --> 00:09:52.675\nI maintain it's her.\n\n198\n00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:55.073\nAnd well there you go what can we say?\n\n199\n00:09:55.073 --> 00:09:58.410\nBut we've been happily married forever and\na day so I guess it works.\n\n200\n00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.114\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do just pull down\n\n201\n00:10:01.114 --> 00:10:05.925\nour profile here, so you can see that\nwe can either use our default one, or\n\n202\n00:10:05.925 --> 00:10:10.658\nwe can go in and or we can go in and\nwe can add an existing hardware profile,\n\n203\n00:10:10.658 --> 00:10:12.773\nif we chose to pull that in also.\n\n204\n00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:15.110\nIt's up to us to decide how to do this.\n\n205\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.569\nI'm doing Gen2, which is why I don't\nsee the profile remember, right?\n\n206\n00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:19.810\nOur other profile was Gen1.\n\n207\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.001\nYou may be wondering, hey why'd\nhe click there and not see it in?\n\n208\n00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:23.621\nHe said it would be there,\nwhat the heck's going on?\n\n209\n00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:28.016\nBut remember I said Gen2 on the VM,\nour hardware profile was Gen1.\n\n210\n00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:30.880\nIt's very important to think about that,\nand remember we got to match that up.\n\n211\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.346\n&gt;&gt; It's not backwards compatible.\n\n212\n00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:35.151\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\ncuz Gen2 doesn't work for Gen1.\n\n213\n00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:39.140\nGen1 hardware profile will\nonly work with a Gen1 VM.\n\n214\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.114\nGen2 hardware profile,\nnew features, new capabilities,\n\n215\n00:10:42.114 --> 00:10:43.667\nwill work with a Gen2 VM right?\n\n216\n00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:46.290\nSo if we wanted to fix that, right?\n\n217\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.650\nWe could fix that if\nwe wanted to fix that.\n\n218\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.846\nWhat would we do here?\n\n219\n00:10:49.846 --> 00:10:51.250\nWe'll make the magic happen, right?\n\n220\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.878\nSo what do we do?\n\n221\n00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:54.740\nWe would come back over here,\njust give that a second.\n\n222\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.404\nAnd then you'll see that our hardware 1,\nand I did label it HW1 so\n\n223\n00:10:58.404 --> 00:11:01.218\nwe would know, right,\nthat our level 1 profile,\n\n224\n00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:05.295\nessentially Gen 1 profile is gonna\nbe available for our Gen 1 template.\n\n225\n00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:08.124\nBut if we do a Gen 2 template,\nwe can create profiles for Gen 2 but\n\n226\n00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:10.480\nwe have to have them\navailable ahead of time.\n\n227\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.674\nSo it is important to understand\nthat there's a version here, or\n\n228\n00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.695\nas Cherokee was saying essentially\nbackwards compatibility\n\n229\n00:11:16.695 --> 00:11:19.145\nconcern because gen 1 is gen 1,\ngen 2 is gen 2.\n\n230\n00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.060\nAnd we don't mix and\nmatch those two in the template.\n\n231\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.340\nWe can in the sense of bringing\nin individual profiles, but\n\n232\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.540\nthey have to be created the right way.\n\n233\n00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.997\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I've noticed a couple of\nthings that you've been talking about here\n\n234\n00:11:29.997 --> 00:11:34.078\nreally play into the prerequisites or\nI guess that kind of path that Microsoft\n\n235\n00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:36.839\nlays out as far as taking\nthe 70-4 series exams,\n\n236\n00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:40.460\nif they're still in that version and\nyou're still watching this.\n\n237\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.640\nBut like to obtain your MCSA,\na lot of that information is covered.\n\n238\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.927\nSo coming in to this show,\n\n239\n00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:49.200\nit really helps because you saw\nthe importance of PowerShell, and\n\n240\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.172\nif you've already sat for those exams you\nknow how important and you know how much\n\n241\n00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:56.696\nyou should really focus whenever\nyou're covering those topics here.\n\n242\n00:11:56.696 --> 00:12:00.100\n&gt;&gt; You do it actually to pre-req for\nbecoming an MCSC cloud.\n\n243\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.164\nAt least as of now and again as Cherokee\njust said, hey if that's still the case\n\n244\n00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:07.380\nwhen you watch this six months from now or\nwhenever you see it.\n\n245\n00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.739\nBut as of now while we're shooting\nthis early 2017 when we're doing this\n\n246\n00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:14.286\nnow the pre-req to be\nan MCSE cloud is you must\n\n247\n00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:16.653\nfirst be an MCSA as you were pointing out.\n\n248\n00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.529\nSo you have to have your MCSA credential,\nand\n\n249\n00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:24.990\nthen you build on that by then doing the\n246, 247 exams to become an MCSE cloud.\n\n250\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.603\nAt least that's one way to go,\n\n251\n00:12:26.603 --> 00:12:30.885\nthere are other class-exam mappings\nyou can go through, but typically 246,\n\n252\n00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:34.560\n247, because there's Azure stuff\nyou could do in theory as well.\n\n253\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.125\nAnd then you will build\non those sill sets, so\n\n254\n00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:42.110\nyeah you would have to have your MSCE and\nhave done all the exams required for that.\n\n255\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.559\nAnd, as we were talking about\nbefore we came on, right?\n\n256\n00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.494\nPersevere and continue through right?\n\n257\n00:12:45.494 --> 00:12:47.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to throwing in the towel and\n\n258\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.180\nsaying, I'm done, no more.\n\n259\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.100\nBut we were just chatting before we came\non, about the fact that it is a very tough\n\n260\n00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.340\nroad to go through, to get all the way\nthrough the MCSE Cloud, because there\n\n261\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.780\nare a number of classes or self study\nopportunities depending on what you do.\n\n262\n00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.150\nIt doesn't always have to be\ntraditional instructor led.\n\n263\n00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.980\nBut there's a lot of knowledge you have\nto acquire, let's put it that way.\n\n264\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.840\nAnd as Cherokee and I were saying,\n\n265\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.750\nthere are a lot of exams that you\nhave to sit through and do as well.\n\n266\n00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.596\nAnd there are several at the MCSA level\ndepending on how you go about it.\n\n267\n00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:17.656\nThree exams at least if not more, and\nthen you would have to then to do your\n\n268\n00:13:17.656 --> 00:13:20.330\nMCSE Cloud with at least\ntwo additional exams.\n\n269\n00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.790\nSo, it's a lot of work and\nit is a lot of time.\n\n270\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.960\nWe don't want to make light about that.\n\n271\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.519\nSo, it's a great set of pre-requisite\nknowledge skills you acquire being\n\n272\n00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:31.590\nan MCSA, PowerShell as you said and\nthings like that we've been talking about.\n\n273\n00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.050\nServer administration and knowledge of\nthe subsystems on the server storage.\n\n274\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.788\nDirectory services, file and print,\n\n275\n00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:40.474\nall that kinda stuff that we\nare either hitting on directly or\n\n276\n00:13:40.474 --> 00:13:43.542\nindirectly talking about become\nprerequisite knowledge for this.\n\n277\n00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:45.740\nAnd so,\nit is important to build on those skills.\n\n278\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.122\nIt's very very important to do that.\n\n279\n00:13:47.122 --> 00:13:49.376\nAll right, so let's go back,\nlet's take a look or continue looking.\n\n280\n00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:51.880\nSo, we could see we do have\nour hardware profile up there.\n\n281\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.636\nSo, we'll choose our hardware profile,\nwe'll make it a hardware,\n\n282\n00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:57.237\nrather a Gen 1 VM no big deal.\n\n283\n00:13:57.237 --> 00:13:59.452\nBut I just wanted you\nto see that difference,\n\n284\n00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:01.093\nI wanted you to understand that.\n\n285\n00:14:01.093 --> 00:14:03.651\nNow I didn't bother to make any\nchanges on the hardware profile,\n\n286\n00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:06.330\nso you just saw it kinda flash and\napply, but nothing's changed.\n\n287\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.940\nBut the reality is if I change that\nhardware profile, check off, hey I wanna\n\n288\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.850\nselect the capabilities for these hosting\nplatforms whatever the configs would be.\n\n289\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.494\nThat would all obviously have\nbeen applied here, right?\n\n290\n00:14:15.494 --> 00:14:18.730\nSo just wanna make note of that,\nknow that in our minds.\n\n291\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.410\nNotice also click New here.\n\n292\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.220\nWe can actually add to the profile\nafter we apply the baseline.\n\n293\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.220\nLet's say I want a secondary network card.\n\n294\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.680\nJust click New and add that in.\n\n295\n00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.350\nSo we're adding in new hardware here.\n\n296\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.280\nNew, what we're gonna do,\n\n297\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.640\nnetwork adapter, fiber channel adapter,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n298\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.470\nAdd a second network adapter,\njust go ahead and configure it.\n\n299\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.620\nConnect it up to a network, right,\nwhatever that network will be.\n\n300\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.980\nWe'd have to specify\nwhat our networks are.\n\n301\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.460\nI don't have any networks\nthat have been created yet.\n\n302\n00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.090\nWe haven't done that we\nhaven't talked about that,\n\n303\n00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:48.930\nthis is part of the fabric area.\n\n304\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.613\nBut I could go in and create a virtual\nmachine network if I want to right here or\n\n305\n00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:54.180\nI could have a pre existing one.\n\n306\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.724\nIf I just want to create one real quick\nyou'll see here I have to create a logical\n\n307\n00:14:57.724 --> 00:15:00.210\nnetwork before I go in and\ncreate an actual VM network.\n\n308\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.690\nI haven't done any of that\nbackground pre req stuff yet, and\n\n309\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.660\nI wanted you to see that error cuz a lot\nof times say, I'll just go quickly there,\n\n310\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.810\nyou can just jump right in.\n\n311\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.550\nBut there is some pre-rec stuff\nthat would have to be done,\n\n312\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.710\nwe haven't covered this yet,\nthis is coming up in upcoming episodes and\n\n313\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.160\nwe'll talk about the fabrics and\nthe networks and all that stuff in depth.\n\n314\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.225\nBut we'd have to have the logical network\nset up binding the physical adapters of\n\n315\n00:15:20.225 --> 00:15:23.811\nthe host into the actual infrastructure\nand then be able to use those and\n\n316\n00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.348\ncreate networks around\nthem as part of a process.\n\n317\n00:15:26.348 --> 00:15:29.007\nSo we're not gonna bother with that for\nthe moment but\n\n318\n00:15:29.007 --> 00:15:31.030\nwe could add that if we choose to.\n\n319\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.146\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\n\n320\n00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:35.446\nwe're gonna remove this cuz when I can\nactually add in the network adapter but\n\n321\n00:15:35.446 --> 00:15:38.767\nshowing that we couldn't we'll click\nYes there to get rid of that all right.\n\n322\n00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:41.070\nSo we've got that we'll go ahead and\n\n323\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:47.166\nwe will, Configure our\noperating system there we go.\n\n324\n00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:50.618\nSo we can have a guest OS profile, we\ndon't have one remember I haven't created\n\n325\n00:15:50.618 --> 00:15:53.261\nall these profile yet, but\nif we did we would pull this down.\n\n326\n00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:58.370\nWe would have our OS profiles, we can\ncreate a new Windows OS customization.\n\n327\n00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.795\nNew Linux OS customization solution,\nso we can specify deployment for\n\n328\n00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.374\nboth Windows and Linux,\nwe do have support for both.\n\n329\n00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:08.220\nIt's important to know that,\nvery big and important add-on there,\n\n330\n00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.810\nwith adding in that Linux capability,\nso we can do hosting on the Linux side.\n\n331\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.220\nI'll choose my Windows OS config.\n\n332\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.340\nI would then go in,\nspecify my operating system.\n\n333\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.340\nYou'll see here,\n\n334\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.070\nI have the ability to be able to use any\nof these operating systems, Windows 7.\n\n335\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:29.740\nRight all the way through and\ndown into Server 12, 12 R2, etc.\n\n336\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.380\nWindows XP is there.\n\n337\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.000\nWindows Vista is there.\n\n338\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.906\nGo back to Server 2003.\n\n339\n00:16:34.906 --> 00:16:38.070\nGot quite a number of OSs, right?\n\n340\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.450\nIf we choose Linux, just to show you here.\n\n341\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.270\nObviously this configuration area changes,\nso we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n342\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.108\nBut if we choose Linux, we have Cent OS.\n\n343\n00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:49.351\nLet me actually just do this one second.\n\n344\n00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:54.800\nIt keeps coming up right on top of our\nlittle virtual set of controls there.\n\n345\n00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.750\nThese are the virtual controls for the\nvirtual environment we're in for the VM.\n\n346\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.280\nSo unfortunately I can't move those and\nget those out of the way,\n\n347\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.435\nthey kind of just stay there.\n\n348\n00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:03.716\nSo I just wanna move off to the right,\nso when I pop that list up,\n\n349\n00:17:03.716 --> 00:17:04.938\nyou're actually able to see it.\n\n350\n00:17:04.938 --> 00:17:07.612\nSo it keeps coming up and\nbeing blocked by part of that, so\n\n351\n00:17:07.612 --> 00:17:09.690\nlet's just try that one more time.\n\n352\n00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.955\nSo you'll see here Cent OS.\n\n353\n00:17:11.955 --> 00:17:15.725\nWe have Oracle, we have Debian,\nRed Hat, we have a generic 32 and\n\n354\n00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:18.175\n64 bit Linux container and other.\n\n355\n00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:20.925\nSo any kind, any distrib,\nany kind of Linux that we\n\n356\n00:17:20.925 --> 00:17:24.155\nwanted to put that's not on the list\ncould be supported there as well.\n\n357\n00:17:24.155 --> 00:17:26.265\nSuse, Red Hat, Ubuntu.\n\n358\n00:17:26.265 --> 00:17:31.590\nSo we do have quite an amount of Linux\ndistributions that are supported,\n\n359\n00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.790\nthe enterprise capable ones.\n\n360\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.470\nWe could do one of these off-brand\ndistributions under the other option,\n\n361\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.780\nbut in general,\n\n362\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.510\nwe're gonna be going more often than\nnot for enterprise level hosting.\n\n363\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.270\nWe're gonna be going with something\nthat's enterprise more often than not.\n\n364\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.017\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back to Windows here and\n\n365\n00:17:46.017 --> 00:17:50.100\nwe'll just specify 12 R2 standard or\nwhatever it is.\n\n366\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.120\nWe put in our admin password,\nproduct key, roles,\n\n367\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.300\nfeatures, we could support all that and\npre-load all that in here.\n\n368\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.420\nSo we're totally customizing,\ntotally tricking out if you will, right?\n\n369\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.053\nPimping my OS as we would say, you ever\nsee that TV show Pimp My Ride, with?\n\n370\n00:18:04.053 --> 00:18:04.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I have, yes, I have.\n\n371\n00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:06.141\nExhibit.\n\n372\n00:18:06.141 --> 00:18:09.577\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, exhibit yeah,\nwith X, so that was a great show,\n\n373\n00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:12.090\nthat was like the original\nreality car TV show.\n\n374\n00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.690\nBecause all the other ones,\n\n375\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.310\nlike the ones you get now like Fast and\nLoud, Diesel Brothers and\n\n376\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.660\nall those other ones that are out there,\nthey all came after that.\n\n377\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.050\nPimp My Ride was like\nthe original hardcore one and\n\n378\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.740\nit was just the funniest too cuz it\nwasn't like he took himself seriously.\n\n379\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.020\nSo it was always something funny.\n\n380\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.400\nHe'd show up, he'd be driving\nthis piece of junk Nova, right?\n\n381\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.200\nTo show up and go take it to the shop.\n\n382\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.840\nAnd there are a couple episodes\nwhere the car would die.\n\n383\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.960\nThey had to actually push it or\nget it towed in.\n\n384\n00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.282\nSo I call these crazy things\nthat would happen, right, but\n\n385\n00:18:40.282 --> 00:18:42.426\nthen you would wind up with\nthis awesome car at the end.\n\n386\n00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:43.045\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n387\n00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:46.937\n&gt;&gt; It's all tricked out and-\n&gt;&gt; Pink and purple rainbow colors, yeah.\n\n388\n00:18:46.937 --> 00:18:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n389\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.620\nWe're not going to let you near\nthe console [LAUGH] by the terms of those\n\n390\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.560\ncolor are so fond up.\n\n391\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.280\nYou could also do a domain join on\nthe workgroup and or the domain here,\n\n392\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.890\nyou'll see if we go back and take a look.\n\n393\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.630\nSo we can do all the things we need\nto do right down at the bottom.\n\n394\n00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.310\nAnd then when we're done,\njust take a look.\n\n395\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.305\nWe also have the option to actually\nautomate this process with running\n\n396\n00:19:08.305 --> 00:19:13.300\nsysprep and an answer file, so we when we\ncan sysprep earlier versions of the OS.\n\n397\n00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.851\nAnd if necessary, you see appropriate\nsupport tools to do any of those things,\n\n398\n00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:18.925\nso we have all the abilities\nthat we need here.\n\n399\n00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:22.884\nYou can also do run once command,\nso we can get run script some time,\n\n400\n00:19:22.884 --> 00:19:25.340\ndo the configuration whatever it is.\n\n401\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.630\nSo once we're all done with all that,\nwe'll click Next.\n\n402\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.110\nWe have the same thing with\nthe application configuration.\n\n403\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.710\nWe can go in and specify our app profile.\n\n404\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.182\nKeeping in mind,\nwe have not created them but\n\n405\n00:19:34.182 --> 00:19:36.677\nyou know that we can be going through and\ndoing these profiles ahead of time.\n\n406\n00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:38.170\n&gt;&gt; It's an option.\n\n407\n00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.120\n&gt;&gt; It is an option.\n\n408\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.522\nBut we could do an application\nsetting here and\n\n409\n00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:46.840\nyou'll see we can add in a script app,\na SQL data to your app.\n\n410\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.820\nWe can do virtual app, so we can do app\nv virtualized apps can be deployed and\n\n411\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.540\nrun, dual web app.\n\n412\n00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.630\nSo we have the ability to deploy\nthese application workloads and\n\n413\n00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.070\nhave them configure and immigrate it as\npart of the virtual machine deployment.\n\n414\n00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.810\nRemember we're creating an end\nto end solution for cloud fabric\n\n415\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.200\ndeploy to virtualized operating\nsystem as the guest OS container.\n\n416\n00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.030\nAnd then on top of it, use these profiles\nto transform that configuration, so\n\n417\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.230\nwe spec this out and\nget this to look exactly like we want.\n\n418\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.910\nThis is the strength, this is the value.\n\n419\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.060\nThis is the wow and\ncoolness factor of using private cloud or\n\n420\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.040\nusing cloud in general, but\nusing private cloud in particular.\n\n421\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.940\nI mean if you think about\nwhat we could have done and\n\n422\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.190\nhow we would have done this exact\nthing just five or six years ago.\n\n423\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.410\nTrying to make this exact\nsequence of steps and\n\n424\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.340\ntechnology seamless and painless.\n\n425\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.180\nJust by having a polite conversation while\nwe're walking through and talking and\n\n426\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:38.805\nclicking buttons.\n\n427\n00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:42.700\nAnd 20 minutes from now,\nI have a fully functional server stack\n\n428\n00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.850\nwith a web app running automated and\nmonitored.\n\n429\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.660\nYou could have done this\njust a few years ago.\n\n430\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.540\nI mean you could have, but\nit would have taken you three or\n\n431\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.590\nfour days to build all of this by hand and\nset it all up,\n\n432\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.880\nnow we're doing this in\nminutes instead of days.\n\n433\n00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.040\nI mean this is really,\n\n434\n00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.360\nreally cool stuff at least to my way\nof thinking, to me this is cool.\n\n435\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.160\nBut then again I get impressed easily,\nso what do I know?\n\n436\n00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.242\nSo we have our operating\nsystem capabilities and\n\n437\n00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:06.843\nour compatibility based on\nthe application workload here.\n\n438\n00:21:06.843 --> 00:21:10.120\nWe would do this, we do the same thing for\nSQL Server deployments.\n\n439\n00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.810\nWe can actually deploy SQL specifically\nand an instance of SQL if needed.\n\n440\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.080\nCuz what better thing to deploy than\nthe database back in their host most of\n\n441\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.260\nthe data that we need.\n\n442\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.350\nSo we can do this, so we have our SQL\nServer deployment specify here, we go in\n\n443\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.710\nour instance name, enter ID product key,\nour configuration service accounts.\n\n444\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.960\nAll that stuff can be done and pre-load it\nhere as well again, we gonna remove this.\n\n445\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.823\nJust cuz I'm not gonna do this now.\n\n446\n00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:34.900\nBut we do have a pre-made profile for\nthis.\n\n447\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.234\nWe could spec this out and\nset this up ahead of time also.\n\n448\n00:21:37.234 --> 00:21:41.749\nWhen we're done we will click Next,\nand then just move this back over so\n\n449\n00:21:41.749 --> 00:21:43.920\nwe can see this over here.\n\n450\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.680\nWe will be able to view\nour script if necessary.\n\n451\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.630\nWe will then click Create.\n\n452\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.580\nWe'll give this just a moment.\n\n453\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:54.900\nWe see our job going in, we see a bunch of\nstuff dropping in there being done for us.\n\n454\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.550\nJust get rid of that real quick,\nlet's make this full screen again, and\n\n455\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.320\nthen you'll see we do have\nour VM template there.\n\n456\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.030\nNow everything is set up,\nour profiles have been linked and\n\n457\n00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.390\nwe've been able to use.\n\n458\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.590\nIn theory anyway, if we got all\nthese profiles ahead of time,\n\n459\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.290\nhave used all those profiles\nto pre-populate our choices.\n\n460\n00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.190\nMaybe modifying as we go and now I could\ntake this template if I wanted to.\n\n461\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.080\nAnd I could use this\ntemplate right from it,\n\n462\n00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.000\nyou can see there,\ncreated virtual machine.\n\n463\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.650\nIf I had actually loaded up the ISO,\nall configuration for\n\n464\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.660\nthe operating system, etc.\n\n465\n00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.590\nIf all that was available ready to go for\nme,\n\n466\n00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.080\nI would actually in about 20 minutes\nbe able to have a VM stood up.\n\n467\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.050\nReady to go on host just by clicking\nthrough and running through this\n\n468\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.330\nCreate Virtual Machine Wizard right\nhere from the template I created.\n\n469\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:38.970\nSo linking together two very important\naspects of the library, we're going\n\n470\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.190\nthrough in the library and we're\nusing our templates and our profiles.\n\n471\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.090\nTo be able to actually see\nhow we combine them together.\n\n472\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.890\nTo be able to do\na deployment end to end and\n\n473\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.170\nactually link the profiles\nto the template.\n\n474\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.710\nAnd as you said modularly,\nput them into the container and\n\n475\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.250\nthen use them for deployment.\n\n476\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.300\nWe do have our equivalent objects\narea here in the library.\n\n477\n00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.780\nJust click here real quick.\n\n478\n00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.760\nAnd we can see information about\nthe objects that we are managing.\n\n479\n00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.010\nMost of them are gonna be\nfrom the global namespace and\n\n480\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.650\nwe can then interact with them if needed.\n\n481\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.490\nAnd we'll come back and\ntalk more about a lot of these features.\n\n482\n00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.380\nWe do have our cloud library, so\nour cloud libraries I should say.\n\n483\n00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.650\nOur cloud libraries are gonna\nallow us to use and\n\n484\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.760\nliterally leverage the cloud,\nleverage the Azure fabric for storage.\n\n485\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.855\nTo be able to store our ISO files,\nstore our templates, store our images,\n\n486\n00:23:26.855 --> 00:23:30.631\nall that stuff that we wanna be able\nto use in this part of the library.\n\n487\n00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:32.938\nRemember the library is\nlike a filing systems,\n\n488\n00:23:32.938 --> 00:23:35.900\nit's where we put all our stuff and\npull it in and use it.\n\n489\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.450\nWe can put that up in the cloud and\n\n490\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.160\nuse cloud-based storage in\norder to be able back in this.\n\n491\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.240\nSo we can add a library server here and\n\n492\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.410\nthen actually be able to use that and\ndrive cloud-based storage.\n\n493\n00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.673\nSo we do have the ability to be able\nto go in and create our profiles and\n\n494\n00:23:48.673 --> 00:23:49.778\ndo all our stuff here.\n\n495\n00:23:49.778 --> 00:23:51.979\nWe could store that up in\nthe cloud if we choose to.\n\n496\n00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:54.350\nWe do not have any cloud\nlibraries here now, but\n\n497\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.852\nwe could have them into\nthe Azure fabric as I said.\n\n498\n00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.367\nAnd use them if we chose to.\n\n499\n00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:02.757\nSelf service user content, we can specify\nhere that we're loading up content that\n\n500\n00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:06.475\nindividual users may be able to come in,\npull down and interact with.\n\n501\n00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:08.708\nSo, we're gonna load up\nprobably ten plates and\n\n502\n00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.540\nISO images thing that like\nthat may be available to them.\n\n503\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.490\nWe may be delegating out and giving users\nthe right to be able to create their own\n\n504\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.591\nvirtual machines, that's one of the things\nthat we can do with the cloud fabric.\n\n505\n00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:21.763\nAnd certainly with the VMM console or with\nany of the management consoles that we\n\n506\n00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:25.550\nuse,we can scope them and\ngive users rights to do certain things.\n\n507\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.503\nAnd we may give users through\na self-service portal environment,\n\n508\n00:24:28.503 --> 00:24:31.038\nthe ability to deploy and\nto be able to do certain things and\n\n509\n00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:32.153\nthis would be part of it.\n\n510\n00:24:32.153 --> 00:24:36.210\nWe create self service run as accounts,\nand specify all of that for them.\n\n511\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.640\nAnd so this content would be what's\navailable to them from the library.\n\n512\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.950\nWe do have library servers,\nas you can see here.\n\n513\n00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.830\nAnd we do have our main server.\n\n514\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.132\nAnd we have all of our standing\ninfrastructure, VHDs and VHDXs.\n\n515\n00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:52.990\nYou saw me use one of them to\nDrive my template initially.\n\n516\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.210\nAnd all the other content that's already\nhere and preloaded as we install.\n\n517\n00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.760\nWe do have our library servers,\nthis is the one we initialized.\n\n518\n00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.720\nWe do have our stored folder, or\nour folder within the MSS CVN\n\n519\n00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.360\nlibrary folder where we put our VHDs in\nour application framework information.\n\n520\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.790\nThis is where actually all the equivalent\nobjects come from, from the web framework,\n\n521\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.160\nour custom resources.\n\n522\n00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.190\nThis is where all of our VHDs, our blank\ngeneric VHDs and VHDXs are stored.\n\n523\n00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.920\nThis is where we can go in,\nwe can see this infrastructure,\n\n524\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.140\nwe can highlight it,\nwe can interact with it.\n\n525\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.265\nThese are the ones that\nMicrosoft gives us.\n\n526\n00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:32.940\nProbably we can go in and we can look\nat properties of anyone of these,\n\n527\n00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.250\nwe can deploy from here, disable them,\nturn them off, enable them, turn them on.\n\n528\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.220\nThere's not much we will do typically,\nbut we can go in and\n\n529\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.090\nmodify the size settings here.\n\n530\n00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:46.440\nWe can view any equivalent resources that\nmay be mapped to this that we can use.\n\n531\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.190\nWe can customize or change,\nif we need to here, mappings and\n\n532\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.270\nwe can also look at dependencies.\n\n533\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.110\nWe don't have any for this, but\nwe could look at them if there were.\n\n534\n00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.260\nSo all of these are available to us here.\n\n535\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.673\nAnd if we have any stored virtual\nmachines and/or services,\n\n536\n00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:04.750\nthese would be archived for\nmaybe long- or short-term storage.\n\n537\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.350\nWe will have them available here.\n\n538\n00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.360\nWe'd be able to see them\nreflected inside the library,\n\n539\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.990\nup in and on the library server.\n\n540\n00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.220\nWe could add library servers.\n\n541\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.740\nYou saw that we could do\nthat both up here and here.\n\n542\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.810\nWe can bring in additional library\nservers to scale out our storage and\n\n543\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.240\nmake it available more broadly and\n\n544\n00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.690\nmake sure we have survivability in\ncase something were to go wrong.\n\n545\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.050\nSo that's always gonna be valuable for us.\n\n546\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.550\nWe do have our update catalog and\nbaseline as well.\n\n547\n00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.350\nWe do have the ability to integrate\nour patch management, and\n\n548\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.830\nmanagement capabilities from\na security stand point here.\n\n549\n00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.270\nSo we can do our update baselines here.\n\n550\n00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.010\nWe can create baselines and\nor use our update catalog.\n\n551\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.160\nWe obviously would have to be integrating\nthe WSUS functionality here and\n\n552\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.670\nhave our update servers set up.\n\n553\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.410\nBut we can then bring that in and\nlink that functionality and\n\n554\n00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.680\ndrive through it here.\n\n555\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.870\nWe'll be talking about that and\n\n556\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.370\nshowing you how to do some of that\nin upcoming conversations as well.\n\n557\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.310\nSo this is the library area.\n\n558\n00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.110\nWe also have our fabric area.\n\n559\n00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.210\nOur fabric area is made up of\nthree building blocks, main parts.\n\n560\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.370\nWe have servers, networking, and storage.\n\n561\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.070\nThese are the three fabric resources\nin virtual machine manager.\n\n562\n00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.970\nBefore we can deploy services out to\nthe private cloud, we have to make sure\n\n563\n00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.940\nthat we configure these areas as well\nwhen I want to create a network.\n\n564\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.610\nIt's today hold on.\n\n565\n00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.750\nYou don't have a lot of\nlogical network setup yet.\n\n566\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.500\nThat's part of configuration will take\nplace in the fabric area if your with\n\n567\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.540\nare networking stacks.\n\n568\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.730\nSo, we would be going in,\nwe would configure out and\n\n569\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.900\ninteract with everyone of these areas.\n\n570\n00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.310\nWe can go in, you'll see under servers.\n\n571\n00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.890\nAnd we have are all host.\n\n572\n00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:34.760\nSo any of our host are being used will\nbe able to host virtual machines will be\n\n573\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.540\nlisted here.\n\n574\n00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.970\nSo where we do house management,\nwe have our infrastructure, and\n\n575\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.860\nunderneath here on our Virtual Machines\nserver, or VMM server, not a host, but\n\n576\n00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.840\nremember this is our\ninfrastructure server.\n\n577\n00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.828\nAnd with our infrastructure server,\nyou know,\n\n578\n00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:51.729\nI just never pay attention to\nthose things when you do that.\n\n579\n00:27:51.729 --> 00:27:52.916\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a habit Adam.\n\n580\n00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:56.370\n&gt;&gt; You can just be waving at me,\nyou know I never pay attention to that.\n\n581\n00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm giving him the five minute\ntimer guys just so you know.\n\n582\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.820\n&gt;&gt; I just totally ignore it.\n\n583\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.451\nThat actually makes me think I have to do\nhave to do ten minutes when you do that so\n\n584\n00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:03.955\nalright.\n\n585\n00:28:03.955 --> 00:28:06.404\nSo, we will try to be,\ngravity is the order of the day.\n\n586\n00:28:06.404 --> 00:28:08.385\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will try to be a little more brief.\n\n587\n00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:11.370\nAlso, we do see,\nwe do have two distinct areas, right?\n\n588\n00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.010\nAnd host are gonna be where we load up and\nmanage VMs.\n\n589\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.050\nInfrastructure servers are the actual\nservers that are providing infrastructure,\n\n590\n00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.220\nin this case our VMM server.\n\n591\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.900\nSo there's a distinction here.\n\n592\n00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.650\nOur library and\nour VMM server row Or signed here.\n\n593\n00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.190\nSo, we do see our library server,\n\n594\n00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.340\nwe've already seen that, but\nremember we also Pixi servers.\n\n595\n00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.230\nWe have update servers which we\nhave not really configured yet.\n\n596\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.810\nWe may have a V center, as we talked about\na V center server that's brought in,\n\n597\n00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.950\nand that could be managed across platform.\n\n598\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.850\nAnd we do have our V and\nM server we see those here.\n\n599\n00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.590\nSo we can go in as you can see, whoops.\n\n600\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:47.270\nWe can go in, as you can see, and\nwe can highlight any one of these and\n\n601\n00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.810\nwe can be looking at\nproperties of the VMM server.\n\n602\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.600\nReally nothing of great importance\nhere except for our version number,\n\n603\n00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.620\nthat's our build number on\nVMM when it's installed.\n\n604\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.860\nThat number equates to SCVMM\n2012R2 just so you know.\n\n605\n00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.880\nIt's not a highly available system\nright now, we've only got one server.\n\n606\n00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.330\nNo high availability, no way to combine or\ncluster an anyway or load balance.\n\n607\n00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.020\nBut we could set that\nall up if we chose to.\n\n608\n00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.200\nSo we do have our infrastructure\ncomponent up under servers here.\n\n609\n00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.880\nAll of that would have to be worked with.\n\n610\n00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.920\nWe do have our networking area here.\n\n611\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.750\nQuite a lot of stuff in networking,\n\n612\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.705\nwe're gonna dedicate several episodes\nafter talking through all these.\n\n613\n00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:24.785\nWe're now gonna get into specific\nscenarios then understand,\n\n614\n00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:28.245\nreally show you quickly what's here,\nbut we do have logical networks,.\n\n615\n00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:30.876\nWe do have that the piece we got the\nwarning and it says hey, you don't have\n\n616\n00:29:30.876 --> 00:29:33.602\na logical networking machine,\nyou create that before you create network.\n\n617\n00:29:33.602 --> 00:29:36.725\nI told you we'll have to come and\ncreate that, we could see that here.\n\n618\n00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:39.765\nCreate VM networks, create IP poles,\n\n619\n00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:43.360\nVIP, virtual IP templates,\nyou now know what a template is.\n\n620\n00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.430\nPrepopulate all the settings with the\nprofiles that we can actually then create\n\n621\n00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:52.340\nour IP configurations and\ndeploy them out to our infrastructure.\n\n622\n00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.110\nWe can create our logical switches\nup to the top if we can go back\n\n623\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.680\nin and take a look.\n\n624\n00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.130\nWe'll see we can create\nour logical switches, so\n\n625\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.350\nyou could see up here very important\npart of this, how do we link our virtual\n\n626\n00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.800\nmachines together, how they talk to\neach other host to host and through,\n\n627\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.370\nin this case, through VMM,\nhow we're able to manage all that.\n\n628\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.900\nSo we can set all this up.\n\n629\n00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.430\nSo we'll be able to go through and\ndo all this.\n\n630\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.220\nWe have our port profiles, our port\nclassifications, our network services.\n\n631\n00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.520\nAll these are the moving parts and\npieces of networking.\n\n632\n00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.650\nAnd we would be going through and creating\nall the different pieces, right-clicking,\n\n633\n00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.510\nCreate New or use any of\nthe wizard driven items up here.\n\n634\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.330\nWe can even come in, you'll see that\nwe can then add resources in here.\n\n635\n00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.580\nSome of the resource like load balancers\nare not listed here into networking, but\n\n636\n00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.000\nwould be available to us.\n\n637\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.530\nWe have our network service which\nis part of our networking stack.\n\n638\n00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.950\nWe have our server roles which are here\nfrom our infrastructure area and\n\n639\n00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.090\nthe server area.\n\n640\n00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.110\nSo it's different options we have\ndepending on what we're looking to do.\n\n641\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.030\nWe're gonna have to add all\nof this information in.\n\n642\n00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:55.240\nAnd then we have our storage area or third\narea of the resources and the fabric.\n\n643\n00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.760\nAnd we have our providers,\nthese are our storage providers.\n\n644\n00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.980\nWe will have our storage\ndevices being added in.\n\n645\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.990\nSo this is our SAN, our NAS, our storage\npool, right where we're getting and\n\n646\n00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.010\nfrom local to this machine, sort of\nacross the network, whatever that may be.\n\n647\n00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.270\nWe're gonna be able to work with those.\n\n648\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.520\nAnd we'll be doing\nan upcoming hands on episode\n\n649\n00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.040\nwhere we actually add storage\ninto the storage fabric\n\n650\n00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.760\nas a deep dive in showing you\nspecifically how to walk through this.\n\n651\n00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.860\nWe're actually gonna walk through that and\na separate one that shows us how to\n\n652\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.170\nconfigure out the networking pieces and\nactually gonna go through walk you through\n\n653\n00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.140\nall of that in some upcoming episodes as\nwe continue wrapping up our conversation\n\n654\n00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.075\nfor a total to get out of how do we\nconfigure the private cloud topic.\n\n655\n00:31:34.075 --> 00:31:36.610\nWe're gonna walk you through\nthese two very important elements\n\n656\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.740\nof public configuration.\n\n657\n00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.590\nSo, you gonna wanna stay tuned for\nthose cuz we gonna come back and\n\n658\n00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.800\nactually walk through\nthese specifics of that.\n\n659\n00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.900\nBut just to show you what's left here\nreally quickly, if we could go back.\n\n660\n00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.340\nWe see, we have the arrays,\nwe have the file servers.\n\n661\n00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.670\nIf we're doing fiber specifically,\nfiber channel,\n\n662\n00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:56.420\nwe will set up our fiber channel fabric\nright there inside of the storage area.\n\n663\n00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.630\nSo all of this is part of our fabric area,\n\n664\n00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.830\nthis is all the settings on the\nunderpinning three key elements, right?\n\n665\n00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.360\nInfrastructure, which is up under servers.\n\n666\n00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.650\nNetworking, and\nstorage that we use as part of our fabric.\n\n667\n00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:15.000\nAnd finally, just to round out our quick\nrun through the consult, cuz Cherokee's\n\n668\n00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.850\nalready giving me the evil eye to get\ndone talking so we can finish up.\n\n669\n00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.120\nYou'll see we do have our VMs and services\nhere, last workspace up at the top.\n\n670\n00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.540\nAnd you'll see we have\nour tenant area here.\n\n671\n00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.790\nWe have our clouds here.\n\n672\n00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.510\nThis is where we connect out to\nthe private clouds that are being created\n\n673\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.260\neither on Prim Or\nthrough the network out to Azure and back.\n\n674\n00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.750\nAnd we can bring in,\nyou'll see create a cloud right here.\n\n675\n00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.570\nWe'll be doing an upcoming set of\ndemonstrations on how to set the cloud\n\n676\n00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.530\nup as well.\n\n677\n00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.910\nWe'll have our tenants here,\nif we need to work with those,\n\n678\n00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.320\nwe'll create our user\nroles specific to them.\n\n679\n00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.780\nWe have our virtual machine networks,\nthose will be created here.\n\n680\n00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.660\nBut we will have all the infrastructure\nparts from the fabric are with networking\n\n681\n00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.110\nso that when I actually do go and\nclick create network next time.\n\n682\n00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.030\nI already have the logical network, the\nswitch and all that other stuff set up.\n\n683\n00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.930\nSo, I'll actually be able\nto spin up the network and\n\n684\n00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.560\nhave that building block available.\n\n685\n00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.885\nWe do have our Storage and this is\nwhere our storage will be added in,\n\n686\n00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:06.835\nthis comes from the fabric as well.\n\n687\n00:33:06.835 --> 00:33:07.895\nAnd we have our hosts.\n\n688\n00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:11.785\nAnd you'll see VMs and services really\njust a workspace that brings together\n\n689\n00:33:11.785 --> 00:33:15.342\nelements, from the other workspaces\nthat we've configured or wanna use.\n\n690\n00:33:15.342 --> 00:33:17.842\nAnd make some easily available for\nus in one area.\n\n691\n00:33:17.842 --> 00:33:22.322\nIt draws from the library and\nthe fabrics area most likely, right?\n\n692\n00:33:22.322 --> 00:33:26.332\nIt's where we're gonna find all these\nstuff and allows have access to it so\n\n693\n00:33:26.332 --> 00:33:28.182\nwe can interact with it right from here.\n\n694\n00:33:28.182 --> 00:33:32.732\nIt's kind of a central common area where\nour most common tasks, probably our most\n\n695\n00:33:32.732 --> 00:33:35.902\ncommon configuration items and\nmanagement items will typically be.\n\n696\n00:33:35.902 --> 00:33:37.482\nSo when I drill in through four or\n\n697\n00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.932\nfive layers in the other workspaces\nin order to get to them.\n\n698\n00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.800\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n699\n00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.400\nI think there we'll know over time but\nit's okay Adam,\n\n700\n00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.020\nyou're still okay in my book and\nI know we have a lot more.\n\n701\n00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.200\n&gt;&gt; Did you say that actually you wanted me\nto bring you a coffee that's why you're\n\n702\n00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.020\nsaying that.\n\n703\n00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.840\n&gt;&gt; Coffee would be great\ncoffee would be great.\n\n704\n00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.890\n&gt;&gt; You're bothering me off so I'll\nbring you coffee that's what it is but\n\n705\n00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.650\nI do appreciate and thank you very much.\n\n706\n00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.780\nWe do have a lot of extra\ninformation to cover.\n\n707\n00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:58.800\nWe're just beginning here.\n\n708\n00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.290\nSo, ladies and gentlemen,\nplease stay tuned so we can go ahead and\n\n709\n00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.590\ncontinue with our studies here.\n\n710\n00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.990\nBut, for this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign off.\n\n711\n00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.840\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n712\n00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.489\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n713\n00:34:07.489 --> 00:34:09.251\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n714\n00:34:09.251 --> 00:34:11.116\n&gt;&gt; Have a virtuallytastic day, everybody.\n\n715\n00:34:11.116 --> 00:34:13.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n716\n00:34:13.122 --> 00:34:19.078\n[MUSIC]\n\n717\n00:34:19.078 -->

00:00:06.628\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:08.332\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.148\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud Series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.670\nIn this episode, we will be demonstrating\nhow to configure the storage fabric.\n\n9\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.440\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.110\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always a pleasure to\nbe here with you guys and hang out,\n\n12\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.160\nspend some time with Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.760\nAnd talk with you a little bit about how\nto set up and configure, as you said,\n\n14\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.540\nthe storage fabric.\n\n15\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.770\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n16\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.220\nIf you have not seen the episodes prior\nto this where we did a pretty extensive\n\n17\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.250\nwalk through in the VMM console.\n\n18\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.350\nWe dabbled and demonstrated for\n\n19\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.990\nyou randomly here and there,\nhither and yon as they say.\n\n20\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.050\nWe went through and talked about\nall the different work spaces, and\n\n21\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.040\nwe did touch on the storage fabric\nas part of the overall container\n\n22\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.370\nin the fabric area where we\nhave three building blocks.\n\n23\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.450\nWe have the networking,\nthe servers, and the storage.\n\n24\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.130\nAnd we demoed a little bit,\ntalked a little bit about what's in there.\n\n25\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.296\nBut I said we would come back and\n\n26\n00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:07.380\nactually take a look at specifically\nhow to set up the storage fabric.\n\n27\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.890\nWe're gonna do that in this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.400\nUpcoming episode right after\nthis one we are gonna go in and\n\n29\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.038\nconfigure the networking fabrics.\n\n30\n00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:15.280\nYou're gonna want to take a look\nat that kind of a part two,\n\n31\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.410\nif you will, to how we set the fabric up\nand maintain the general infrastructure,\n\n32\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.480\nthe underlying infrastructure required for\nus to start creating virtual machines.\n\n33\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.600\nAnd set up our private cloud.\n\n34\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.058\nSo you don't wanna miss that,\nthat's gonna be coming up.\n\n35\n00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:28.550\nIt's going to be very interesting for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n36\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.470\nBut let's jump in.\n\n37\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.480\nWe'll take a look at our storage fabric.\n\n38\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.540\nSo we have here, as you can see,\nour VMM console,\n\n39\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.740\njust already have it open,\nthat way we can just get right down to it.\n\n40\n00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.510\nWe're in our fabric workspace, we're up\nunder fabric here in the storage area.\n\n41\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.668\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n42\n00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:49.911\nwe're gonna use our\nAdd Resources area right here.\n\n43\n00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.262\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna use our storage devices and\n\n44\n00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.260\nwe're gonna go in.\n\n45\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.510\nAnd we're going to choose\nto add a storage device.\n\n46\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.100\nNow, we could do that here.\n\n47\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.460\nWe can also come down here and\nwe can just right-click on Storage and\n\n48\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490\nwe could choose Add storage\ndevices right from here.\n\n49\n00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.830\nSo we have a couple of different\nways to go in and do it.\n\n50\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.530\nIt's really up to us to decide,\ntakes us to the same place,\n\n51\n00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.100\ndoesn't really matter what we do.\n\n52\n00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.848\nEssentially wind up with this wizard\nright here, we have our storage or\n\n53\n00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:16.540\nSelect storage provider type.\n\n54\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.846\nCan we go full screen just so\nwe could see this,\n\n55\n00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:21.840\nI'll just move everything\noff just a little bit over.\n\n56\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.898\nSo that way you don't have the black or\nrather the blue square getting in the way.\n\n57\n00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:29.050\nBut we can see we have our\nSelect storage provider type.\n\n58\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.350\nAnd we have four types here, we are gonna\nwalk through the click by click\n\n59\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.570\ndiscussion and demo on Windows-based file\nservers, that's the one we're gonna use.\n\n60\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.730\nBut let's just quickly talk\nabout the others, just so\n\n61\n00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.380\nwe know what's going on there.\n\n62\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.920\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n63\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.545\n&gt;&gt; You have the capability,\nI'm so glad you said all right.\n\n64\n00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:44.488\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you said no, I'm like.\n\n65\n00:02:44.488 --> 00:02:45.713\n&gt;&gt; I know I kind of like talk, and\n\n66\n00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:48.573\nI'm thinking this in my head that I\nsay that loud sometimes, so I do.\n\n67\n00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:50.177\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That why we said use your quiet voice,\n\n68\n00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:51.430\nyour inside voice, right?\n\n69\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.506\nYou always say that to your kids,\nuse your inside voice.\n\n70\n00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They don't have a clue what you're\n\n71\n00:02:55.023 --> 00:02:56.615\ntalking about, they just keep screaming.\n\n72\n00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:58.010\nBut had Cherokee not said all right,\n\n73\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.080\nwhat would have happened is,\nI would have had to stop.\n\n74\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.910\n&gt;&gt; We wouldn't have done it.\n\n75\n00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.720\n&gt;&gt; We would have had to talk\nabout this off screen and\n\n76\n00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.420\nI would have had to convince her\nit was a good idea to do this.\n\n77\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.420\nSo I'm so happy you said all right,\nso we could continue.\n\n78\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.640\nSo what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n79\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330\nWe're gonna go ahead, just talk to\nyou quickly about these other types.\n\n80\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.207\nWhat we want to do is just point out that\nwhen we're configuring storage fabric\n\n81\n00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:18.555\nthe idea of the fabric is the container\norganizational structure or\n\n82\n00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:21.509\ninter connectivity depends\non what we're talking about.\n\n83\n00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:25.412\nIn the case of storage, we're talking\nabout network connectivity or\n\n84\n00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:28.010\nthe local connectivity or\nstorage provider.\n\n85\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.728\nIn this case we're gonna use our own\nmachine, the VMM host, the actual VMM\n\n86\n00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:35.701\nserver to do the storage for the Windows\nFile Share we're gonna get it locally.\n\n87\n00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:39.210\nBut if we were going out over the network,\nwe have to configure that network\n\n88\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.943\nconnectivity and understand how to reach\nour SAN, or Storage Area Network, or\n\n89\n00:03:42.943 --> 00:03:45.360\nour NAS device or\nNetwork Attached Solution.\n\n90\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.690\nThis is out over a network and so we have\nto have some additional thought processes\n\n91\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.620\ncoming to bear here about our provider.\n\n92\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.310\nIf we're gonna be doing fiber and\nyou could see we have an option for\n\n93\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.090\nfiber channel here as well.\n\n94\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.070\nFor the fiber fabric,\n\n95\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.530\nwe would have to have our fiber\ninfrastructure set up in the data center.\n\n96\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.705\nWe'd have our fiber channel switches,\nour fiber channel interconnects,\n\n97\n00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:09.110\nour HPAs, so our host bus adaptors or\nstorage adaptors specified for fiber.\n\n98\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.530\nAll of that would have to be\nconfigured and set up and\n\n99\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.600\nthen we will connect out to\nthat using our SMIS provider.\n\n100\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.550\nAlso, we'll just quickly take a look at\nthe options, even though we're not gonna\n\n101\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.540\nconfigure them, just so\nyou have an idea what's in there.\n\n102\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.680\nAnd talk a bit about some of the things\nthat may come up that'll be important.\n\n103\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.860\nLet's take a look at the SAN and\nNAS devices that are discovered or\n\n104\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.020\nmanaged through the SMIS provider.\n\n105\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.900\nIf we take a look here, we click,\nsome of these options will change and/or,\n\n106\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.470\nas you can see as I click\nwill become different.\n\n107\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.800\nYou'll see fiber channel fabric\ndown there instead of select so\n\n108\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.450\nwe have some options in the layout\nhere that will switch out.\n\n109\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.190\nWe'll go ahead and we'll specify our\ndiscovery type just to show you.\n\n110\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.780\nAnd we have our ability here to\npull down our protocol selector.\n\n111\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.360\nAnd we can choose either WMI or CIM, so\n\n112\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.210\nwe have the ability to use both\nan industry standard non-vendor specific\n\n113\n00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.025\ndiscovery methods through CIM\nand/or Microsoft specific WMI.\n\n114\n00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:09.415\nAnd we can use either one with the storage\nprovider fabric to then be able to go out\n\n115\n00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.365\nas a protocol and actually go out and\n\n116\n00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:15.295\nfind our storage that's sitting out\non the network, whatever that may be.\n\n117\n00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:17.415\nEventually, we are going\nto be moving away from WMI.\n\n118\n00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:22.080\nMicrosoft's made it clear that over\ntime WMI will be deprecated and\n\n119\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.340\neventually will disappear.\n\n120\n00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.870\nHow long that's gonna take, hard to say.\n\n121\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.420\nBut over time we are moving towards\na more open source, more generic stack.\n\n122\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.140\nAnd CIM, Common Information Management\nmodel, is gonna replace,\n\n123\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.510\nnot really replace cuz WMI\nis a derivative of that.\n\n124\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.330\nCIM's been around as long,\nlonger in fact that WMI.\n\n125\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.340\nBut the idea is that CIM is\nused by most major vendors.\n\n126\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.270\nVMware uses it in their stack.\n\n127\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.050\nCertainly many vendors do,\nbut we do support both.\n\n128\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.920\nBut there are slight differences\nwith implementation and\n\n129\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.830\nwith variations in terms of the cmdlets\nthat are supported in PowerShell\n\n130\n00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.110\nto reference the object classes,\nthings of that nature.\n\n131\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.260\nSo just be aware of that but\nwe would choose either one.\n\n132\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.244\nIt doesn't really matter for\nour purposes what we do here,\n\n133\n00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:09.682\nyou can see when we choose either one,\nthere we go.\n\n134\n00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:14.627\nWe do if we choose a CIM XML I'll get to\nspecify our port here along with our SSL\n\n135\n00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:18.800\nconnection run as account,\nthings like that if we choose WMI.\n\n136\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.839\nAnd you'll see that our port number is\nlocked out but we do in a run as account.\n\n137\n00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.420\nIt has to be browsed to be set but\nessentially get the same information.\n\n138\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.660\nSo we would go through,\nwe would specify this, right?\n\n139\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.080\nWhatever our provider may be\nif we have one, or IP address.\n\n140\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.120\nAnd then we would walk through and\n\n141\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.520\nprovide whatever is necessary based on\nour providers having been published out.\n\n142\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.710\nNow remember, just kinda look at it off\nto the side here for just a second.\n\n143\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.820\nThe providers we're talking about, are\nproviders that would have been detailed\n\n144\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.515\nout and defined as you can see over there.\n\n145\n00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.105\nI'm doing this cross,\n&gt;&gt; You did it right.\n\n146\n00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:50.525\n&gt;&gt; Like side saddle.\n\n147\n00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:53.829\nYou could see over there, our provider\nside, and then I'm pointing to in\n\n148\n00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:57.735\nthe console on the left in the work space,\nthat's where our providers would be.\n\n149\n00:06:57.735 --> 00:07:00.945\nAnd that's what we would be looking for,\nis one of the providers listed or\n\n150\n00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:05.005\nhaving been defined and\ncreated there up under the provider area.\n\n151\n00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:07.845\nSo we're not gonna walk all the way\nthrough that, because we're not set up for\n\n152\n00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.795\nus to actually use those providers.\n\n153\n00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:11.510\nBut I just wanted to show that to you.\n\n154\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:17.841\nWe could go in, And we could choose\nto do the same thing with SAN devices\n\n155\n00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:22.870\nmanage with the native SMP, a multipath\nprovider, we could be doing that as well.\n\n156\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.395\nWe could be doing fiber, when we do fiber\nhere we will have the option to provide or\n\n157\n00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:28.835\nspecify our provider.\n\n158\n00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:31.455\nAgain, standard intro screen,\nnothing different there.\n\n159\n00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:34.535\nBut we will go to our fiber\nchannel fabric here and\n\n160\n00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:37.035\nactually specify our\nfiber related settings.\n\n161\n00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:38.385\nSo we do have different storage options.\n\n162\n00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:40.545\nIt's really up to us to\ndecide how to do this.\n\n163\n00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:44.890\nInstead, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna do our Windows-based file server.\n\n164\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.890\nWe're gonna use some storage\nfrom the Windows network.\n\n165\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.530\nWe're gonna pull down.\n\n166\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.510\nAnd we are going to, see,\nwe don't have a provider there.\n\n167\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.462\nBut no big deal.\nWe're gonna provide a name for\n\n168\n00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:53.939\nour provider, if you will.\n\n169\n00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:57.026\nWe're gonna provide either an IP address,\nand/or an FQDN there.\n\n170\n00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:02.059\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna just\nget the name of our provider there.\n\n171\n00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:05.821\nWe're gonna do plabvmm01,\nwhere it is locally.\n\n172\n00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:07.550\nSo let me just type this in.\n\n173\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:13.391\nAnd we'll do 01.practicelabs.com.\n\n174\n00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:15.318\nSo we're gonna do our FQDN for\n\n175\n00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:19.568\nour provider which is perfectly\nfine as long as we know what it is.\n\n176\n00:08:19.568 --> 00:08:22.450\nMove that over so\nyou guys can see that okay.\n\n177\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.090\nIf this is in an untrusted Active\nDirectory domain we'd wanna specify that.\n\n178\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.250\nWe're not gonna do that cuz\nwe don't have an issue there.\n\n179\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.270\nWe are gonna browse and\nuse a run as account.\n\n180\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.470\nIf you remember we did\nhave our run as accounts.\n\n181\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.970\nWe did do the demo, I left the Cherokee\nrun as account in there for us to use.\n\n182\n00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.420\nSo you could see we already\nhave the run as account created\n\n183\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.060\nfrom the walk-through we did before.\n\n184\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.680\nBut let's just pretend for a minute.\n\n185\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.810\nWe didn't have one, we had to create one,\nyou may not have seen me do that,\n\n186\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.123\nwe did that on a prior episode.\n\n187\n00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:50.837\nBut let's just assume for\na minute we don't have a run as account,\n\n188\n00:08:50.837 --> 00:08:51.770\nwe have to create one.\n\n189\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.019\nWe do have the option to do that here,\nwe'll just walk through the wizard again.\n\n190\n00:08:55.019 --> 00:09:01.890\nWe'll call this, Storage,\nrun as just so we know what it is.\n\n191\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.650\nYou would name it something that\nmakes sense to you in the real world,\n\n192\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.640\nwhatever that may be.\n\n193\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.610\nWe'll do our username using\nthe domain/username format.\n\n194\n00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.470\nSo we'll do practice labs.\n\n195\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.818\nAnd we'll do our administrator account.\n\n196\n00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:19.550\nBecause we're gonna actually need that\naccount to get in and access the storage.\n\n197\n00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.160\nSo we want to use an account that has\nreal credentials associated with it.\n\n198\n00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.270\nAnd actually has write permissions\nassociated with it for\n\n199\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.900\npurposes of what we're doing.\n\n200\n00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.900\nSo we'll specify that.\n\n201\n00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.920\nWe'll put our password in.\n\n202\n00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.758\nLet's just go ahead and\ntype that in real quick.\n\n203\n00:09:33.604 --> 00:09:36.925\nAnd then, validate our domain credential,\nwant that to happen and\n\n204\n00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:39.070\nmake sure it will work the right way.\n\n205\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.280\nGo ahead and we'll click OK there.\n\n206\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.677\nIt's gonna validate for us.\n\n207\n00:09:41.677 --> 00:09:45.810\nGive that just a second to come back,\ndo its thing, it shouldn't take too long.\n\n208\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.002\nAnd then once we have that we now\nhave our Run As account specified or\n\n209\n00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:51.310\nhave it available for us to specify here.\n\n210\n00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.280\nWe'll do our storage run as account.\n\n211\n00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.678\nGonna click OK so\nwe'll have that programmed in there.\n\n212\n00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.058\nLet's click Next.\n\n213\n00:09:57.058 --> 00:09:59.556\nWe have to wait for that to go out,\nfind some information.\n\n214\n00:09:59.556 --> 00:10:01.029\nYou'll see it doesn't take very long.\n\n215\n00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:04.895\nNow, obviously if we had a lot of\nstorage providers that we had specified.\n\n216\n00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:09.435\nOr a large scale infrastructure with\na lot of stores associated with it.\n\n217\n00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:11.230\nIt may take a little bit longer, right?\n\n218\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.320\nBut we did one, it's very quick, it's\njust local on the machine essentially.\n\n219\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.990\nSo it's not gonna take too long.\n\n220\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.496\nSo we do have our provider there,\nwe can see, Practice Labs or\n\n221\n00:10:20.496 --> 00:10:23.624\nexcuse me PLAB VMM1practicelabs.com.\n\n222\n00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:26.863\nGot what looks like,\njust about 60 gigabytes of space there.\n\n223\n00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:29.069\nSo we're gonna have a little\nbit of space we can use.\n\n224\n00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:33.160\nSo that's obviously gonna be helpful if we\nhave to start thinking about hosting how\n\n225\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.748\nmuch stuff we can put out there.\n\n226\n00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.950\nWhat kind of VMs can we use?\n\n227\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.601\nHow big are they gonna be?\n\n228\n00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:39.849\nRemember we looked at\nin the run through or\n\n229\n00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:42.942\nthe walk through as we did our\ndeep dive into the console.\n\n230\n00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:46.064\nWe took a look at templates and\nprofiles and hardware profiles.\n\n231\n00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:48.538\nAll that kinda stuff,\nhow some of that will come together.\n\n232\n00:10:48.538 --> 00:10:52.239\nWe may wanna constrain the creation size\non our VMs to take advantage of that.\n\n233\n00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:55.089\nAnd that will be something we could\nthink about doing in our profile and\n\n234\n00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:57.176\nthen attaching that to our\ntemplate if we chose to.\n\n235\n00:10:57.176 --> 00:11:00.656\nSo we just wanna be thinking about how\nall that information comes together and\n\n236\n00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:02.539\nwe start linking those concepts as we go.\n\n237\n00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:04.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna select that.\n\n238\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.132\nWe'll click Next here.\n\n239\n00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:07.534\nWe then have to select\nour storage devices.\n\n240\n00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:12.080\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nhighlight the MS SCVMM library.\n\n241\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.880\nYou'll see here we have our ability to be\nable to bring in the total capacity of 60\n\n242\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.930\ngigs but available is about half that,\nas you can see.\n\n243\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.876\nWe're not actually gonna be able to mount,\nin other words,\n\n244\n00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:23.139\nall of that space cuz some of it's\nalready being used for other stuff.\n\n245\n00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:27.179\nSo it's available to us but we're gonna\nonly see the free space as being the part\n\n246\n00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:29.422\nthat's actually not being used right now.\n\n247\n00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.940\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n248\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.330\nWe'll go ahead and we'll see here\nwe don't have any classifications.\n\n249\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.952\nBut if we did, or if we had tiered our\nstorage and set up classifications.\n\n250\n00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:43.250\nYou'll see here classifications and\npools right over here.\n\n251\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.590\nWe haven't set them up but\nif we had done that,\n\n252\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.090\nwe could say this is tier one storage,\nmaybe top tier.\n\n253\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.970\nMaybe it's SSD driven so it's high speed.\n\n254\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.512\nMaybe this is tier two or\ntier three storage, lower.\n\n255\n00:11:54.512 --> 00:11:57.241\nA lot of times you'll often hear,\nand tiering is a relative thing.\n\n256\n00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:02.010\nMeaning that you can use whatever\nclassifications you would like to do your\n\n257\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.696\ntiering.\n\n258\n00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:03.894\nThere's no standard.\n\n259\n00:12:03.894 --> 00:12:07.482\nBut what most people do in the industry\nis either tier one, tier two, tier three,\n\n260\n00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:10.196\none being the highest typically,\nthree being the lower one.\n\n261\n00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:14.232\nYou often will hear gold,\nsilver, bronze or platinum,\n\n262\n00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:16.849\nsomething like that at the high end.\n\n263\n00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:21.135\nIndicating high level performance,\nindicating newer.\n\n264\n00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:24.141\nThere are different ways of thinking\nabout what tiering may mean to you.\n\n265\n00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:27.102\nBut the general idea is if we\nrank based on performance,\n\n266\n00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:29.610\nthis is just a meta data tag essentially.\n\n267\n00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.330\nA description we're defining ourselves and\nwe're assigning.\n\n268\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.980\nBut if we were to do that\nthen we would be able to say,\n\n269\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.740\nby the way,\nthis is the really fast storage.\n\n270\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.090\nWe wanna use that versus, this is the\nstorage we give to people that we hate,\n\n271\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.660\nthat we don't want anybody to use, right?\n\n272\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.970\nSo we just want to keep track of that.\n\n273\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.010\nNow we're not using classifications here,\nbut we could create them.\n\n274\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.024\nYou would come over here\nto the classification area,\n\n275\n00:12:49.024 --> 00:12:50.917\nas you can see,\nwe'd have those tags available.\n\n276\n00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.832\nWe would then be able to assign them,\nwe could pull them down, and\n\n277\n00:12:53.832 --> 00:12:55.855\nthis is used in large\nscale infrastructure.\n\n278\n00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:58.760\nSo we know what kind of\nstorage we're getting.\n\n279\n00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.820\nVery specifically and very importantly,\nespecially if we're doing cloud hosting.\n\n280\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.422\nSo if we're in ISP,\nthat's in the cloud services business.\n\n281\n00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:09.871\nIf we are ITProTV cloud as\nopposed to just ITProTV.\n\n282\n00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:14.045\nAnd we are giving customers storage\nbased on what they pay for every month,\n\n283\n00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:16.500\nyou think about the logic of the cloud.\n\n284\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.480\nWe want to give you whatever you want,\nbut we want to make you pay for it,\n\n285\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.010\ncuz that's just how things work.\n\n286\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.714\nI mean we wanna be nice after all,\nbut gotta make money.\n\n287\n00:13:23.714 --> 00:13:28.543\nSo if that's the case, and you're only\npaying for a level three storage,\n\n288\n00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:32.929\nbasic level storage, not SSD driven,\nnot high speed, not fiber.\n\n289\n00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:35.899\nThen we wanna make sure we classify\nthat storage in the right way and\n\n290\n00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.770\nassign the right storage profile to you.\n\n291\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.616\nSo you're not getting\nmore than you pay for but\n\n292\n00:13:39.616 --> 00:13:41.567\nalso not getting less than you paid for,\nright?\n\n293\n00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:43.281\nSo we wanna make sure we do that and so\n\n294\n00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:46.605\ntiering and classifications are used\nextensively in our industry.\n\n295\n00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:50.349\nBut it's typically done in multi-tenant\ncloud fabric providers that are dealing\n\n296\n00:13:50.349 --> 00:13:50.890\nwith this.\n\n297\n00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.443\nMore so than perhaps you\nhosting your own private cloud.\n\n298\n00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:56.075\nWhere let's face it, you're gonna\njust give all the resources to\n\n299\n00:13:56.075 --> 00:13:58.191\nthe organization,\nyou don't really care, right?\n\n300\n00:13:58.191 --> 00:14:00.262\nUnless somebody pisses you off in which\ncase you put them on this low storage.\n\n301\n00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:02.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you don't tell them that, right?\n\n302\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.840\nBut other than that, you're gonna\nobviously provide these resources.\n\n303\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.980\nIt's really not going to be a big deal.\n\n304\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.300\nSo in your world,\nit may not matter to you,\n\n305\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.620\nif you're running hosted\non prem private cloud.\n\n306\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.490\nBut if you're in the, hey,\nlet's charge for cloud business.\n\n307\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.780\nThis really does make a difference.\n\n308\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.030\nAnd it's something you\njust want to be aware of.\n\n309\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.880\nSo let's go back.\n\n310\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.830\nWe'll continue from here.\n\n311\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.360\nWe're not gonna set a classification up\nbut I just wanted to show that to you,\n\n312\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.110\nat least explain the logic\nbehind why we have that.\n\n313\n00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.100\nIf we do create or want to create\na classification, notice right down there,\n\n314\n00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.090\nwe can go in and do that right\non the fly here if we need to.\n\n315\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.490\nWe may have had them preconfigured.\n\n316\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.590\nAs I said, we'd be getting them from this\narea over here under the storage fabric.\n\n317\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.860\nBut if we didn't have them,\nwe could actually go in and\n\n318\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.770\ncreate one right here and\nthen just attach it to our storage.\n\n319\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.530\nBe up to us, what do you think,\nyou wanna flip a coin?\n\n320\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.220\nShould we create the classification?\n\n321\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.270\nI'm not letting you name it, but\n\n322\n00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.050\nI will let you say whether\nwe should create it or not.\n\n323\n00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.880\n&gt;&gt; Let's create it.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n324\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.977\nI knew you were gonna say that.\n\n325\n00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.224\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n326\n00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:51.160\nlet's create one real quick.\n\n327\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.187\nSo you can see here,\n\n328\n00:14:52.187 --> 00:14:55.930\nit's nothing more than literally\njust a descriptive name, right?\n\n329\n00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.970\nSo since Cherokee said let's create one,\n\n330\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:03.390\nlet's call this\nLet's Create A Classification-1,\n\n331\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.410\nfor level one, right?\n\n332\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.970\nLet's click Add.\n\n333\n00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.020\nWe have that in there now,\nit's been created.\n\n334\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.278\nWe now have let's create\na classification level one.\n\n335\n00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:15.716\nAnd of course now,\nour window doesn't fit on the screen-\n\n336\n00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:16.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:15:16.261 --> 00:15:17.376\n&gt;&gt; Where we can't see everything, right?\n\n338\n00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:19.663\nBut you can see that it's very simple-\n&gt;&gt; Pretty easy.\n\n339\n00:15:19.663 --> 00:15:20.987\n&gt;&gt; To add the classification.\n\n340\n00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:23.205\nNothing more than just metadata\ntags right, descriptions.\n\n341\n00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:25.039\nBut very important as I said.\n\n342\n00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.591\nIf we assign a system and\n\n343\n00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:31.499\nwe follow that system as a standardized\nway of attaching value to storage.\n\n344\n00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:34.438\nSo we can charge or\nput you in to the appropriate area.\n\n345\n00:15:34.438 --> 00:15:36.179\nBut again this is all person-driven.\n\n346\n00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:37.874\nYou gotta come up with this\nframework in your head.\n\n347\n00:15:37.874 --> 00:15:41.097\nYou gotta institute it and you gotta\nstandardize it for it to make sense.\n\n348\n00:15:41.097 --> 00:15:42.304\nOtherwise it's random.\n\n349\n00:15:42.304 --> 00:15:43.351\nIt just wouldn't really matter.\n\n350\n00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:46.820\nYou could have called that thing green or\nfuchsia for all I know.\n\n351\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Who would do\nsomething that crazy?\n\n352\n00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:50.810\n&gt;&gt; I have no idea, and\nif I ever meet somebody who would,\n\n353\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.008\nboy Am I gonna give them\na piece of my mind.\n\n354\n00:15:53.008 --> 00:15:54.828\nBut I would never let them do that.\n\n355\n00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:57.320\nAt least not if I didn't know how\nto spell it anyway, all right.\n\n356\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.700\nWe're joking around just because I\nlet Cherokee choose the name for\n\n357\n00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.770\none of our application demos,\none of our prior episodes.\n\n358\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.270\nAnd she said, why don't we use Fuchsia.\n\n359\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.040\nAnd I had no idea how to spell Fuchsia.\n\n360\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.650\nSo we just approximated that.\n\n361\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it worked out well, all right.\n\n362\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.649\nSo we did our classification here,\nwe're gonna ahead and gonna click next.\n\n363\n00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.990\nWe basically at that point have\nour summary screen, right, so\n\n364\n00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.130\nwe're gonna finish up.\n\n365\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.350\nWe've got a little summary.\n\n366\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.860\nRemember I'll remind you as I\nhave in a couple other episodes.\n\n367\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.790\nAnd I'm sure I will in the future\ncuz it is important guidance.\n\n368\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.780\nScreenshot that, right?\n\n369\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.386\nUse that for your documentation, know\nwhat you'd called it, know where it is,\n\n370\n00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:30.245\nknow how big it is.\n\n371\n00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:31.523\nAnd of course as we talked about,\n\n372\n00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:34.369\nview PowerShell script if you wanna\nsee how it's actually gonna be done.\n\n373\n00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.745\nAnd this one's kinda interesting.\n\n374\n00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:38.856\nIt's pretty big one compared to the other\none we looked at because there's a lot\n\n375\n00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:39.470\ngoing on here.\n\n376\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.570\nWe got a lot of happening.\n\n377\n00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.120\nWe gonna go out specify that\nwe're gonna create this thing.\n\n378\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.560\nWe're gonna give it a unique identifier\nand a unique instance of its own ids,\n\n379\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.882\nwe're gonna see that.\n\n380\n00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.730\nWe gotta add some native\nprovider names in there.\n\n381\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.390\nAnd then we actually have to\nspecify the file server and\n\n382\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.960\nthis is a good way which one of\nthe reasons I say hey look at the scripts.\n\n383\n00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.280\n&gt;&gt; It helps you learn also the syntax.\n\n384\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.150\n&gt;&gt; It helps you learn\nthe cmdlets absolutely.\n\n385\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:05.400\nYou could just go in to Management Shell\nissue the get command get-cmdlet\n\n386\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.580\nin a list all commands in\nPowerShell in that module for you.\n\n387\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.286\nExport them out to a text file.\n\n388\n00:17:12.286 --> 00:17:14.235\nYou have an already made cheat sheet\nthat you can make your notes on\n\n389\n00:17:14.235 --> 00:17:14.880\nif you wanna do that.\n\n390\n00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.200\nSo it wouldn't be hard\nto be able to do that.\n\n391\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.260\nbut my point is, if you do this,\nas Cherokee said its a great idea.\n\n392\n00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.470\nYou start to learn what some\nof things will look like.\n\n393\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.040\nActually, you know what,\n\n394\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.770\nwe can actually show you that real\nquick while we're doing this.\n\n395\n00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.960\nLet's just finish that up,\nlet that do its thing.\n\n396\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.430\nYou can see here we're adding in all\nof our storage related information so\n\n397\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.680\nas always, we get our job console there.\n\n398\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.520\nLike to see the green circles and the\nwhite checks, that's always good, right?\n\n399\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.270\nSo we're gonna minimize that.\n\n400\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.920\nWe'll come out over here.\n\n401\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.244\nAnd let's just go and\nwe'll take a look here.\n\n402\n00:17:46.244 --> 00:17:49.412\nLets go in here one second,\nand we can see our server.\n\n403\n00:17:49.412 --> 00:17:50.743\nThere's our file share right there.\n\n404\n00:17:50.743 --> 00:17:53.703\nSo we have our storage that's\nbeen mounted so we can see that.\n\n405\n00:17:53.703 --> 00:17:56.014\nYou'll see it lets you create\na classification, right, so\n\n406\n00:17:56.014 --> 00:17:58.950\nthat's our tag so we know that's\nactually what we just created.\n\n407\n00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.950\nAnd we can see it's mounted,\nmanaged, made available.\n\n408\n00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.950\nSpace is good.\n\n409\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.630\nWhat I wanted to show you\nreally quickly was the file.\n\n410\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:10.547\nLet me just bring back up my, if I can\nget to my bar there because I hid it.\n\n411\n00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.187\n&gt;&gt; Your machine inside your machine there.\n\n412\n00:18:12.187 --> 00:18:14.396\n&gt;&gt; My machine inside my machine\ninside my machine, right?\n\n413\n00:18:14.396 --> 00:18:16.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let me do that and\n\n414\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.450\nlet me see if I can just get that blue.\n\n415\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:21.700\nThere we go right there.\n\n416\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.800\nAll right, so let's just go in\nhere real quick for just a second.\n\n417\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.309\nAnd let's go behind the scenes, right?\n\n418\n00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:32.496\nSo I've installed VMM on this machine,\nwe're on a server 12 R2 machine.\n\n419\n00:18:32.496 --> 00:18:34.790\nAnd I'm just looking at\nthe apps in the app area.\n\n420\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.585\nWe're just gonna go scroll\nhere really quick, and\n\n421\n00:18:37.585 --> 00:18:40.781\nwe're gonna take a look,\nlet's go all the way back over.\n\n422\n00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:44.560\nLet's go back over here, and.\n\n423\n00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.840\nWindows PowerShell,\nWindows PowerShell ISE.\n\n424\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.400\nThere we go.\nOkay,\n\n425\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.170\nso Virtual Machine Manager Command Shell.\n\n426\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.050\nThat's what I was looking for.\n\n427\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.520\nThis is the instance of\nPowerShell specific to VMM.\n\n428\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.500\nWe have PowerShell, generically, and you\ncan see it kind of off right over here.\n\n429\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.210\nI'll just move over so\nyou can see both on the screen at once.\n\n430\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.030\n&gt;&gt; And your PowerShell ISE.\n\n431\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.250\n&gt;&gt; And we have PowerShell ISE exactly,\nin case you're wanting a cool,\n\n432\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.350\nrefreshing version of PowerShell.\n\n433\n00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a hot day and\n\n434\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.110\nyou wanna just cool off.\n\n435\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.350\nOr you had a hot cup of coffee.\n\n436\n00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.794\nYou may wanna have\na little PowerShell ISE.\n\n437\n00:19:14.794 --> 00:19:15.476\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n438\n00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:16.405\n&gt;&gt; To go with that.\n\n439\n00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:19.601\nBut if we're not gonna use ISE, which is\nthe graphical editor for PowerShell and\n\n440\n00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:22.390\nmay be worth your time to explore\nif you haven't seen it before.\n\n441\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.500\nBut we have a generic\nversion of PowerShell.\n\n442\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.395\nAnd when I say generic what I\nmean is it will run PowerShell.\n\n443\n00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:32.898\nBut it's not gonna have the module\ncmdlet specific, in this case,\n\n444\n00:19:32.898 --> 00:19:35.035\nto VMM installed in it already.\n\n445\n00:19:35.035 --> 00:19:37.920\nWe would have to load them in\nthrough an import command.\n\n446\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.998\nSo import module, and\nspecify what the module name is, VMM, or\n\n447\n00:19:40.998 --> 00:19:44.760\nwhatever it's called, to load up\nthe functionality, the specificity, and\n\n448\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.866\nthe support for these commands we've been\nshowing you that show up in those scripts.\n\n449\n00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:52.409\nThose are unique and specific to VMM and\nthey're stored in a module.\n\n450\n00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:56.917\nThe module is essentially the container\nthat we use in PowerShell to create all of\n\n451\n00:19:56.917 --> 00:19:57.989\nthe commandlets.\n\n452\n00:19:57.989 --> 00:20:02.584\nThe little get this, do this, file this,\nsend that, all that functionality is\n\n453\n00:20:02.584 --> 00:20:06.522\nin some cases generic, but\nin others specific to a certain product.\n\n454\n00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:10.355\nSo VMM has its own shell\nwith it's own module.\n\n455\n00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:14.710\nOps Manager does, most of the system\ncenter products do, exchange does,\n\n456\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.660\nSharePoint does.\n\n457\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.780\nMost of our products today can\nuse in leverage PowerShell but\n\n458\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.378\nhave specific modules that give us\nfunctionality or additional capabilities.\n\n459\n00:20:23.378 --> 00:20:26.220\nSo we're gonna be able to bring\nthose in if we choose to,\n\n460\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.880\nwe can use an import command and do that.\n\n461\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.856\nI'll show an trick with ISE in\njust a second to show you that.\n\n462\n00:20:30.856 --> 00:20:35.720\nBut we also can go specific to the module\nrelated content, in other words,\n\n463\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.540\nwe can load and cheat by loading\nthat module in ahead of time, and\n\n464\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.490\nhave a shell that already\nhas that built in.\n\n465\n00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.880\nSo we're gonna show you both here.\n\n466\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.000\nSince you mentioned ISE,\nI'm gonna show you a neat trick with ISE.\n\n467\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.950\nI'm gonna show you how you could\nget that functionality as well.\n\n468\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.780\nLet's go back, if we could, we'll go\nahead and we'll take our turn here.\n\n469\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.560\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna bring up\nthe PowerShell console specific to VMM.\n\n470\n00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.863\nBut what I'm gonna do is\nright click on it first.\n\n471\n00:20:55.863 --> 00:20:58.535\nI'm gonna pin it to the Taskbar.\n\n472\n00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:01.134\nI'm gonna pin it to the Start menu so\nwe see it, so we can get to it.\n\n473\n00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:02.139\nAnd you'll see it there.\n\n474\n00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:05.400\nAnd then we can just go ahead and\nstart it as Administrator, right?\n\n475\n00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.270\nSo we're gonna go launch\nthat as Administrator.\n\n476\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.450\nSo just give that a second.\n\n477\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.670\nNow, what I normally do with my shells\nwhen we have them set up for you for\n\n478\n00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.490\ndemos, is I changed the background so\nyou could see it a little better.\n\n479\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.140\nSo I'm gonna show you how we do that in\ncase you wanna go in and do that yourself.\n\n480\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.950\nIt's gonna be easier on\nyour eyes ultimately,\n\n481\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.230\nand you're also gonna be able to see.\n\n482\n00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.290\nSo I'm gonna make the options here for\ncursor size, large.\n\n483\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.110\nI'm gonna enable quick edit mode which\nlets me go in and mark things off,\n\n484\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.820\nand copy and paste.\n\n485\n00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.280\nI'm gonna go ahead and go to font.\n\n486\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.250\nI'm gonna use Lucinda Console.\n\n487\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.984\nThat's gonna make it easier for you guys,\n\n488\n00:21:34.984 --> 00:21:36.729\nin the real world you\nmay not wanna do that.\n\n489\n00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.436\nBut I'm gonna make that\na bigger font size.\n\n490\n00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:39.828\nWe'll make that 18.\n\n491\n00:21:39.828 --> 00:21:43.152\nI'm gonna go to colors and\nI make my screen background white.\n\n492\n00:21:43.152 --> 00:21:46.224\nI make my screen text this\nlovely shade of dark blue and\n\n493\n00:21:46.224 --> 00:21:49.519\nthat's gonna make it very easy for\nyou to see hopefully.\n\n494\n00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:52.600\nSo that way when we do something, it's\neasier for you to tell what we do, right?\n\n495\n00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.910\nSo, all right, now what I was\nsuggesting is if you do get command.\n\n496\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.840\nYou're gonna see all the commands and\nif you are careful and\n\n497\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.097\nyou read quickly, right?\n\n498\n00:22:03.097 --> 00:22:04.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You will get them all.\n\n499\n00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.160\nThere's a quiz at the end of this\nepisode by the way, so pay attention.\n\n500\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.952\nYou will see all the commands\nthat go back to the console.\n\n501\n00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.322\nBut let's be honest, you're not gonna\nable to really keep track of all that.\n\n502\n00:22:11.322 --> 00:22:14.330\nYou're gonna be there a thousand times,\none at a time.\n\n503\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.880\nDo that, wait, I got one.\n\n504\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.670\nIt's really not practical.\n\n505\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.060\nI mean, you could see that\nit's not real practical.\n\n506\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.590\nSo what you may wanna do is, do something\nlike this and output this, right?\n\n507\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.987\nSo if we do this out to a file.\n\n508\n00:22:23.987 --> 00:22:28.574\nLet me just create a folder here, so\nwe can put it into the C drive real quick.\n\n509\n00:22:28.574 --> 00:22:30.670\nAnd then we'll be able to go get it, so.\n\n510\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:37.860\nJust go in here, and let's just put\nit into PS for PowerShell, right?\n\n511\n00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.100\nSo we'll drop the output of that in there\njust so we know where it is, right, so\n\n512\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.370\nit's easy to tell.\n\n513\n00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.100\nSo let's do that in the PS and\nthen what we'll do is we'll output that\n\n514\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.090\nto vmmcommands.txt, right?\n\n515\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.570\nSo we know what they are, right?\n\n516\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.790\nSo that way when we do that,\nwe'll wait for that to finish.\n\n517\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.120\nThat doesn't echo back, but\nnow it just gets output directly.\n\n518\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.090\nSo now what we have is we have this\nnice file that's sitting here,\n\n519\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.220\nabout 400 kilobytes, right.\n\n520\n00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.290\nAnd what we can do is we can open\nthat up and we just literally\n\n521\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:16.789\nhave the listing along with\nthe module name for every command.\n\n522\n00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:21.049\nBut this would now give us the ability, as\nyou can see to go in an see what all these\n\n523\n00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:23.157\ncommands are, tells us what they are.\n\n524\n00:23:23.157 --> 00:23:25.410\n&gt;&gt; You could even use it as\na checklist when you're studying.\n\n525\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.620\nJust make sure you know what they are,\nthe functionality of them.\n\n526\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.380\n&gt;&gt; You could, absolutely.\n\n527\n00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.472\nAs I'm going down you're seeing there's\na whole bunch of different ones.\n\n528\n00:23:31.472 --> 00:23:32.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There is a lot, yeah.\n\n529\n00:23:32.165 --> 00:23:33.411\n&gt;&gt; Here as you can see.\n\n530\n00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:37.085\nThere's a whole bunch specific to Hyper-V,\nvirtual machine manager.\n\n531\n00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:40.425\nI outputted all the commands that\nare gonna be available here.\n\n532\n00:23:40.425 --> 00:23:42.990\nBut you could see, we could be\nspecific and just get commands for\n\n533\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.855\na certain subgroup.\n\n534\n00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:47.243\nAnd we would see that for fail over,\ncim commandlets, or whatever.\n\n535\n00:23:47.243 --> 00:23:48.216\nBut you get the idea,\n\n536\n00:23:48.216 --> 00:23:52.132\nwe would have the capabilities here to now\nstart building out, like a glossary list.\n\n537\n00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:52.938\nAlmost like what you and\n\n538\n00:23:52.938 --> 00:23:54.921\nI were talking about in one of\nthose other episodes where.\n\n539\n00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:56.486\nYou were excited about the fact we\nhad the glossary, cuz we could see-\n\n540\n00:23:56.486 --> 00:23:57.592\n&gt;&gt; I already printed my notes.\n\n541\n00:23:57.592 --> 00:23:58.120\n&gt;&gt; All that stuff.\n\n542\n00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.890\nSo Cherokee's already done her homework.\n\n543\n00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.230\nSo now she's gonna have to do this to\nstart filling in the blanks, right?\n\n544\n00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.940\nBut we can do this, and\nI said I would show you something cool.\n\n545\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.702\nShow you a little trick with ISE.\n\n546\n00:24:07.702 --> 00:24:10.130\nSo let me do this since we were talking.\n\n547\n00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.413\nWe'll finish up our demo here\nin just a minute on this but\n\n548\n00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:15.424\nI think this is worth the detour for\na couple minutes just to show you some of\n\n549\n00:24:15.424 --> 00:24:18.508\nthe tools that are gonna be helpful to\nyou to manage from behind the scenes.\n\n550\n00:24:18.508 --> 00:24:19.330\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n551\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.661\nI was talking to you about this earlier\nAdam that I had obtained my MCSA but\n\n552\n00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:27.921\nnever went to take the other two tests\nto get an MCSE because, frankly,\n\n553\n00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:30.700\npassing those three were quite a chore for\nme.\n\n554\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.955\nBut now that you've shown\nme these extra tools,\n\n555\n00:24:32.955 --> 00:24:36.260\neven just from recording these shows,\nI'm thinking about it, Adam.\n\n556\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What do they say?\n\n557\n00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.521\nYou go, girl.\n\n558\n00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:40.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You go do that.\n\n559\n00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:42.720\nYou be you, that's what they say.\n\n560\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.350\nDo you.\n\n561\n00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.970\nAll right, that would be awesome.\n\n562\n00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.910\nI will be the first one to\ncongratulate you when that happens.\n\n563\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.773\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; I will be there with your big light\n\n564\n00:24:48.773 --> 00:24:51.742\nchocolate mocha venti latte,\nbut I'm gonna have ISE.\n\n565\n00:24:51.742 --> 00:24:53.193\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In that PowerShell ISE for\n\n566\n00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:54.402\nyou, so we can cool it down.\n\n567\n00:24:54.402 --> 00:24:56.330\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna show you PowerShell ISE.\n\n568\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.360\nLet me just come back here.\n\n569\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.402\nI'm gonna just show you one quick things.\n\n570\n00:24:58.402 --> 00:25:01.191\nIt's not the cool trick but this is\nsomething to know which will get you in\n\n571\n00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:03.110\ntrouble if you're not paying attention.\n\n572\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.178\nSee, you may have picked up on\nthe fact when I was scrolling through,\n\n573\n00:25:05.178 --> 00:25:05.684\nif you didn't.\n\n574\n00:25:05.684 --> 00:25:08.584\nThat's what I wanted to show it to you,\nextend this a little bit more so\n\n575\n00:25:08.584 --> 00:25:09.670\nit is easier to see.\n\n576\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.919\nWe do have two versions of PowerShell\nseparate from, we probably have like four\n\n577\n00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:16.276\nor five actually by the time we get done\nadding in all the console specific shells.\n\n578\n00:25:16.276 --> 00:25:19.860\nBut just generically, in the OS,\nwe have two versions of PowerShell.\n\n579\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.020\nWe have the X86 versions.\n\n580\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.450\nAnd then we have the non X86 and\nother 64-bit versions.\n\n581\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.880\nNow, it's not a big deal.\n\n582\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.350\nBut we do have an ISE and a PowerShell\nconsole, or PowerShell command window for\n\n583\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.332\neach version.\n\n584\n00:25:32.332 --> 00:25:35.180\nYou wannamake sure you run the appropriate\nversion, depending on the OS.\n\n585\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.475\nAnd the things you're gonna wanna use.\n\n586\n00:25:36.475 --> 00:25:39.220\nSo I'm gonna use the 64-bit version here.\n\n587\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.180\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n588\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.693\nI'm gonna pin that to start.\n\n589\n00:25:41.693 --> 00:25:44.230\nI'm gonna also have that available there.\n\n590\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.010\nWe'll pin that to the taskbar so\nwe know what it is.\n\n591\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.966\nAnd we're gonna run that as Administrator.\n\n592\n00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:50.920\nWe'll let that load up here real quick.\n\n593\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.878\nNow this loads up, and you may think well,\nthat's kinda just crazy, cuz it's\n\n594\n00:25:55.878 --> 00:26:00.688\nlike PowerShell but just with a little\nmodule search area the side that it is.\n\n595\n00:26:00.688 --> 00:26:03.596\nBut you have to understand that when\nyou open this up, when you click here,\n\n596\n00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:05.176\nthis is really the value of PowerShell.\n\n597\n00:26:05.176 --> 00:26:08.962\nIt just comes up that way and you\nactually can write your scripts out here,\n\n598\n00:26:08.962 --> 00:26:10.626\ndo debugging, do error check.\n\n599\n00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:12.069\nThere's a lot of stuff you can do here.\n\n600\n00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:14.640\nI do all sorts of stuff with PowerShell.\n\n601\n00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.680\nWe're not gonna get into, hey,\nhow do you use PowerShell?\n\n602\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.862\nWe have a whole set of shows for that.\n\n603\n00:26:17.862 --> 00:26:20.090\nI invite you to come back,\ntake a look at all those.\n\n604\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.660\nBut for now, we're gonna assume you've\neither seen them or you're gonna need to,\n\n605\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.090\nand put them on you need-to-watch list.\n\n606\n00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.480\nBut I wanted to show you\na quick little trick here.\n\n607\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.750\nWhich is, can we go full screen,\n\n608\n00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.250\njust gonna need to see what I'm doing\nright behind me there to see that.\n\n609\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.248\nAll right, so when you go into PowerShell,\nas I said PowerShell by itself,\n\n610\n00:26:35.248 --> 00:26:39.308\nPowerShell lights, doesn't have the\ncapability for you to look up all those\n\n611\n00:26:39.308 --> 00:26:42.506\nDMM specific modules out of\nthe box cuz are not loaded there.\n\n612\n00:26:42.506 --> 00:26:46.520\nBut with ISE, we have the capability\nto go out and find those modules.\n\n613\n00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.181\nYou'll notice here we can search and\nwe can pull in any module that\n\n614\n00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:55.846\nwe would like concluding Hyper-V,\nMicrosoft PowerShell, and\n\n615\n00:26:55.846 --> 00:26:59.941\nif we scroll down,\nwe can find virtual machine manager.\n\n616\n00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:03.596\nAnd so we can zero in on just\nthe PowerShell specific or\n\n617\n00:27:03.596 --> 00:27:08.472\nVMM specific PowerShell cmdlets by\nusing the module selector there and\n\n618\n00:27:08.472 --> 00:27:10.840\nthen we can begin to look up these.\n\n619\n00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.973\nAnd so let's say we wanted to\nlook at Add Cloud Resource.\n\n620\n00:27:13.973 --> 00:27:17.583\nWe didn't know much about it, you'll\nsee here the import the virtual machine\n\n621\n00:27:17.583 --> 00:27:21.320\nmodule, you have to go ahead and use\nthe Show Detail button, it'll bring it in.\n\n622\n00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.020\nSo it goes in and it brings it in,\nso it loads the module for me.\n\n623\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.883\nAnd then, what it does, is it allows\nme to look at all of the cmdlets and\n\n624\n00:27:28.883 --> 00:27:32.029\nallows me to see all supporting\ninformation about it, so\n\n625\n00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:35.195\nwe can better understand it,\ndepending on what it does.\n\n626\n00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:39.717\nEach one of these will have different\ninformation, script, server abbvie,\n\n627\n00:27:39.717 --> 00:27:40.478\nweb deploy.\n\n628\n00:27:40.478 --> 00:27:43.300\nThere's different information that you\nmay or may not need to know about this.\n\n629\n00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.710\nSo we can cheat a little bit with ISE,\nbecause we can load the modules and\n\n630\n00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.110\nwe can actually see them.\n\n631\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.580\nWe can interact with them and\nfind out more about them, right,\n\n632\n00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.730\nfrom here, which is nice.\n\n633\n00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.490\nAnd then down here,\nwe also can see our command parameter.\n\n634\n00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.880\nSo we can go in and we can take a look\nat whatever command or common parameter.\n\n635\n00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.930\nI keep saying command.\n\n636\n00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.470\nWhatever common parameters may exist,\nwe can look at our error actions first.\n\n637\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.920\nAnd say if something happens,\nhow do we deal with error?\n\n638\n00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.380\nWell solid continue,\nstop continuing nor suspend, etc.\n\n639\n00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.970\nWe can look at any one of these.\n\n640\n00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.590\nAnd so we can see some of the common\nthings that are going on.\n\n641\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.560\nSame thing for warning.\n\n642\n00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.600\nWe can specify our warning action here and\ndo that and\n\n643\n00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.280\nwe can see what happens and\nhow this is set up and how it works.\n\n644\n00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.530\nSo it's nice cuz we can go in,\nwe can actually play around a little bit\n\n645\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.080\ninstead of having to go out and\njust Google each command.\n\n646\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.028\nRight, we can actually take a look in\nhere, start to get some information.\n\n647\n00:28:34.028 --> 00:28:37.845\nSo using ISE may not be such a bad thing\ncuz it's gonna allow us to see and\n\n648\n00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:42.087\nto understand more about what's\nhappening with those PowerShell cmdlets.\n\n649\n00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:46.249\nAs long as we know, we have to be\nmodule specific, meaning we have\n\n650\n00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:51.190\nthe import the appropriate module,\nthe get cmdlet we ran, out put that.\n\n651\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.810\nWe can then look at all\nthe commands available.\n\n652\n00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.039\nWe can zoom in on certain subsets\ncommands and start to work with them.\n\n653\n00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:57.935\nSo you have a couple\na different options in here,\n\n654\n00:28:57.935 --> 00:29:01.051\njust depending on how you wanna actually\napproach things and what you wanna do.\n\n655\n00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:03.140\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;&gt; All right, you're welcome.\n\n656\n00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.360\nSo let's just go back in real\nquick we'll just finish up.\n\n657\n00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.270\nSo you'll see what we do now\nhave our storage information, or\n\n658\n00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.750\nrather our file server storage\ncontainer setup made available.\n\n659\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.290\nYou see we mounted this.\n\n660\n00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.370\nOkay look at property's real quick.\n\n661\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.697\nWe can see, and we already saw the\nproperties down here below in the screen.\n\n662\n00:29:19.697 --> 00:29:21.652\nBut we could see the name,\nwe could see the path,\n\n663\n00:29:21.652 --> 00:29:23.660\nalways important to know what the path is.\n\n664\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.860\nWe could see our space available,\nsee our classification.\n\n665\n00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.550\nWe can file share manage by virtual\nmachine manager enable and disable.\n\n666\n00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.320\nSo that's how we actually configure\nout the storage fabric for\n\n667\n00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.720\nWindows file shares of course.\n\n668\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.510\nBut we talked about how to do this for\nSAN, for NAS.\n\n669\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.130\nAnd for fiber channel as well.\n\n670\n00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.411\nOnce we have our storage fabric set up,\nthat's kind of part one of part two.\n\n671\n00:29:42.411 --> 00:29:46.720\nWe would then go back in, and\nstart to work inside the fabric area.\n\n672\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.320\nSo in, over here, in the fabric workspace,\nwe're then gonna go into networking.\n\n673\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.725\nJust cancel out of there.\n\n674\n00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:55.907\nWe're gonna go into networking and\nwe're gonna then have to stand up and\n\n675\n00:29:55.907 --> 00:29:59.130\nset up all the different moving parts and\npieces for networking.\n\n676\n00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.275\nThat is gonna be our next how to episode,\nDIY ITProTV,\n\n677\n00:30:03.275 --> 00:30:05.991\nhow do you stand up network fabric?\n\n678\n00:30:05.991 --> 00:30:09.700\nAnd that's gonna be what you come back and\nsee us for as soon as we're done here.\n\n679\n00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, so like Adam said,\n\n680\n00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.620\nstay tuned because we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n681\n00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.869\nBut for this demonstration, that's it.\n\n682\n00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:17.410\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n683\n00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.340\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n684\n00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.200\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n685\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.284\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n686\n00:30:23.284 --> 00:30:29.291\n[MUSIC]\n\n687\n00:30:29.291 -->

00:00:08.225\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.187\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.800\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.560\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat creating networks and profiles.\n\n8\n00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.190\nAnd with us today we have\nMr Adam Gordon in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.701\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:29.055\n&gt;&gt; You are welcome, hello.\n\n11\n00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.960\nSo let's go ahead and let's get started.\n\n12\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.212\nWe are gonna continue talking about\nhow to configure out our fabric.\n\n13\n00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:35.230\nCome to part one.\n\n14\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.110\nIf you haven't seen that episode,\ndefinitely go back, take a look.\n\n15\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.160\nWe did storage.\n\n16\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.250\nWhat we're gonna do now is focus in on the\nsecondary aspects of fabric configuration,\n\n17\n00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.340\nwhich is all the networking stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.250\nAnd so if you join me in here,\nwe're gonna take a look and jump in.\n\n19\n00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.180\nWe have our work space open.\n\n20\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.310\nWe're in our fabric area, as you can see.\n\n21\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.290\nInstead of storage now,\nwe're looking at networking.\n\n22\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.970\nWe're gonna start with\nour logical network area.\n\n23\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.203\nWe have to create a logical network.\n\n24\n00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.144\nWe're also gonna do a port profile here,\njust kind of a one,\n\n25\n00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:03.680\ntwo combination to get our first\naspects of networking fabric stood up.\n\n26\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.920\nWe'll have some other things we have\nto do in some upcoming episodes as well\n\n27\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.760\nto round out the network configuration.\n\n28\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.100\nBut let's start with our logical network.\n\n29\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.370\nSo we're gonna right-click.\n\n30\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.200\nWe'll create a new logical network.\n\n31\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.190\nWe can also use the icon right up here,\nby the way.\n\n32\n00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.560\nIt works the same way.\n\n33\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.120\nSo we're gonna specify our name for\nour logical network.\n\n34\n00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.360\nLet's do VMM Logical Net,\njust so we know what it is.\n\n35\n00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.150\nFix that so\nit's actually spelled the right way.\n\n36\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.790\nAnd then we'll do ITProTV on\nthe end of that so we know.\n\n37\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.374\nAnd then you'll see, Select option\nthat describes this logical network,\n\n38\n00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:40.625\nin other words,\nwhat kind of logical network.\n\n39\n00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.694\nJust move this over so\nyou can see this while we're talking.\n\n40\n00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:45.520\nOne connected network down here.\n\n41\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.250\nIt says, as you can see here,\nnetwork site.\n\n42\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.800\nSo that's better, thank you very much.\n\n43\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800\nFull screen's always a good option when\nwe're talking about configuration choices.\n\n44\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.045\nSo you can see the network sites here are\nequivalent and routable to one another,\n\n45\n00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:56.640\ncould be used as single connected network.\n\n46\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.630\nIn other words, everything is\ngonna be connected on one LAN.\n\n47\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.040\nYou're gonna be able to see everything.\n\n48\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310\nIt's all together in one area.\n\n49\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.150\nWe have VLAN based independent networks or\nprivate VLANs,\n\n50\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.980\nwhat are called PVLAN networks.\n\n51\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.709\nThese are nested VLANs,\nVLANs inside of other VLANs,\n\n52\n00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.560\nsometimes called secondary VLANs.\n\n53\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.307\nHere we refer to them differently, just\ndepending on who you're talking about, or\n\n54\n00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:19.180\nrather, whose documentation you\nmay be reading, I would say.\n\n55\n00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.520\nBut you'll see we can be doing primary and\nsecondary VLANs in isolated mode.\n\n56\n00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.570\nWe could stack our VLANs one inside\nthe other and create a secondary layer\n\n57\n00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.840\nof isolation with a private, a community,\ndifferent kinds of VLANs associated.\n\n58\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.380\nIf you're not familiar with them,\nit's definitely an interesting concept.\n\n59\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.770\nIt's used quite a bit in virtual hosting,\nespecially in multitenant\n\n60\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.470\nenvironments where we wanna isolate\ncertain traffic from others.\n\n61\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.550\nSo it may be something to consider,\nthink about.\n\n62\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.010\nA little out beyond the conversation\nwe're having right now, but\n\n63\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.460\ncertainly something to consider.\n\n64\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.060\nWe do have that capability.\n\n65\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.590\nWe have our general VLAN\nbased independent networks.\n\n66\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.000\nWe can specify our VLAN pairs here to\nfind buyer's sites within the logical\n\n67\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.400\nnetwork that are gonna be\nused as independent networks.\n\n68\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.507\nEvery VLAN, in other words,\n\n69\n00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:03.270\nwill be essentially seen as an independent\nnetwork from every other one.\n\n70\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.900\nSo as a result, VMs may or may not be\nable to be routable to one another.\n\n71\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.309\nWe may not be able to see traffic between\nVMs and different VLAN based independent\n\n72\n00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.981\nnetworks, which would be good\nfrom an isolation standpoint.\n\n73\n00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:16.300\nThat's what we want from\na security standpoint.\n\n74\n00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.200\nFor purposes of our simple demonstration,\n\n75\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200\nwe're gonna use the one connecting\nnetwork and just go with that.\n\n76\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.100\nBut let me just show you what the options\nlook like if we switch over here.\n\n77\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.880\nJust look at what's happening\non this side as we go.\n\n78\n00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.378\nIf we choose VLAN, right,\nwe go here, we choose Next.\n\n79\n00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.128\nWe still have to specify our network site.\n\n80\n00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:34.860\nWe would add in our network site.\n\n81\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.620\nYou could see host groups that\ncan use this network site.\n\n82\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.720\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n83\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.480\nAny associated VLANs and IP subnets,\nwe'd have to have those VLANs available.\n\n84\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.380\nWe could insert a row and\nspecify what our VLAN is.\n\n85\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.891\nSo VLAN, you got a special VLAN number\nyou like, maybe fuchsia, green?\n\n86\n00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:57.022\nI don't know, what does that equal when\nyou translate that color into a VLAN ID?\n\n87\n00:03:57.022 --> 00:03:59.905\n&gt;&gt; 10.0.1.\n\n88\n00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.365\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's start with our VLAN ID.\n\n89\n00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:02.988\nSo if we're at a VLAN network.\n\n90\n00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:04.246\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so then let's just do that,\nnumber one.\n\n91\n00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.338\n&gt;&gt; Number one, okay.\n\n92\n00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:08.625\nSo our first VLAN,\nwe would then enter our IP subnet.\n\n93\n00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:09.890\nSo you were gonna give me a subnet.\n\n94\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.497\nWhat are we gonna put in there?\n\n95\n00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:13.252\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could just use a 10.,\nrange there.\n\n96\n00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:18.536\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so our IP subnet would be 10.0.0.\n\n97\n00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:21.243\n&gt;&gt; Maybe not one, cuz sometimes\npeople use that as a gateway.\n\n98\n00:04:21.243 --> 00:04:23.875\nSo maybe like, there you go.\n\n99\n00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.690\n&gt;&gt; So we could be inserting,\nright, various ones, right?\n\n100\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.983\nPut those in.\n\n101\n00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:33.100\nWe would then specify now, right?\n\n102\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.460\nLook here, invalid subnet.\n\n103\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.820\nWhat you gave me is not a subnet.\n\n104\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.724\nWhat you gave me is an IP address.\n\n105\n00:04:36.724 --> 00:04:38.283\n&gt;&gt; The IP address.\nThat is correct, sorry, Adam.\n\n106\n00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:39.924\n&gt;&gt; We would be doing our subnet, right?\n\n107\n00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:43.470\nAnd that's a common mistake people make,\nby the way, is that, we need a subnet.\n\n108\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.600\nThey put in the actual IP.\n\n109\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.540\nWhat we really want, let me just delete\nthat or let me see if I can edit that.\n\n110\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.310\n&gt;&gt; The actual mask here.\n\n111\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we want the actual,\nlet me see if I can get that out of there.\n\n112\n00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.603\nSo we want this, right?\n\n113\n00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:52.982\nSomething like 255.255.\n\n114\n00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:53.874\n&gt;&gt; 255.255.\n\n115\n00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:56.028\n&gt;&gt; I hope it's not 222, that's not good.\n\n116\n00:04:56.028 --> 00:05:00.579\n255., let's say 240.0 or\nsomething like that.\n\n117\n00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:02.123\nWhatever the case may be, right.\n\n118\n00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:04.599\nAnd then you'll see\nthat we can go through.\n\n119\n00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.112\nWe have an invalid,\nI wrote 2 as an invalid subnet.\n\n120\n00:05:07.112 --> 00:05:08.164\nHold on one second.\n\n121\n00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.120\nIt's not an invalid subnet.\n\n122\n00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.295\nIt is because we're not defining subnet.\n\n123\n00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:15.570\nI haven't defined subnets yet.\n\n124\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.890\nThat's why it's not\ngonna let me put it in.\n\n125\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.753\nBut it's giving me an invalid item because\nI haven't actually defined its subnet.\n\n126\n00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:22.468\n&gt;&gt; You have to put in a class full\nsubnet here if you don't define them?\n\n127\n00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:24.350\n&gt;&gt; No, we could do this.\n\n128\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.950\nIt wouldn't matter.\n\n129\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.850\nIt's just that I haven't defined\nthem elsewhere, and just one second.\n\n130\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.290\nI haven't defined them period.\n\n131\n00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.065\nSo when I go in and I try to,\nregardless, it's not gonna like that,\n\n132\n00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:36.558\nbecause I just don't have any subnets to\nclear it anywhere on the networking stack.\n\n133\n00:05:36.558 --> 00:05:37.168\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n134\n00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:38.970\n&gt;&gt; So that we can fix,\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n135\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.133\nBut I just wanted to show you that we\nwould actually be able to put these in.\n\n136\n00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.360\nAnd then once we do that,\nlet me just delete the row.\n\n137\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.390\nOnce we do that, and we do this here,\nand then we go through.\n\n138\n00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.260\nWe would just hit Summary and\nwe would be done.\n\n139\n00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.710\nSo adding in the VLAN ID\nis really not difficult.\n\n140\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.150\nWe just have to know\nwhat our VLANs will be.\n\n141\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.857\nBut then let's go back,\ngo to previous here.\n\n142\n00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:02.690\nLet's do private VLAN just so\nyou can see this.\n\n143\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.890\nWhen we do private VLAN network,\nwe do get the same basic idea here but\n\n144\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.310\nnotice that instead of just the primary\nVLAN ID, we get our secondary VLAN ID.\n\n145\n00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.130\nSo when we're doing the stacked VLANs or\nthe nested VLANs.\n\n146\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.050\nThat's what they're often referred to as.\n\n147\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.930\nWe have to provide two VLAN IDs,\none inside the other.\n\n148\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.521\nAnd the secondary ID can\nlead to an isolated VLAN,\n\n149\n00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:24.185\na community VLAN that you\ncan see other VLANs from.\n\n150\n00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:28.190\nThere's different ways you can do it, but\nwe would specify a secondary VLAN ID.\n\n151\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.580\nSo that's the only difference here\nis just the additional VLAN ID.\n\n152\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.600\nAnd then when we are doing our one\nconnected network, our standard default\n\n153\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.670\nchoice, the one that we will normally\ngo with, we'll specify that.\n\n154\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.420\nWe'll leave all the default choices here,\nbut let's just look at what these are.\n\n155\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.878\nWe'll just scroll over here for\njust another little blip, so\n\n156\n00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:46.840\nyou can see this a little\nbit more clearly.\n\n157\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.430\nAllow one VM, or allow, excuse me,\n\n158\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.010\nnew VM networks created on this logical\nnetwork to use network virtualization.\n\n159\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.020\nCheck that off.\n\n160\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.791\nCreate a VM network with the same network,\nwith the same name,\n\n161\n00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.840\nto allow virtual machines to access\nthis logical network directly.\n\n162\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.694\nWe can enable those additional features\ndepending on what we wanna do, and\n\n163\n00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:03.028\nhow we want our networking set up.\n\n164\n00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:06.120\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do this, we'll click Next.\n\n165\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.440\nWe'll do our site here.\n\n166\n00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.530\nYou can see network site, just like we saw\nbefore with our VLAN ID and our IP subnet.\n\n167\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.140\nWe're just not gonna bother inserting\nanything if we're not gonna be using them\n\n168\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.330\nnecessarily, but\nwe could put them in there if we want to.\n\n169\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.396\nSo here, we'll go ahead, and\nyou can see we have our network name VM.\n\n170\n00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:26.248\nWe have our All Hosts.\n\n171\n00:07:26.248 --> 00:07:27.464\nWe've inserted that.\n\n172\n00:07:27.464 --> 00:07:28.518\nWe've got that.\n\n173\n00:07:28.518 --> 00:07:30.080\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n174\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.619\nWe're not gonna bother with any\nsubnets right now, or excuse me,\n\n175\n00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.790\nany VLANs right now, but\nif we wanted to, we could add them in.\n\n176\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.200\nSo we have our site.\n\n177\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.647\nWe're gonna call it that machine name, or\nnot machine name, rather, logical network\n\n178\n00:07:41.647 --> 00:07:46.210\nname, underscore, and then an identifier,\nin this case zero for the first one.\n\n179\n00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.670\nAnd then we're gonna click Finish.\n\n180\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.626\nSo let's just go ahead and\nwe'll do that real quick,\n\n181\n00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:50.980\ngive that just a second to finish up.\n\n182\n00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.300\nYou'll see our job rotating down there.\n\n183\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.430\nEverything's been done.\n\n184\n00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.180\nCreate the logical network,\ncreate the logical network definition.\n\n185\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.460\nBoth of those have been done successfully.\n\n186\n00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.420\nSo once we've gone through, we've done\nthat, we do have our logical network now.\n\n187\n00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.620\nAnd it's set up, so a not very\ncomplicated one once we get all that.\n\n188\n00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.160\nBut we can insert our VLANs if we want to.\n\n189\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.220\nWe can go back, we'll actually\ninsert our VLAN if we wanna do it.\n\n190\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.190\nLet's go back and do one.\n\n191\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.225\nI'll show you how to put it in.\n\n192\n00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:18.911\nWe'll do it with a slash notation,\nso we'll put the IP and\n\n193\n00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:20.500\nthe subnet in together.\n\n194\n00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.242\n&gt;&gt; And maybe I'll read the instructions\nthis time and slow down and\n\n195\n00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:24.630\nnot put in random IP addresses.\n\n196\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.475\n&gt;&gt; No, well, what we'll do is we'll put\nthe IP with the subnet identifier so\n\n197\n00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:29.320\nwe can actually tell\nexactly what range it is.\n\n198\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.580\nSo that's how we're gonna do,\nthat's the proper form to do.\n\n199\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.365\nWe'll have the actual IP\naddress/subnet together.\n\n200\n00:08:34.365 --> 00:08:36.270\nSo let me just go edit\nthis after the fact.\n\n201\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.940\nIt's easy to do.\n\n202\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.920\nWe'll just go in here,\njust go to Properties we'll go in.\n\n203\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.220\nLet's go to network site real quick,\nand we'll add this in.\n\n204\n00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.600\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do,\nyou said you wanted one, right?\n\n205\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.480\nSo we'll do one, and\nthen we'll go ahead and we'll put this in.\n\n206\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.792\nInstead of 10 let's do 192.168.0.0\nwhich is our our range for\n\n207\n00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:58.830\nthe lab, for\nthe environment that we're testing it.\n\n208\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.043\nWe'll do our /24.\n\n209\n00:09:00.043 --> 00:09:05.530\nSo we'll do a /24 or 255 255 255 for\ndefault class C subnet.\n\n210\n00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.988\nSo we'll insert that there, and\n\n211\n00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:09.600\nlet me just look at my notes to\nmake sure that all looks good.\n\n212\n00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.580\nYep, so we'll do that.\n\n213\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.496\nWe'll specify VLAN ID1.\n\n214\n00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:13.730\nGo ahead and we'll click OK there.\n\n215\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.750\nSo we'll add that in.\n\n216\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.800\nAnd then we can actually tag or\nadd that subnet alone with that VLAN ID.\n\n217\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.486\nAnd now we can use all that traffic and\n\n218\n00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:23.160\nhave it all move through there\non that particular subnet.\n\n219\n00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.810\nSo we could easily add that in\nif we choose to with no trouble.\n\n220\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.400\nOnce we've done all that,\nwe have that all set up and ready to go.\n\n221\n00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.450\nYou could see up under\nour logical networks.\n\n222\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.150\nWe now have our logical network.\n\n223\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.380\nAnd from there,\nalthough we're not gonna do it right now,\n\n224\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.610\nwe could then create\na virtual machine network.\n\n225\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.800\nWe can create an IP pool if we\nwanted to add IP addresses in and\n\n226\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.460\nhave a pool to leverage.\n\n227\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.880\nWe could do that from here.\n\n228\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.890\nWe could go ahead, and we don't\nhave dependent resources right now.\n\n229\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.160\nBut we could view our dependent\nresources if we wanted to.\n\n230\n00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.817\nBut if we wanted to create a VM network,\nwe could then go in and specify,\n\n231\n00:09:55.817 --> 00:09:59.017\nfor instance,\njust do Net1 here, Network 1.\n\n232\n00:09:59.017 --> 00:10:00.678\nWe could do Network 1.\n\n233\n00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:05.353\nAnd we could, using our logical network,\ngo in, click Finish.\n\n234\n00:10:05.353 --> 00:10:09.270\nWe'll give that just,\nthere we go, just a second.\n\n235\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.660\nWe'll get our create VM network in there.\n\n236\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.900\nHere's our job, we've got that.\n\n237\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.260\nAnd now we've got our\nnetwork in there as well.\n\n238\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.280\nSo we've actually got our network created\nand associated with our logical network.\n\n239\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.091\nAnd we can now begin to use that\nto actually have VMs hook up and\n\n240\n00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:24.550\nstart to exchange\ninformation if we want to.\n\n241\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.494\nAnd we'll be creating\nVMs from templates and\n\n242\n00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:28.500\nsetting all that stuff\nup in future episodes.\n\n243\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.900\nWe're just laying down the foundational\nelements of the fabric right now.\n\n244\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.920\nSo we've gone ahead and\nwe've done our logical network.\n\n245\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.923\nWe've added in the other\nnetwork just to bind it,\n\n246\n00:10:35.923 --> 00:10:38.750\neven though we weren't necessarily\ngonna use that right away.\n\n247\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.830\nWell, what we wanna do now is\ntake a look at port profiles.\n\n248\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.020\nSo let's just go over here.\n\n249\n00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.512\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate a port profile for an uplink so\n\n250\n00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:49.630\nthat we can actually use this for\nthe host to be able to connect in.\n\n251\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.820\nAnd so what we're gonna do is\ncreate our Hyper-V port profile.\n\n252\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.789\nSo let's go in, right-click, and\nwe can see Create Hyper-V port profile.\n\n253\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.114\nJust move this over,\n\n254\n00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:02.520\ncuz this thing keeps coming up,\njust on the edge of our box in box.\n\n255\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.350\nAnd so what we do, is you'll see we\ncan select a different type of Hyper-V\n\n256\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.430\nport profile that we wanna use.\n\n257\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.790\nLet's go ahead and we'll give it a name.\n\n258\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.830\nLet's call this ITProTV\n\n259\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.640\nport Hyper-V.\n\n260\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.751\nSo we'll do that.\n\n261\n00:11:19.751 --> 00:11:23.360\nWe've got our virtual network adapter,\nport profile, or uplink port profile.\n\n262\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.760\nWe'll choose whichever one we wanna use.\n\n263\n00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.990\nNotice we do change what\nwe're selecting here.\n\n264\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.610\nLet's go back and just take a look.\n\n265\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.700\nWe'll have some different\noptions depending on what we do.\n\n266\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.547\nIf we're doing our uplink port profile,\n\n267\n00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:35.960\nwe'll specify our load\nbalancing algorithm.\n\n268\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.988\nWe have some different options here for\nload balancing.\n\n269\n00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:41.354\nThis is software-based load balancing\ndone in the networking stack through\n\n270\n00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:42.190\nthe hypervisors.\n\n271\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.040\nSo through Hyper-V and through\nthe application of either algorithms that\n\n272\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.150\nare used, or the proprietary load\nbalancing methods that we will deploy.\n\n273\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.638\nWe're gonna decide how to route traffic\nthrough the switch once we bind this to\n\n274\n00:11:54.638 --> 00:11:55.390\nthe switch.\n\n275\n00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.780\nAnd then specify how\ntraffic should be managed.\n\n276\n00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.030\nHow do VMs bind?\n\n277\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.370\nHow do they send traffic?\n\n278\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.280\nDo they stay bound to that port,\nor do they rotate through?\n\n279\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.740\nOr how does traffic get sent and\nreceived back and forth?\n\n280\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.450\nAnd this is what will happen\nbased on what we choose here.\n\n281\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.330\nSo we have address hash,\nIP address, MAC address hash.\n\n282\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.800\nWe have different ways of doing this,\nHyper-V port dynamic host default.\n\n283\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.550\nWe can do different ones.\n\n284\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.005\nEach one of these methods has unique\nproperties associated with it, and\n\n285\n00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:26.260\nwe would have to specify.\n\n286\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.340\nDepending on what we do, we in our mind\nwould have to know how this behaves.\n\n287\n00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.320\nWhen we do hashing, for instance, we're\ntaking a, in the case of address hashing,\n\n288\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.170\nwe're looking at source IP and\ndestination IP.\n\n289\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.280\nWe're gonna be able to hash the values.\n\n290\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.450\nAnd then based on what we're sending\nfrom or where we're sending from and\n\n291\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.370\nwhere we're sending to, we're gonna\ndecide how that traffic gets mapped.\n\n292\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.716\nAnd how it gets sent and\nreceived out through, what uplink adapter,\n\n293\n00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:53.320\nessentially through what\nuplink port on the switch.\n\n294\n00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.110\nAnd based on that,\nwe may bind to different uplinks or\n\n295\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.388\ndifferent paths out of the virtual switch\nfrom the hypervisor to actually send and\n\n296\n00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:02.750\nbe able to move traffic in and\nout of the host.\n\n297\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.846\nSo there's different options here,\nand we do have to be cognizant of or\n\n298\n00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:07.200\naware of what our choices are.\n\n299\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.812\nBecause if we're not paying attention,\nwe may wind up creating an uplink port\n\n300\n00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:14.660\nprofile that behaves differently than what\nit is that we would like to actually do.\n\n301\n00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.821\nSo we do have to just think about this,\n\n302\n00:13:16.821 --> 00:13:20.880\nmake sure we're aware of what we\nwanna do and the choices we make.\n\n303\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.340\nIf we choose also, and\n\n304\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.900\nwe can choose also here, teaming,\nwe can choose our teaming mode.\n\n305\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.391\nWe have different options for teaming,\n\n306\n00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:32.720\nbinding the ports together and/or\ncreating a redundancy solution.\n\n307\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.181\nSo if we lose one, we still have\nthe ability to use the others that are in\n\n308\n00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:39.190\nthe team, so that we don't have\na total failure of our path.\n\n309\n00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.990\nAnd we can use\nLink Aggregation Control Protocol.\n\n310\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.885\nSo we could use LACP to be able to do some\nadvanced management of traffic outside of\n\n311\n00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:50.800\nthe virtual environment if we support this\nout, for instance, in our CISCO gear.\n\n312\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.360\nWe could be using this in our stack.\n\n313\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.010\nAnd we could be doing bonding and teaming.\n\n314\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.585\nAnd we can do all sorts of stuff that\nwe could use to manage traffic and\n\n315\n00:13:58.585 --> 00:13:59.730\ncreate redundancy.\n\n316\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.570\nAs well as optimize and\naggregate bandwidth so\n\n317\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.645\nwe get the full value of all the bandwidth\ncoming through all the connectors.\n\n318\n00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.317\nSo we have a lot of\ndifferent options here.\n\n319\n00:14:06.317 --> 00:14:08.525\nIt really just depends on what\nour choices are gonna be.\n\n320\n00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:10.965\nCan we go full screen just so\nwe can see this a little bit easier?\n\n321\n00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:12.785\nIt's a little bit easier\nto see when we do this.\n\n322\n00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:16.295\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do our uplink port profile.\n\n323\n00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:22.145\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to just go here.\n\n324\n00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:24.660\nLet's actually just go back one second.\n\n325\n00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.980\nDo this, and we're going to choose our,\nwhich one do we wanna choose?\n\n326\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:38.387\nDo our uplink port, rather, and\nwe will choose our host default.\n\n327\n00:14:38.387 --> 00:14:40.974\nAnd we're gonna leave that\nat switch independent.\n\n328\n00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:42.340\nSo we'll just put it\nback to the way it was.\n\n329\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.400\nWe'll get started.\n\n330\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.660\nWe'll click Next.\n\n331\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.127\nThen we're gonna choose our\nlogical network here for our site.\n\n332\n00:14:48.127 --> 00:14:50.070\nYou can see we have our logical network.\n\n333\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.289\nI'm gonna check that off, bring that in,\n\n334\n00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:56.160\nallowing us to bind this to our\nlogical network configuration.\n\n335\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.900\nThen once we're done,\nwe'll go ahead and we will click Next.\n\n336\n00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.910\nWe just have our summary screen,\nno big deal there.\n\n337\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.950\nWe'll click Finish,\nwait for that to happen.\n\n338\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.570\nDoesn't take very long.\n\n339\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.120\nAnd then once we have this done,\nlet me just go back here.\n\n340\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.500\nWe have our port profile.\n\n341\n00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.090\nLet's just go down here.\n\n342\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:20.360\nAnd we'll have that right down at\nthe bottom ITProTV Pro Hyper-V.\n\n343\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.280\nSo we could see it's an uplink port\ntype as opposed to a virtual type.\n\n344\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.769\nAnd we could see that it's being used.\n\n345\n00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:27.230\nWe see that it's now been created.\n\n346\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.170\nIf we need to go in and\n\n347\n00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.940\ntake a look at it just like we\ndid with the others, no big deal.\n\n348\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.130\nGo into the properties\nthat we need to change.\n\n349\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.548\nEither the load balancing algorithm,\nour teaming mode,\n\n350\n00:15:36.548 --> 00:15:38.580\nand/or any of the settings here.\n\n351\n00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.260\nWe can go in if we wanna add\nanother network site here.\n\n352\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.880\nSo we bind it to more than\none logical network, or\n\n353\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.530\nunbind from one bind to another.\n\n354\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.530\nThat kind of thing, we could do that.\n\n355\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.320\nSo we have all of that available to us.\n\n356\n00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.165\nIf we're gonna run in and\ntalk about this when we created it.\n\n357\n00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:55.150\nLet's just briefly talk about enabling\nHyper-V host network virtualization.\n\n358\n00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.325\nIf we're running, as you can see here,\non a host running server 12 only,\n\n359\n00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:03.434\nwe will then be able to set this up\nbecause we have to enable it versus 12 R2\n\n360\n00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:05.940\nwhere this is automatically enabled for\nus.\n\n361\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.105\nSo we don't have to worry about it going\nforward, in other words, in the newer OSs.\n\n362\n00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:12.816\nBut in the older OS, we would enable\nthe Hyper-V network virtualization, so\n\n363\n00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:16.015\nwe would have to check that off\nto enable that and ensure that.\n\n364\n00:16:16.015 --> 00:16:19.869\nWe turn that on in the Hyper-V stack,\nbecause in 12 it was an option,\n\n365\n00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:20.717\nnot a default.\n\n366\n00:16:20.717 --> 00:16:23.297\nWhereas in 12R2 and 16,\nit is enabled by default.\n\n367\n00:16:23.297 --> 00:16:25.949\nSo we would just have to make\nsure we're aware of that,\n\n368\n00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:27.687\ncheck that off if that's the case.\n\n369\n00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:30.007\nAnd then we can go ahead and\njust make sure that gets enabled.\n\n370\n00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:32.407\nClick OK, and it will go through and\nconfigure that for us.\n\n371\n00:16:32.407 --> 00:16:35.537\nSo we'd be able to create that\nport profile and use that.\n\n372\n00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.577\nWe're not gonna turn it on,\ncuz we're on 12R2.\n\n373\n00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:40.647\nSo it's actually already enabled for\nus, won't have to worry about it.\n\n374\n00:16:40.647 --> 00:16:45.183\nBut we would create whatever port profiles\nwe need using those port profiles,\n\n375\n00:16:45.183 --> 00:16:47.450\nlinking them to our logical networks or\n\n376\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.660\nsites that we're then gonna be able to\nuse to be able to use our networks.\n\n377\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.089\nAnd then once we've added in\nthe other components and the parts,\n\n378\n00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:55.915\nwe're gonna go in and\ncreate an IP address pool.\n\n379\n00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:58.695\nWe'll be taking a look at that,\na MAC address pool as well.\n\n380\n00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:01.925\nWe'll be building out some of the other\nbuilding blocks of the network fabric.\n\n381\n00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:04.425\nSo we'll be doing that in\nour upcoming conversations.\n\n382\n00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:07.595\nOnce we have all those pieces together,\nwe'll actually have a functional\n\n383\n00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:10.528\nstructured network fabric that we\ncan begin to communicate across.\n\n384\n00:17:10.528 --> 00:17:13.199\nAnd we'll then use that going\nforward in our other demonstrations,\n\n385\n00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.238\nour other discussions, to be able to\nstart deploying VMs and using the network\n\n386\n00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:19.425\ntopology we're creating to be able to\nhave them communicate with one another.\n\n387\n00:17:19.425 --> 00:17:22.714\nSo we'll be continuing these\nconversations in just a few minutes.\n\n388\n00:17:22.714 --> 00:17:26.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, without further ado,\nlet's go ahead and get started with that.\n\n389\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.740\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n390\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.000\nBut for this show we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n391\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.440\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n392\n00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.660\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n393\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:41.840\n[MUSIC]\n\n394\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:04.985\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.921\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:17.510\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.540\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.510\nAnd in today's episode we are coming back\nat you with more of our configuring and\n\n8\n00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.940\ndeploying a private cloud series and\nof course joining us,\n\n9\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.480\nlike a day without sunshine,\nit would be a day without Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.500\nAdam, welcome back we're so\nglad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.398\n&gt;&gt; It is going fantabulously well,\nI feel like I'm [INAUDIBLE] with sunshine.\n\n12\n00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:36.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's what I feel like,\n\n13\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.620\na day with sunshine.\n\n14\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Blue skies.\n\n15\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Blue skies, coming your way.\n\n16\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.160\nSo we're gonna continue our\ndiscussion/demo series here\n\n17\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860\nwith focusing on the SCOM product now,\n\n18\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.200\nthe center piece of what we've been\ntalking about in these shows/episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.270\nWe've done some of the background and\nsome of the supporting cast of characters.\n\n20\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.200\nWe set up in episode one in\nthis series the VMM product.\n\n21\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560\nWe set up in episode\ntwo the app controller.\n\n22\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.200\nWe're now gonna do SCOM and\nconfigure SCOM on a single server install.\n\n23\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.420\nThe reason we're gonna do that is it's\njust easier to bring all that together in\n\n24\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.040\none place, do the demo for you, than it\nis to have all those different pieces\n\n25\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.490\nconfigured out and having to jump\nthrough them during the demo just to put\n\n26\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.310\nthe database in place, just to\nconfigure this, just to configure that.\n\n27\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.090\nSo we're gonna do a standard\nall-in-one install,\n\n28\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.960\ndatabase assumption is it's\nrunning on the same machine.\n\n29\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.170\nRemember in the real world, if you're\nsetting this up at a lab environment,\n\n30\n00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.320\nthis is most likely what you would do.\n\n31\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.737\nAnyway, if you're gonna do this in\nproduction, the only difference is where\n\n32\n00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:37.391\nyou go to spec out the database and say\nwhere is my database, where's my instance.\n\n33\n00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.362\nYou will be connecting\nto a remote machine.\n\n34\n00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:43.250\nBut other than that, most of what we're\ngonna do is gonna look identical for you.\n\n35\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.566\nJust to be aware of of that.\n\n36\n00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.542\nWe are gonna start out with\ndealing with our pre reqs.\n\n37\n00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.079\nBut I'm gonna do this a little bit\ndifferently than I have done in some of\n\n38\n00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:50.854\nthe prior episodes.\n\n39\n00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:52.606\nI'm gonna bring PowerShell\ninto the mix here.\n\n40\n00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:55.130\nWe will take a look at this in a minute,\nwe like PowerShell.\n\n41\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.720\nAnd we have to be using it for\na variety of things.\n\n42\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.771\nSo it's always important to think\nabout how we can use PowerShell,\n\n43\n00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:01.794\nwhat we can use it for.\n\n44\n00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:04.301\nRemember the ideas,\nanything we could do in the GUI\n\n45\n00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.868\ntraditionally can be done\nthrough PowerShell, and\n\n46\n00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:10.660\nthere may always be additional things\nthat are PowerShell only or PowerShell\n\n47\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.362\ncentric that may not apply to the GUI or\nmay not be possible through the GUI.\n\n48\n00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:18.174\nBut in this case what we're gonna\ndo in PowerShell is install and\n\n49\n00:02:18.174 --> 00:02:23.117\nconfigure the web service, the web server\nfunction rather as a role on the box prior\n\n50\n00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:26.290\nto installing SCOM, and\nthen also configure it.\n\n51\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.650\nWe could easily do that through the GUI\nusing the server manager, but I'm gonna\n\n52\n00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.260\nshow you how to do it in PowerShell\nas a pre req to get this set up.\n\n53\n00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.910\nSo let's take a look if we could.\n\n54\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.840\nWe'll start with that,\nwe'll get that going,\n\n55\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.800\nand then once that's done we'll jump\nin and actually do our install.\n\n56\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.620\nWe've got our media already loaded.\n\n57\n00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.020\nOur set up file ready to go.\n\n58\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.948\nBut what we're gonna do\nis jump in to PowerShell,\n\n59\n00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:50.634\nI've adjusted the console shell font and\nbackground and color scheme before.\n\n60\n00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:52.292\nIt's going to be easier for you to see.\n\n61\n00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:55.450\nAnd what we've done is we've\ngone ahead and I've typed in\n\n62\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.240\nthe add Windows feature of PowerShell\ncmdlet, followed by the feature we want,\n\n63\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.150\nin this case, the web server,\nfollowed by a long string, no spaces,\n\n64\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.670\ncomma separated, of all\nthe configuration parameters we need.\n\n65\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.744\nSo, when we're doing the web server,\nand we're gonna then go in and\n\n66\n00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:14.407\ndo the Web Management Compatibility,\nWeb ASP, so we're gonna install the ASP.\n\n67\n00:03:14.407 --> 00:03:19.371\nWe're gonna go ahead of the Active Server\npage content, we're gonna go through and,\n\n68\n00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:23.519\nas you see, when you read through\nthat string, set up ASP.NET 4.5,\n\n69\n00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.320\nASP.NET, HTTP activation,\ninclude the management tools.\n\n70\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.300\nDo all the various things.\n\n71\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.160\nThe asape filters are there as well.\n\n72\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.390\nAll the things we need done\nto configure this out and\n\n73\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.360\nhave the .NET framework capability\nbuilt in and ready to go.\n\n74\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead, let me just\nclick in here so we're all set.\n\n75\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.683\nAnd we're gonna hit Enter and\nget our little paste buffer there.\n\n76\n00:03:43.683 --> 00:03:48.310\nLet me do that, and then actually do\nit this way, one second, I forgot.\n\n77\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.090\nGotta just backspace one, and\nthen we'll be able to, there we go.\n\n78\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.310\nTools, activate the console.\n\n79\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.100\nLittle trick in our demo environment to\nmake sure it's working the right way.\n\n80\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.605\n&gt;&gt; It's fun showing things on live TV,\nisn't it?\n\n81\n00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:01.135\n&gt;&gt; It is live so\n\n82\n00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:04.686\nyou gotta have those little things happen\nto make it look like it really is live,\n\n83\n00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.946\neven though this is all really just\na bunch of robots, it's Westworld.\n\n84\n00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really not really us,\n\n85\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.730\nit's just robots doing this.\n\n86\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.310\nBut you can see,\n\n87\n00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.600\nas we're going through, that the\ninstallation's starting in the console.\n\n88\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.894\nPowerShell is going out, configuring the\nrequired feature, setting up, and getting\n\n89\n00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:24.629\nall the specifics and the parameters\nwe've specified configured out for us.\n\n90\n00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.690\nWon't take too long, so we'll just wait\nfor this to go ahead and finish up.\n\n91\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.644\nWhile we're waiting on this real quick,\nso PowerShell, right,\n\n92\n00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:33.720\nthis is an interesting little product,\nwe do a lot with PowerShell.\n\n93\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.221\nAnd as I mentioned, using PowerShell\nwhile it's not required necessarily for\n\n94\n00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:42.586\nthe install, it's a set of skills that\nare gonna become really important for\n\n95\n00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:46.751\nyou even more so as we continue on down\nthe road of talking about the various\n\n96\n00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.446\nthings that are gonna be involved\nwith using SCOM, standing up,\n\n97\n00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:54.110\nconfiguring the product and\nmaking sure that it's ready to go.\n\n98\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.190\nWe do try to sprinkle in some of\nthe PowerShell cmdlets from time to time.\n\n99\n00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.420\nYou'll see those both\nin prior episodes and\n\n100\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.810\nepisodes that are upcoming\naround various things.\n\n101\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.350\nAlways encourage you to go out,\n\n102\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.210\ntake note of those PowerShell cmdlets,\ntest them out, make sure they work.\n\n103\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.352\nBut you have to keep in mind\nthat those PowerShell cmdlets\n\n104\n00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.780\nare specific to the SCOM PowerShell shell.\n\n105\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.841\nIn other words, the ops manager shell\nthat is PowerShell, but with PowerShell\n\n106\n00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:22.824\nalready loading the system center ops\nmanager cmdlet module for you as opposed\n\n107\n00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:28.189\nto just the normal PowerShell modules or\nthe standard PowerShell implementation,\n\n108\n00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.600\nwhich doesn't support those cmdlets\nunless you add the modules in.\n\n109\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.490\nNow you could do that either way.\n\n110\n00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.960\nWe're not gonna get into how do I add the\nmodules in the standard PowerShell here,\n\n111\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.490\nbut it's easy to import modules.\n\n112\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.136\nYou would just use the import module\ncmdlet, specify the name of the module or\n\n113\n00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:47.006\nmodules, you would have to know where they\nare, they're in the install media for\n\n114\n00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:50.090\nSCOM, so you could certainly bring\nthem in if you wanted to use and\n\n115\n00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.360\njust your standard PowerShell shell,\nor Ice.\n\n116\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.067\nDaniel and I will talking about\nthe Ice editor before we got started\n\n117\n00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:56.120\nwith this demo.\n\n118\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.830\nThat's just a graphical editor overlay for\nPowerShell so you can write your scripts,\n\n119\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.780\nyou can test them, debug them,\netc, do all that in there.\n\n120\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.070\nOr you could simply load it.\n\n121\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.630\nAnd once we do have SCOM up and running,\nwe'll show you there is a separate command\n\n122\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.640\nor PowerShell cmdlet window that\nyou open up specific to SCOM.\n\n123\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.010\nYou could just open that one up and all\nthose cmdlets are already imported from\n\n124\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.510\nthe module and you could just run all\nthe cmdlets we're gonna show you there.\n\n125\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.160\nSo just keep that in mind and make\nsure you're aware of that distinction.\n\n126\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.881\nBecause I get that sometimes from\ncustomers, hey, I'm in PowerShell and\n\n127\n00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:27.142\nI'm using these cmdlets you sent me,\nthey're not working.\n\n128\n00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.198\nWell if you're in the normal PowerShell\nthey won't, because they're probably not\n\n129\n00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.930\nsupported there, but if you open up\nthe ops manager cmdlet shell they will be.\n\n130\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.950\nSo just understand that distinction.\n\n131\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.970\nAnd if we go back take a look,\nwe will see that we are successful.\n\n132\n00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.880\nThat has been configured and you'll see\nhere success true, restart needed no.\n\n133\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.160\nRight exit code success, so\nthat's all good we have all that set up.\n\n134\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.150\nIt says Windows automatic\nupdating is not enabled.\n\n135\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.480\nNo big deal, that's not a problem for\nus, just a warning.\n\n136\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.240\nBut other than that, perfectly fine.\n\n137\n00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.670\nSo that's all been done, that's good.\n\n138\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.330\nI'm just gonna minimize PowerShell, and\nwhat we're gonna do is now come over here.\n\n139\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.590\nWe're gonna go to our setup item or\nsetup.exc, and we're gonna go ahead and.\n\n140\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.520\nWe're gonna run this, right-click, run as\nadministrator, and we're gonna load and\n\n141\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.610\nrun, let's bring that up in the middle of\nthe screen there, we're gonna load and\n\n142\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.750\nrun the SCOM 2012 R2 ops\nmanager install window,\n\n143\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.350\nand we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna get started with their install.\n\n144\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.759\nNow, keep in mind we've pointed this\nout in some of the other demos as well,\n\n145\n00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.905\nwe have that option to download\nlatest updates for the setup program,\n\n146\n00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:29.884\nwanna opt in on that.\n\n147\n00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:32.305\nRemember that is not the same thing\nas going out to Microsoft and\n\n148\n00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:33.593\ndownloading security updates.\n\n149\n00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:39.070\nThat is, I wanna download any updates to\nthe SCOM 2012 R2 Ops Manager software,\n\n150\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.950\nand make sure I'm downloading and\ninstalling the most recent version.\n\n151\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.110\nThis is typically gonna be roll\nup updates or things like that.\n\n152\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.889\nThey may have been put out since the ISO\nwas actually standardized and pushed out,\n\n153\n00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.762\nright, so always good to do that so\nwe get the latest version.\n\n154\n00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:57.487\nSo we're gonna do that, we're then gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna click install,\n\n155\n00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:01.107\nwe'll let that go out, take a look real\nquick, it's gonna download or Check for\n\n156\n00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:04.120\nupdates, we may or not get any just\ndepending on what we are doing.\n\n157\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.880\nSo once we have that finished,\nit doesn't take too long.\n\n158\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.200\nOnce that is done, we'll then be able to,\nselect our feature to install.\n\n159\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.960\nSo we will see that roll over.\n\n160\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.630\nAnd we have, our options here.\n\n161\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.450\nNow we talked about in the overview and\nadministration episodes,\n\n162\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.210\nthe very beginning set of episodes,\nwe put together for\n\n163\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.160\nthis overall show, that we have\ndifferent moving parts and pieces.\n\n164\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.090\nAnd if you remember,\nin our picture that we have looked at,\n\n165\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.370\nlet me just bring that up real quick so\nwe can take a look.\n\n166\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.265\nOur standard [COUGH] little graphics\nfile that I put together for you.\n\n167\n00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:40.705\nYou'll see that we have talked\nabout extensively right?\n\n168\n00:08:40.705 --> 00:08:43.160\nOur agents that we're gonna deploy for\nmonitoring.\n\n169\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.435\nTalked about our gateway server.\n\n170\n00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:47.840\nWe talked about our management server or\nservers in a pool.\n\n171\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.065\nTalked about our databases that\nwill be created and set up.\n\n172\n00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:53.925\nWe've talked about our ops console or\nweb console or\n\n173\n00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:57.360\napplication monitoring consoles and\nour reporting server.\n\n174\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.500\nSo we have all these different moving\nparts that we're gonna start to see\n\n175\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.740\nthe options for installing,\n\n176\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.150\nat least most of them anyway\nare going to be on that screen.\n\n177\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.090\nAnd what you're gonna see is we have the\nmanagement server option there we'll go\n\n178\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:07.990\nback to it in a minute.\n\n179\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.710\nWe have the ops console option there and\nwe talked about in hey what's the order,\n\n180\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.000\nwhat's the priority order for\n\n181\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.230\ninstalled discussion, the fact that we\nwould do our first management server and\n\n182\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.670\nwe could opt into doing the ops console at\nthat point or just install the management\n\n183\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.820\nserver and then do the ops console\nat a different time, right.\n\n184\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.820\nEither step one do it all together,\nstep one without the console and\n\n185\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.690\nthen step two in our thought\nprocess was do secondary servers,\n\n186\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.970\nagain ops consoles an option there or\nnot, we didn't do it there.\n\n187\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.930\nOur step three was, do the ops\nconsole by itself after the fact.\n\n188\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.940\nWe could do that or not,\nit would be up to us.\n\n189\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.030\nWe have the web console.\n\n190\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.110\nWe talked about installing\nthat separately.\n\n191\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.020\nThat'll be an option, and you'll see the\nreporting service an option there as well.\n\n192\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.140\nAnd we'll be able to install and configure\nthat, but we'll do that separately.\n\n193\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.070\nSo what we're gonna do, is come back here.\n\n194\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.320\nWe have our management server and our Ops\nconsole, we're gonna choose both here and\n\n195\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.430\ndo them at the same time.\n\n196\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.010\nSo I'm gonna opt in and\ndo one and the other.\n\n197\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.150\nWe're then gonna go ahead and just take\na look at, before we actually continue\n\n198\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.140\nthe install, this item on the left here,\nwhich says Supported Configurations.\n\n199\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.600\nAnd you can take a look if you're\nnot sure about this, and click here.\n\n200\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.930\nWe'll just do that real quick.\n\n201\n00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.680\nIt opens up the website, where it goes\nout to the web, opens up the website.\n\n202\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.090\nYou gotta be connected to the web,\nobviously, for this to work.\n\n203\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.880\nAnd it takes you out and\nit will give you a link to a page\n\n204\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.575\nwhere supported configurations are gonna\nbe discussed by build inversion.\n\n205\n00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:33.575\nSo if you're not clear on or sure about\nwhat to do, what order to do it in,\n\n206\n00:10:33.575 --> 00:10:36.235\nhow you would install,\nwhat could be done with that, etc.\n\n207\n00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:39.455\nIf you don't remember that or\nyou haven't seen that episode,\n\n208\n00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:42.295\nthat series of discussions,\nyou could always go click here if you're\n\n209\n00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:45.825\ndoing this for real, get this information,\nmake sure you're up to date.\n\n210\n00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:50.260\nThe nice thing about that also is, if we\nchange the rules of the game along the way\n\n211\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.870\nand Microsoft updates the requirements,\nclicking there will give you the most\n\n212\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.660\nrecent information as opposed\nto what we may have talked about\n\n213\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.280\nwhen we put these episodes together or\nmaybe now it's six months, a year later,\n\n214\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.200\nwho knows how long it is\nwith you watching this now.\n\n215\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.960\nAnd you may be seeing this but we may\nhave changed these parameters since then.\n\n216\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.130\nSo, it's always good to check\nthe most recent information.\n\n217\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.255\nJust to point that out to you.\n\n218\n00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:12.430\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click next here.\n\n219\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.940\nWe're then gonna get our install location.\n\n220\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.500\nStandard install location.\n\n221\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.360\nWe will leave the defaults there but\n\n222\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.340\nyou'll see C program files\nMicrosoft System Center 2012 R2,\n\n223\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.440\nOps Manager in this case, instead of\none of the other programs we looked at.\n\n224\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.080\nRequired space, roughly just over a gig.\n\n225\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.670\nYou'll see 1,305 megabytes, so\njust over a gig, about a gig and a third,\n\n226\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.560\napproximately.\n\n227\n00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.770\nSomething like that, so\njust keep that in mind.\n\n228\n00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.250\nWe'll click next,\nverifies quickly that we're all set to go.\n\n229\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.360\nProceed with set up so\n\n230\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.770\nwe're gonna then be able to go in and\nclick next, all prerequisites are pass.\n\n231\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.220\nNow, this was just the prereq check,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.900\nThis was just saying these\nare all the software installed.\n\n233\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.660\nEverything we need there,\nare we sure we have everything we need.\n\n234\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.925\nIf we're not sure about what those are,\nright here,\n\n235\n00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.850\nreview full system requirements.\n\n236\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.280\nGo and check that link out again.\n\n237\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.760\nThe most recent information would\nalways be available there over the web.\n\n238\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.010\nGonna click next here.\n\n239\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.050\nNow we have to specify an install option.\n\n240\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.670\nWe have to specify here\nwhat we're gonna do, or\n\n241\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.180\nessentially, how we're gonna install,\nright.\n\n242\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.920\nAre we gonna create the first management\ngroup server in a new management group?\n\n243\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.010\nThis is the first server installed.\n\n244\n00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.000\nCreate the management group.\n\n245\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.260\nWe have to name it and\nspecify the database location.\n\n246\n00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.140\nAll those things we talked about in\nthe episode that are specific to\n\n247\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.500\nthe first install.\n\n248\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.920\nOr are we gonna add a management server to\nan existing management group that will be\n\n249\n00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.280\nthe option below,\nwe've all ready done that.\n\n250\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.210\nSet up the management group,\ndone this already.\n\n251\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.460\nThis will be adding additional\nservers into the management group.\n\n252\n00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.800\nThis would be a second,\nthird, fourth server etc.\n\n253\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.490\nAnd we would then make\na different set of choices.\n\n254\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.950\nCuz we'd have to provide the name\nof the management group and\n\n255\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.150\nuse the existing databases\nthat are already there.\n\n256\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.790\nSo that set up will look different\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n257\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.500\nThis is our first install.\n\n258\n00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.380\nSo we're gonna choose\nthe default option on top and\n\n259\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.470\nwe're gonna give our\nmanagement group a name.\n\n260\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.040\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna name this and\n\n261\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.320\nwe can call this anything we want if you\nhave a convention in your organization,\n\n262\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.910\nyou would wanna follow that, right?\n\n263\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.790\nI'm gonna use our Practice Labs.\n\n264\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.010\nCom, PracticeLabsCom.\n\n265\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.110\nGroup 4r, name 4r, management group.\n\n266\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.940\nSo we're gonna use that.\n\n267\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.640\nThat's our domain that we're using.\n\n268\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.450\nWe're just keeping everything\nstandardized for ease of use, and\n\n269\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.920\nease of reference in the demo.\n\n270\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.010\nBut in the real world of course,\n\n271\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.150\nas I said, you would specify what\nit is that you would like to use.\n\n272\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.670\nSo we have PracticeLabs.com.\n\n273\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.350\nOr PracticeLabsCom, no dot.\n\n274\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.920\nMake sure that's spelled correctly.\n\n275\n00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.697\nHit next here, we get our EULA or\nEnd User License Agreement.\n\n276\n00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:39.805\nWe're going to go ahead and click that\nand, no I'm not going to scroll down.\n\n277\n00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:41.622\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to use my super powers and\n\n278\n00:13:41.622 --> 00:13:44.014\nread the whole thing without\nhaving to go through that.\n\n279\n00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:44.700\n&gt;&gt; Use as osmosis.\n\n280\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.337\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to use just the ability to\nabsorb that information without having to\n\n281\n00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:50.003\ngo through and actually look at it.\n\n282\n00:13:50.003 --> 00:13:52.090\nAll right, so\nthis is where the magic happens.\n\n283\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.678\nConfigure the Operational Database.\n\n284\n00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:55.184\nRemember two databases here right.\n\n285\n00:13:55.184 --> 00:13:57.700\nLet's just remind ourselves\nquickly what this looks like.\n\n286\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.285\nWe have our ops manager database, so\n\n287\n00:13:59.285 --> 00:14:01.580\nthat's what we call\nthe operational database.\n\n288\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.910\nAnd we have our ops\nmanager data warehouse.\n\n289\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.770\nWe're working on this one right now.\n\n290\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.090\nThe ops manager database, that's\nthe one we're about to configure and\n\n291\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.140\nspecify the settings for.\n\n292\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.070\nSo we're gonna go in here.\n\n293\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.400\nServer name and or instance name.\n\n294\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.010\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna set this up.\n\n295\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.340\nNow keep in mind, right,\nthat when we're in here and\n\n296\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.600\nwe're looking at this\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n297\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.300\nwe are going to use our local instance\nwe said, beginning of the episode, we're\n\n298\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.850\ngonna use an all in one install, local\ninstance of MS SQL server on the machine.\n\n299\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.195\nSo ours is going to look a little bit\ndifferent than what you would probably use\n\n300\n00:14:36.195 --> 00:14:36.755\nin the real world,\n\n301\n00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:40.305\nbecause you may be connecting out to\nan instance that's set up somewhere else,\n\n302\n00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:44.225\nin a SQL cluster, or that the DBA\nmay have been setting up for you.\n\n303\n00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:47.745\nSo yours will obviously look different\nwhen you do this, but for purposes of our\n\n304\n00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:51.905\ndiscussion, our demonstration, we're\njust doing this all in one quick demo.\n\n305\n00:14:51.905 --> 00:14:52.945\nPutting it together for you, so\n\n306\n00:14:52.945 --> 00:14:55.845\nI'm gonna use the MS SQL Server\ninstance that's local.\n\n307\n00:14:55.845 --> 00:14:59.850\nSo I'm gonna type in the name of\nthe machine, play our plab, rather.\n\n308\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.585\nPlab, let me spell that correctly,\nnot pal.\n\n309\n00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:05.218\nPlab sys 01, plab sys build 01.\n\n310\n00:15:05.218 --> 00:15:07.044\nPlab sys build 01.\n\n311\n00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:11.492\nThat's the name for our local machine.\n\n312\n00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:14.980\nAnd then, I'm gonna go ahead and\nput in the name of our instance.\n\n313\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.644\nMS SQL Server.\n\n314\n00:15:18.644 --> 00:15:21.124\nHave our standard port there,\nwhich Daniel knows is port?\n\n315\n00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:22.852\n&gt;&gt; 1433.\n\n316\n00:15:22.852 --> 00:15:26.774\n&gt;&gt; 1433, absolutely, and then you'll see,\ncan we go full screen for just a second,\n\n317\n00:15:26.774 --> 00:15:28.170\njust to show you all this?\n\n318\n00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.340\nYou'll see we have our named instance,\nwe have our port.\n\n319\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.570\nI just want you to see\nthe name of the database here.\n\n320\n00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.310\nDatabase name,\n\n321\n00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.360\noperations manager, standard size\nyou could modify that if necessary.\n\n322\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.790\nBut this our ops manager database\nas suppose to the date warehouse\n\n323\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.810\ndatabase, right?\n\n324\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.899\nNow we have our data file folder log file\nfolder Standard, default install Program\n\n325\n00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:51.784\nfiles, Microsoft SQL server MS SQL 1 1,\nyou know, MS SQL server MS SQL data.\n\n326\n00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.952\nRight, and then we're going to\ninstall into that directory,\n\n327\n00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:59.075\nwe're going to leave all of those defaults\nalone and In the real world again you may\n\n328\n00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:03.173\nchoose to modify that, that will be up to\nyou but we're gonna leave those alone.\n\n329\n00:16:03.173 --> 00:16:06.476\nWe're then gonna have the option\non the next screen to configure\n\n330\n00:16:06.476 --> 00:16:09.670\nthe data warehouse database so\npart two of our conversation.\n\n331\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.057\nSo we're gonna click Next here and what\nI'm actually gonna do is the following.\n\n332\n00:16:13.057 --> 00:16:16.417\nJust before we do that, I'm gonna cheat\njust a little bit, I'm gonna copy that so\n\n333\n00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:19.777\nthat I don't have to worry about actually\ntyping out again because if I got it right\n\n334\n00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:22.528\nthe first time, I'm gonna assume\nhopefully that it will be good.\n\n335\n00:16:22.528 --> 00:16:24.042\nSo we're gonna click Next.\n\n336\n00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:25.953\nWe'll check that right now,\nthat look good.\n\n337\n00:16:25.953 --> 00:16:29.994\nSo what I'm gonna do is for the data\nwarehouse database, I'm gonna paste that\n\n338\n00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:33.500\nin so I don't have to bother typing\nit again but assume I typed it in.\n\n339\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.352\nAnd you'll see format server name, it just\nchecks to make sure we can get out there.\n\n340\n00:16:37.352 --> 00:16:40.699\nWe're then gonna be able to go ahead,\nand you'll see we have, and again,\n\n341\n00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.187\nif we could just go full screen for\n\n342\n00:16:42.187 --> 00:16:45.370\na minute, just to show what\nthe naming convention looks like.\n\n343\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.521\nOps manager dw,\nthat will be our data warehouse database,\n\n344\n00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:50.356\nas opposed to our other database.\n\n345\n00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:52.865\nSame path cuz we're installing locally,\nand so\n\n346\n00:16:52.865 --> 00:16:57.025\nwhat we're doing now is we're working on\nthis database right here on the right,\n\n347\n00:16:57.025 --> 00:16:59.249\nthe Ops Manager Data Warehouse database.\n\n348\n00:16:59.249 --> 00:17:00.978\nThe DW for data warehouse.\n\n349\n00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:04.786\nThat's the one we're gonna finish\nconfiguring right now and as soon as we're\n\n350\n00:17:04.786 --> 00:17:08.745\ndone, we're gonna actually then go\nahead and get ready to do our install.\n\n351\n00:17:08.745 --> 00:17:12.275\nSo we're gonna do this,\nget this spun up, hit Next.\n\n352\n00:17:12.275 --> 00:17:13.754\nNotice we're almost done.\n\n353\n00:17:13.754 --> 00:17:15.736\nStill got a couple of bars here,\nnot quite there yet.\n\n354\n00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:19.130\nRemember, we also need to specify,\ncuz this is our first install.\n\n355\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.650\nWe have to specify our various accounts.\n\n356\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.900\nRemember, we have four different kinds\nof accounts, or types, that we specify.\n\n357\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.090\nWe've got our management\nserver action account.\n\n358\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.130\nWe've got our system center config\nservice and system center data server, or\n\n359\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.370\ndata access service account, rather.\n\n360\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.770\nWe've got our data reader and\ndata writer accounts.\n\n361\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.780\nNow, we talked extensively about these\naccounts what permission levels they need,\n\n362\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.030\nwhether they are domain and or local, how\nwe configure all that in prior episodes.\n\n363\n00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.950\nSo just reminded you that\nwe've been through all of this\n\n364\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.880\nwhen we walked through the logic\nof how to do the install and\n\n365\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.460\nwhat it is that we would do in\nthe order we would do it in.\n\n366\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.020\nBut because this is our first management\nserver, we have to specify all this.\n\n367\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.301\nIf this was the second management server,\nand\n\n368\n00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:03.250\nwe were already joining\nan existing management group.\n\n369\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.112\nWe would be able to either all ready\nhave some of this populated or\n\n370\n00:18:06.112 --> 00:18:09.197\nperhaps not have to specify all of\nit depending on what we're doing.\n\n371\n00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:13.776\nSo we're gonna start typing these in,\nnotice the option here for local and or\n\n372\n00:18:13.776 --> 00:18:17.166\ndomain account for\nthree of the four selected as domain.\n\n373\n00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:21.036\nNotice that for the system center config\nand data access service accounts,\n\n374\n00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:23.220\nthey're set to local by default, right?\n\n375\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.780\nBecause we're gonna use the local\naccount for that on the system.\n\n376\n00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:35.220\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngoing to type in here our information.\n\n377\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.950\nWe'll do practice labs,\nthat's the name of our domain.\n\n378\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.457\nAnd then we're gonna do administrator.\n\n379\n00:18:43.161 --> 00:18:45.650\nSo we're gonna do our\ndomain admin account.\n\n380\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.658\nNow remember, in the real world, you\nwould not choose to use your domain admin\n\n381\n00:18:49.658 --> 00:18:52.772\naccount as the account that\nyou're gonna be using for this.\n\n382\n00:18:52.772 --> 00:18:56.037\nYou would come up with a set of accounts\nthat will be given the specific\n\n383\n00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:57.550\npermissions necessary.\n\n384\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.400\nWe're doing that in the demo just for\npurposes of ease of use and\n\n385\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.350\nto keep it simple so we don't have to keep\ntrack of all these different accounts\n\n386\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.970\nwhile we're doing the install.\n\n387\n00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.220\nBut in the real world,\n\n388\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.150\nyou would wanna make sure you are using\na different account for that, right?\n\n389\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.451\nWe're gonna go ahead, we're gonna put in,\nlet me make sure I type that correctly,\n\n390\n00:19:14.451 --> 00:19:16.824\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nput in our password.\n\n391\n00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:20.586\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead we're\ngonna do the same thing here for\n\n392\n00:19:20.586 --> 00:19:23.160\nthe data reader and\nthe data writer accounts.\n\n393\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.038\nSo we're gonna go down here and\n\n394\n00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:29.386\nwe're going to make sure that we put\nthat same account in for all three.\n\n395\n00:19:29.386 --> 00:19:30.873\nLet me just do that real quick.\n\n396\n00:19:30.873 --> 00:19:35.274\nWe're gonna use our, whoops, hold on,\nthat's not what I wanted to copy.\n\n397\n00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:42.191\nOkay, let's type it in.\n\n398\n00:19:42.191 --> 00:19:43.451\n&gt;&gt; When all else fails, right, the old\nkeyboard is waiting to work for us.\n\n399\n00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:47.428\n&gt;&gt; Well, it just feels like I wanted\nto copy that, you saw me copy it.\n\n400\n00:19:47.428 --> 00:19:49.380\nBut it copied like something\ntotally different.\n\n401\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.534\n&gt;&gt; Computers hate us, Adam.\n\n402\n00:19:50.534 --> 00:19:52.097\nHow many times do I have to tell you?\n\n403\n00:19:52.097 --> 00:19:54.594\n&gt;&gt; When they take over the world,\nI'm just going to-\n\n404\n00:19:54.594 --> 00:19:55.710\n&gt;&gt; We'll enjoy fighting them.\n\n405\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.865\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm gonna unplug them.\n\n406\n00:19:56.865 --> 00:19:58.294\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just unplug them.\n\n407\n00:19:58.294 --> 00:19:59.483\nWe'll pull their batteries out.\n\n408\n00:19:59.483 --> 00:20:02.459\n&gt;&gt; Let me just do that, get rid of that.\n\n409\n00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.716\nAnd you know what?\n\n410\n00:20:04.716 --> 00:20:07.620\nLet me just do this real quick\njust to get that out of the way.\n\n411\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.880\nThere we go,\nthat way that doesn't bother us.\n\n412\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.677\nAll right, so, Let's type in\n\n413\n00:20:14.677 --> 00:20:19.066\nour password there,\nmake sure we type that correctly.\n\n414\n00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:23.447\nAnd then, let's go down here, and\n\n415\n00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:28.569\nlet's do practicelabsadministrator.\n\n416\n00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:30.883\nAnd then our password here.\n\n417\n00:20:34.019 --> 00:20:38.227\nAll right, so we've got our accounts set\nup, our passwords entered correctly.\n\n418\n00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:40.287\nHopefully everything's\nconfigured the right way.\n\n419\n00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:43.200\nOnce we've got all that set up,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n420\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.670\nwe're just gonna pause for a second,\nverify that, make sure we're all good.\n\n421\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:53.240\nAnd then, once we're all set and\nready to go, we're gonna click Next.\n\n422\n00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.421\nNow we get this little pop up here.\n\n423\n00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:56.630\nCan we go full screen just to see that?\n\n424\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.638\nWe're gonna see it says your setup\ndetected that the account or\n\n425\n00:20:59.638 --> 00:21:03.169\nthe action account rather specified\nis a domain administrator account.\n\n426\n00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:06.310\nI told you that's not a good idea,\ndon't wanna do that in the real world.\n\n427\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.557\nWe warn you about that.\n\n428\n00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:11.479\nIt's says for security reasons not\nrecommended, I said not a best practice.\n\n429\n00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.107\nWe're doing it just for\nease of demonstration,\n\n430\n00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.717\nease of use here in this demo.\n\n431\n00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:19.360\nIn the real world as I suggested,\nmake sure that you don't use the demo or\n\n432\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.450\nrather make sure you don't use the domain\nadmin account for your installation.\n\n433\n00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.420\nBut for here it's fine.\n\n434\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.470\nWe'll note that, we know that's an issue,\nwe're accepting that risk just because\n\n435\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.678\nwe're setting this up to\nshow you how to do it.\n\n436\n00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:31.472\nIn the real world,\n\n437\n00:21:31.472 --> 00:21:34.368\nif you don't use a domain admin\naccount you will not see that prompt.\n\n438\n00:21:34.368 --> 00:21:35.641\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n439\n00:21:35.641 --> 00:21:38.675\nopt out of the customer experience\nimprovement program and\n\n440\n00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:42.871\nthe error reporting, in the real world,\nencourage you to opt in to both of these.\n\n441\n00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:45.048\nWe're gonna click Next and\n\n442\n00:21:45.048 --> 00:21:51.020\nonce we do that we are going to make sure\nit took my click there, there we go.\n\n443\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.509\nWe're gonna get our install summary.\n\n444\n00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:55.519\nAgain, thinking about the fact that\nthis may be a good opportunity for\n\n445\n00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:56.642\nyou to grab a screenshot,\n\n446\n00:21:56.642 --> 00:21:59.612\nthis will probably be two because of\nthe fact that you have to scroll.\n\n447\n00:21:59.612 --> 00:22:03.370\nBut grab a screenshot of this,\ndocument it so you know what you're doing.\n\n448\n00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.860\nOnce you've done all that, we're gonna\ngo ahead, we're gonna click Install,\n\n449\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.690\nwe're gonna let that run.\n\n450\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.020\nThat is gonna take\na little bit of time for\n\n451\n00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.870\nus to actually get through the install.\n\n452\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.431\nSo we're gonna wait for\nthat to finish and then come on back and\n\n453\n00:22:14.431 --> 00:22:15.374\nshow you the results.\n\n454\n00:22:15.374 --> 00:22:18.809\nBut just before we cut away to do that,\nyou'll notice initial config,\n\n455\n00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:21.160\noperational database\nconfiguration starts and\n\n456\n00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.555\nthat we're gonna go through that\nthen the management server itself.\n\n457\n00:22:24.555 --> 00:22:29.685\nThen the data warehouse config, then\nthe operations console, then final config.\n\n458\n00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:34.071\nSo we're doing this in a specified order\nto ensure we understand how things\n\n459\n00:22:34.071 --> 00:22:35.920\nare actually gonna work.\n\n460\n00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.080\nAnd to make sure we understand\nthe order that they have to be done.\n\n461\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.735\nIt's the same order we discussed\nwhen we went through the episodes,\n\n462\n00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.169\ntalked about how things would work.\n\n463\n00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:46.098\nSo stay tuned as soon as this finishes up,\nwe'll come on back and\n\n464\n00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:48.557\nI we'll show you what the rest\nof the demo looks like.\n\n465\n00:22:48.557 --> 00:22:50.636\nSo we see that our\ninstallation is finished.\n\n466\n00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.567\nWhat we're gonna do is just quickly check,\n\n467\n00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:54.767\nmake sure we see that\neverything turned out well.\n\n468\n00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:58.172\nWe do see a little warning off there\nto the left of the management server.\n\n469\n00:22:58.172 --> 00:22:59.252\nBut when you read it all,\n\n470\n00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:02.110\nit really says is hey we're\ninstalling as an eval edition.\n\n471\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.250\nJust again, reminding us we\nhaven't licensed the product.\n\n472\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.209\nNo big deal, we know that's the case and\nwe're fine with that.\n\n473\n00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:09.685\nOther than that,\neverything is green, all looks good.\n\n474\n00:23:09.685 --> 00:23:12.447\nWe'll scroll down here just so\nyou could see the very bottom item and\n\n475\n00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:14.560\nyou'll see yeah, everything is good there.\n\n476\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.590\nWe do have our check boxes at the bottom,\n\n477\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.180\nLaunch Microsoft update\nwhen the wizard closes.\n\n478\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.085\nMake sure we're up to date,\nwe have all the patches.\n\n479\n00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.237\nWe know the value of that.\n\n480\n00:23:22.237 --> 00:23:26.324\nStart the ops console when the wizard\ncloses, we could go ahead and either leave\n\n481\n00:23:26.324 --> 00:23:30.481\nthat in there or use the shortcut that's\ngonna be created from the app launcher.\n\n482\n00:23:30.481 --> 00:23:31.686\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n483\n00:23:31.686 --> 00:23:35.510\nWe'll go ahead and we'll let that launch\nfor us this time so we'll hit Close.\n\n484\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.690\nWe'll have that come up.\n\n485\n00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.731\nTakes just a moment to bring\nthe console up the first time.\n\n486\n00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:44.279\nOnce we get that up and running, if we\ncan go full screen for just a moment,\n\n487\n00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:47.045\nI just wanna quickly zero you\nin on the environment here.\n\n488\n00:23:47.045 --> 00:23:50.525\nThis is the first time you're getting\nto see the actual console in our\n\n489\n00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:51.435\nconversations.\n\n490\n00:23:51.435 --> 00:23:55.503\nWe're gonna be coming in, spending a lot\nmore time in here throughout the remaining\n\n491\n00:23:55.503 --> 00:23:58.841\nepisodes as we configure and\ninteract with the various workspaces.\n\n492\n00:23:58.841 --> 00:24:00.499\nBut just to show you quickly what we have.\n\n493\n00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:02.082\nWe have four workspaces.\n\n494\n00:24:02.082 --> 00:24:05.928\nThese are the areas down here that\nwe are gonna be interacting with.\n\n495\n00:24:05.928 --> 00:24:10.340\nYou'll see we've Monitoring, we have\nAuditing, excuse me Authoring, pardon me.\n\n496\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.030\nWe have Administration and\nwe have the My Workspace area.\n\n497\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:17.010\nMy Workspace is where you can customize\nand configure your own views,\n\n498\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.740\ncreate your own little kind of\ncomfortable working area if you will so\n\n499\n00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.710\nyou can customize the look and feel.\n\n500\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.840\nAdministration is where we spend\ntime configuring the settings,\n\n501\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.980\nmaking sure we understand what has to\nhappen for the system to run correctly.\n\n502\n00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.710\nOur device management agent\nversus agentless manage.\n\n503\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.515\nOur management service found here.\n\n504\n00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:42.140\nOur pending management installs, if we\nhave any agents that have been manually\n\n505\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.590\ninstalled and\nhave to be approved will be found here.\n\n506\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.138\nWe talked about that in\none of our prior episodes.\n\n507\n00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:49.720\nOur Unix,\nLinux computers if we're monitoring\n\n508\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.850\nalternate operating system\nstacks will be found here.\n\n509\n00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.970\nWe have our management packs.\n\n510\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.490\nWe'll spend some time in here.\n\n511\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:01.390\nTake a look at how to create management\npacks from scratch or use existing once.\n\n512\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.370\nWhen we do our install, the management\npacks that are all ready configured or\n\n513\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.310\nset up as part of our\ninstall will be available.\n\n514\n00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.460\nThey're imported.\n\n515\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.210\nAnd you can see the list of them here.\n\n516\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.920\nSo we have all of those\nwe can have it work.\n\n517\n00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.300\nWe have 95 out of the box by default.\n\n518\n00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.440\nWe'll add to that if necessary by\ndownloading additional man of impacts\n\n519\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.370\nfrom other vendors or creating our own and\nthen working with them.\n\n520\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.800\nSo we can able to do that\nin our upcoming episodes.\n\n521\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.310\nNetwork management is\ngoing to be found here\n\n522\n00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.060\nwe are able to deal with different\ndiscovery methodologies and go out and\n\n523\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.740\nfind network devices and\nsystems that we wanna be able to manage.\n\n524\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.230\nWe'll be taking a look at that.\n\n525\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.130\nOur notifications areas here.\n\n526\n00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.510\nSetting up our channels,\nour subscriptions and or our subscribers.\n\n527\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.030\nWe'll be talking about that, how we\ncommunicate and get updates from SCOM.\n\n528\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.300\nSo we'll be taking a look at that.\n\n529\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.240\nOur product connectors are here.\n\n530\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.120\nHow do we connect out to our alternate\nsystems and interact with them and\n\n531\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.190\nbring them in so they can be monitored or\nprovide data to us for\n\n532\n00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.720\nmonitoring, through connection.\n\n533\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.140\nSo we'll be talking about\nthat at some point.\n\n534\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.920\nWe have our resource pools.\n\n535\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.270\nSo if we set up our resource pool,\nas we've been talking about.\n\n536\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.600\nWe'll be able to see it here,\nand interact with it.\n\n537\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.460\nYou'll see that we have our AD\nassignment resource pool, our AR or\n\n538\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.430\nmanagement servers resource pool.\n\n539\n00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.100\nAt our notification resource pool.\n\n540\n00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.555\nThrough resource pools that are installed\nthat of the box by default.\n\n541\n00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:24.430\nWe'll then we will be able to go in,\nand work with this if necessary.\n\n542\n00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.380\nYou'll see we can write click here, and\nwe have options to be able to go in.\n\n543\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.440\nAnd do a variety of things, based on what\nwe are doing in the In this particular\n\n544\n00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.047\narea can also go in and\nyou'll see over here.\n\n545\n00:26:35.047 --> 00:26:38.075\nCreate a resource full of\nnecessary create our own.\n\n546\n00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:41.085\nAnd or manually provide\nmembership updates were equip in.\n\n547\n00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:44.907\nAnd we got more details in some\nof this in upcoming episodes.\n\n548\n00:26:44.907 --> 00:26:49.207\nThe run as configurations, so our accounts\nthat we're gonna be using are here.\n\n549\n00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:52.237\nThis is where our system\naction account and our\n\n550\n00:26:52.237 --> 00:26:56.467\nadmin account is gonna be found along with\nall the other accounts that we specified.\n\n551\n00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:57.907\nSo we'll see those here.\n\n552\n00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:01.267\nWe have our profiles that\nare used to be able to then\n\n553\n00:27:01.267 --> 00:27:04.157\ncreate building blocks that\nwe can assign user rights.\n\n554\n00:27:04.157 --> 00:27:07.030\nDelegate responsibilities for\nadministration.\n\n555\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.320\nWe have our UNIX/Linux account.\n\n556\n00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.720\nSo we're gonna be interacting\nwith Unix Linux systems.\n\n557\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.550\nNeed a separate set of run as accounts for\nthem.\n\n558\n00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.770\nWe'll see them here.\n\n559\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.770\nUnder security we have user roles.\n\n560\n00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.470\nOur user roles are built from our profile.\n\n561\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.570\nSo we're gonna be able to use those\nto be able to create a user role and\n\n562\n00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:27.050\ndefine the activities that a user may\nengage in through a delegation event.\n\n563\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.910\nAnd so we'll be able to go in,\ncreate a new user role, and specify.\n\n564\n00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.200\nYou'll see there operator, read only,\nauthor, advanced operator, etc.\n\n565\n00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.670\nAnd we'll then be able to go in and\nassign the user the appropriate rights.\n\n566\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:40.580\nWe'll be able to do that.\n\n567\n00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.899\nWe see our settings here.\n\n568\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.060\nThese are setting for\n\n569\n00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.980\nthe system overall and we'll be able to\ngo in, take a look at things like age and\n\n570\n00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.200\nheartbeat and all of these will have\nproperties associated with them.\n\n571\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.480\nWhat's the interval on heart\nbeating from the agent?\n\n572\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.295\nSo how many seconds go by before\nwe update on a rolling basis?\n\n573\n00:27:57.295 --> 00:27:59.745\nSo we'll be able to\nmodify that if necessary.\n\n574\n00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:04.625\nWe could see our alert area here, go in\nand take a look at various states and\n\n575\n00:28:04.625 --> 00:28:08.425\nID's that are set up for\nalerts out of the box by default.\n\n576\n00:28:08.425 --> 00:28:15.798\nA resolved item you'll see here resolution\nstate is 254, acknowledged 249, new 0.\n\n577\n00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:19.007\nSo you could set up alert resolution\nstates and we'll see how to program in\n\n578\n00:28:19.007 --> 00:28:23.070\na new one in one of our future discussions\nwe'll simply come here and create our own.\n\n579\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.800\nWe also can see automatic\nalert resolution and\n\n580\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.100\nremember we talked about these\nvalues in one of our prior episodes.\n\n581\n00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.880\nWhere we type in some of the configuration\nsettings and things to do out\n\n582\n00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.980\nof the box once we get the install done\nand maybe modifying these settings.\n\n583\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.087\nAnd I told you how to do this through\nPowerShell using one of the commandlets\n\n584\n00:28:39.087 --> 00:28:41.814\nbut we also could do it from here\njust in the graphical interface.\n\n585\n00:28:41.814 --> 00:28:45.524\nSo we would change that 30 day or\n7 day default and just go in and\n\n586\n00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.040\nmodify it as needed.\n\n587\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.757\nSo we can do all that from\nhere if we decide to.\n\n588\n00:28:49.757 --> 00:28:51.460\nWe have our database grooming settings.\n\n589\n00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.200\nWe'll talk about some of these as well.\n\n590\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.780\nI showed you the retention periods,\nthe default periods.\n\n591\n00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.350\nWould be able to go in and see those.\n\n592\n00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.630\nI created a little Word document table for\nyou that mirrored this exactly,\n\n593\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.390\nand we talked about modifying\nthese if necessary.\n\n594\n00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.570\nAgain, can do that right from here as we\ntalked about, and, or from PowerShell,\n\n595\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.530\njust click Edit.\n\n596\n00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.390\nYou can go in and from here, there we go.\n\n597\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.250\nSoon as that registers we can go in and\nthere we go.\n\n598\n00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.204\nWe can actually get the item to come up,\nit's that double left tap click.\n\n599\n00:29:20.204 --> 00:29:22.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thing that we gotta do.\n\n600\n00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.420\nMy mouse is a little screwy sometimes\nthere's nowhere to register the click.\n\n601\n00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.820\nAnd you could see that we're able to\nsimply in the interface here modify it.\n\n602\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.809\nWe did talk about the fact that we could\ndo this for PowerShell as well, so\n\n603\n00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:33.985\nwe showed you how to do that.\n\n604\n00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:38.025\nSo you got these settings here,\nwe've got other things for the general\n\n605\n00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:42.910\nsettings we have reporting, we have web\naddresses variety of different things.\n\n606\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.230\nWe have a system center advisor area here,\nwe can interact with that product and\n\n607\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.630\nlook at some of the settings and\nconfigurations.\n\n608\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.570\nWe have then the authoring workspace,\nswitching up just a little bit.\n\n609\n00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.000\nOur ability,\ncan we go back full screen just so\n\n610\n00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.740\nyou can see this in a little more detail?\n\n611\n00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.750\nYou'll see that we have, and\n\n612\n00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.310\nwe'll spend a significant\namount of time in here as well.\n\n613\n00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.040\nWe have our management pack objects and\nwe wanna create a new management pack and\n\n614\n00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.120\npopulate it with a variety\nof different things.\n\n615\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.824\nAnd I've spoken about some of\nthese before, we'll see them here.\n\n616\n00:30:08.824 --> 00:30:13.242\nWe have attributes, monitors, object\ndiscovery methods, overrides, rules,\n\n617\n00:30:13.242 --> 00:30:15.650\nservice level tracking tasks and views.\n\n618\n00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.350\nWe'll be able to right click click new and\nthen create one or more of these and\n\n619\n00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.930\nthen attach them to a new management\npack that we've created inside\n\n620\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.070\nof the admin Workspace.\n\n621\n00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.756\nAnd by doing that we populate\nour management pack and\n\n622\n00:30:26.756 --> 00:30:30.369\nthen we can export that management pack,\nand give it to others to use.\n\n623\n00:30:30.369 --> 00:30:32.398\nThat's what you've getting for\nChristmas by the way big guy,\n\n624\n00:30:32.398 --> 00:30:33.556\nI'm giving you a management pack.\n\n625\n00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:36.600\nSo you're gonna get one of those,\nso we'll show you how to do that,\n\n626\n00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600\n&gt;&gt; You spoil me sir.\n\n627\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.140\n&gt;&gt; I do try, I do try.\n\n628\n00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:43.825\nWe have a distributed application we'll\ntalk about the ability to be able to go in\n\n629\n00:30:43.825 --> 00:30:45.005\nand take a look at this.\n\n630\n00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:48.065\nWe can right click,create a new\ndistributed application just to give you\n\n631\n00:30:48.065 --> 00:30:49.265\na quick idea here.\n\n632\n00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:52.405\nThis is where we're gonna go in and most\nlikely use one one of the templates that\n\n633\n00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:56.940\nare set up here you'll see dot net three\ntier application, line of business,\n\n634\n00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.380\nweb app, messaging,\n\n635\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.030\nblank which just really just a canvass\nthat will start dragging pieces on.\n\n636\n00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.094\nIf you're familiar with\nOrchestrator in doing work flows,\n\n637\n00:31:05.094 --> 00:31:09.251\nif you're familiar with Visio and building\ndiagrams in flows and enabling them.\n\n638\n00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:10.660\nThe same kind of concept.\n\n639\n00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.041\nWe'll be able to build out\nthe logic of our application here,\n\n640\n00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:18.464\nput in all the actually connectors and\npieces, configure it out, set it up, and\n\n641\n00:31:18.464 --> 00:31:22.254\nthen actually put it in so to speak and\nhave it run live and monitor it.\n\n642\n00:31:22.254 --> 00:31:25.070\nAnd you'll see that we're able to\nattach it to the management pack.\n\n643\n00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.680\nAnd if we've created our own management\npack or custom management pack\n\n644\n00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.770\nwe'll be able to assign the distributed\napp to the management pack and\n\n645\n00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.030\nhave it monitor that application.\n\n646\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.350\nThis is actually the magic behind\nthe scenes that takes place to do this.\n\n647\n00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.170\nSo, we'll be going through and\ntalking through how to do this.\n\n648\n00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.280\nYou guys will actually see this\nin one of our upcoming episodes.\n\n649\n00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.704\nOnce we've done that, we've got our\ndistributed application designer sitting\n\n650\n00:31:47.704 --> 00:31:49.315\nhere just so you can see that.\n\n651\n00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:51.945\nWe'll pull that right down below our\nlittle blue mythical floating box there\n\n652\n00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:53.211\nfor our control panel inside the VM.\n\n653\n00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:57.394\nAnd you'll see we can then go in.\n\n654\n00:31:57.394 --> 00:32:01.220\nAnd we'll be able to start building\nout objects and or the details.\n\n655\n00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.360\nAnd we can actually begin\nusing our object search and\n\n656\n00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.330\nall the various things we wanna do.\n\n657\n00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.660\nWe just go new here.\n\n658\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.130\nSpecify real quick.\n\n659\n00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.410\nLet's just do a.\n\n660\n00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.860\nClick one just so\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n661\n00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.223\nAnd then, we'll use our three tier and\nlet's just choose\n\n662\n00:32:20.223 --> 00:32:25.650\nour Defaults and let's click OK.\n\n663\n00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.150\nAnd you'll see now I get our design and\n\n664\n00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.830\nI get the pretty made template\nthen I can actually go in, and\n\n665\n00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:35.700\nI could start to add components I could\ndrag things out and drop them on here.\n\n666\n00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.360\nAnd I can use all these different sliders\nto be able to build out the actual logic.\n\n667\n00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.280\nSo again, if you used one of the Microsoft\nproducts look similar to this,\n\n668\n00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.980\nAccess Views or Report Builder,\nSQL Server reporting services.\n\n669\n00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.620\nIf you used report designer,\nthey are similar,\n\n670\n00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.250\nthey are grid like function where you just\nattach things and interact with them.\n\n671\n00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.970\nSo, once we're done with that, we save it.\n\n672\n00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.890\nAnd then we add that to\nour management pack.\n\n673\n00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.440\nWe're not gonna do that right now but\nyou get the general idea here.\n\n674\n00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.550\nWe can also go in use our\nmanagement pack templates,\n\n675\n00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.240\nour pre-built templates\nthat are available to us.\n\n676\n00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.590\nAnd so let's say we want to use a .NET\napplication performance monitoring\n\n677\n00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.530\ntemplate, we can right click\nadd a monitoring wizard or\n\n678\n00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.050\nuse the ad monitoring wizard.\n\n679\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.960\nWe'll be able to add this monitor\ninto our management pack and\n\n680\n00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.520\nbind it there,\nspecifying what it is we want to do.\n\n681\n00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.810\nSo we'll choose that there and\nthen what we'll do here real quick.\n\n682\n00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.710\nLet me just hide the task bar so\nwe can see that,\n\n683\n00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.960\nbecause this particular window has\na nasty habit of just coming up.\n\n684\n00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.280\nBeing just big enough that we\ncan't actually see it normally,\n\n685\n00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.030\nso we're gonna click Next.\n\n686\n00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:46.018\nAnd then, as you can see,\nwe'll give it a name And\n\n687\n00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:49.940\nthen here, we'll again choose our\nmanagement pack that we wanna bind it to.\n\n688\n00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.760\nAnd our demo when we do it for\nreal, we'll actually go through and\n\n689\n00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.500\nhave a custom management pack we'll\nbind it to and we'll do all that.\n\n690\n00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.900\nBut you could see then we go ahead and\nwe click Next.\n\n691\n00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.840\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe'll be able to go ahead and\n\n692\n00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.340\nadd in our application components,\nspecify our targeted group, set up and\n\n693\n00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.220\nspecify our server side configuration.\n\n694\n00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.710\nIn this particular template,\nset up the monitoring,\n\n695\n00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.290\nwe'll be able to bind that\nto a management pack.\n\n696\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.030\nAnd again, the management pack becomes\nthe container that allows us to monitor\n\n697\n00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.950\neverything and we're setting up\nthe individual component parts of that\n\n698\n00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:25.560\nusing the offering workspace so that as\nwe build out our necessary functionality.\n\n699\n00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.530\nAnd we add the things in that we need\nto do we're able to track those and\n\n700\n00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.940\nuse the management pack to\nassign those specific Nncessary\n\n701\n00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.360\nobjects in properties and functions,\nall the stuff we want to do.\n\n702\n00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.420\nSo all that stuff takes\nplace in authoring.\n\n703\n00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.350\nIn monitoring workspace,\nwe're able to go in and\n\n704\n00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.060\nactually engage in the specific work or\nsee the outcome of\n\n705\n00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.990\na specific monitoring that's taking place\nthat we're actually using SCOM to drive.\n\n706\n00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:55.850\nSo if we go full screen we can see here\nwe've got our action alerts overall,\n\n707\n00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.440\nour active alerts that are running\nin the system, we may or\n\n708\n00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.380\nmay not have anything right now.\n\n709\n00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.820\nRight now we're clean\ncuz we just installed.\n\n710\n00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.340\nWe've got our discovered\ninventory without having anything\n\n711\n00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.010\nwith agents running the only\nwe see is ourselves so\n\n712\n00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.580\nwe can see that we're there and\nwe seem to be healthy for the moment.\n\n713\n00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.990\nThat's a big relief, right?\n\n714\n00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.150\nAlways good to know that.\n\n715\n00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.800\nWe don't have any distributed\napplications other than our standard\n\n716\n00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.750\nOpsManager Management Group, so that's\njust again out of the box by default.\n\n717\n00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.610\nWhat we would see the OpsManager\nManagement Group becomes a distributed app\n\n718\n00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.470\nthat we are monitoring.\n\n719\n00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.860\nWe're monitoring all the health of\nall the component parts in there, so\n\n720\n00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.440\nwe're able to see that.\n\n721\n00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.470\nAnd we have tasks associated with\nthat on the bar over here, and\n\n722\n00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:38.250\nthey change their contextual,\nthe navigation elements change as well.\n\n723\n00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.070\nOur default view User there.\n\n724\n00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.960\nWe have our six default views off on the\nlower right, our navigation alert diagram\n\n725\n00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.340\nevent performance state and in this case,\nnetwork vicinity for the dashboard.\n\n726\n00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.060\nSo we can see all those different things.\n\n727\n00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.380\nWe have our Health Explorer.\n\n728\n00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.530\nWe have our ability in this\ncase to put the machine or\n\n729\n00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.330\nthe server in a maintenance mode that's\none of our primary actions or tasks.\n\n730\n00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.150\nIf we have tasks that are running,\nwe can check the status of them,\n\n731\n00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.750\nsee what's going on.\n\n732\n00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.130\nUnix, Linux computers\nhave their own area and\n\n733\n00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.050\nWindows computers have their own as well.\n\n734\n00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:12.550\nFor the dashboard, we could see\nwhich on the install we're healthy,\n\n735\n00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.420\nthe management server role this healthy.\n\n736\n00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.330\nWe're not currently monitoring the\noperating system because we have enabled\n\n737\n00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:21.630\nany monitoring at but we could tell that\nthe general system itself os healthy.\n\n738\n00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.520\nAnd we can see that and we can also see\nthat we've added some task over here\n\n739\n00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.000\non the right at the bottom for\nWindows computers specific in this view.\n\n740\n00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.930\nWe can view things like pinging,\nwe can do computer management,\n\n741\n00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.450\nopen up computer Manager.\n\n742\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.240\nSo, we have, depending on\nthe particular item we select,\n\n743\n00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.690\ndepending on the particular area we're in,\nwe have contextual opportunities to engage\n\n744\n00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.940\nand operate with different pre-made\ntasks or workflows that may exist.\n\n745\n00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.920\nWe could do Remote Desktop Admin.\n\n746\n00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.110\nWe can open up and\nconnect to a machine directly.\n\n747\n00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:54.710\nAnd then we have all of the various\nmonitoring elements from\n\n748\n00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.960\nthe management packs that have been\nimported and we see them here.\n\n749\n00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.090\nAnd we have one for Systems Center, for\n\n750\n00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.260\nthe OpsManager itself, for\nWindows machines, for Unix/Linux machines.\n\n751\n00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.050\nThese are all out of the box, right,\n\n752\n00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.680\nby default,\nplus whatever else we would bring in.\n\n753\n00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.790\nAnd so if we take a look, for\ninstance, here, up under Windows,\n\n754\n00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:17.100\nMicrosoft Windows Server We see a variety\nof elements that help us to understand how\n\n755\n00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.480\nto manage,\nour traditional Microsoft Windows server.\n\n756\n00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.950\nWe would see the act of\nalerts that may occur.\n\n757\n00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.390\nWe would see the Operating System\nperformance monitor.\n\n758\n00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:30.110\nSo we will be able to pre-configure this,\nor set this up as necessary.\n\n759\n00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.630\nWe can actually go in and modify it here.\n\n760\n00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.070\nWe would have any tasks\nthat may be running.\n\n761\n00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.550\nWe'd have the state of the server.\n\n762\n00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.130\nWe'd be able to see health,\nIP address information, etc.\n\n763\n00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:44.660\nWe'd be able to go in, look at detailed\nhealth monitoring with various dashboards.\n\n764\n00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.180\nThings like disk health, right,\nwould be displayed here.\n\n765\n00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.050\nWe'd be able to see what that looks like.\n\n766\n00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.740\nAgain, nothing is monitoring yet,\nbecause we're just out of the box,\n\n767\n00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.880\nbut you get the idea.\n\n768\n00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.150\nPerformance would be\nlooked at here as well.\n\n769\n00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:00.380\nAnd so, all of these views and all this\ninformation is coming to us out of\n\n770\n00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.080\nthe management packs that have been\ninstalled, with the default configuration.\n\n771\n00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.910\nAnd then we start to delve in, modify, and\n\n772\n00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:11.300\nmanipulate as necessary to create\nthe environment, install the agents and\n\n773\n00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.390\nstart to do the in-depth monitoring\nthat SCOM is actually gonna be used for.\n\n774\n00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, definitely a lot to\ntake a look at when it comes to\n\n775\n00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.255\nthe Operations Manager, and now\n&gt;&gt; We know how to install the thing,\n\n776\n00:38:22.255 --> 00:38:24.955\nwe can actually do that and\nstart playing around in there,\n\n777\n00:38:24.955 --> 00:38:29.215\nstart getting things connected and\nmonitoring as well.\n\n778\n00:38:29.215 --> 00:38:30.395\nAdam, we do thank you for\n\n779\n00:38:30.395 --> 00:38:33.755\nshowing us how to get this far because\nthis is an important step for us.\n\n780\n00:38:33.755 --> 00:38:37.932\nSo being able to install this thing, get\nit running operational is very important.\n\n781\n00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:39.582\nAnd now I think that,\n\n782\n00:38:39.582 --> 00:38:43.012\nhopefully our audience there will have\nthe ability to do that very thing.\n\n783\n00:38:43.012 --> 00:38:46.512\nAnd being so, I'm looking at our clock,\nour time is will expired, but for\n\n784\n00:38:46.512 --> 00:38:49.782\nvery good reason, we hang in there for\nit, for you good people, so\n\n785\n00:38:49.782 --> 00:38:52.812\nthat you have knowledge, which is power.\n\n786\n00:38:52.812 --> 00:38:54.852\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n787\n00:38:54.852 --> 00:38:56.152\nFor ITProTV, thanks for watching.\n\n788\n00:38:56.152 --> 00:38:58.462\nI've been your host Daniel Larry\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n789\n00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:00.961\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n790\n00:39:00.961 --> 00:39:06.978\n[MUSIC]\n\n791\n00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:10.798\nThank you for watching IT PRO

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:11.585\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.618\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:16.271\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:17.754\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:21.643\nAnd in today's episode, we are back\nwith more of our configuring and\n\n10\n00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:23.668\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n11\n00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:27.569\nAnd joining us in the studio, uou know\nhim, the man, the myth, the legend,\n\n12\n00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.910\nthat is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.750\nAdam, welcome back, sir,\nand how's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.460\n&gt;&gt; Going really well.\n\n15\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.060\nGoing really well.\n\n16\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.960\nHopefully, it's going well for you also.\n\n17\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080\nWe're gonna continue our discussion/demos.\n\n18\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.830\nInstalling various aspects\nof the system center suite.\n\n19\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.740\nWe're going to be configuring,\ninstalling and\n\n20\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.240\nconfiguring the App Controller Server\npiece.\n\n21\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.390\nWe're gonna take you through that,\nsee how that works.\n\n22\n00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.160\nJust reminding you the last episode,\nin case you haven't seen it,\n\n23\n00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.990\nprobably a good idea to walk\nthrough these sequentially.\n\n24\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.090\nWe configured the SCVMM products.\n\n25\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090\nSo we installed\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n26\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.060\nWe finished up that install with\na restart of the VMM server\n\n27\n00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.310\nto enable us to then\ncontinue where we are.\n\n28\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.330\nWe'll go there in just a second to\ninstall the app controller piece.\n\n29\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.495\nWe're installing it on the VMM Server.\n\n30\n00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:12.445\nBut we talked about the fact we need that\nrestart at the end of the VMM install\n\n31\n00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:16.666\nin order to set the system, make sure that\nwe can do the app controller install.\n\n32\n00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:20.543\nIf you don't do that, what you find\nis you get about, oo, third or so,\n\n33\n00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:24.182\nmaybe halfway through the app\ncontroller install, and it stops.\n\n34\n00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:26.589\nAnd says, hey, by the way,\nyou have a pending restart and\n\n35\n00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:29.212\nwe need to get that done before\nyou can actually do the install.\n\n36\n00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:31.882\nAnd it wipes out all\nthe information you typed in.\n\n37\n00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:33.415\nYou gotta restart and start over again.\n\n38\n00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:36.277\nSo just reminding you of that\nas we get started here so\n\n39\n00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:38.891\nyou don't get caught by\nthat in the real world.\n\n40\n00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:43.427\nIn addition, I did also remind you in\nthe last episode that VMM has a strange\n\n41\n00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:47.980\nhabit of not always starting the service\nto load the console properly.\n\n42\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.830\nIt usually works.\n\n43\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.340\nI don't wanna give you the case or\nthe sense that it will not work correctly.\n\n44\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.092\nBut we do see sometimes in the real world\nthat the VMM service will, even though\n\n45\n00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:01.712\nit's set to autostart, will go to\ndelayed start and not start up properly.\n\n46\n00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:03.821\nSo if you have a problem\nloading the console,\n\n47\n00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:06.220\njust make sure you go check\nthat service on the box.\n\n48\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.682\nIt's usually nothing more than that.\n\n49\n00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:11.020\nIf you start the service up,\nyou'll find the console loads right away.\n\n50\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.362\nSo just a few little\nminor things to consider.\n\n51\n00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:17.620\nJust be aware of real world\nscenarios/issues you wanna address.\n\n52\n00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.683\nAnd that way you're not stuck having to\nscratch your head and think about, hey,\n\n53\n00:02:20.683 --> 00:02:21.778\nwhat's going on with that?\n\n54\n00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:25.120\nHow did that not or did happen or\nnot happen the right way?\n\n55\n00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.924\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead.\n\n56\n00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:26.428\nWe're gonna go in.\n\n57\n00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:29.712\nGonna take a look at how to do\nthe app controller install.\n\n58\n00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:32.528\nWhat you're gonna see up there,\nI've just gonna ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.168\nloaded the app controller media.\n\n60\n00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:35.706\nSo we just started that up.\n\n61\n00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:38.483\nWe've got our setup foul right there.\n\n62\n00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:41.050\nWe're gonna right-click,\ndo run as administrator,\n\n63\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.530\nas you're used to seeing me do.\n\n64\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.285\nJust reminding you of that so we know.\n\n65\n00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:48.320\nOn the system center 2012\nApp Controller install interface,\n\n66\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.400\nyou'll notice we do install.\n\n67\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.276\nBut you'll notice we have a checkbox here.\n\n68\n00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.103\nAnd what we're gonna see is that this\nsays use Microsoft update to go out and\n\n69\n00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:58.420\ncheck for updates to app controller.\n\n70\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.542\nThis is important.\n\n71\n00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:03.970\nI know we talked about in the VMM\ninstall that there is a checkbox.\n\n72\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.436\nIt occurs at the end of the install cycle.\n\n73\n00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.965\nAs we finish up on the complete screen,\nwe unchecked it in the demo, saying, hey,\n\n74\n00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.962\nuse Windows Update to go out and\ndownload new updates.\n\n75\n00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:16.024\nWe said in the real world\nleave that checked off,\n\n76\n00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:18.200\nyou wanna make sure you\nupdate the product.\n\n77\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.280\nWe're doing that on the front end here.\n\n78\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.310\nThe reason is that we're probably\ngonna need some specific software\n\n79\n00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.310\nthat's gonna have to be in or\non the box as a prereq for app controller.\n\n80\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.005\nYou're gonna see that, and I'm just gonna\nclick Install while we're talking just to\n\n81\n00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.840\nkick this off, so we can get this running.\n\n82\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400\nBut what you'll see is we're gonna go out,\nwe're gonna check for that software.\n\n83\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.713\nAnd then once we do that,\n\n84\n00:03:39.713 --> 00:03:43.416\nwe are gonna actually then potentially\nhave to download and install.\n\n85\n00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:46.270\nWe're gonna go out and check and\nsee it's doing that right now.\n\n86\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.670\nComes out, brings up our, hey,\nlet's put in our product key.\n\n87\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.890\nWe talked about this on the last\ninstall with VMM as well.\n\n88\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.770\nIn the real world, clearly you would\nlicense these products, right?\n\n89\n00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.870\nCuz you have to use them in production.\n\n90\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.622\nIn the demo environments we're building\nand or you may build to practice with,\n\n91\n00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:05.148\nyou don't have to necessarily\ninstall the license.\n\n92\n00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:06.994\nYou can install the product as an eval.\n\n93\n00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:09.690\nIf you do that, you get 180 day usage.\n\n94\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.740\nOr 90 days, depending on what version\nyou downloaded, that kinda thing.\n\n95\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.700\nIf it's one of the beta release,\nor pre-release builds,\n\n96\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.560\nversus the full, finished product release\nbuild, you may get 90 versus 180 days.\n\n97\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.550\nBut if you're using full-release product,\n\n98\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.810\nin this case 2012 R2 would be,\nyou get 180 day eval.\n\n99\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.982\nSo you could skip the license key.\n\n100\n00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:30.710\nWe're gonna skip that as well.\n\n101\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.240\nIt does tell you right here, hey,\nwe're putting this in an eval mode or\n\n102\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.400\nan eval edition,\nif you're not gonna license it.\n\n103\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.423\nSo we'll click Next.\n\n104\n00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:42.284\nWe get our EULA, we're gonna check off and\nsay we read that, even though we did not,\n\n105\n00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:44.540\nas Daniel reminded me last time.\n\n106\n00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.620\nAnd you'll notice that checkbox\nwe had on the first screen.\n\n107\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.840\nHey, do we need to check for\nmissing software?\n\n108\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.010\nAbsolutely, you'll see we got\na couple of items here, on the WCF,\n\n109\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.810\nthe Windows Communication Framework,\ndata services version five.\n\n110\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.940\nThe web server IIS roll has to be\ninstalled and configured on the box.\n\n111\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.360\nIt is not, so we're gonna configure\nthat as part of the install.\n\n112\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.050\nSo these things are gonna happen.\n\n113\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.445\nSo we're gonna be going through and\nhaving this do its thing.\n\n114\n00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:13.459\nNow we can, just so we know,\nin case we think we missed something,\n\n115\n00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:15.050\nverify pre-reqs again.\n\n116\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.227\nWe're not gonna bother doing that.\n\n117\n00:05:16.227 --> 00:05:17.860\nWe know we have all the pre-reqs.\n\n118\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.363\nBut if for some reason,\nyou feel you're missing something or\n\n119\n00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:23.072\nsomething doesn't look right,\njust rerun that pre-req check.\n\n120\n00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:25.110\nYou could do that at the lower-left.\n\n121\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.083\nAnd then obviously once you get the\nresults, make sure you have what you need.\n\n122\n00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:30.370\nWe're gonna click Install.\n\n123\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.135\nI'm gonna let this do its thing.\n\n124\n00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:34.880\nIt is gonna take a few minutes to\ndownload, get all of that done.\n\n125\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.800\nIt's enabling IIS and\nthe role services right now.\n\n126\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.120\nWe'll wait for that to finish,\nwe'll come on back and\n\n127\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.460\nwe'll take a look at what's that done,\nand then we'll continue.\n\n128\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.314\nAll right, so you could see we've got\nour select install pass screen up.\n\n129\n00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:49.728\nWe finished downloading our prereqs,\nconfiguring IIS,\n\n130\n00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:52.800\ngot the WCF Services Version\n5 installed in there.\n\n131\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.104\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna use the default path.\n\n132\n00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.950\nWe can obviously modify\nthis in the real world.\n\n133\n00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.968\nJust keep in mind here,\nfree disk space, about 24 GB.\n\n134\n00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:01.854\nWhat do we require?\n\n135\n00:06:01.854 --> 00:06:02.400\n50 MB.\n\n136\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.951\nReal, real small install compared\nto some of the others, right?\n\n137\n00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:09.364\nRemember, [COUGH] some of the other\nsoftware we took a look at as pre-reqs to\n\n138\n00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:12.584\nthe VMM, we needed about three\nto four gigs of space for\n\n139\n00:06:12.584 --> 00:06:15.470\nthe Windows deployment\nkit that we downloaded.\n\n140\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.974\nWe don't need that for\nthis, this is really tiny.\n\n141\n00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:19.740\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nclick Next here.\n\n142\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.150\nConfigure the services, what kinda\nservice account are we gonna use?\n\n143\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.560\nGonna do our domain account.\n\n144\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.726\nSo we're just gonna click here.\n\n145\n00:06:24.726 --> 00:06:26.965\nI'll just put this in real quick.\n\n146\n00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:32.340\nThis'll be our domain, so\npractice labs administrator.\n\n147\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.974\nAnd then make sure that's\nspelled correctly cuz-\n\n148\n00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:37.903\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It does matter, doesn't it?\n\n149\n00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:39.900\n&gt;&gt; I am just such a great typist.\n\n150\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.180\nYeah, spelling does matter.\n\n151\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.700\nBelieve it or not, it does.\n\n152\n00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.899\nAnd we have our password there.\n\n153\n00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.710\nWe do have our port number\ndown at the bottom.\n\n154\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.198\nI don't know if you're able to see that or\nnot.\n\n155\n00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:51.094\nWe could go to full screen for\njust a second just to show you that,\n\n156\n00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:56.087\nyou'll see the port number down\nhere 18000, 18622, 18,622.\n\n157\n00:06:56.087 --> 00:07:00.929\nThis is the traditional port that's\nused for app controller communication.\n\n158\n00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:02.176\nWe can modify that.\n\n159\n00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:05.673\nProbably don't wanna do that, but we could\ngo in to modify that if we wanted to.\n\n160\n00:07:05.673 --> 00:07:08.312\nWe'd have to make some\nchanges in other areas.\n\n161\n00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:11.512\nAnd it may get a little complicated\nto get it right everywhere, but\n\n162\n00:07:11.512 --> 00:07:13.470\nwe can modify that port, if necessary.\n\n163\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.480\nSo, you'll see it here.\n\n164\n00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.340\nGonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n165\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.034\nWe have to configure the website now.\n\n166\n00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:23.111\nRemember, the app controller is gonna be\nresting on top of the IIS role that we've\n\n167\n00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:24.050\nconfigured.\n\n168\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.959\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe are setting up the website.\n\n169\n00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.035\nAnd having it configured the right way so\nthat we can interact with it and\n\n170\n00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.760\napp controller can leverage it.\n\n171\n00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.266\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\njust take a look.\n\n172\n00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:38.530\nWe have our default IP address all\nunassigned, meaning it'll bind to any IP.\n\n173\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.932\nWe've got our default port here,\n443, so secure communications for\n\n174\n00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:44.073\nHTTPS being used.\n\n175\n00:07:44.073 --> 00:07:45.912\nWe'll see that here.\n\n176\n00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:50.001\nWe do then have either the ability\nto use an existing certificate, or\n\n177\n00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.974\nwe have to generate\na self-signed certificate.\n\n178\n00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:57.208\nWe can go ahead, if we use the existing\ncertificate, and pull down,\n\n179\n00:07:57.208 --> 00:08:01.880\nwe'll see that we have our domain\nspecified here, or domain certificate,\n\n180\n00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.007\nquote unquote, specified here.\n\n181\n00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:08.405\nThe machinepracticelabs.com Certificate\nthat's been issued behind the scenes.\n\n182\n00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:12.640\nThis is just the certificate that's\nbeen used or setup for this demo.\n\n183\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.840\nIn the real world you would either have\nto have a certificate already available,\n\n184\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.130\nit could be a self signed certificate\nissued to the machine from your PKI,\n\n185\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.960\nfrom your Public Key Infrastructure.\n\n186\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.740\nProbably ADCS, right, so\n\n187\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.690\nthe Active Directory Certificate Services\nwould be used to self sign and\n\n188\n00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.740\nauto generate a certificate that could\nthen be assigned to this machine.\n\n189\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.240\nYou could generate a self signed\ncertificate on this machine itself.\n\n190\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.720\nWould be up to you to\ndecide how to do that.\n\n191\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.250\nBut if the domain certificate\nservices issues the certificate,\n\n192\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.260\nyou'll then have it published and\nmade available.\n\n193\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.685\nYou could pull it in either way,\nso we'll go ahead or\n\n194\n00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:47.343\na third party certificate as\nwell from a third party PKI.\n\n195\n00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:49.460\nWe'll just go ahead and grab this.\n\n196\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.780\nWe click View here.\n\n197\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.300\nWe can see the certificate just quickly so\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n198\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.460\nThis is our standard X509 E3\ncertificate template.\n\n199\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.410\nNothing too weird about this.\n\n200\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.080\nWe'll see it here.\n\n201\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.510\nAnd we can see it's\nissued to the VM build or\n\n202\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.270\nVMM build machine issued by the VMM\nbuild practicelabs.com machine.\n\n203\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.810\nIn other words, it is a certificate\nissued by this machine itself.\n\n204\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.280\nAnd we see the certification\npackage path is here, right?\n\n205\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.320\nSo it's going to be the key container\ncertificate that's being used to specify\n\n206\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.390\nthat we can actually apply\nthis to the website.\n\n207\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.110\nAnd use this to validate and use this\nto ensure that we can host securely.\n\n208\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.840\nSo we're gonna grab that certificate.\n\n209\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.980\nOnce we've done that\nwe'll just click Refresh.\n\n210\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.910\nJust make sure that that is available,\nloading properly, all is good.\n\n211\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.920\nWe know it is, but we just want\nto do that as a best practice.\n\n212\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.570\nMake sure we follow all those steps and\n\n213\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.350\nmake sure everything is\ngoing to work the right way.\n\n214\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.860\nSo we've got that, we'll click Next.\n\n215\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.710\nWe then have to configure\nthe SQL database.\n\n216\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.290\nSo we're going to go in and make sure\nthat we have this information put in.\n\n217\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.620\nRemember we're using, or\nwe have been using for our demos,\n\n218\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.049\nthe IP addresses as\nopposed to server name.\n\n219\n00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:58.417\nI'm just gonna specify\nthe IP address here.\n\n220\n00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:03.490\n192.168.0.2 is the machine\nIP we've been using.\n\n221\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.760\nOur port is gonna be the standard port for\nSQL Server.\n\n222\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.351\nI would ask you what that port is,\nbased on the last one we did.\n\n223\n00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.082\n&gt;&gt; 1433.\n\n224\n00:10:10.082 --> 00:10:11.603\n&gt;&gt; This time you got it right, absolutely.\n\n225\n00:10:11.603 --> 00:10:12.756\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I learned something new.\n\n226\n00:10:12.756 --> 00:10:14.157\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 1433.\n\n227\n00:10:14.157 --> 00:10:16.010\nAnd we've got our instance name.\n\n228\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.820\nWe're using our standard instance,\nwhich will be MSSQL Server so\n\n229\n00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.770\nwe'll put that in, make sure we\ngot the right number of Ss there.\n\n230\n00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.430\nI always put in an extra S when I do that.\n\n231\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.020\nMSSSS SQL Server.\n\n232\n00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.720\nSo you just want to make\nsure you get that right.\n\n233\n00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.010\nWhatever the instance name is you\nmay have a named instance that\n\n234\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.890\nyour DBA has set up for you.\n\n235\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.340\nYou may be that DBA.\n\n236\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.702\nYou may be setting this up yourself.\n\n237\n00:10:37.702 --> 00:10:40.560\nSo you'll pull in whatever that\nparticular information may be.\n\n238\n00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.050\nYou will figure that out.\n\n239\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.180\nThe database name, you will see\nthe default database name there.\n\n240\n00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.862\nAppcontroller, no spaces.\n\n241\n00:10:46.862 --> 00:10:48.430\nThat's what we'll accept.\n\n242\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.360\nWe accept that the default\nVMM database name, as well.\n\n243\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.960\nWe'll be doing that with all\nof our installs, pretty much.\n\n244\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.830\nYou can obviously modify those if\nyou have a naming convention or\n\n245\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.600\nsomething you need to deal\nwith in your organization.\n\n246\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.490\nBut the best practice recommendation\nis simply to leave those database\n\n247\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.430\nnames alone.\n\n248\n00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.899\nThat way, we're not messing around\nwith what we would expect and see.\n\n249\n00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:09.200\nAnd then if we reading\ndocumentation later,\n\n250\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.466\nfrom Microsoft about how to do a recovery,\nor how to do a backup,\n\n251\n00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:15.750\neverything we need to do later,\nthose names are gonna match up.\n\n252\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.178\nBecause they are gonna be what I used\nin the documentation as a standard\n\n253\n00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.060\ndatabase names.\n\n254\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.160\nSo just a little extra way for\nyou to be cautious but\n\n255\n00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.050\nalso to ensure that if you have a problem\ndown the road and you have to go back and\n\n256\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.450\nread up on how to deal with it,\nthings will match up easily.\n\n257\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.380\nYou're not gonna be mystified about what\nyou called something or where it is.\n\n258\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.590\nSo we're gonna leave that there,\nlet that go through,\n\n259\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.800\njust make sure everything is copacetic,\nas we say.\n\n260\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.000\nWe'll give that a second or two.\n\n261\n00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.400\nUsually takes a moment just to be\nable to connect to the database,\n\n262\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.410\nmake sure everything is good, verifying\nthat everything is the way it should be.\n\n263\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.170\nI did spell it correctly, no extra Ss.\n\n264\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you did.\n&gt;&gt; So that's always-\n\n265\n00:11:50.734 --> 00:11:51.384\n&gt;&gt; You can type with a lisp.\n\n266\n00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:52.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can type, I do, I do, I can.\n\n267\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.300\nAnd so you'll see,\nwe do have the customer improvement, or\n\n268\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.010\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n269\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.460\nRemember, we're opting out of this\nin the demo, but in the real world,\n\n270\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.790\nyou would hopefully opt in.\n\n271\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.100\nGive Microsoft the ability to understand\nmore about your usage, how you're using\n\n272\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.420\nthe product, and to benefit from that,\nand make the product better.\n\n273\n00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.400\nThe Microsoft update check mark there,\nwe talked about this.\n\n274\n00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.080\nAre we gonna use this to\ndownload updates ongoing?\n\n275\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.930\nThis is the hey, do you wanna use\nthe update function to securely patch and\n\n276\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.500\nmaintain app controller?\n\n277\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.850\nIn the real world,\ndefinitely wanna opt in for this.\n\n278\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.458\nIn the demo we're not gonna bother\nwith this cuz again we're not gonna be\n\n279\n00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:26.327\ndownloading updates.\n\n280\n00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.150\nBut make sure you're aware of that okay.\n\n281\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.666\nSo we're gonna click Next here.\n\n282\n00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.730\nWe get our confirm the settings page.\n\n283\n00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.801\nThis is where we're just\ngonna double check, and\n\n284\n00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:37.116\nwe should be a little bit cautious here\nto make sure we have everything correct.\n\n285\n00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:40.629\nIf you're the standard IT professional\nyou're probably gonna click Next or\n\n286\n00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:43.870\nInstall and not bother to look, but\nhopefully what you're gonna do and\n\n287\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.380\nthis is something I tell all my customers,\nall my students to do.\n\n288\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.130\nFrom a documentation standpoint,\nwhat better time\n\n289\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.350\nto capture the build information than\nright now by taking a screen capture,\n\n290\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.450\ndropping this into your documentation?\n\n291\n00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.750\nYou've got everything essentially laid\nout beautifully here when we come in and\n\n292\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.500\nwe do auto work after\nthe fact you show me this.\n\n293\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.070\nI can quickly validate this against what\nyou're showing me in the environment,\n\n294\n00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.110\nand it's good.\n\n295\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.660\nI need to do DR, I've got all\nthe pertinent information here.\n\n296\n00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.205\nThe port numbers, the install directory,\nthe URL, the information\n\n297\n00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.475\nabout the database, the name of\nthe certificate, all that stuff's here.\n\n298\n00:13:18.475 --> 00:13:21.235\nI obviously clearly need additional stuff,\nbut\n\n299\n00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:24.215\nI've all the pertinent\nfacts to drive DR here.\n\n300\n00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:27.142\nSo this would be a great time for\nyou to to do a quick screen capture.\n\n301\n00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:30.642\nEven if it's one of those let me take a\npicture with my phone and just capture it,\n\n302\n00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:32.652\nbecause maybe you don't\nhave a screen capture or\n\n303\n00:13:32.652 --> 00:13:34.872\na screen snip program\ninstalled on the machine.\n\n304\n00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:35.772\nThat's fine,\n\n305\n00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:39.220\nbecause you know I've had customers say\nwe don't have that as part of our build.\n\n306\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.330\nJust take the picture and\nthen drop it into the demo or\n\n307\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.230\ndrop it into the documentation\nafter the fact.\n\n308\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.730\nSo, just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n309\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.300\nWe're gonna click, Install.\n\n310\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.540\nThis is gonna kick off.\n\n311\n00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.750\nIt is gonna take a few minutes for\nit to run through.\n\n312\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.170\nWe'll watch it for just a second but\nthen we'll cut away,\n\n313\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.470\nwe'll come back when it's done.\n\n314\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.140\nBut I just want to point out before we do\nthat that you'll see that we can go and\n\n315\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.340\nwe're watching here.\n\n316\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.180\nWe have server already configure\ncore components are set up.\n\n317\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.997\nWe have our website already set up\nthe firewall settings are really\n\n318\n00:14:03.997 --> 00:14:05.450\nwhat's being done there.\n\n319\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.502\nThe database itself is\nnow being instantiated,\n\n320\n00:14:07.502 --> 00:14:08.960\nthe server's being configured.\n\n321\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.372\nThe agent jobs eventually\nwe'll get PowerShell and\n\n322\n00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:12.914\nthat will complete the install.\n\n323\n00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:16.900\nSo it will take a few minutes, once this\nis done we'll come back and take a look.\n\n324\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.240\nAnd then we'll finish up our install.\n\n325\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.950\nSo we can see that our app\ncontroller setup has finished.\n\n326\n00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.530\nYou'll see the completion screen there.\n\n327\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.280\nGot our green circles,\nwhite checks for everything.\n\n328\n00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.870\nIt'd be great if they put\nlike a smiley face, or\n\n329\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.770\nBill Gates's head was floating,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.734\n&gt;&gt; In like a window, like an Easter egg.\n\n331\n00:14:32.734 --> 00:14:34.650\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Him winking with his thumb.\n\n332\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n333\n00:14:35.906 --> 00:14:36.645\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n334\n00:14:36.645 --> 00:14:38.507\n&gt;&gt; Or beating the snot out of,\nwhat's his name?\n\n335\n00:14:38.507 --> 00:14:39.010\n&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs?\n\n336\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.640\n&gt;&gt; No, not Jobs, the one who was running\nMicrosoft before the current guy.\n\n337\n00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.276\n&gt;&gt; Was it Ballmer?\n\n338\n00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:46.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ballmer, if he's beating\nthe snot out of Ballmer or something.\n\n339\n00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:50.200\nBut anyway, they don't ask our\nopinion about this kinda stuff.\n\n340\n00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.940\n&gt;&gt; They should.\n&gt;&gt; Well, they should, but they don't.\n\n341\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.150\nBut anyway, so what we'll see at\nthe bottom of the screen there\n\n342\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.490\nis we do have an option to go ahead and\nstart the app controller website up.\n\n343\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.530\nWe are gonna leave that unchecked,\nonly because I wanna show you,\n\n344\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.050\nhow to ensure that the proper level of\nauthentication is set up on the website.\n\n345\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.590\nGonna take you into IS, show you how to\ndo that real quick, then we go ahead and\n\n346\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.400\nlaunch the website to show\nyou that is is configured and\n\n347\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.800\ncomplete and will wrap up this demo.\n\n348\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.350\nBut normally in the real world,\nif you go ahead and do this,\n\n349\n00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.840\nyou may decide to opt right in,\nset this up.\n\n350\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.600\nBut as I said, all we're running right\nnow is basic authentication on the site,\n\n351\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.540\nwhich would get you in as\nan administrator local on the system, but\n\n352\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.280\nyou may want to enable a higher\nlevel of authentication.\n\n353\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.760\nWindows authentication,\n\n354\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.710\ndeal with credential based authentication\nfrom another user in the domain so\n\n355\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.370\nI wanna show you how to do that as a best\npractice just before we spin the site up.\n\n356\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.040\nSo we're gonna finish this out we'll\njust go ahead and click Finish.\n\n357\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.378\nWe'll go ahead and just close out\nour window on the media here.\n\n358\n00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:45.163\nAnd what we're gonna do.\n\n359\n00:15:45.163 --> 00:15:48.096\nGo into our server manager, on the box,\n\n360\n00:15:48.096 --> 00:15:52.860\nwe are gonna go into the IS manager and\ntake a look at the websites.\n\n361\n00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.126\nSo we can see the IS is installed and\nconfigured here, just so we can see that.\n\n362\n00:15:57.126 --> 00:16:01.303\nWe're gonna come over to Tools, and\non Tools we are going to come down here on\n\n363\n00:16:01.303 --> 00:16:05.628\nIS manager, just gonna bring this up,\nwe are running IS services version 8.\n\n364\n00:16:05.628 --> 00:16:11.220\nThis is a Server 12 R2 box, 88.5,\ndepending on the version of Windows.\n\n365\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.617\nAnd we're gonna open up our plaid VMM\nbuild practice labs website here.\n\n366\n00:16:15.617 --> 00:16:17.380\nJust gonna open this up.\n\n367\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.870\nWe're gonna extend this down,\nwe're just gonna get rid of our little,\n\n368\n00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.690\nhey do you wanna go out and connect and\ndownload stuff from Microsoft prompt.\n\n369\n00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.110\nGonna open up our Sites container here.\n\n370\n00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.098\nAnd under sites you'll see we have our\napp controller website that has been\n\n371\n00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:29.770\ninstantiated.\n\n372\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.160\nThat's what we were doing\nduring the install.\n\n373\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.610\nWe were building out and\nconfiguring that website.\n\n374\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.110\nSo it's already been set up.\n\n375\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.218\nNow, if we can go full screen here a sec,\nit's kinda hard to see the details.\n\n376\n00:16:38.218 --> 00:16:42.334\nYou'll see that one of the subside\nvirtual directory here,\n\n377\n00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:46.368\nwe have as API, the API Home Site,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n378\n00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:49.775\nset up authentication on\nthis particular areas.\n\n379\n00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.235\nWe're gonna highlight this, right?\n\n380\n00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:54.920\nAnd we can just see what's sitting up\nunderneath there, we have a bin directory.\n\n381\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.078\nAnd inside bin,\nwe just have settings, right.\n\n382\n00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.620\nThere's really nothing to speak of\nthat we're gonna interact with.\n\n383\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.690\nBut we have API here for the Home.\n\n384\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.770\nWe're gonna come over\nhere to Authentication.\n\n385\n00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.950\nDouble click on that and\n\n386\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.810\nyou'll see we have the Windows\nauthentication levels here.\n\n387\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.590\nAnd I mentioned that the only\nthing that's running by default\n\n388\n00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.840\nis basic authentication.\n\n389\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.070\nWe can see that there.\n\n390\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.930\nEverything else is set to disabled.\n\n391\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.124\nAnd so, what we're gonna do is\ngrab Windows Authentication and\n\n392\n00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:21.910\nwe can enable any of these, just by\nhighlighting and using the task area over\n\n393\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.596\nhere under actions, can actually right\nclick and do it as well from here.\n\n394\n00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:29.754\nIt's just question at what should prefer,\nso we'll just click enable here,\n\n395\n00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:31.180\nwe'll set that up.\n\n396\n00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.027\nNow, it's been turned on we have some\nadvanced settings that we need to go in\n\n397\n00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:36.200\nthere, we're not gonna\nconfigure anything there.\n\n398\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.740\nBut if we do wanna take a look.\n\n399\n00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.750\nYou just quickly see that we have\nextended protection capabilities here.\n\n400\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.860\nKernel mode authentication is selected.\n\n401\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.660\nSo we've enabled that.\n\n402\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.290\nIt says, just in case you\nhaven't dealt with this before,\n\n403\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.200\nby default we enable kernel mode app.\n\n404\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.734\nOur kernel mode Authentication protection\nfather which improves authentication\n\n405\n00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:56.915\nperformance, prevents authentication\nproblems, some of them anyway,\n\n406\n00:17:56.915 --> 00:17:59.445\nwith application pulls configure\nwith a custom identity.\n\n407\n00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:03.995\nSo allows us to control and\noptimize the authentication process.\n\n408\n00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:07.005\nSo we're gonna just go with that,\nleave that there.\n\n409\n00:18:07.005 --> 00:18:09.335\nNow that that's been set\nup we'll minimize this.\n\n410\n00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:12.920\nWe're not gonna bother to close out, we'll\njust go ahead and we'll minimize this.\n\n411\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.818\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll minimize the server manager as well.\n\n412\n00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:18.400\nWhat we're then gonna do is spin up IE.\n\n413\n00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.002\nSo we'll just bring up Internet Explorer.\n\n414\n00:18:20.002 --> 00:18:23.904\nAnd we're just gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna type in our pass.\n\n415\n00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:25.573\nAnd we're just gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n416\n00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:27.910\nSo we'll put in HTTPS.\n\n417\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.105\nIt is, if you remember,\nfrom our configuration, a secure connect,\n\n418\n00:18:31.105 --> 00:18:32.036\nsupport 4443.\n\n419\n00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:34.070\nJust gonna do that.\n\n420\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.450\nPlay or plab I should say.\n\n421\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.220\nWoops, hold on,\nlet me turn off the caps lock there.\n\n422\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.726\nPlaid VMM.\n\n423\n00:18:39.726 --> 00:18:42.528\nPlaid VMM build.\n\n424\n00:18:42.528 --> 00:18:45.907\nAnd then practicelabs.com.\n\n425\n00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:51.995\nThis would be the URL of the machine that\nyou're configuring in the real world.\n\n426\n00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:53.145\nWe're using this, but\n\n427\n00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:56.435\nobviously in the real world this would be\nwhatever it is that you're gonna be using.\n\n428\n00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:58.755\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna type that in.\n\n429\n00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:00.045\nJust hit Go there real quick.\n\n430\n00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:04.305\nThe first time we connect we are prompted\nto download Silverlight and put in\n\n431\n00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:07.745\nthe latest build if we don't already\nhave it preconfigured in the system.\n\n432\n00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:10.305\nDidn't set it up and install it\nahead of time so you would see this.\n\n433\n00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:13.930\nCuz want you to see this is the expected\nbehavior so you'll know about it.\n\n434\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.540\nNo big deal, you just have to\nclick to download, obviously.\n\n435\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.940\nSo we'll do that.\n\n436\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.346\n&gt;&gt; Rumors of Silverlight's demise\nhave been greatly exaggerated.\n\n437\n00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:23.210\n&gt;&gt; They have been because it\nis popping up everywhere.\n\n438\n00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.190\nSo we're gonna click, Run, here.\n\n439\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.940\nWe're gonna get a little prompt for\ninstalling Silverlight.\n\n440\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.390\nNow, zoom in for a minute, I just want\nto show you this cuz you're probably\n\n441\n00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.180\nnot gonna wanna do these two things.\n\n442\n00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.400\nMeaning you're not gonna wanna make\nBing your default search engine and\n\n443\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.710\nmake MSN your homepage, right.\n\n444\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.210\nSo make sure you opt out of those if\nyou have no desire to have that happen.\n\n445\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.780\nI'm gonna opt out of that, right.\n\n446\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.530\nSo we're gonna make sure that's there.\n\n447\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.170\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're just gonna download.\n\n448\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.370\nAnd it's interesting if\nyou actually take a look.\n\n449\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.230\nGo back and\njust let me Full screen for a second,\n\n450\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.730\njust show you the market genius here,\nright?\n\n451\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.800\nSo okay, you've got the opt-ins, but\nthen if you read the real, real small fine\n\n452\n00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.800\nprint down there, asterisk after each one,\napplies to IE, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.\n\n453\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.150\nSo it does apply to every browser.\n\n454\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.230\nThis is the behavior,\nthey just want you to know that, right?\n\n455\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.964\nSo just pointing that out to you anyway.\n\n456\n00:20:09.964 --> 00:20:11.020\n&gt;&gt; You gotta love Big Brother.\n\n457\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you very much.\n\n458\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.870\nWe're gonna click install now.\n\n459\n00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.070\nIt will take just a moment to download and\ndo that.\n\n460\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.010\nThey do say in the little prompt there\nit's less than a 30 second install,\n\n461\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.580\nno big deal.\n\n462\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.040\nYou could see it is pretty quick, It has\nbeen done, it does tell you to refresh.\n\n463\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.056\nIf you just hit close, it actually does\nload up without having you refresh,\n\n464\n00:20:31.056 --> 00:20:34.082\nit's up to you but\nit will take a moment, it does load up.\n\n465\n00:20:34.082 --> 00:20:38.160\nThat's the super secret magnetic\ncombo cryptolock being unlocked.\n\n466\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.163\nFor you to see the console there.\n\n467\n00:20:39.163 --> 00:20:40.320\n&gt;&gt; It's a very wonderful graphic.\n\n468\n00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.965\n&gt;&gt; It is a wonderful graphic.\n\n469\n00:20:41.965 --> 00:20:46.068\nIt's almost as good as the swirling\nvortex, in the newer versions of Windows.\n\n470\n00:20:46.068 --> 00:20:51.670\nAnd so, you'll see here that we do\nget our app controller console up.\n\n471\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.940\nNotice at the bottom here.\n\n472\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.683\nYou have to go full screen for me for\njust a second so we can see the warning,\n\n473\n00:20:55.683 --> 00:20:57.998\nnot warning, but just the note\ncuz I can't really drag it up.\n\n474\n00:20:57.998 --> 00:20:59.810\nIt sits at the bottom of the screen.\n\n475\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:05.670\nBut you'll see 180 day eval, it reminds\nus we have not licensed the product,\n\n476\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.900\nwe're running it in eval\nmode which is fine.\n\n477\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.910\nNo big deal, just reminding you of that.\n\n478\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.703\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Does the eval\nmode restricted in anyway Adam?\n\n479\n00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:14.404\n&gt;&gt; Full license product,\nfull functionality,\n\n480\n00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:18.360\nno restriction other than just\nkeeping track of the calendar.\n\n481\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.280\nNo one's gonna die but\nno other than that it works the same way.\n\n482\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.630\nSo we're just gonna get rid of that so\nwe're not bothered by that.\n\n483\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.507\nAnd then you'll see we're signed\nin on our app controller.\n\n484\n00:21:26.507 --> 00:21:29.900\nWe're not gonna go through all\nthe settings, bells and whistles now.\n\n485\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.770\nWe'll be talking about this more\nin some of the upcoming episodes.\n\n486\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.250\nAnd we'll interact with this\na little bit in other areas.\n\n487\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.360\nBut we can see this is fully\nfunctional setup, ready to go.\n\n488\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.030\nAt that point, we can either sign out or\nwe can just leave this up and running.\n\n489\n00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.630\nWe'll go ahead and we'll sign out.\n\n490\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.010\nAnd then once we've done that we'll see\nthe APP controller just drops back down.\n\n491\n00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.270\nWhoops should.\nLets try that one more time.\n\n492\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.630\nThat's the refresh issue\nwith silver light.\n\n493\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.064\nLets do it this way.\n\n494\n00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:57.820\nLets just do this and get rid of that.\n\n495\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.675\nBut that's good enough.\n\n496\n00:21:58.675 --> 00:22:01.457\nWithout refreshing it, it doesn't actually\nsign out the right way the first time.\n\n497\n00:22:01.457 --> 00:22:05.175\nI'll be, you can see once we've done\nthe install, we're all set, ready to go.\n\n498\n00:22:05.175 --> 00:22:07.700\nAnd that completes our discussion and\nour demo for you,\n\n499\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.017\nof how to setup the App Controller\nserver product.\n\n500\n00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:12.121\nCome back and join us for another episode,\n\n501\n00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:15.842\nwe are gonna be taking a look at how\nto configure and install opps manager.\n\n502\n00:22:15.842 --> 00:22:17.740\nThat's going to be I believe\nour next demo coming up,\n\n503\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.526\nthat'll be an interesting one especially\ngiven the fact that that's gonna be\n\n504\n00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:23.372\nthe focus of our attention from majority\nof our discussion in this set of shows.\n\n505\n00:22:23.372 --> 00:22:27.097\nReally important demo, you wanna see how\nwe build that out from the ground up,\n\n506\n00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:29.525\nand make sure we understand\nhow to configure it, so\n\n507\n00:22:29.525 --> 00:22:33.210\nwe can be successful at doing our\ndata center monitoring in the cloud.\n\n508\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.340\nSo come back and see us for that.\n\n509\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.272\n&gt;&gt; Awesome stuff Adam and\nthank you so much for\n\n510\n00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.956\nshowing us how to get the apps\nmanager installed very very or\n\n511\n00:22:38.956 --> 00:22:41.383\nour controller should I say\napps control [CROSSTALK].\n\n512\n00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:45.070\nManagers and controllers all over\nthe place hard to keep them straight.\n\n513\n00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.796\n&gt;&gt; Everything wants to be heard.\n\n514\n00:22:45.796 --> 00:22:47.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.\n\n515\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.632\nAll right, that being said, it looks like\nwe've come to the end of our episode.\n\n516\n00:22:49.632 --> 00:22:52.080\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it, and\nyou've learned something from it.\n\n517\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.558\nWe strive hard to make that the very case.\n\n518\n00:22:53.558 --> 00:22:55.942\nAnd we're going to ahead and\nsign-off, though.\n\n519\n00:22:55.942 --> 00:22:58.270\nFor ITPROTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel

--> 00:00:46.980\nJust to remind you, if you haven't\nseen the episodes up until now,\n\n17\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.450\nyou may want to go back just review them.\n\n18\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.510\nWe did the VMM,\nthe Virtual Machine Membership product.\n\n19\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.610\nWe did the app controller, we did SCOM,\n\n20\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.310\nwe're about to do the,\nwhat are we doing now?\n\n21\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.320\nThe Orchestrator, right,\nthat's what we're doing now right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.472\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you get to [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna do the Orchestrator.\n\n23\n00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:05.944\nSo we're gonna have Daniel orchestrate for\nus.\n\n24\n00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:09.048\nTthe Orchestrator product is\nthe automation workflow product.\n\n25\n00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:10.674\nThis is like PowerShell, but\n\n26\n00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.708\nwith a graphical interface allowing\nus to be able to build workflows, and\n\n27\n00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.300\nthen deploy them using what\nare called integration connectors.\n\n28\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.840\nWe're gonna be able to connect and\n\n29\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.150\nuse integration packages to be\nable to manage workflow and\n\n30\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.540\nbuild componentized, compartmentalized\nworkflows for various products.\n\n31\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.260\nReally cool little\naspect of system center.\n\n32\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.680\nNot a lot of people use the product and\nuse it well.\n\n33\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.800\nI see this in the field with\na lot of the customers.\n\n34\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.640\nThey hear about it, they wanna use it.\n\n35\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.025\nThey're not really sure\nwhat to do with it.\n\n36\n00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:41.440\nAnd it is a really,\nreally neat little product.\n\n37\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.230\nWe're gonna show you how to\nset this up and install this.\n\n38\n00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead\njump right in if we can.\n\n39\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.000\nWe'll take a look.\n\n40\n00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.010\nSo we've got our installation\nmedia loaded up.\n\n41\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.220\nOur System Center Orchestrator Media.\n\n42\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.309\nWe're gonna right click on set\nup Orchestrator down here,\n\n43\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.080\ndo the run as administrator\nas we always do.\n\n44\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.690\nLet's just get that out of the way.\n\n45\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.760\nBring this up, and\n\n46\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.790\nyou'll see here we have our System Center\n2012 R2 Orchestrator product.\n\n47\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.690\nDo our install right here.\n\n48\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.970\nSo let's just click on that, and\nwe'll give that just a second to spin up.\n\n49\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.700\nWe get our standard product\nregistrations screen.\n\n50\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.210\nMost of these products will look more or\n\n51\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.390\nless the same,\nthe naming of the product notwithstanding.\n\n52\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.360\nSo we're gonna go ahead as\nwe've been doing, set this up.\n\n53\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.350\nWe'll call this administrator.\n\n54\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.130\nWe'll put this in as practicelabs.\n\n55\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.010\nWe're gonna bypass our key on this one,\nset up as an eval.\n\n56\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.790\nSo go ahead and we'll do that,\nwe're gonna accept our EULA, and yes,\n\n57\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.440\nI did read it ahead of time,\nin case you were wondering.\n\n58\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.300\nAnd, if we could just zoom in for\na minute,\n\n59\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.350\ngo full screen just to see this here,\nwe do have Management Server selected\n\n60\n00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.770\nby default, but notice the options,\nwe are gonna leave all the defaults.\n\n61\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.390\nBut we have the runbook server.\n\n62\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.340\nWe have the Orchestator console, and\nWeb Service, and the Runbook Designer.\n\n63\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.290\nThe designer is where we're going to\nactually build out our workflows.\n\n64\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.865\nIt's going to be our drag and\ndrop grid-like environment.\n\n65\n00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:00.020\nAnd we are going to be able to go in, and\n\n66\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.930\nuse that to be able to build out\nour workflows and deploy them.\n\n67\n00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.772\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n68\n00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:06.270\nSo we're to go head and\ndo this install, we'll kick this off.\n\n69\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.994\nLet's click Next.\n\n70\n00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:09.620\nWe're going to check for\nrequired hardware and software.\n\n71\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.860\nYou'll see that we have\nthat piece well in hand.\n\n72\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.400\nWe have to configure our service account.\n\n73\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.970\nSo we are gonna go in,\nset up the information we need here.\n\n74\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.010\nWe will install with our\npracticelabs account,\n\n75\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.425\nso let me just spell that correctly here.\n\n76\n00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:27.350\nPracticelabsadministrator, the one\nwe've been using for\n\n77\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.410\nmost of our installs, so\nwe'll do administrator.\n\n78\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.490\nWe're gonna do our\nstandard password here and\n\n79\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.100\nthen, what we're gonna do is you'll see\nwe have our domain down at the bottom.\n\n80\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.095\nWe are gonna run a test to make sure\nwe put the credential in correctly,\n\n81\n00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.720\ndidn't fat-finger anything or\nscrewed something up.\n\n82\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.560\nCuz you never know, you may have made\na mistake, you want to catch it now, so\n\n83\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.650\nwe'll check it quickly.\n\n84\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.320\nYou could see credential accepted,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n85\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.379\nNow we're gonna click next here,\n\n86\n00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.499\nwe're gonna then have to go in and\nconfigure the database server, so\n\n87\n00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.991\nwe're gonna specify what we're gonna\ndo here for our database instance.\n\n88\n00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:03.324\nRemember we're doing an all in one install\nwhere we have our database running on\n\n89\n00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:03.930\nthe machine.\n\n90\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.125\nWe've been using that for\n\n91\n00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:08.810\nour various demonstrations in\nthe different episodes we've been doing.\n\n92\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.050\nSo we have an instance\nof SQL running locally.\n\n93\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.750\nAs a result we're gonna\nuse that local instance.\n\n94\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.940\nIn the real world as you're doing\nyour install in the organization,\n\n95\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.530\nout the enterprise, whenever you're doing\nthis, you may path this differently.\n\n96\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.140\nSo just understand what\nI'm about to type in,\n\n97\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.180\nin other words, is the local install and\nthe instance for the local install.\n\n98\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.110\nYou may choose to do this differently.\n\n99\n00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.730\nSo I'm gonna put in practicelabs.\n\n100\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.080\nSo let's just put that in, no,\nI'm sorry, not practicelabs.\n\n101\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.360\nThinking about the credential here.\n\n102\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.530\nGetting ahead of myself.\n\n103\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.841\nI'm gonna put in the name on my machine,\nplab, for practice labs,\n\n104\n00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:47.508\nthis is our sys right or\nsys machine, so plabsysbuild01.\n\n105\n00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:54.750\nAnd then our database instance\nmssqlserver, so we're gonna use that.\n\n106\n00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.200\nWe have our default port there, 1433.\n\n107\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and specify our\nWindows authentication credential\n\n108\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.280\nwill be used, so we're not gonna put in\na specific credential for SQL, but rather\n\n109\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.060\njust use our built-in Windows credential\nthat we're already supplying and using.\n\n110\n00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.391\nWe could test our database connection,\nalways good to do that check that out,\n\n111\n00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.714\nmake sure we haven't typed\nin that name incorrectly,\n\n112\n00:05:16.714 --> 00:05:18.290\nhave a problem with the credential.\n\n113\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.020\nAgain, want to check these things out.\n\n114\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.889\nIt’s a good way for us to catch errors\nup front and not start the install and\n\n115\n00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.150\nfind out things are not going to\ngo well and have to backtrack.\n\n116\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.230\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ndo that, it doesn't take very long,\n\n117\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.990\ntypically about 30 seconds or so.\n\n118\n00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.420\nYou could see that here\nwe do have success, so\n\n119\n00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.745\nthat is good, so\nwe're going to click Next.\n\n120\n00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:38.320\nWe're then going to be asked\nabout configuring the database,\n\n121\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.930\nare we doing a new install\nwith a new database.\n\n122\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.820\nWe are going to do that.\n\n123\n00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.680\nYou'll see the default database\nname there is Orchestrator.\n\n124\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.390\nSo we're gonna accept that.\n\n125\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.020\nBut we could specify an existing\ndatabase if we chose to.\n\n126\n00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.770\nBe up to us to decide.\n\n127\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.770\nRemember in the real world,\n\n128\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.060\nif you are setting up multiple instances,\nyou may already have a database.\n\n129\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.520\nAnd as a result you may have a named\ninstance you wanna connect to.\n\n130\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.140\nSo we're gonna do a new database,\nwe'll leave that alone.\n\n131\n00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.522\nWe're then gonna setup\nthe Orchestrator users group.\n\n132\n00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:06.460\nIn other words,\nwhat group are we going to specify\n\n133\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.170\nthat is going to allow us to have\naccess to the Runbook Designer and\n\n134\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.690\nthe deployment manager,\nportions of your Orchestrator install.\n\n135\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.070\nOrchestrator is\na compartmentalized program.\n\n136\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.400\nWe have the the Runbook Designer\nwhich is used to actually create,\n\n137\n00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.730\ndesign the Runbooks.\n\n138\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.330\nRunbooks are what we call the work\nflows that we want to create.\n\n139\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.350\nThat's just the name we give them.\n\n140\n00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.760\nWe call them Runbooks,\nwe save them and then we deploy them.\n\n141\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.830\nThe deployment manager is where we\nactually bring in the integration packs.\n\n142\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.082\nWe are gonna import integration packs and\nthen use those, which are gonna give us,\n\n143\n00:06:37.082 --> 00:06:40.668\nthink of this almost like Visio where\nyou're importing the shapes for\n\n144\n00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:43.690\nvarious solutions you wanna\nbe able to work with.\n\n145\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.680\nThe integration pack imports\nall the modular components and\n\n146\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.390\nthe workflow elements for\nvarious products.\n\n147\n00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.230\nSo it's almost like a management pack for\nSCOM, but it's the integration pack,\n\n148\n00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.180\nis the equivalent of the Management Pack\nbut in the Orchestrator product.\n\n149\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.760\nSo the Deployment Manager is\nthe piece that's used to import\n\n150\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.170\nthose integration packs, make them\navailable for the Orchestrator server,\n\n151\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.920\nwhere they're hosted and\ngive us access to the Runbook Designer, so\n\n152\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.080\nwe can use them to actually\nbuild those runbooks.\n\n153\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.870\nSo it's a multi-level solution, right?\n\n154\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.080\nAnd so the user groups or the user's\ngroup is going to be a group we have to\n\n155\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.640\nbe a member of to be able to get\naccess to these functional elements.\n\n156\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.770\nThink of it like being a member of\nthe domain admin group in Windows\n\n157\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.140\ngives you access to everything.\n\n158\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.030\nIt's that equivalent.\n\n159\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.640\nSo we have one that's built in by default,\nit's called the Orchestrator users group.\n\n160\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.860\nWe're gonna accept that and\nleave that there.\n\n161\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.420\nWe are gonna grant remote\naccess to the Runbook Designer.\n\n162\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.670\nCould we go full screen for\njust a second just to show you this?\n\n163\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.340\nThis is a check box down at the bottom.\n\n164\n00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.193\nIf we wanna be able to give this\ngroup permission to be able to access\n\n165\n00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:48.316\nthe Runbook Designer from a different\nmachine other than the management\n\n166\n00:07:48.316 --> 00:07:52.323\nserver itself, we have to make sure\nthat we are giving remote access.\n\n167\n00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:56.512\nThat is the default here, because very\nlikely they're gonna wanna administer this\n\n168\n00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:59.348\nand work with this but\nnot just on the management server.\n\n169\n00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:01.966\nWe may actually decide to\nuse this product Remotely,\n\n170\n00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:05.178\nwe often have an admin workstation,\nsomething like that we use.\n\n171\n00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:09.278\nAnd so we wanna be aware of that, so\nyou don't wanna uncheck that box if you\n\n172\n00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:13.830\nwanna be able to give access to a system\nother than the management server itself.\n\n173\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.540\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthat's why we have that set up there.\n\n174\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.675\nSo we're gonna leave that there,\nwe're gonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n175\n00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:21.605\nWe then have to specify the ports for\nthe web service,\n\n176\n00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:26.295\nwe're gonna leave the defaults in place,\nyou'll see port 81 for the web service,\n\n177\n00:08:26.295 --> 00:08:30.290\nport 82 for the orchestration console\nport, those are the defaults.\n\n178\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.786\nAgain, we could modify those but\n\n179\n00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:34.650\nprobably better if we're\ngonna leave those in place.\n\n180\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.182\nWe're then gonna go ahead, accepting those\ndefaults, select the install location.\n\n181\n00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:43.908\nHave our standard default install program\nfiles, x86, Microsoft System Center 2012\n\n182\n00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:47.910\nR2, Orchestrator, you decide whether\nyou wanna leave it there or not.\n\n183\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.927\nNotice this bar has not budged at all,\nwe've been through like five screens and\n\n184\n00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:51.613\nit has not moved.\n\n185\n00:08:51.613 --> 00:08:52.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's not doing nothing.\n\n186\n00:08:52.523 --> 00:08:56.440\n&gt;&gt; We've got an install that takes like\n1,000 years with this product, it's crazy.\n\n187\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.130\nBut it actually will get going here\nin just a minute, we're almost there.\n\n188\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.572\nWe've got our System Center Orchestrator\nhelp us to improve it product.\n\n189\n00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:05.196\nLittle screen, we always know just\nthat this, we talk about this,\n\n190\n00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:08.200\nin the real world we would opt in,\nhopefully you would choose to opt in,\n\n191\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.304\nand specify that you wanna give\nMicrosoft some feedback through\n\n192\n00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:13.430\nthe customer experience\nimprovement program.\n\n193\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.330\nWe're gonna say no here,\nno to error reporting as well, but\n\n194\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.130\nwe would in the real\nworld hopefully opt in.\n\n195\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.470\nWe do have our install summary,\nagain I'll just remind you as I often have\n\n196\n00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.270\nin the other demos, good opportunity for\nyou to stop, take a screen capture here,\n\n197\n00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.250\nthink about your documentation,\nget that information captured properly.\n\n198\n00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.060\nNice thing about this, and it's a little\nunusual than some of the other screens in\n\n199\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.530\nthe other products,\nthey give us the ability to click here and\n\n200\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.440\njust change that particular item,\nwhich is nice.\n\n201\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.910\nWe could opt in right here on this screen\nwithout having to go, previous, previous,\n\n202\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.120\nprevious, back, back, back, we could jump\nright in and change it right from here.\n\n203\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.930\nSo it's kind of just a little odd\nlittle item in this particular wizard,\n\n204\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.850\ndoesn't show up in every one, but\nit's nice that they thought about us and\n\n205\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.540\nallowed us to do this.\n\n206\n00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.990\nThis must be the user friendly product\nteam at Microsoft that designed this\n\n207\n00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.810\nparticular one, so we like that.\n\n208\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.803\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Install.\n\n209\n00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:05.029\nWe're gonna let that cook, it's gonna take\na few minutes so we're gonna wait for\n\n210\n00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:06.040\nthat to finish up.\n\n211\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.350\nWe'll come on back and\nshow you what the results are, and\n\n212\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.780\ntake a look at the moving\nparts as soon as we finish up.\n\n213\n00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.890\nAll right so you could see that your\nOrchestrater setup's finally completed,\n\n214\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.540\nwe've got our green circles,\nwhite checks all the way down.\n\n215\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.170\nWe do have just at the bottom here,\nwe can scroll down and\n\n216\n00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:25.102\nsee the launch Windows update, we're gonna\nuncheck that in the demo environment,\n\n217\n00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:28.020\nin the real world clearly\nwanna keep that selected.\n\n218\n00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.960\nWe do have view System Center Orchestrator\nonline, we're gonna uncheck that but\n\n219\n00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.910\nyou can take a look at that in\nthe real world if you would like.\n\n220\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.940\nI did click to uncheck that,\nit put the check back in,\n\n221\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.670\nit's one of those funky little bounce\nthe check back in checkbox days.\n\n222\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.890\nBut the bottom item, go ahead and\n\n223\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.880\nlaunch the Runbook Designer,\nwe're gonna leave that checked off.\n\n224\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.360\nWe wanna see the Runbook Designer,\nmention what it is,\n\n225\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.370\nwe're gonna have it launch that for us.\n\n226\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.540\nSo we're gonna click Close,\nwe're gonna open up the Runbook Designer,\n\n227\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.060\ngive this just a second.\n\n228\n00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.480\nLet's explode that out and\nmake that full size so you can see that.\n\n229\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.830\nIf we could just take a look\nfull screen here for a minute so\n\n230\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.440\nwe could see the bottom part of\nthe screen that you're missing right now.\n\n231\n00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.992\nRemember, the Runbook Designer\nis where we go in and\n\n232\n00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:10.484\nactually create the runbooks using\nthe integration pack components.\n\n233\n00:11:10.484 --> 00:11:15.456\nYou'll see the activities on the\nright-hand side under activities here by\n\n234\n00:11:15.456 --> 00:11:20.700\nwork area, system, scheduling,\nmonitoring, whatever the case may be.\n\n235\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.780\nAnd as we add integration packs, we get\nmore work areas here, more activities.\n\n236\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.620\nSo we'll have them specifically for\nSCOM, we'll have them for Exchange, for\n\n237\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.640\nSharePoint, whatever the case may be, we\ndownload those integration packs in VMM.\n\n238\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.480\nSo if we do that and we bring those in,\nwe'll then be able to start adding\n\n239\n00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.250\nspecific activities associated with\nthe particular workflow in question, and\n\n240\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.860\ndragging them out on the screen and\ncreating them.\n\n241\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.110\nWe would come in here under Runbooks and\n\n242\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.220\nwe could see that right now we\ndon't have any runbooks set up.\n\n243\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.790\nBut we could right click New Runbook\nif we wanted to create one.\n\n244\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.940\nWe just create one right\nhere if we wanted to,\n\n245\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.050\nand the new runbook would be very similar,\nit's just a named instance.\n\n246\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.724\nWe then go ahead,\ndo something like drag out get computer.\n\n247\n00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:08.755\nDo we wanna check this out,\nwe always check out the runbook so\n\n248\n00:12:08.755 --> 00:12:13.150\nwe can begin to work with it, changes the\nicon so we can see it's edited right now.\n\n249\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.820\nWe just drag out a bunch of\nthese shapes onto the screen.\n\n250\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.760\nAnd then once we've done get\ncomputer and/or IP status,\n\n251\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.245\nwe may get something\nlike get service status.\n\n252\n00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:25.590\nSo just drag that out, we'll line that up.\n\n253\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.670\nWe may then decide to monitor disk\nspace or something like that.\n\n254\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.360\nAnd then when we're\ndone we'll go ahead and\n\n255\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.490\nperhaps we'll restart the system\nafter we've done all that, so\n\n256\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.050\nwe'll drag out a restart system icon.\n\n257\n00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.700\nAnd each one of these, as we hover over\nthem, if we go back to full screen for\n\n258\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.030\njust a second so\nyou could see this in little more detail.\n\n259\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.179\nWhen I hover over the shape I have\nconnector arrows that indicate flow.\n\n260\n00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:56.259\nAnd you'll see that I can drag that,\nconnect that over like that, and create\n\n261\n00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:01.185\na linear flow to actually instantiate\nan anchor, the workflow elements,\n\n262\n00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:07.040\nso I know what order I want to execute\nthem in and I can begin to draw that out.\n\n263\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.970\nSo, oops, didn't mean to grab that that\nway, gotta be careful you grab the arrow.\n\n264\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.670\nYou can see I get a little\ncross here when I do that, and\n\n265\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.340\nthere we go, grab that,\nbring that over, all right.\n\n266\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.140\nAnd you'll see sometimes, depending\non the kind of relationship I set up,\n\n267\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.580\nit says here this activity you\nare trying to link is an event,\n\n268\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.250\nevent activities cannot\naccept incoming links.\n\n269\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.840\nSo this particular event right here can't\nactually accept an inbound workflow,\n\n270\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.120\nit could be monitoring or\ndoing something on its own.\n\n271\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.320\nSo you have to obviously understand the\nshapes and the activities we're working\n\n272\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.810\nwith, and as you start to spend time using\nthe product we'll learn more about it.\n\n273\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.780\nSo let's move that out of the way, let's\njust go ahead bring this over here, so\n\n274\n00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.835\nwe'll have this running.\n\n275\n00:13:47.835 --> 00:13:51.430\nActually, move this back out this way\na little bit, have a little more room.\n\n276\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:58.200\nWe then can go ahead, grab that,\nthere we go right there.\n\n277\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.430\nGrab that, put that over there, set that\nup, so we've got a little workflow there.\n\n278\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.810\nIf we decide we don't want\nthe monitor we can go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.790\ndelete that shape, just highlight that,\nwe can get rid of it and delete it.\n\n280\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.372\nWe can right click on it for\ninstance and choose delete, and\n\n281\n00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:15.160\njust say yeah, we're just gonna get rid\nof that and just move it off to the side.\n\n282\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.965\nThe other nice thing about\nthe Orchestrator here, when we go in and\n\n283\n00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:19.068\nstart setting these up and\n\n284\n00:14:19.068 --> 00:14:21.741\nwe actually create the workflow\nwe can right click on each one.\n\n285\n00:14:21.741 --> 00:14:26.019\nWe can rename them cuz we may wanna take\nthe generic name and specify this machine,\n\n286\n00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:29.115\nsplitting the machine name\nthat we're gonna monitor.\n\n287\n00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:34.185\nSo let's rename that, instead of\nget computer IP status we're gonna\n\n288\n00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:37.156\ndo get status for\n\n289\n00:14:37.156 --> 00:14:43.210\nITProTV server one or something like that.\n\n290\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:47.280\nSo we can actually spec out our workflow,\nmake it make sense, label it so\n\n291\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.970\npeople know what we're doing.\n\n292\n00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.830\nIn addition,\nwe can go into the properties and\n\n293\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.940\nwe can decide that we wanna specify\nwhat computer we're gonna connect to.\n\n294\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.920\nSo we actually have to program in\nthe computer we wanna be able to hit.\n\n295\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.272\nSo we'd go in here, maybe go out on the\nnetwork, find a computer that's available,\n\n296\n00:15:07.272 --> 00:15:09.034\nlet's just pretend we found one.\n\n297\n00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:16.174\nAnd let's just call this let's\ncall this plab DC01 which is\n\n298\n00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:21.278\nour domaincontroller.practicelabs.com,\n\n299\n00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:26.648\nlet's just assume that's\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n300\n00:15:26.648 --> 00:15:31.410\nAnd then run behavior,\nwe're gonna decide how this is gonna run.\n\n301\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.920\nAre we gonna report out when\nthe activity runs for so many seconds,\n\n302\n00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.690\nare we gonna go ahead and output\nthe activity output in a certain way?\n\n303\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.140\nThere's different things we do\njust depending on what it is.\n\n304\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.233\nSo we're gonna program\nin all the properties,\n\n305\n00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.755\nwe do this for\nall the different elements of the runbook.\n\n306\n00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:48.298\nAnd then some of these\nhave a looping entity, or\n\n307\n00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:52.369\nan element where we can actually go ahead\nand we can enable this and say okay,\n\n308\n00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:56.882\nif it doesn't work the first time, kind of\na delay, let's go back and try it after so\n\n309\n00:15:56.882 --> 00:16:00.635\nmany seconds cuz We may be pinging or\nmay be trying to do a heartbeat, or\n\n310\n00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:01.560\nwho knows what.\n\n311\n00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.360\nDepends, obviously, on the particular item\nand the workflow that we're gonna build.\n\n312\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.440\nOrchestration is a fairly\ndetailed process,\n\n313\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.240\nand when I spend time with customers doing\nthis and building out workflows, and\n\n314\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.260\nbuild Workbooks and Runbooks for them.\n\n315\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.540\nThis can take awhile to\nfigure out how to get right.\n\n316\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.950\nThere's some really good\ne-Learning out there,\n\n317\n00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:25.240\nthat you can take a look at from Microsoft\ndirectly, on how to do Orchestrators, or\n\n318\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.190\nhow to do the Runbooks, rather.\n\n319\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.310\nThere's some interesting books out there\nthat people put about this, but it's kinda\n\n320\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.690\nthing you gotta practice and really spend\ntime doing to get well-versed with.\n\n321\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.640\nCuz you have to understand all\nthe different activities based on\n\n322\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.340\nthe integration packs that\nyou're gonna be working with.\n\n323\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.840\nAnd what I do when I load a new\nintegration pack, or customer says hey I\n\n324\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.720\nneed you to figure this out, or a student\nasks a question, I gotta load that up.\n\n325\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.940\nI'll spend a few hours playing with\nall the different activities and\n\n326\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.870\nunderstanding them.\n\n327\n00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.190\nSo I have a better understanding\nof how to integrate them.\n\n328\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.480\nSo we would set this all up obviously,\nand once we're done,\n\n329\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.130\nwe get everything organized.\n\n330\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.210\nWe would then wanna go ahead and\n\n331\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.860\nsave this, you'll notice up here we\nhave a check in feature that we can use.\n\n332\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.190\nCheck in allows us to\nessentially stop editing, and\n\n333\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.550\nthen once we've done that,\nwe can name or rename this.\n\n334\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.690\nWe can right click on the tab, we could\ncheck out, we could do a test on this.\n\n335\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.250\nWe can run it, see what would happen, we\ncan save it, we can delete it, export it.\n\n336\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.760\nSet up permissions, all the standard\nstuff we would need to do.\n\n337\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.040\nAnd then once we're done, we would then\nbe able to deploy this workbook or\n\n338\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.450\nrather this runbook and\n\n339\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:35.540\nbe able to use it to then automate and\ncarry out some sort of activity.\n\n340\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.390\nNow the other piece associated with this\nthat we spoke about during the install.\n\n341\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.519\nLet's take a look at that, we're gonna go\nover here to our desktop for a minute.\n\n342\n00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:50.080\nWe're gonna go down here do a little quick\nbrowse, let me just scroll over here.\n\n343\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.454\nAnd what we're gonna look for is you'll\nsee here we have our runbook designer,\n\n344\n00:17:54.454 --> 00:17:55.967\nwe've already seen that.\n\n345\n00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:59.397\nBut I mentioned that we will have\na console as well for Orchestrater, so\n\n346\n00:17:59.397 --> 00:18:02.610\nwe're gonna take a look at this and\nsee what's going on here.\n\n347\n00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.220\nSo let's just right-click on the console,\nand\n\n348\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.800\nlet's just pin that to the start menu so\nwe can see that, and we'll open that up.\n\n349\n00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.910\nAnd then there's one other thing\nwe just wanna take a look at here\n\n350\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.070\nreally quickly, as well.\n\n351\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.170\nLet me just scroll this way,\nshould be able to find that.\n\n352\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.780\nWhere are we?\n\n353\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.858\nNope, that's up under SQL,\nand what I am I looking for?\n\n354\n00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:29.620\nI'm looking for\n\n355\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.492\nour-\n&gt;&gt; Lots of options for configuration.\n\n356\n00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:34.715\n&gt;&gt; I'm just looking for\nthe Deployment Manager, which I did see,\n\n357\n00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:35.795\nit was sitting right up there.\n\n358\n00:18:35.795 --> 00:18:39.259\nIt's alphabetical by product I just wasn't\nlooking in the right place I missed\n\n359\n00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:41.610\nthat d there, and\ndidn't realize it was there.\n\n360\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.530\nThe Deployment Manager,\n\n361\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.080\nwhich remember, is where we're gonna\ngo to do our integration imports.\n\n362\n00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.620\nRight, our integration pack imports,\nso we're gonna bring that in.\n\n363\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.680\nJust wanna show you this as well,\nso we'll right click on this.\n\n364\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.150\nWe'll pin that to the start menu so\n\n365\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.760\nwe can see that,\nlet's just take a look at the console.\n\n366\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.260\nThen we'll take a look at how we\nbring in the integration pack.\n\n367\n00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.540\nWe are gonna run these so, we'll go ahead,\nand we'll just do that real quick.\n\n368\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.160\nBring this up, this is a web base\nconsole that we will log in to.\n\n369\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.310\nSo, this allows us to interact\nwith the Orchestrator product.\n\n370\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.380\nThis is against the actual Orchestrator\nserver that we've installed and\n\n371\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.920\nyou'll see right there.\n\n372\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.000\nWebsite cannot be found.\n\n373\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.160\nNow, why would that happened?\n\n374\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.142\nMaybe we have a service error,\n\n375\n00:19:18.142 --> 00:19:22.670\nmaybe there's something going on that\nis not gonna allow us to access that.\n\n376\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.174\nIt looks like we have website not found,\nwhen you do the install initially it\n\n377\n00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:29.457\ndoes take a little of time for\nthe website to instantiate, it may just be\n\n378\n00:19:29.457 --> 00:19:33.320\nthat it's not done cooking yet behind the\nscenes, and that could also be the case.\n\n379\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.739\nSo we may just have to go in and\ntake a look at that,\n\n380\n00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:39.113\ndo troubleshooting if that happens\nthe first time we go to connect.\n\n381\n00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:42.779\nLet's look at the manager, in the meantime\nspring up the deployment manager.\n\n382\n00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:46.880\nWe'll see here the Deployment Manager,\njust make this full screen so\n\n383\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.367\nwe could see this,\nwe'll see our integration packs here.\n\n384\n00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:55.254\nNotice that we don't have any\nintegration packs loaded by default, but\n\n385\n00:19:55.254 --> 00:19:57.497\nwe could go in, right click, and\n\n386\n00:19:57.497 --> 00:20:02.383\nwe could register the IP with\nthe Orchestrator manager server, and, or\n\n387\n00:20:02.383 --> 00:20:07.620\ndeploy IP runbooks, deply IP2 runbooks\nservere is what I was trying to say.\n\n388\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.110\nAnd actually bring them in,\nit's a two-step process.\n\n389\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.030\nAnd when we go in and we do this,\n\n390\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.440\nwelcome to\nthe Integration Pack Registration Wizard,\n\n391\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.490\nwe actually are then able to go in, walk\nthrough the steps required to go ahead and\n\n392\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.500\nregister Integration Packs, or hot fixes\nor updates, whatever may be importing, and\n\n393\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.510\nmake them available.\n\n394\n00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.680\nWe're not gonna out and\nactually download them off the Internet.\n\n395\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.930\nBut to show you the beginning of this\nprocess, we could click Next here.\n\n396\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.330\nWe would then be able to add in, we'd have\nto either have them available locally or\n\n397\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.120\nwe would have to have downloaded them\nalready and make them available.\n\n398\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.200\nSo we would bring in those integration\npacks once we get them from Microsoft or\n\n399\n00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.530\na third party vendor,\nwhere ever they're gonna be.\n\n400\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.740\nAnd then once we got that,\nwe'll be able to load those up, be able to\n\n401\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.780\nadd them in here, and then run through,\nand integrate them or import them.\n\n402\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.180\nWhen we then deploy them, we have\nthe second wizard that allows us to\n\n403\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.233\nwalk through the steps to\ndeploy the integration packs,\n\n404\n00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:01.120\nwe'd obviously have to integrate them and\nadd them in first.\n\n405\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.070\nWe would see the integration packs\nthat we'd loaded up using the prior\n\n406\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.670\nwizard here.\n\n407\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.080\nWe would then highlight them,\nand then deploy them out.\n\n408\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.082\nAnd we would then be able to use them,\nonce that's done,\n\n409\n00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:13.160\nwe then would be able to go in and\nuse the Runbook Designer.\n\n410\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.840\nWe would see the additional\nintegration pack activities, and\n\n411\n00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.430\nwe'd be able to use them here.\n\n412\n00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.270\nAnd be able to create the work flows\nas needed to be able to drive whatever\n\n413\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.196\nRunbook Design we would like to do.\n\n414\n00:21:23.196 --> 00:21:26.921\nSo, once we have all that set up,\nwe're then able to interact with,\n\n415\n00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:30.409\nin this case you can see,\nthe Runbook Design server right here.\n\n416\n00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:34.290\nAnd we'd be able to go in and\nbe able to configure and use it.\n\n417\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.080\nAnd we showed you that\nin the other console.\n\n418\n00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.540\nBut I just wanna show you here\nwe do have deployment logs so\n\n419\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.320\nwe could see what's going on\nwith the deployments we stage.\n\n420\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.590\nCan right-click on the server and\nsee those, and\n\n421\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.070\nwe have properties here, really nothing\nto speak of that we can set up.\n\n422\n00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.470\nBut you'll see we have the name\nof the server, what it is.\n\n423\n00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.470\nAnd we have the Runbook Designer, and\nwe could see the install version.\n\n424\n00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.860\nSometimes you have to go in and\nsee what version you're running.\n\n425\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.540\nThis is one of the ways you could tell the\nversion, so we're able to see that here.\n\n426\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.850\nWe're also able to go in and see\nthe runbook server right from here, and\n\n427\n00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.660\nreally same kind of thing uninstall,\nview the deployment logs,\n\n428\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.760\nlook at properties of the server.\n\n429\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.530\nSame thing really just see the build\nnumber, and the version, and\n\n430\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.490\nthe install date here.\n\n431\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.370\nNothing more than that, but it does\nallow us to work with the product and\n\n432\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.520\ninteract with it to be able to\nbring in the integration pack, so\n\n433\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.380\njust wanna make sure you\nguys are able to see that.\n\n434\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.220\nLet's go in, and let's do one other\nthing here really quickly, oops.\n\n435\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.170\nJust see if I can get that to hit\nthe right area, get that taskbar back up.\n\n436\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.350\nThere we go, so let's just go in here.\n\n437\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.478\nLet's go over to IIS real quick,\nsee what's going on with our website.\n\n438\n00:22:35.478 --> 00:22:38.350\nSo we could see whether or not that\nwas actually set up the right way.\n\n439\n00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.660\nAnd it's running,\nwe didn't get an error on the install, so\n\n440\n00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.540\nwe would assume that that should be up and\nrunning and functional.\n\n441\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.530\nAnd let's just take a look,\nwe'll make this full size here so\n\n442\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.100\nwe could see what's going on.\n\n443\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.710\nLet's just move that over, oops,\n\n444\n00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.190\nsee if we can catch that just\nmove that over a little bit.\n\n445\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.370\nAnd if we move it all the way over,\nwe'll see we do have our default website.\n\n446\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.120\nWe do have our system center\nOrchestrator web service and\n\n447\n00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.460\nOrchestration console sites.\n\n448\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.290\nSo the sites are all there, does look\nlike it is fine, we could see it here.\n\n449\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.780\nWe could see the Settings of it.\n\n450\n00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.470\nLet's just go in and make sure we don't\nhave anything funky going on with\n\n451\n00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:17.160\nAuthentication, and it looks like we\ndo have Windows Authentication Label.\n\n452\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.640\nWe should be able to get in there.\n\n453\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.340\nLet's just go ahead and although we\nwould never normally wanna do this,\n\n454\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.050\nlet's just enable Anonymous\nAuthentication, make sure we can connect.\n\n455\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.919\nAnd make sure there's nothing\ngoing on that's wrong,\n\n456\n00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:28.398\njust from a troubleshooting perspective.\n\n457\n00:23:28.398 --> 00:23:32.408\nAnd let's make sure that's fine, and then\nlet's see if that changes anything for\n\n458\n00:23:32.408 --> 00:23:32.934\nus or not.\n\n459\n00:23:32.934 --> 00:23:35.998\nSo let's go in here and\nlet's go in and see, and\n\n460\n00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:40.790\nalso let's just restart that real\nquick before we do anything else.\n\n461\n00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.600\nJust to make sure we don't\nhave any issues with that.\n\n462\n00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.000\nSo we'll take that down,\nbring that back up real quick,\n\n463\n00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.530\nlittle real-time troubleshooting for you.\n\n464\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we add value at IT Pro TV,\n\n465\n00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:50.142\nevery time we do something.\n\n466\n00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:51.960\nAnd this is the kind of stuff that\nhappens in the real world, right.\n\n467\n00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.225\nYou may go to connect and you may think\nit's fine, cuz it looks like it installed\n\n468\n00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:58.320\nfine, and it may not come up, and you\ngotta go in and you gotta check it out.\n\n469\n00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.933\nSo just gonna do a quick refresh here.\n\n470\n00:23:59.933 --> 00:24:01.840\nMake sure everything is good.\n\n471\n00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.050\nThen let's go ahead and\nlet's see if we can actually connect out.\n\n472\n00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.280\nLet's do a quick browse and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n473\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.980\nSee if we can connect and\nget that to come up.\n\n474\n00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.160\nIf it registered my click for\nthe browser, it may not have.\n\n475\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.650\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n476\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.820\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; There it goes.\n\n477\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.760\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nThere it is right there.\n\n478\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.730\nAnd there we go, right.\n\n479\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.200\nSo you see now, we've got our prompt for\nSilverlight, so\n\n480\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.880\nthat looks like it is working.\n\n481\n00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.430\nLet's just go ahead and\ninstall that real quick.\n\n482\n00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.960\nYou saw me do this for\nthe other console, remember?\n\n483\n00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.200\nWe had to install Silverlight.\n\n484\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.560\nSometimes you need to do that.\n\n485\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.654\nAnd so that may have just been the issue\nthe first time, we didn't get the prompt.\n\n486\n00:24:36.654 --> 00:24:38.312\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then once I went ahead and\n\n487\n00:24:38.312 --> 00:24:41.900\nrestarted it, you could see here that it\nis gonna come up here with no trouble.\n\n488\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.470\nSo let's just go ahead and install that.\n\n489\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.240\nAnd just put Silverlight in real quick,\nshould get that up and\n\n490\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.520\nrunning in just a moment here.\n\n491\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.710\nThis was for the app control,\nyou remember we did that demo earlier and\n\n492\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.400\nthen we actually had to put Silverlight\nand then we're able to get in the console.\n\n493\n00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.970\nSo that could be the same\nthing that's going on here.\n\n494\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.990\nSo let's just go ahead.\n\n495\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.850\nLet's refresh that, and\njust get that out of the way, and\n\n496\n00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.060\nthen we can see our console's\ncoming up with no trouble.\n\n497\n00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.440\nCuz we already installed,\nwe don't have to actually reinstall.\n\n498\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.690\nSo glad I just hit Browse like two or\nthree times and it stacked up all the tabs\n\n499\n00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.460\nbefore I realized it was-\n&gt;&gt; Just to remind us that it's\n\n500\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.000\nthere, right?\n\n501\n00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly,\ncuz if one is good, three is better.\n\n502\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.770\nSo that's always good.\n\n503\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.690\nSo it takes a moment to\nload the first time.\n\n504\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.300\nYou can see it's kind of doing its thing.\n\n505\n00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.990\nAnd that eventually, once it does come up,\nwe should be able to get in.\n\n506\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.630\nWhat do we got there?\n\n507\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.620\nDebug, resource strings unavailable.\n\n508\n00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.720\nOkay, no big deal.\n\n509\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.480\nThat should allow us to get install,\naccess is denied.\n\n510\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.010\nAll right.\n\n511\n00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.920\nIt's looks like we still\nhave a permission issue.\n\n512\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.800\nBut we got the console up and running.\n\n513\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.800\nWhat would probably need to happen at this\npoint, a restart will typically deal with\n\n514\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.040\nthese issues, we may be having\na problem just because the service\n\n515\n00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.760\nis not fully instantiated, there may be\nsomething going on behind the scenes.\n\n516\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.500\nWe restart and\n\n517\n00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.670\nthen bring the console up, usually it\nclears that problem up with no trouble.\n\n518\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.940\nBut you could see that it's not\ntoo hard to troubleshoot that and\n\n519\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.960\nget that up and running.\n\n520\n00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.350\nWe just have to do a restart.\n\n521\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:00.290\nChances are good we do that,\nconsole will connect with no trouble and\n\n522\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.520\nwe'll be able to take a look at it and\ninteract with it.\n\n523\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.620\nSo not gonna, we're gonna spare you\nthe interest, the waiting on that.\n\n524\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.730\nYou'll just assume and\n\n525\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.630\ntrust me on this one that if you\nrestart it will work with no trouble.\n\n526\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.770\nBut we'll call that one good.\n\n527\n00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.440\nYou saw how everything gets installed and\ncomes up.\n\n528\n00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.390\nOnce we're done with orchestrator\ngonna restart the system, tee it up.\n\n529\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.190\nWe're actually gonna go in,\nlast demo that we're gonna do for ya,\n\n530\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.490\nand we're actually gonna\ninstall service level manager.\n\n531\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:28.020\nYou're gonna get a chance to see how that\ngets set up and stood up and configured.\n\n532\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.690\nAnd then once we're done with that, well\nwho knows what we're gonna do then cuz\n\n533\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:35.200\nwe've got this crazy guy standing next me,\nhe's got all sorts of crazy ideas so\n\n534\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.280\nwe can go ahead and do for you.\n\n535\n00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.810\nBut I think what we'll probably\nwind up doing if I'm not mistaken\n\n536\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.310\nis just talking more about SCOM.\n\n537\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We use that to do cloud based\n\n538\n00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.590\nmanagement services.\n\n539\n00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well,\nwe love the SCOM, right?\n\n540\n00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.240\nIt's an amazing product, and that's why\nwe're all here, to learn more about it.\n\n541\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.620\nAnd we do thank you for dropping by and\n\n542\n00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.960\nhelping us understand how\nto install Orchestrator.\n\n543\n00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.570\nIt's a very nice product, and\n\n544\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.030\neven giving us a test drive\naround the system a little bit.\n\n545\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.930\nSee kind how it works, so\nat least at a high level view over that.\n\n546\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.740\nLike I said thanks for dropping by,\nit looks like it's that time for\n\n547\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.890\nus to sign off.\n\n548\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.586\nThanks for watching for ITProTV,\nI have been

00:00:08.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.038\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:14.033\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.475\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:20.576\nI'm you host Daniel Lowrie and today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n8\n00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:23.366\nconfiguring and\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.418\nAnd of course,\njoining us back in the studio yet again,\n\n10\n00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:28.275\nto learn his expertise on that very topic,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:29.909\nAdam, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:30.736\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:33.492\n&gt;&gt; Pleasure as always, pleasure as always.\n\n14\n00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:37.785\nGlad to be here talking with you,\ncontinuing our roll through our\n\n15\n00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:41.230\nimplementation/installation\ndemonstrations.\n\n16\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.890\nThat's a mouthful right there.\n\n17\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.347\nWe're gonna take up a Data Protection\nManager this particular episode.\n\n18\n00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:49.227\nWe're gonna show you how\nto get that up and running.\n\n19\n00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.676\nBuild out, or continue to build out,\n\n20\n00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.079\nall the supporting cast of\ncharacters around Systems Center,\n\n21\n00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.910\nsurrounding SCOM with all the elements\nnecessary to make it successful.\n\n22\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.593\nData Protection Manager is going\nto be the enterprise backup and\n\n23\n00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:06.620\ndata recovery product that Microsoft has\nas part of the Systems Center suite.\n\n24\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.650\nThink of Backup Exec, think Oxer, think\nwhatever you may be using in the real\n\n25\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.509\nworld that is your equivalent of\nan enterprise level back-up solution.\n\n26\n00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.340\nThat's what DPM is for us here.\n\n27\n00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.592\nWe're gonna walk through how\nto do the install for you.\n\n28\n00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:23.160\nI'm gonna show you a quick\nlittle bonus extra added special\n\n29\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.470\nitem that we talked about at\nthe very end of our last episode.\n\n30\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.820\nIf you haven't watched that one on how\nto stand up SCOM get it configured,\n\n31\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.370\nwe did the full install there.\n\n32\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.373\nWe did do our reboot on the machine\nalthough I didn't show you that at the end\n\n33\n00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:38.614\nof the episode just to make sure as we've\nbeen talking about we're ready to do our\n\n34\n00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:39.249\nnext install.\n\n35\n00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.826\nRemember, if we're gonna be combining\nmultiple rows on a single server,\n\n36\n00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:48.695\nwe're gonna wanna do reboots in between\nto make sure the installs will set up and\n\n37\n00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.070\nstack properly.\n\n38\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060\nWe've done that, and what I wanted to show\nyou just before we get started with DPM,\n\n39\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.409\nis what happens once you get SCOM up and\nrunning.\n\n40\n00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.250\nWe walked through the council with you.\n\n41\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.561\nWhat I really did not\nshow you in that episode,\n\n42\n00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:03.904\nwas what the PowerShell commandments look\nlike in the Ops manager PowerShell module.\n\n43\n00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:05.885\nSo I thought I would start\nwith that little quick,\n\n44\n00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:08.385\nif you wanna take a look even if\nyou don't just close your eyes,\n\n45\n00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:10.560\npretend you're not looking\nit doesn't matter.\n\n46\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.631\nWe're to get to the DPM install here\nin just a minute we got that set up.\n\n47\n00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:19.560\nBut I brought up the Ops\nmanager PowerShell Console 4.\n\n48\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.195\nYou see that's running.\n\n49\n00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.987\nYou'll see it is right here.\n\n50\n00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:25.083\nSo this is the ops manager variant for\nPowerShell,\n\n51\n00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.580\nnot the actual normal PowerShell.\n\n52\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.845\nI did modify and I do in my\ndemonstrations modify PowerShell, so\n\n53\n00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.361\nthat you could see it better.\n\n54\n00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:36.256\nSo just to understand, when you go look it\nup and bring it up, it's not gonna start\n\n55\n00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:40.210\nup and look white with a blue back, or\nrather a white background with blue text.\n\n56\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.206\nUnless you modify the console permanently,\nbut I do that cuz it's easier for\n\n57\n00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:43.951\nyou guys to see it.\n\n58\n00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:48.058\nIt will start up and look like the\nstandard PowerShell, it'll be black, look\n\n59\n00:02:48.058 --> 00:02:52.490\nlike a DOS shell, with the white text,\nso just don't get thrown off by that.\n\n60\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.076\nNow, all I did was to you to see all the\ncommand list that are installed here in\n\n61\n00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:56.705\nthe module.\n\n62\n00:02:56.705 --> 00:03:02.690\nI just issued the git commands\ncommand you'll see that right here.\n\n63\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.930\nJust highlight that for you, and by doing\nthat, it just echos back to the shell\n\n64\n00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.120\nin the console for all the commands but\nthere are very large number of them.\n\n65\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.250\nAnd you may not be able to\nkeep up with all of them and\n\n66\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.910\nactually see what all of them are.\n\n67\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.980\nSo instead of just doing them to\nthe shell, what I thought would be good is\n\n68\n00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.632\nquickly let you see how we actually\nare gonna be able to take this.\n\n69\n00:03:24.632 --> 00:03:28.109\nAnd how we're actually gonna be able to\noutput the content of the git command\n\n70\n00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:28.609\ncommand.\n\n71\n00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.140\nSo I usually git command, I output it to\na string wherever I wanna put it in this\n\n72\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.302\ncase, I just created a directory and\n\n73\n00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:39.419\nthen we're gonna see drive called\nSCOM I'll create a folder called or\n\n74\n00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:44.150\nfile rather called Commandlets.txt and\nonce I do this and I hit Enter.\n\n75\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.124\nI'm then able to, Output that and\n\n76\n00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:53.655\nonce I've done that if I go and\nI take a look real quick,\n\n77\n00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:58.303\nI'll see that In the c drive,\nlet's just go to c drive.\n\n78\n00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:02.300\nWe have our scum folder,\nwe have our Commandlets stat TXT file.\n\n79\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.130\nNow, it is almost 400 kilo bits,\nyou been now wanna open that, in notepad.\n\n80\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.560\nYou may wanna take that,\nand try to open a new Word.\n\n81\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.690\nOr Word pad, and then another it's gonna\nbe able to deal with that larger size\n\n82\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.970\na little bit more efficiently.\n\n83\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.683\nBut, it will give you a working\nlist of all the Commandlets, and\n\n84\n00:04:15.683 --> 00:04:18.409\nhelp you then to start working\nthrough them to see what they are.\n\n85\n00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.370\nAnd gives you a nice way to be able to\nparse really quickly and search for\n\n86\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.950\none if you're not familiar with or\nnot sure as to what it maybe.\n\n87\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.010\nYou can look it up to see\nwhether it's there or not.\n\n88\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.410\nYou could do the same thing in Ice,\nby the way.\n\n89\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.064\nSo we've talked about Ice before, and\n\n90\n00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:33.528\nyou certainly could do that\nthere as well if you wanted to.\n\n91\n00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:37.188\nRemember, Ice may or not be installed\nby default you may have to go in and\n\n92\n00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:39.570\ngrab that and\ninteract with that separately.\n\n93\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.260\nSo all we did was just set that up, now I\nparked that little shortcut down here for\n\n94\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.385\nus on the task bar.\n\n95\n00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:49.945\nAnd in case you're not familiar how to do\nthat ,I just went in to the work space\n\n96\n00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.292\nthe start work space.\n\n97\n00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:55.604\nI went in, and notice I put them here on\nthe start work space as well because I\n\n98\n00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:57.390\nalready set them up there.\n\n99\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.680\nBut those tiles are not gonna be there by\ndefault instead what I did is I went down\n\n100\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.180\nhere in to my app work space and\nsimply just scrolled over.\n\n101\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.787\nFound the area for system center 2012\nwhere the the install is, ops console,\n\n102\n00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:16.391\nops manager shell, right click on each one\none at a time,it will say pin to start,\n\n103\n00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:20.370\npin to task bar because I've already\npinned them there it says unpin.\n\n104\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.914\nAll I did was just delete each one at\na time, get the short cut then I launch it\n\n105\n00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:27.401\nright from there, just see you can set\nyourself up you have all the items in\n\n106\n00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.880\nthe place where you want them to be and\nit's easy to work with them.\n\n107\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.235\nIf you're gonna be looking for ISE and\nsee whether or not it's installed,\n\n108\n00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:36.113\nyou could do a quick search for ISE there.\n\n109\n00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:39.983\nYou'll see that we do have Windows\nPowerShell ISE and we can go ahead and\n\n110\n00:05:39.983 --> 00:05:43.336\nwe can load that up and we can then,\nif you've never seen ISE,\n\n111\n00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:45.780\nlet's just bring this in real quick.\n\n112\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.840\nRun this as an administrator one time.\n\n113\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.733\nJust see you can quickly\nget a sense to this.\n\n114\n00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:54.398\nIt does start up looking like this in\ncase again you may or may not with it, or\n\n115\n00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:57.600\nyou can simply pull this\nlittle button right here.\n\n116\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.970\nCould go go full screen for a second.\n\n117\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.780\nJust you could see this\na little bit easier.\n\n118\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.500\nJust go ahead and click on that,\nand it will open up for you.\n\n119\n00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.963\nI love my mouse that is what I\nkeep saying myself there, we go.\n\n120\n00:06:06.963 --> 00:06:11.467\nIt will allow you to see, a work space\nwhere you can actually type in the various\n\n121\n00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:15.359\nlines of the PowerShell commandlets and\nscripts you wanna create,\n\n122\n00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.090\nwithout executing them.\n\n123\n00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.330\nBut working on them, editing them,\n\n124\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.600\ndebugging whatever you need to do,\nyou could then execute them from up here.\n\n125\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.797\nYou'll see the output down here.\n\n126\n00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:26.730\nSo you can work with different areas and\nyou can modify this view as needed.\n\n127\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.050\nBut the reason I brought this up and\n\n128\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.090\nthe reason this is nice is that we can\ngo in and we can search by module.\n\n129\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.620\nAnd we could pull down\nhere on the right and\n\n130\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.016\nwe can actually see that we can search.\n\n131\n00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:39.270\nAnd if we can scroll down,\n\n132\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.810\nwe could see a list of all the modules\nthat are here in PowerShell.\n\n133\n00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.926\nAnd we can scroll through and search for\n\n134\n00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:48.725\ncommandlets that maybe available\nby whatever module we have loaded.\n\n135\n00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:51.318\nNow, remember this is going to be ISE for\n\n136\n00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:54.460\nthe normal PowerShell\nfunction of the machine.\n\n137\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.700\nThis is not the operations manager shell.\n\n138\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.320\nSo as the result as we scroll\nthrough here right we go back up.\n\n139\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.364\nWe would have to choose the ops\nmanager modules specifically, so\n\n140\n00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.949\nwe can search for those modules, right?\n\n141\n00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.538\nSo we could choose that here and\nthen we will see all the module Cmdlets,\n\n142\n00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:16.510\nall the ones that are loaded\nwith this particular module.\n\n143\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.084\nWe'll see them all here.\n\n144\n00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:20.223\nAnd this is essentially what we got\non the output of that list we just\n\n145\n00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:21.400\ncreated, right?\n\n146\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.581\nAnd we can actually bring all these up.\n\n147\n00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.200\nNow the nice thing about this is\nwe can choose any one of these.\n\n148\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.280\nLet's just randomly choose one.\n\n149\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.210\nLet's go in and do adscom run as\nagent account, or run as account, and\n\n150\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.050\nit will tell us a little bit about it.\n\n151\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.300\nIt shows us what it is.\n\n152\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.020\nIt says to import the ops\nmanager module and\n\n153\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.200\nits commandlets including blah blah blah,\nclick show details\n\n154\n00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.330\nyou have to bring it in because remember\nit's not loaded into PowerShell normally.\n\n155\n00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.386\nSo we're seeing the module\nbecause it's on the machine, but\n\n156\n00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.735\nwe're not actually working with it\nunless we actually import it and\n\n157\n00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:56.633\nbring it in because these are two distinct\ndifferent versions of PowerShell.\n\n158\n00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:59.946\nOne is the normal PowerShell Install for\nthe machine,\n\n159\n00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.990\nthe other is the shell\nspecific ops manager.\n\n160\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.200\nAnd so we just wanna make sure,\nyou're familiar with that.\n\n161\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.200\nSo if we click Show details, it will\nbring it in so we can interact with it.\n\n162\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.206\nAnd then we can see, all the parameters\nthat are available to us.\n\n163\n00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:15.584\nAnd we can see all\nthe information about it, and\n\n164\n00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:17.380\nwe could start to interact with it.\n\n165\n00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.650\nSo ISE is a very powerful tool\nin general for PowerShell.\n\n166\n00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.140\nBut as an editor specially,\nit gives us additional abilities here and\n\n167\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.790\ngives us the ability to\ninteract with search for\n\n168\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.660\ncommandments, find out how to set them up,\nwhat the parameters are to use with them.\n\n169\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.294\nSo we don't have to go out and\nlook for all these on the web.\n\n170\n00:08:36.294 --> 00:08:39.696\nSo I just wanted you to see that\nas we're getting started here and\n\n171\n00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:43.670\ngetting ready to interact with DPM I\njust thought it would be a value to you.\n\n172\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.373\nAll right so we're to close this out,\nwe're gonna go in.\n\n173\n00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:51.133\nNow what I've done is I've started the DPM\nthe Data Protection Manager setup,\n\n174\n00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:53.279\nbecause we're gonna get an error.\n\n175\n00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.264\nAnd I wanna show you what\nthat error looks like and\n\n176\n00:08:55.264 --> 00:08:57.650\nhow to deal with it the first\ntime we do the install.\n\n177\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.070\nWe're doing an all in one install again\nwe're using the local SQL Server instance\n\n178\n00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.160\non this box,\nSQL is installed locally on this machine,\n\n179\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.280\nand that's what we're using for our demos.\n\n180\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.461\nSo as a result we have a pre-rack or\n\n181\n00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:13.084\nessentially dependency if you\nwill that has to be there.\n\n182\n00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:16.468\nAnd that is gonna be the,\nwhat is the S-I-S the SIS\n\n183\n00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:21.280\nfilter that we're gonna have to\ninstall it's not there by default.\n\n184\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.560\nWhen we do an all in one install and\nwe use the standalone SQL Server instance\n\n185\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.090\nthat's not clustered on this box,\nwe get this issue.\n\n186\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.313\nAnd so this is expected I just wanted\nyou to see this you run the install,\n\n187\n00:09:32.313 --> 00:09:32.916\nwe get this.\n\n188\n00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:37.496\nThe pre req actually does get installed,\nbut it errors out now and says, hey okay,\n\n189\n00:09:37.496 --> 00:09:38.230\nI did that.\n\n190\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.468\nBut, since I did that, you gotta\nessentially come back and try again.\n\n191\n00:09:41.468 --> 00:09:42.950\nSo, no big deal.\n\n192\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.522\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n193\n00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:45.520\nWe're gonna cancel out of\nof this at the bottom.\n\n194\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.271\nLet me just drag this back up, so\nyou can see the Cancel button down there.\n\n195\n00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:51.200\nWe were to cancel out of this install.\n\n196\n00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.660\nAnd once we've cancelled,\nwe're then going to go ahead,\n\n197\n00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.890\nwe're gonna restart the box and\nwe're then gonna clear that error.\n\n198\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.400\nSo when we rerun this setup,\n\n199\n00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.870\nwe're actually then gonna be able to go\nthrough and complete it without a concern.\n\n200\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.780\nSo I'm gonna do that as\nsoon as we come back,\n\n201\n00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.880\ncuz you're gonna not want do that but\nassume it's gonna get done.\n\n202\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.280\nAs soon as we come back we're\ngonna be up ready to go and\n\n203\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.270\nwe're gonna actually have the install\nset up again, the wizard running.\n\n204\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.205\nWe're gonna run through this time this\ntime it'll actually be successful.\n\n205\n00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:22.768\nSo stay tuned for\nthat come back in just one second.\n\n206\n00:10:22.768 --> 00:10:24.925\nAll right, so\nwe're back from our restart and\n\n207\n00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.650\nyou could see what I did is I\njust brought back up the media.\n\n208\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.755\nAnd I wanted to show you this one\nin particular cuz DPM is a little\n\n209\n00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:30.968\nbit different than all the others.\n\n210\n00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:35.520\nAll the other media we've looked at,\nthe VMM, the app controller, ops manager.\n\n211\n00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.700\nYou go right in there's a set up MSI or\nEXC sitting right in the root.\n\n212\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.856\nDPM is a little bit of\na different structure.\n\n213\n00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:43.110\nIf could zoom in for just a second,\n\n214\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.040\ngo full screen to see we\nhave two folders there.\n\n215\n00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.239\nAnd we're to go in to SCDPM or\nData Protection Manager.\n\n216\n00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:50.665\nWe'll then scroll down and\n\n217\n00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:54.480\nunderneath there at the bottom\nwe'll see our set up application.\n\n218\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.004\nRight click, run that as admin.\n\n219\n00:10:56.004 --> 00:11:01.020\nWe're gonna get our little start up\nlaunch page of splash screen 12 R2.\n\n220\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.885\nWe're gonna then do our\ndata protection install,\n\n221\n00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:07.559\nwe'll accept our EULA this is\ngonna be fairly straightforward.\n\n222\n00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:10.617\nIt runs a quick little set up check for\nus, and\n\n223\n00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:15.540\nthen as soon as that's done,\nwe're gonna get back to our prereq check.\n\n224\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.456\nSo we'll see this in just a moment.\n\n225\n00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:21.385\nThis is where we had advanced through\nin the first go round just to show\n\n226\n00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:22.470\nyou the error.\n\n227\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.990\nSo I had preloaded all this so you didn't\nhave to worry about seeing it all happen.\n\n228\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.050\nCuz we're gonna show it\nto you this time and so\n\n229\n00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.650\nnow once we deal with that error and\nwe're starting.\n\n230\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.070\nWe're gonna start with our welcome screen.\n\n231\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.890\nWe'll click Next,\nwe'll then doing a pre rec check.\n\n232\n00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.261\nWe're gonna used our\nstand alone SQL Server.\n\n233\n00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:38.820\nThat's why we were,\nlast time if you remember.\n\n234\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.782\nWe had loaded in our credential.\n\n235\n00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:43.640\nRun the pre req check found\nthe SIS filter error.\n\n236\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.310\nDealt with that through the restart.\n\n237\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.220\nWe're now good to go.\n\n238\n00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.130\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nput this back in.\n\n239\n00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.705\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nspecify here you stand alone SQL server.\n\n240\n00:11:51.705 --> 00:11:56.236\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna put\nin the instance name that we're using.\n\n241\n00:11:56.236 --> 00:12:02.935\nSo I'm just gonna type that in,\nthe plasy or sys sysbuild01 MS SQL server.\n\n242\n00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:07.085\nSo we've got all that, we're then gonna go\nahead, we're just gonna tab through there.\n\n243\n00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:08.965\nWe'll get our little hey,\nare you ready to check and\n\n244\n00:12:08.965 --> 00:12:11.175\nmake sure you're good to do your install?\n\n245\n00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.875\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncheck and install.\n\n246\n00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:16.472\nNow it says set up or use per user's\ncredentials for the SQL instance.\n\n247\n00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:20.752\nSo, that's what we're doing, that's why\nwe're not providing a credential here.\n\n248\n00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:22.380\nI'm gonna click check and install.\n\n249\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.420\nWe'll give that a second.\n\n250\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.370\nThis is what we ran prior to the last\ntime we did this to see that we would\n\n251\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.450\nhave that capability or\nthat error that may or may not come up.\n\n252\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.476\nLooks like we're good.\n\n253\n00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:36.735\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nit says, and if you zoom in,\n\n254\n00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:40.360\nyou could probably see it here real quick\nwe'll just go for a screen for a second.\n\n255\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.811\nThis time instead of\nthe error what do we get?\n\n256\n00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:46.960\nThis computer meets, the Software and\nHardware requirements for DPM.\n\n257\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.740\nSo this time we've dealt with that,\n\n258\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.310\nwe no longer have that issue\nwith the SIS filter dependency.\n\n259\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.996\nSo we're gonna be able to move past\nthat getting the product registration.\n\n260\n00:12:54.996 --> 00:12:59.476\nWe're gonna click Next here we're\ngonna be asked for username,\n\n261\n00:12:59.476 --> 00:13:03.180\nwe'll put that in do administrator here.\n\n262\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.572\nWe're going to go ahead assuming\nthat is spelled correctly and\n\n263\n00:13:08.572 --> 00:13:11.532\nwe'll do practice labs for this.\n\n264\n00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:14.950\nAnd then we have our product key here,\nwe're gonna go ahead,\n\n265\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.740\nwe actually have our product key for\nthis particular install.\n\n266\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.560\nI have it here, so we're just gonna\nuse a product key for this one.\n\n267\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.580\nUnlike some of the prior ones we have done\nwhere we've just done this in eval mode\n\n268\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.000\nthought we'd for\na little curved ball in there.\n\n269\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.017\nPut our product key in.\n\n270\n00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:32.417\nDon't try to use that product key in home\nblizzard girls because that's just for\n\n271\n00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:34.280\ndemonstration purposes, all right?\n\n272\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.209\nSo, we're gonna click Next there,\ngive that just a second.\n\n273\n00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:37.715\nWe're then gonna go ahead,\n\n274\n00:13:37.715 --> 00:13:41.615\nmove pass that, we'll see that we\nthen have our install setting screen.\n\n275\n00:13:41.615 --> 00:13:45.300\nPretty straight forward, just our\nstandard defaults, what's our program,\n\n276\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.205\ninstall direct it gonna be, what's our\ndrive space look like, what's required,\n\n277\n00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:50.160\nthings like that.\n\n278\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.667\nWe're gonna click Next, or\nwe gonna use Microsoft Update.\n\n279\n00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.970\nWe've talked about this in the real world,\nright?\n\n280\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.685\nAre we gonna need to do the updates?\n\n281\n00:13:58.685 --> 00:14:00.620\nYes, absolutely.\n\n282\n00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.100\nBut for purposes of our demonstration here\nwe're not gonna bother with the updates,\n\n283\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.110\nbut in the real world we\ndefinitely wanna be doing that.\n\n284\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.250\nWe'll click Next.\n\n285\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.090\nAre we gonna do the customer feedback?\n\n286\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.944\nAgain in the real world,\nimportant for you to do that here,\n\n287\n00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:16.158\nwe'll deal with that later then\nwe get our summary pretty simple.\n\n288\n00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:19.540\nJust go ahead and click Install,\nwe're gonna let that do its thing.\n\n289\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.951\nIt's going to cook for a couple minutes.\n\n290\n00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.770\nWhen we'll come back, we'll actually\ntake a look at it being done.\n\n291\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.980\nWe'll open up the console.\n\n292\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.590\nMake sure everything is working for you.\n\n293\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.520\nSo please come on back and\n\n294\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.000\nsee us in just a couple of minutes,\nwe'll have that all set up for you.\n\n295\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.490\nAll right, so you could see we\nfinished up our Data Manager,\n\n296\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.065\nData Protection Manager install.\n\n297\n00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:37.770\nJust brings down just a smidge so\nyou could see that.\n\n298\n00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.751\nYou'll see that we are successful, got\na little green check unlike the others.\n\n299\n00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:45.050\nNo green circle, wide check Switched it\nup on this one, no circle, green check.\n\n300\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Who needs consistency?\n\n301\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.520\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love those guys at Microsoft.\n\n302\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.240\nThey're always thinking\nabout ways to totally-\n\n303\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.848\n&gt;&gt; One team built this and\n\n304\n00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:50.844\nanother team built the other thing.\n\n305\n00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:52.890\n&gt;&gt; Confound and confuse.\n\n306\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.034\n&gt;&gt; One like one, the other like the other.\n\n307\n00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:55.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; That's how they work.\n\n308\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.316\n&gt;&gt; Now, just wanna show you let's go full\nscreen for me for just one second, so\n\n309\n00:14:58.316 --> 00:14:59.671\nwe could see this link right down here.\n\n310\n00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:03.898\nSo it does say, hey, by the way, if you\nwanna click on this link to see the latest\n\n311\n00:15:03.898 --> 00:15:07.140\nDPM updates, click there to be\nable to go out and take a look.\n\n312\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.410\nSo if there is an information you can go\nout to the web assume you can connect\n\n313\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.760\nto the course,\nyou'll be able to find that.\n\n314\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.797\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclick Close I will let that finish up.\n\n315\n00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:17.585\nNow, we do get a little check for\nupdate thing,\n\n316\n00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:20.390\nit's running in the background\nautomatically from Microsoft.\n\n317\n00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.240\nNo big deal, we're not gonna bother with\nthat we're just gonna close that out cuz\n\n318\n00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.057\nwe know then the real world\nwould be important here,\n\n319\n00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.820\nwe're not gonna bother with that,\nwe're good.\n\n320\n00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.584\nSo, now that we've got that done,\nwe'll just gonna come over here and\n\n321\n00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:34.475\nwe'll see that we have two console\nshortcuts let me just moved this down so\n\n322\n00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.890\nyou could see this.\n\n323\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.661\nBecause that one is kinda long and I\nactually I'll pull it over on the side and\n\n324\n00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:41.519\nhere you could see it right in the middle\nof the screen not that helped much cause\n\n325\n00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.931\nit's so dark it's kinda hard to see.\n\n326\n00:15:42.931 --> 00:15:45.791\nBut you could see it is\nthe DPM console shortcut and\n\n327\n00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:50.153\nthen we have our DPM management shell\nas well so you would have a PowerShell,\n\n328\n00:15:50.153 --> 00:15:53.378\nshell specific to DPM just\nlike we do in the ops manager.\n\n329\n00:15:53.378 --> 00:15:57.458\nAnd we have the console for DPM,\njust go ahead and open up the console for\n\n330\n00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.710\nDPM real quick.\n\n331\n00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.370\nMake sure that's gonna load for us.\n\n332\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.940\nWe could see that it does, and\n\n333\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.960\nyou could see that we now have\nan interface we can work with.\n\n334\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.199\nAgain, this is an enterprise level\nbackup and data management product, so\n\n335\n00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:10.284\nthis is gonna be where\nwe'll set up our backups.\n\n336\n00:16:10.284 --> 00:16:14.432\nWe'll be able to interact with and link\nthis to our private or public clouds, and\n\n337\n00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.290\nbe able to do our backups and\nmanage them from here.\n\n338\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.840\nSo this is an interesting product we could\ndo our monitoring, our protection, our\n\n339\n00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.690\nrecovery our reporting and are management\ntthrough the various workspaces.\n\n340\n00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.360\nAnd we can go in and make sure that\nwe've got all the things necessary for\n\n341\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.650\nus to be able to ensure the the BCDR,\n\n342\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.690\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery\ncapabilities are fully integrated\n\n343\n00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.840\ninto our cloud infrastructure using\nthe System Center suite of products.\n\n344\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.481\nAnd we're building out and continuing to\nbuild out that entire ring of products and\n\n345\n00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:44.666\nthe protection that they\nall afford each other and\n\n346\n00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.385\nthe interaction among them as\nwe continue to do our installs.\n\n347\n00:16:47.385 --> 00:16:50.765\nWe're gonna be coming back with another\nepisode I wanna invite you to take\n\n348\n00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:51.730\na look at that.\n\n349\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.459\nWe've actually got two more left to\nbe able to do the full install of\n\n350\n00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:56.279\nall the product suite\nmembers that we need.\n\n351\n00:16:56.279 --> 00:17:00.158\nWe're gonna be doing orchestrator and\nalso service level manager.\n\n352\n00:17:00.158 --> 00:17:02.158\nSo I wanna invite you to come back and\ntake a look at those, and\n\n353\n00:17:02.158 --> 00:17:03.582\nhopefully you'd do so very very quickly.\n\n354\n00:17:03.582 --> 00:17:05.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam,\nthanks for joining us today.\n\n355\n00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.690\nThanks for showing us how to install\nthe Data Protection Manager,\n\n356\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.580\nit seems to be a very interesting product.\n\n357\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.445\nSomething we may need in the future.\n\n358\n00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:16.830\n[LAUGH] That being said, we do thank you\nguys for watching us as well, the viewer.\n\n359\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.385\nBut it is time for us to sign

00:00:10.896\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:13.581\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:17.550\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.910\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and today's\nepisode we are looking at our configure\n\n7\n00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.810\nand deploy a, well private cloud.\n\n8\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.880\nThat's right and joining us back in\nthe studio yet again, our good friend,\n\n9\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.700\nour mentor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.830\nAdam welcome back so\nglad to have you yet again.\n\n11\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.108\nHow's it going?\nThat good.\n\n12\n00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:35.276\nThat's excellent.\n\n13\n00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:37.372\nHe's gonna pantomime\non this whole episode.\n\n14\n00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:41.964\n[LAUGH] And yes now SCOMs,\nso that's all he had to do.\n\n15\n00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:46.825\nIs go to the configuration console, click\nthat button, right click and [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:51.726\nWe can hear your bracelets jingling.\n\n17\n00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:55.620\n[LAUGH] There you go,\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're just playing around,\n\n18\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.670\nso we're gonna talk about how to\ninstall service level manager,\n\n19\n00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.940\nthis is the last of the episodes\ninvolved with demonstrating\n\n20\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.820\nhow to do the configuration installation\nand set up of all the key moving parts,\n\n21\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.210\nall the components associated with\nthe system center suite surrounding\n\n22\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.070\nSCOM with all the environmental\nattributes, values, things that\n\n23\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.590\nare gonna be required to make it healthy\nand allow it to work its magic for us.\n\n24\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800\nAnd service level manager's\ngonna be real important.\n\n25\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.970\nThis is our equivalent product of heat,\nremedy, service desk, service now.\n\n26\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.920\nAny of those products out there\nyou may be familiar with,\n\n27\n00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.160\nthat allow you to do ticketing, management\nand monitoring of your SLAs and use\n\n28\n00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.050\nof KPIs in order to be able to keep track\nof what's happening in the organization.\n\n29\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.570\nWe're gonna set this product up and\ndeploy it, we have gone ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.260\njust started the deployment off,\nrun the beginning steps of the wizard.\n\n31\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.770\nWalk through the hey let's\nget the information in there.\n\n32\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.630\nLet's accept the EULA,\nlet's check off we wanna do it as an eval,\n\n33\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.740\nlet's run the prereq check,\nmake sure all that's done.\n\n34\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.050\nAnd then once we do that,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n35\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.540\nclick next to be able to continue on.\n\n36\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.170\nIt did say by the way,\nyou cannot continue.\n\n37\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.600\nYou don't have enough memory.\n\n38\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.770\nBut this is just a demo environment.\n\n39\n00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.165\nWe're not worried about that.\n\n40\n00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:15.045\nIn the real world, we recommend at\nleast eight gigs of memory on the box.\n\n41\n00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:17.335\nWe're deploying it to\na VM with less than that.\n\n42\n00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:20.924\nNo problem, it'll work for purposes of\nwhat we're doing, but in case you saw that\n\n43\n00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.205\non the screen and then bothered to\nstop and actually sight see there.\n\n44\n00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:27.075\nBut if you saw that, caught wind of that,\ndon't worry about that.\n\n45\n00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:30.315\nIn the real world you wanna pay\nattention to those install requirements.\n\n46\n00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:33.375\nHere, we're going to fudge that a little\nbit and just pretend that didn't exist.\n\n47\n00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:35.834\nSo we do get a little configure\ndatabase warning here,\n\n48\n00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:40.460\nthe coalition specification for\nSQL is unsupported.\n\n49\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.300\nIt's warning us of that again.\n\n50\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.230\nIn the demo environment,\n\n51\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.430\na little bit different than what\nwe may do in the real world.\n\n52\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.220\nBut it's just telling us that we\nhave an unsupported SQL coalition\n\n53\n00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.020\nthought process here.\n\n54\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.190\nI think the one that we've selected is,\nthat's what it is.\n\n55\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.090\nWhatever the default is,\nthat was configured for\n\n56\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.120\nall the other installs we've been doing,\nis set up here.\n\n57\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.490\nWe'd modify that, but\nnormally not a problem.\n\n58\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.920\nWe'll click okay here.\n\n59\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.170\nWe'll then be able to wait for\nit to connect out to the instance.\n\n60\n00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.470\nYou could see it does, and\n\n61\n00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.600\nthen once we've done that we'll\nsee that the instance is there.\n\n62\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.740\nWhat's our database server,\nwhat's our default instance,\n\n63\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.350\nwhere are we installing etc.\n\n64\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.710\nSo we're gonna find all that, see that\nthere, we're then gonna go ahead, and\n\n65\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.370\nwe're gonna accept all of those defaults.\n\n66\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.070\nI just wanna point out, maybe we can\ngo full screen for just half a second.\n\n67\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.880\nJust to see this, point out\nthe default database name server,\n\n68\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.580\nmanager, service manager.\n\n69\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.620\nExcuse me, and our default instance,\nand our machine.\n\n70\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.110\nSo we're gonna do that, we're gonna click\nnext, and then it's gonna ask us for\n\n71\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.590\nour management group name.\n\n72\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.280\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nspecify our management group name.\n\n73\n00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.570\nRemember we would have already have\na management group name set up\n\n74\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.760\nfrom before, right?\n\n75\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.290\nSo, or we may have one, well may not it\ndepends on when we're installing this.\n\n76\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.110\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nput in a name for our management group.\n\n77\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.800\nWe'll call this practice labs.\n\n78\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.285\nIf we are going to use an existing one\nwe just need to know what it will be.\n\n79\n00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:02.685\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do this and\n\n80\n00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:06.335\nthe management group admin section who's\ngonna be involved with administering.\n\n81\n00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:08.665\nWe're gonna browse to set that up,\nso let's browse here,\n\n82\n00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.295\nwe give that just the second.\n\n83\n00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:13.535\nIt's gonna bring up a standard box\nprobably pretty familiar with if we've\n\n84\n00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:14.385\nbeen doing this.\n\n85\n00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.425\nWell we have to put in a user name.\n\n86\n00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:20.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ntype in administrator.\n\n87\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.520\nAnd we'll just check that to make\nsure that it finds it for us.\n\n88\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.660\nGives us two options there, notice that\nwe have the administrator's account and\n\n89\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.270\nnotice that we have\nthe administrator's group.\n\n90\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.550\nWe're gonna choose the administrator's\naccount up at the top, specify that,\n\n91\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.400\nget that little underline, telling us\nit's validated the name, we'll come back,\n\n92\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.640\nthat will be put in there.\n\n93\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.030\nCould have just typed in\npractice labs administrator but\n\n94\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.360\nyeah that's not as much fun and I have\nmore stuff to talk about cuz you know\n\n95\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.200\nwe do need to get out beyond\nthat 15 to 20 minute time marks.\n\n96\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.970\n&gt;&gt; We have to validate that guy that\ncoded in the fact that you can hit\n\n97\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.890\ncheck names and underlines and\nvalidates if that works.\n\n98\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Well we got to make sure he\nfeels like he's working is-\n\n99\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he did something.\n\n100\n00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.400\n&gt;&gt; And valuable, we got to make\nsure we take advantage of the-\n\n101\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Actually really love that future,\n\n102\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.360\nto be honest with you.\n\n103\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, cuz it does prevent\nyou from making stupid mistakes.\n\n104\n00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.770\nWhich is hey,\nI'm choosing a machine name, a user name,\n\n105\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.160\na group name that isn't correct,\nisn't recognized.\n\n106\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.260\nYou get all the way through and it dies\non you halfway through the install.\n\n107\n00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.680\nAnd those are the good old days.\n\n108\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.320\n&gt;&gt; Look, I put adminstrader.\n\n109\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that can happen, that can happen.\n\n110\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.460\nDoes happen, has happened,\nwill happen I'm sure.\n\n111\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.990\nAll right.\n\n112\n00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.930\nSo I'm going to configure the account for\nservice management services.\n\n113\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.450\nWe're going to use a domain,\nas opposed to a local service account.\n\n114\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.520\nSo we're going to click there.\n\n115\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.970\nGoing to type in our user name.\n\n116\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.260\nWe're going to use that admin\naccount we were just using.\n\n117\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.190\nSo administrator, spell that correctly.\n\n118\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.420\nSpeaking of administrator, administrador.\n\n119\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.410\nSo, we're gonna put that in.\n\n120\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.350\nWe're gonna type in our password.\n\n121\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.110\nGet that in there.\n\n122\n00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.380\nWe're gonna specify our domain.\n\n123\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.550\nWe'll pull that down.\n\n124\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.530\nPut our domain in there.\n\n125\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.480\nRemember in your world It'll be\nwhatever domain you're associated with.\n\n126\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.980\nHere, it's our practice labs domain.\n\n127\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.660\nWe're going to take advantage of that\ntest credentials, item click there.\n\n128\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.670\nThat's been accepted.\n\n129\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.240\nWe can see that's all good.\n\n130\n00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.840\nSo now we're going to go ahead,\nwe're going to click next.\n\n131\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.100\nNow we have to configure the service\nmanager work flow account.\n\n132\n00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.000\nWe have several accounts we have\nto specify and configure, so\n\n133\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.120\nwe're going to go through them.\n\n134\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.308\nAgain we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do domain here, and\n\n135\n00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:12.960\nthen we'll specify our user name,\nadministrator.\n\n136\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.550\nAnd we'll specify our password, and\n\n137\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.300\nwe will specify our domain, practice labs.\n\n138\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.290\nDo a little practice labs there we go.\n\n139\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.560\nTest credential,\nagain we'll give that a second.\n\n140\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.890\nComes back with no trouble, and then\n\n141\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.900\nonce we've done that we'll be done with\nconfiguring our accounts we'll click Next.\n\n142\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.700\nWe got our help improve screen,\n\n143\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.710\nremember in the real world we've\nbeen saying opt in and say yes here,\n\n144\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.880\nwe're going to say no, click Next,\nwe got a little installation summary,\n\n145\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.810\ngonna let that sit there for a second\njust so you can see what we're doing,\n\n146\n00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.490\ngive you the standard reminder I've been\ngiving you in every episode around this.\n\n147\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.360\nScreen capture this, use it for\nyour documentation, make your auditors and\n\n148\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.990\nmake your IA professionals\nin your organizations happy,\n\n149\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.530\nmake sure you have good documentation.\n\n150\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.610\nIt's gonna to help you\nwhen it comes to BCDR.\n\n151\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.230\nThis is continuity or\ndisaster recovery around this or\n\n152\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.130\nany of our products that we're installing.\n\n153\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.940\nYou can never go wrong with having too\nmuch documentation when it comes to how\n\n154\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.610\nyou install and configure, so\ntake advantage of that, right?\n\n155\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.120\nAll right, we're going to click Install,\ngonna to wait for\n\n156\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.670\nthat to go out and do its thing.\n\n157\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.090\nIt is gonna take a few minutes as you\ncan see, we're gonna let that cook,\n\n158\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.900\nwhen we come back, we're gonna\nhave this all set up ready to go.\n\n159\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.990\nWe'll take a look at it for you.\n\n160\n00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.520\nAll right so we can see the Service\nManager Setup Wizard has completed.\n\n161\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.360\nWe've got all of our this time it's\nwhite circles and green checks.\n\n162\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.300\nI love it when we get this randomization\nof completion and success.\n\n163\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.820\nWe normally have green circle,\nwhite check.\n\n164\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.830\nWe now have white circle, green check.\n\n165\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.510\nAnd remember we had just the check\nin one of the other ones.\n\n166\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.150\nSo it is just a potpourri,\n\n167\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.620\na cornucopia of a random success\nmarkers here as we go through.\n\n168\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.940\nBut we do see success.\n\n169\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.300\nAnd the interesting about this one,\nwe're not actually done yet.\n\n170\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.970\nWe are in the sence we've installed.\n\n171\n00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.520\nBut we have to go through and\nhave to run the encryption key backup and\n\n172\n00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.700\nrestore Wizard so that we can backup the\nencryption keys for service level manager.\n\n173\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.740\nGonna show you how to do that right now.\n\n174\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.700\nWe do have the open encryption backup and\nrestore wizard\n\n175\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.030\ncheck mark down at the bottom select\nwe're gonna leave that there.\n\n176\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.920\nWe're not gonna open the console\nyeah we're gonna run this first and\n\n177\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.160\nthen when we're done we'll\ntake a look at the console.\n\n178\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.575\nSo we're gonna go ahead Go ahead and\nclick close.\n\n179\n00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:20.565\nThis is gonna launch the wizard for us.\n\n180\n00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:23.305\nI'm just gonna kill the installation\nmedia in the background.\n\n181\n00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:26.225\nJust get that out of the way so\nI have a little more room on the screen.\n\n182\n00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:29.995\nI'm gonna just bring this over\nkinda centered so we can see that.\n\n183\n00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:33.195\nWe'll offset that just a little bit so\nwe can see,\n\n184\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.190\nwhat that says right there encrypted\nkey of back up and restore wizard\n\n185\n00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.200\nwe gonna clicked next on this we're gonna\ngo ahead and decide what we're doing.\n\n186\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.360\nWe haven't backed up the key yet\n\n187\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.910\nso obviously backing up first\nrestoring second right.\n\n188\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nbacked up the key, notice by default\n\n189\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.680\nit is selected and that is the option\nwe're gonna go for, we'll click next.\n\n190\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.294\nWe have to browse and\nspecify where we gonna put this.\n\n191\n00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:03.033\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to specify or just browse and\n\n192\n00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.649\nuse the default path.\n\n193\n00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:08.573\nWe'll do it in our documents directory\nlocally for the user logged on it's doing\n\n194\n00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:11.978\nthe install for you, you would\nobviously put somewhere more secure,\n\n195\n00:09:11.978 --> 00:09:15.844\nspecify a place where you're going to be\nable to store that key or retrieve it and\n\n196\n00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:18.040\nthen use it from there when necessary.\n\n197\n00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.227\nI'm just going to call mine sm for\nservice manager key, so\n\n198\n00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:25.144\nI'm going to call the file sm key,\nright, so we'll put that in there.\n\n199\n00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:29.170\nYou'll see it's in the directory my\ndocuments directory where we did the demo\n\n200\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.647\nif you remember for setting up and\ntaking a look at various things and\n\n201\n00:09:32.647 --> 00:09:36.978\ndownloading and putting them in, we may\nhave information floating around a variety\n\n202\n00:09:36.978 --> 00:09:41.553\nof places, so we're just going to store it\nhere, we'll click open, got that in there,\n\n203\n00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:44.786\npopulates that path for us,\nreally nice, we'll click next,\n\n204\n00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:46.872\nare we going to use a password with that?\n\n205\n00:09:46.872 --> 00:09:50.210\nIf we wanna use a password\nassign one to the file, so\n\n206\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.340\nwe'll put our password in there,\njust hit tab for that.\n\n207\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.520\nWe'll do that, click Next,\nand then just wait for that.\n\n208\n00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.990\nWe'll click Complete so\nwe have that all set up ready to go.\n\n209\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.500\nReally nothing more involved than that,\nit's just that way we have the key.\n\n210\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.810\nAnd if there's a problem,\nwe can obviously run the restore procedure\n\n211\n00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.430\nusing the same program and run it\nthe opposite way and restore the key.\n\n212\n00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.550\nWe're gonna go in and\nload the console now.\n\n213\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.120\nSo we're gonna go to our Start workspace,\n\n214\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.270\nwe'll see that we do not have\nit installed here as a tile.\n\n215\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.490\nWe haven't added it in.\n\n216\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.840\nWe have added in some of the other\nones we've been working with.\n\n217\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.600\nWe can either go browse for it, or\nwe could just search for it either way.\n\n218\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.340\nSo if we just search right from\nhere start typing service,\n\n219\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.170\nyou'll see service manager\nconsole comes up right down here.\n\n220\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.840\nAbout half way down,\ngonna right click on that.\n\n221\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.140\nWe'll do a pin to start just so\nwe could see it right here.\n\n222\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.810\nGet out of there.\n\n223\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.820\nWe'll right click.\n\n224\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.600\nWe'll do pin to task bars so we have it.\n\n225\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.900\nAnd we'll do a run as administrator,\nright?\n\n226\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.840\nSo we're gonna load that up real quick.\n\n227\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.660\nWe could see that when we do that,\nwe are then prompted for the connect to.\n\n228\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.730\nWhat's the server name\nwe're gonna connect to,\n\n229\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.680\ngonna connect to our server\nwhen we did the install.\n\n230\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.130\nAssuming all the services running,\neverything is running well,\n\n231\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.910\nshould be able to get in there\nafter just a momentary pause.\n\n232\n00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.220\nIt's loading up right now.\n\n233\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.120\nYou'll see that come up once it does.\n\n234\n00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.170\nYou'll see that we have the service\nlevel manager console in here.\n\n235\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.235\nWe've got some workspace areas\nwe can quickly identify.\n\n236\n00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:15.120\nWe've got the administration workspace.\n\n237\n00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.940\nWe have the library workspace,\nwork items and configuration items.\n\n238\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.420\nSo we'll be going through and\ntake a look at this product and\n\n239\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.060\ntalking more about it,\nsome of our upcoming episodes.\n\n240\n00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.210\nRemember this is where we're gonna be able\nto take the output of Ops Manager, once we\n\n241\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.990\ncreate the configuration, that binds these\ntwo products together through a connector,\n\n242\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.240\nand allow the alerts that are generated\nthere to actually then come over here and\n\n243\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.880\nopen up configuration items,\nwork items, tickets, and\n\n244\n00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.600\ndo resolution to walk through\nthe resolution chains for us.\n\n245\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.180\nSo we're gonna see this synergy\nstarting to take place.\n\n246\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.780\nWe'll have some upcoming episodes where\nwe talk about how do we configure all\n\n247\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.760\nthe interaction and the interconnection\nthat is required between these products so\n\n248\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.790\nthat they could talk to each other.\n\n249\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.100\nAnd we'll be setting that up here and\nbeing able to work with it.\n\n250\n00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.300\nAnd once we've done that we'll then be\nable to see the information flowing\n\n251\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.240\nback and forth.\n\n252\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.150\nSo we'll be taking a look that some for\nupcoming discussions, but you could\n\n253\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.040\nsee as we get in and set this up this one\ndoes take a little bit longer than most of\n\n254\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.760\nthe others to instantiate, it's about\na 15 minute install give or take.\n\n255\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.285\nIt's amazing how that time just flies by.\n\n256\n00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:18.118\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like nothing.\n\n257\n00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:21.870\nBut it does take a little bit longer than\nthe others, so don't be surprised when you\n\n258\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.454\ninstall Service Level Manager\nthat it does take longer.\n\n259\n00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:29.011\nThe main reason, and I was talking about\nthis with Daniel while we're waiting on it\n\n260\n00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:32.150\nto finish Is the need to import\nall the management packs.\n\n261\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.520\nYou could see we have 137 of them sitting\nthere that have been imported by default.\n\n262\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.430\nAnd there's quite a number of them for\nservice level manager,\n\n263\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.390\nand this is what takes\nthe longest amount of time.\n\n264\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.250\nIt's got to copy all that information,\nbring it in, and\n\n265\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.240\nset it up the right way as part of\nthe configuration of the tool initially.\n\n266\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.740\nSo this is why it does tend\nto take a little bit longer\n\n267\n00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.230\nthan some of the other programs\nthat we did the demos for.\n\n268\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.720\nSo just so you have a sense of that.\n\n269\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam,\n\n270\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.190\nthanks for walking us through\ninstalling the Service Manager.\n\n271\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.690\nLike you said, not too difficult,\n\n272\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.450\nbut a little bit of time\nconsuming on the plate there.\n\n273\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.350\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n274\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.820\nThat being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of this episode.\n\n275\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.570\nAdam, thanks so much for joining us today.\n\n276\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.840\nWe do thank our audience for watching,\nbut Ssgning off for ITProTV.\n\n277\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.364\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n278\n00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:16.292\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n279\n00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:23.582\n&gt;&gt; And

cloud services.\n\n9\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.224\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:24.391\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.424\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.480\nHopefully everybody's doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.701\nAlways a pleasure to be here, spend time\nwith Cherokee, spend time with you, and\n\n14\n00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.850\ncontinue talking about cloud services.\n\n15\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.397\nI wore my bright yellow\nshirt to represent a sunny,\n\n16\n00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:38.183\ncloudless day,\nbecause we're gonna talk about fun and\n\n17\n00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:41.621\nexciting stuff that clarifies the cloud\nfor us hopefully a little bit\n\n18\n00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.372\nmore than where we stand right now,\nas we're just starting to get into it.\n\n19\n00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:49.011\nWe've spent time in the last set\nof episodes talking about some of\n\n20\n00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:52.330\nthe background requirements,\nhow do we set up the fabric.\n\n21\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.127\nWe went through,\ndid some hands-on exercises for you,\n\n22\n00:00:55.127 --> 00:00:59.041\nwalked you through how to set up a storage\nfabric, how to set up the networking.\n\n23\n00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.298\nWent through and took a look at IP pools,\nMAC address pools, took a look at VIP,\n\n24\n00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:06.033\nVirtual IP templates,\nlinked all that together,\n\n25\n00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.310\ncreated a virtual machine network.\n\n26\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.445\nAnd just talked about all of the\nrequirements that have to be in place for\n\n27\n00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:12.918\nus to actually start operating.\n\n28\n00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:16.182\nWe're gonna move from there now,\nrefer back to that and\n\n29\n00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:19.169\nlook at some of that as we go,\nbut move from there and\n\n30\n00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:22.510\ntalk a bit about the idea of\nhow we deploy cloud services.\n\n31\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.526\nWhat are service templates,\nwhat makes them up, how do we use them,\n\n32\n00:01:25.526 --> 00:01:28.906\nwhat's a service template designer,\nhow do we actually create a template.\n\n33\n00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:32.424\nWhat are all those profiles that you\nheard me talk about in some of the prior\n\n34\n00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.887\nepisodes and actually saw us use to\ndo a couple of quick demonstrations,\n\n35\n00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.220\ntake a look at some of that.\n\n36\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.693\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout some server App-V,\n\n37\n00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:42.589\na little application virtualization,\nand web deploy,\n\n38\n00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:46.408\nwhich are some interesting things\ncoming up in these discussions as well.\n\n39\n00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:50.642\nIf you havent seen it before or don't know\nwhat it is, we'll talk about the concept\n\n40\n00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:54.754\nof web deploy, how we use it to sync web\ncontent and move web application packages\n\n41\n00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:58.340\nbetween IIS servers as we're\ndeploying them to the cloud.\n\n42\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.474\nIt's a neat little tool that we have\naccess to that we can use to do that,\n\n43\n00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:03.846\nall part of what we do with\nregards to cloud services.\n\n44\n00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo when we think about the cloud\nas we've talked about before,\n\n45\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.306\nwe're thinking about using primarily,\nat least on the back-end admin side,\n\n46\n00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.310\non the fabric side, the VMM product.\n\n47\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.827\nAnd we're gonna go back into\nthe console and take a look at that.\n\n48\n00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:19.131\nWe're gonna add in at some point\nduring this discussion another one of\n\n49\n00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:21.946\nthe System Center products,\ncalled App Controller.\n\n50\n00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:25.348\nYou heard me mention it briefly in one of\nour very first introductory episodes where\n\n51\n00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:28.653\nwe talked about all the different products\nthat make up System Center from a suite\n\n52\n00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:29.299\nperspective.\n\n53\n00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.806\nWe've talked about\nSystem Center Ops Manager,\n\n54\n00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:36.160\nwe'll be spending time talking about\nthat and delving into that product.\n\n55\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.766\nWhich is the other major component to\ncloud services, the monitoring and\n\n56\n00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.613\nthe management of the information\non the back end, and how\n\n57\n00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:46.510\nwe flow that information between different\nproducts, the Service Manager and\n\n58\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.141\nall the different other associated\nproducts in the System Center suite.\n\n59\n00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.651\nWe'll be talking about that in some\nupcoming episodes, so, wanna remind you\n\n60\n00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.860\nabout that, give you a heads-up,\ntell you to come back, take a look.\n\n61\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.304\nWe'll talk about monitoring\ncloud-based applications and\n\n62\n00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.030\nconfiguring application performance\nmonitoring, we call it APM.\n\n63\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.420\nAnd we'll be talking about those,\nan in-depth dive into SCOM.\n\n64\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.527\nAnd if you haven't seen those product\nelements or don't know about them,\n\n65\n00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:12.828\nobviously it'd be very valuable for you\nto be not only taking a look at that, but\n\n66\n00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:14.330\nlearning more about that product.\n\n67\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.388\nBut we're going to focus on SCVMM, and by\nextension, a little bit on App Controller.\n\n68\n00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:23.737\nThe App Controller piece is gonna help us\nto better understand how we're gonna set\n\n69\n00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:28.337\nup our connection into the Azure fabric if\nwe're hosting with Microsoft in the Azure,\n\n70\n00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:31.710\nour private cloud off-prem\nbeing hosted there.\n\n71\n00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.940\nThere being the data centers at Microsoft.\n\n72\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.156\nWe'll then use App Controller\nto be able to deploy our VMs and\n\n73\n00:03:37.156 --> 00:03:40.323\nour services into the Azure fabric,\ninto the Azure cloud.\n\n74\n00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:43.886\nWe're gonna take a look at just the\noverview of the console, what does that\n\n75\n00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.337\nlook like, what are the steps involved\nwith setting up the connection,\n\n76\n00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:49.120\nthe subscription out to Azure.\n\n77\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.066\nConfiguring it,\nwe've got some step-by-step guidance for\n\n78\n00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:51.770\nyou in the show notes.\n\n79\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.453\nWe'll walk through\na high level on that and\n\n80\n00:03:53.453 --> 00:03:55.850\nshow you a little bit more\nabout what's going on.\n\n81\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.293\nSo we've got all of that to cover, and\n\n82\n00:03:57.293 --> 00:04:00.197\nCherokee promised she's gonna tap dance\nfor us before we're done as well.\n\n83\n00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:00.819\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n84\n00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.074\nyou're gonna get to see her do\na soft-shoe, and a little bit of that-\n\n85\n00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:03.598\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:04.361\n&gt;&gt; At some point.\n\n87\n00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:07.160\nAll right, so\nlet's get into the console here.\n\n88\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.456\nLet's talk a little bit about things, but\n\n89\n00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.835\nlet's do it by way of\nactually taking a look.\n\n90\n00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:14.210\nIf we could see my machine,\nwe are in SCVMM.\n\n91\n00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.280\nHopefully by now, if you've been through\nsome of the other episodes with us,\n\n92\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.660\nthis console looks a little familiar.\n\n93\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.940\nI skipped the whole hey, let's open it up.\n\n94\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.650\nIt's just a shortcut off the desktop, and\nwe've got the console up and running.\n\n95\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.350\nWe are in, as you can see here,\nhopefully, the library workspace.\n\n96\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.630\nAnd I'm up under Templates up top here.\n\n97\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.190\nAnd I'm in the Service Template area.\n\n98\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.720\nAnd I've already created\na service template\n\n99\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.230\nthat we're just gonna use to do some\nquick show-and-tell and discussion.\n\n100\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.000\nBut I'll walk you through how to create\none, I'll actually show you how to use\n\n101\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.580\nthe wizard, and\nthen we'll take a look at the designer.\n\n102\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.750\nBut the service templates\nare essentially gonna be containers.\n\n103\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.764\nThey're gonna be,\nI think of them as blank canvases.\n\n104\n00:04:49.764 --> 00:04:51.936\nWhen I was growing up,\nI don't know if when you were growing up,\n\n105\n00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:54.570\nthis is more of a generational thing,\nthis may or may not have worked for you.\n\n106\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.256\nBut you have young children,\nbut it may work for you now.\n\n107\n00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.666\nBut when I was growing up,\nwhen I was a kid, Lego was really popular.\n\n108\n00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or it still is, not\n\n109\n00:05:00.193 --> 00:05:00.854\nthat it's not popular.\n\n110\n00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:04.493\nBut I had Legos, as many children do,\nand I'm sure all of you,\n\n111\n00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:07.890\nhopefully, got to play with\nLegos when you were a kid.\n\n112\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.085\nBut I was really into the space Legos,\nright?\n\n113\n00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:11.354\nSo you would get all the different kits,\nand\n\n114\n00:05:11.354 --> 00:05:14.910\nyou would then be able to build\na spaceship, or whatever it was.\n\n115\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.087\nBut one of the cool things about\nthe space ones, if you were the uber\n\n116\n00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:24.083\ngeek in the Lego world, you actually\nhad these, they were like square, huge,\n\n117\n00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:28.810\nprobably two-by-two plates that you\ncould buy, that were landscapes.\n\n118\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.751\nSo it was like a moon landscape with all\nthe little Lego connectors on the bottom.\n\n119\n00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.967\nUsually the surface was the pieces\nyou could plug the Lego pieces onto.\n\n120\n00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:39.285\nSo if you built your spaceship and\nyou wanted it to land,\n\n121\n00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:41.245\nyou could put it down and\nlike lock it in place.\n\n122\n00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:44.940\nBut it had the moon kinda ridges, the\ncraters and all, so it was really cool.\n\n123\n00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.345\nSo you could buy all these and\nyou could set up,\n\n124\n00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:50.645\nalmost like a tabletop like this,\nwith five or six of them.\n\n125\n00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:53.305\nAnd you'd have a little moon base area,\nyou could build out all your stuff.\n\n126\n00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:55.511\nI was a really geeky child, I have to say.\n\n127\n00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.308\nAnd this is why I went the total opposite\nway with the hair, the beard, the earrings\n\n128\n00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:02.930\nand everything, just because I got away\nfrom all that when I became an adult.\n\n129\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.528\n&gt;&gt; Sure you did.\n\n130\n00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:07.000\n&gt;&gt; I didn't really,\nit's just that I do good at looking that.\n\n131\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.570\nThe outward appearance looks that way, but\nI'm still the internal child at heart.\n\n132\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.265\nBut when I was, you know when\nI was playing with all those,\n\n133\n00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:17.170\nI remember you'd set all this stuff up and\nyou'd have these grids you could use, and\n\n134\n00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.260\nI'd always think, wow this is so cool.\n\n135\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.651\nWhat do I wanna make, and\nwhat do I want to kinda design?\n\n136\n00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.624\nBecause every time I would set something\nup, then I would take it apart,\n\n137\n00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:27.710\nput it back together, it would be\nbrand-new, like a blank canvas.\n\n138\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.266\nAnd then I could start to, from there,\nwork with it again and rebuild,\n\n139\n00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:35.357\nkind of structuring my world, figuring out\nwhat pieces I wanted to put in there and\n\n140\n00:06:35.357 --> 00:06:36.621\nwhat it would look like.\n\n141\n00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:39.644\nSo I think of service\ntemplates kinda like that,\n\n142\n00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:43.714\nbecause they're empty canvases,\nthey're blank containers.\n\n143\n00:06:43.714 --> 00:06:48.406\nAnd then, what we do is we put all these\ndifferent services and the component parts\n\n144\n00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:53.370\nof themin to this service template,\neither a single-tier, multi-tier solution.\n\n145\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.310\nWe'll talk about what tiers are and how\nthey work, machine tiers, what they are,\n\n146\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.220\nwhy they're important, in a minute.\n\n147\n00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.034\nWe'll put in VM templates.\n\n148\n00:07:00.034 --> 00:07:04.979\nWe'll put in all of the parts and\npieces that are configurable essentially,\n\n149\n00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.305\nthese components.\n\n150\n00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:11.257\nWe'll add them in and bind them to the\nservice template, so that when we're done,\n\n151\n00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:15.147\nwe have this container with all of\nits parts that we can then use and\n\n152\n00:07:15.147 --> 00:07:17.521\nactually drive a deployment through.\n\n153\n00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:19.858\nAnd by using it to drive a deployment,\n\n154\n00:07:19.858 --> 00:07:24.590\nwhat we can then do is we can use\nall of the preconfigured elements.\n\n155\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.904\nWe ensure all the various infrastructure\ncomponents we need are built.\n\n156\n00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:29.730\nAnd we'll take a look at and\nshow you what they are in just a minute.\n\n157\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.144\nBut by doing this, we can go ahead and\nwe can then actually set up a deployment.\n\n158\n00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:38.565\nAnd we actually can push this\ncontainerized service and\n\n159\n00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:41.880\nall its supporting elements\nout into our cloud.\n\n160\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.130\nSo we do all the back-end work,\nwe set everything up.\n\n161\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.380\nAnd we have a service to go,\nlike a service in a box.\n\n162\n00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.282\nAnd we're not the first ones\nwho came up with this concept.\n\n163\n00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:52.874\nIf you watch TV you see all\nthese commercials recently,\n\n164\n00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:56.422\nlike Blue Apron and all these companies\nthat are shipping you meals in a box.\n\n165\n00:07:56.422 --> 00:07:58.169\nEverything comes all put together.\n\n166\n00:07:58.169 --> 00:07:59.549\nIt's essentially the same concept.\n\n167\n00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:03.914\nWhat we're doing with service templates is\nWe're building what goes into that box and\n\n168\n00:08:03.914 --> 00:08:06.443\nwe're going to ship out and\npresent to somebody.\n\n169\n00:08:06.443 --> 00:08:09.708\nSay, okay here's everything we\nneed finished and ready to go.\n\n170\n00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.057\nOpen it up to play it.\n\n171\n00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:14.249\nAnd now once you're done, if everything's\nsuccessful, you've got your service,\n\n172\n00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:15.267\nat least in theory anyway.\n\n173\n00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:17.588\nAssuming you did everything correctly,\nyou've got your service.\n\n174\n00:08:17.588 --> 00:08:19.000\nSo that's what we're going to be doing.\n\n175\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.910\nThat's essentially what the goal or\nthe idea of the service template is.\n\n176\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.299\nSo If we can go back here,\njust take a look, you'll see.\n\n177\n00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:25.978\nAnd again, I'm not going to\ndo a deployment right now.\n\n178\n00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:28.194\nBut you can see what I\nwas just talking about,\n\n179\n00:08:28.194 --> 00:08:31.417\nwhich was if I take this service template,\nI right-click on it.\n\n180\n00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:35.062\nOne of the things I can do here, aside\nfrom export it, publish it, design it,\n\n181\n00:08:35.062 --> 00:08:38.620\nwe will go through some of those elements\nhere and take a look at properties.\n\n182\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.087\nBut I can actually configure this\ndeployment I was talking about to push\n\n183\n00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:44.240\nthe elements in this service template out.\n\n184\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.870\nAnd actually throw them out in to\nthe cloud, and have them running.\n\n185\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.220\nThese could be virtual machines,\nthese will be applications.\n\n186\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.250\nA SQL server fully deployed with\na template, we'll talk about what that is.\n\n187\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.130\nBut essentially a way of being\nable to take a SQL server and\n\n188\n00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:05.005\npre-configure it if necessary and\nthen deploy that instance out along\n\n189\n00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:08.445\nwith all the supporting elements to run\napplications, the database instance,\n\n190\n00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:13.275\nthe run as accounts or rather the SQL\nserver accounts that are necessary.\n\n191\n00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:16.515\nAll that kind of stuff can be done\nas part of this service template.\n\n192\n00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:20.265\nSo service templates are a very\npowerful idea because they\n\n193\n00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:25.060\nare a master container that will\nthen let us allocate resources,\n\n194\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.320\nconfigure them, put them in to\na consumable exportable unit, and\n\n195\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.150\nallow us to move them and\nactually ultimately deploy them.\n\n196\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.250\nSo what are some of these\ncomponents that go in there?\n\n197\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.140\nWell, we've got a lot of these\ncomponents lying around here.\n\n198\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.590\nWe've got our VMM library resources.\n\n199\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.920\nSo in the library, we've got our profiles.\n\n200\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.640\nLet me just open this up so you can see.\n\n201\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.360\nWe've got our profiles sitting here.\n\n202\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.990\nWe'll just scroll down on the left,\nso you can see this.\n\n203\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.710\nOur application profiles, our\ncapability profiles, guest OS profiles,\n\n204\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.710\nhardware, and physical computer profiles,\nour SQL Server profiles.\n\n205\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.970\nAll of these profiles\nare going to be part of this.\n\n206\n00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.950\nWe have our networking components.\n\n207\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.110\nIf we go over here to our fabric for\n\n208\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.170\njust a minute,\nwe go here we've got our logical networks.\n\n209\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.590\nWe've got our IP pools,\nour load balancers, our VIP templates.\n\n210\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.820\nWe've got our MAC address pools,\nour port profiles.\n\n211\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.520\nWe've got our network services.\n\n212\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.560\nAll of these things are componentised\nelements that are gonna be pulled in, or\n\n213\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.660\nat least they're going to make up\nelements that will then be represented\n\n214\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.860\nin the template, they're the backend\nconfigurations for this.\n\n215\n00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.440\nSo, we've got all of this, we have our\nvirtual machines and our host groups.\n\n216\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.930\nIf we go out here to our VMs and\n\n217\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.580\nservices, we'll have our virtual\nmachines that will be here.\n\n218\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.120\nWe'll have our host group,\nwhich represents our all host area.\n\n219\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.640\nAnd we'll be able to bring in any\nhost that we have sitting over here.\n\n220\n00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.050\nWe don't have any virtual\nmachines currently deployed but\n\n221\n00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.670\nif we had any those would be there.\n\n222\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.750\nWe do have our virtual machine templates.\n\n223\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.930\nSo we will be taking a look at those.\n\n224\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.480\nWe can come up here.\n\n225\n00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.380\nJust go back up here real quick.\n\n226\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.350\nAnd we can come over\nhere to our VM templates.\n\n227\n00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.952\nAnd you see we have Gen1 and\nthe Gen2 template.\n\n228\n00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:01.976\nAnd we'll be able to use\none of those two templates,\n\n229\n00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:05.196\nwe'll show you some issues associated\nwith templates, that's why you've got to\n\n230\n00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:08.371\npay attention to hardware generation\nwhen you're creating service templates.\n\n231\n00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:11.559\nWe'll take a look at that and we'll see\nthose in a minute, we'll drag one in.\n\n232\n00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:14.973\nSo, we gonna have those,\nwe'll have our private clouds,\n\n233\n00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:17.447\nif we have any clouds\nthat are being set up.\n\n234\n00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:20.244\nBack here in VMs and\nservices, up under clouds,\n\n235\n00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:24.146\nif we actually have any clouds\navailable to us we'll see them here.\n\n236\n00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:28.800\nWe'll be to go in and take a look at and\nsee what may be available and use those.\n\n237\n00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.890\nWe'll have all the different\nprofiles as I mentioned.\n\n238\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.843\nWe'll also have monitoring and\nreporting that will be available to us.\n\n239\n00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:38.487\nAnd we'll be able to combine all of\nthis stuff into our service template.\n\n240\n00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:42.042\nSo we're gonna go in and we're gonna\ntake a look and go back here and\n\n241\n00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:44.200\ntake a look how to build all of this out.\n\n242\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.437\nSo what we have is our service template,\nor\n\n243\n00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:49.430\nour service template area in the library,\nI should say.\n\n244\n00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.093\nAnd our service template, just scroll back\nup here because I clicked in the wrong\n\n245\n00:11:54.093 --> 00:11:58.152\nplace and went to the wrong set of\nitems for what we're talking about.\n\n246\n00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:58.970\nThere we go.\n\n247\n00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.818\nAll right, so, when we are talking\nabout a service template,\n\n248\n00:12:03.818 --> 00:12:06.572\nwhat we do is, we right click here.\n\n249\n00:12:06.572 --> 00:12:08.900\nCreate Service Template,\nvery straightforward.\n\n250\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:14.130\nWe also can do this right up here on the\nlittle tab up top, right on the ribbon.\n\n251\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.737\nSo notice, and\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n252\n00:12:15.737 --> 00:12:17.197\nCherokee's been good at pointing this out.\n\n253\n00:12:17.197 --> 00:12:19.230\nHey, there's more than\none way to do things.\n\n254\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.249\nAnd always make sure\nyou know where we are.\n\n255\n00:12:21.249 --> 00:12:24.100\nSo we can go in service templates,\ncreate a service template.\n\n256\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.120\nNow when we do this we are going\nto get asked a question here,\n\n257\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.840\na couple of questions.\n\n258\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.670\nSo we have to figure out actually in\nthe wizard, new service template.\n\n259\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.819\nThis window opens up.\n\n260\n00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:36.068\nLet me drag this over here for\njust a second.\n\n261\n00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:40.090\nLet me see if I can make that work,\nthere we are.\n\n262\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.330\nOkay now we just lost focus there for\na minute.\n\n263\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.940\nSo when we do this we're going to have\nto choose what kind of pattern or\n\n264\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.190\ntemplate we want to use.\n\n265\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.826\nAnd we'll talk about the difference\nhere in just a minute, but\n\n266\n00:12:50.826 --> 00:12:52.180\nwe also have to give this a name.\n\n267\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.997\nIt's called new service template one.\n\n268\n00:12:53.997 --> 00:12:56.260\nI can call this anything I'd like.\n\n269\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.839\nLet's call this ITProTV.\n\n270\n00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:05.370\nTemplate two and\nthen we specify a release number.\n\n271\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.070\nThis is really just us doing change\nmanagement in virtual control\n\n272\n00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.070\nand tracking.\n\n273\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.289\nThat can be any kind of item you want,\nyou saw new was there by default,\n\n274\n00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:18.365\nyou want to put in a number, version 1,\nversion 2, whatever, you can do that.\n\n275\n00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:23.580\nIf want to put in a word like new, or\ndemo or test or QA, doesn't really matter,\n\n276\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.030\nthis is merely metadata that's going\nto be associated with the template.\n\n277\n00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.650\nBut it helps us to understand what\nwe're doing, keep track of things.\n\n278\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.150\nSo I'll go ahead for\nrelease and I'll put in QA so\n\n279\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.030\nwe know it's for QA testing purposes.\n\n280\n00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:41.090\nAnd then, we have to decide what kind\nof structure we want with our template.\n\n281\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.460\nDo we want a blank canvas like I was\ntalking about, that grid that we're just\n\n282\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.060\nessentially gonna be able to design\nourselves by dragging things out and\n\n283\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.010\ninteracting with them?\n\n284\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.230\nDo we want a single machine where\nwe're gonna have, as you can see,\n\n285\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.330\nif you can kind of look at this here,\nwe'll have a single machine.\n\n286\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.960\nSo just a single solution with one or\nmore items attached?\n\n287\n00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.780\nWe could do a two-tier,\nor we do a three tier.\n\n288\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.910\nYou'll see the tier is a machine with\nmultiple levels of services, or multiple\n\n289\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:13.190\nlevels of things associated with it, that\nwe're going to be able to interact with.\n\n290\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.440\nWhen we think about the different\ntier settings, we have machine tier,\n\n291\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.180\nwe have networking tier.\n\n292\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.980\nWe also have the ability to be able to\ndecide what will go into those tiers.\n\n293\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.810\nAnd we're going to take\na look at how to set this up,\n\n294\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.440\nbut what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna start with a blank one,\n\n295\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.310\nbecause you can actually start\nwith blank and add tiers in.\n\n296\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.830\nYou may see this poking out of\nthe corner right over here,\n\n297\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.160\nI have my add machine tier item.\n\n298\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.620\nSo if we choose a blank one, and what\nI normally do when I design templates,\n\n299\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.360\nI usually,\nunless I've talked to my customer, or\n\n300\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.840\nunless whoever I'm doing this with, or\nif I'm helping somebody figure it out,\n\n301\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.710\nunless they have a very specific idea in\nmind of exactly what this service is gonna\n\n302\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.970\nlook like,\nall the components are already mapped out.\n\n303\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.260\nIn other words,\nthey've done all the background.\n\n304\n00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.600\nDue diligence, and exercised\ntheir discussions internally, and\n\n305\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.030\nreally mapped this out.\n\n306\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.660\nI recommend they start with the blank.\n\n307\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.340\nBecause then they can just add in\nall the appropriate things to build\n\n308\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.490\nout as they go.\n\n309\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.038\nWait, I forgot, I need this.\n\n310\n00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:10.130\nNo problem, we'll just go up there,\n\n311\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.380\nwe'll grab it right from\nthe little pick list up here.\n\n312\n00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.198\nYou could see we can add our\nmachine tiers, add our networks,\n\n313\n00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:17.420\nour load balancers.\n\n314\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.620\nOur application host template for\nweb apps, for SQL apps, whatever they are.\n\n315\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.170\nWe could bring all those\ncomponents in after the fact.\n\n316\n00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.700\nIf I start with one of the other ones,\nI can still add, but then I've got\n\n317\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.390\nto go in and delete or modify and move\nstuff around if I don't want what's there.\n\n318\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.920\nSo it may be easier to start with a blank\ntemplate, but again that's just me in\n\n319\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.880\nthe real world doing this and telling you,\nhey I find it easier to do it this way.\n\n320\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.470\nYou'll hear other people say,\nno, absolutely,\n\n321\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.670\nif you know what you're doing\njust start with like a two tier.\n\n322\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.460\nBecause that's probably the most flexible.\n\n323\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.320\nAnd then you can add or remove as needed.\n\n324\n00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.257\nSo you'll get different kinds of guidance.\n\n325\n00:15:50.257 --> 00:15:53.658\nIt's really up to you to decide what\nyou think is gonna work best for you.\n\n326\n00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:56.286\nBut for purposes of our discussion,\nI'm gonna do a blank, and\n\n327\n00:15:56.286 --> 00:15:58.129\nwe're just gonna add\nsome stuff in as we go.\n\n328\n00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:00.753\nOkay, so I know Cherokee wanted\nto ask something here real quick.\n\n329\n00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:02.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna just grab the blank\n\n330\n00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:03.500\ntemplate while we're talking.\n\n331\n00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And go ahead, and\n\n332\n00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.230\nI'm just gonna click OK.\n\n333\n00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.220\nAnd then, we'll talk while I'm\njust letting this set up, okay?\n\n334\n00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.510\n&gt;&gt; In a previous episode, Adam, you had\nshown us different service level tiers\n\n335\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.060\nwhen we were setting\nup our storage fabric.\n\n336\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.635\nAm I close,\nis this the same concept or no bueno?\n\n337\n00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:21.970\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n338\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.642\nOn the idea is the same in the sense of\nyeah, we have tiering, and we happen to\n\n339\n00:16:26.642 --> 00:16:31.828\nrefer to it in this case as machine tiers,\nbut when we talked about tiering storage.\n\n340\n00:16:31.828 --> 00:16:34.927\nAnd the episode Cherokee's talking about\nby the way if you haven't seen it,\n\n341\n00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.131\nIs our walk through on how to\nset up the storage fabric.\n\n342\n00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:39.651\nWe talk about, hey,\nlet's go hands on piece,\n\n343\n00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:42.760\nwe'll show you how to\nconfigure the storage fabric.\n\n344\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.840\nLet's do a separate one on how\nto set the network fabric.\n\n345\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.254\nWe did kind of one of each.\n\n346\n00:16:47.254 --> 00:16:50.026\nThe storage fabric episode where we\nactually walked through to set up\n\n347\n00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:51.200\nthe storage fabric.\n\n348\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.570\nIs the episode that Cherokee\nis asking the question about.\n\n349\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.200\nSo, we went through and I talked\nabout the concept the store hearing\n\n350\n00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.210\nin the storage area there where we set\nup our Windows file share storage or\n\n351\n00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.900\nuse Windows file share as our provider for\nstorage.\n\n352\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.950\nWe've talked about how to set\nup a center in that solution and\n\n353\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.780\nalso looked at how to set up fiber.\n\n354\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.300\nBut we didn't actually go through and\nconfigure all those,\n\n355\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.620\nwe just talked about what they would be.\n\n356\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.760\nBut, we actually did the configuration\non the Windows file share.\n\n357\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.110\nAnd during that I specified,\n\n358\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.380\nat least I talked about the idea that\nwe would typically want to use, or\n\n359\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.190\nat least normally, we would see that\nmany storage systems will use tierring\n\n360\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.940\nas a process to rank or\nsomehow indicate importance of or\n\n361\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.500\nperformance ratings, things like that\naround the storage architecture.\n\n362\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.966\nAnd that this was totally\ndriven by us as administrators.\n\n363\n00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:41.660\nIt was gonna be specific to our context,\n\n364\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.760\nin other words how we set\nup our storage network.\n\n365\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.509\nWe, as the storage admins,\nor as the IT admins, or\n\n366\n00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:53.237\nthe SCVMM or whoever we are,\nwould decide what those tiers are.\n\n367\n00:17:53.237 --> 00:17:56.153\nThey are centered as meta-data tags,\nright, their labeled,\n\n368\n00:17:56.153 --> 00:17:59.231\nnothing more than that and we said\nthey could be as you were saying and\n\n369\n00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:02.957\nI can see certainly where the linkage\nmakes sense on the surface, right, because\n\n370\n00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:06.540\nwe did talk about one tiering system as\nbeing tier one, tier two, tier three.\n\n371\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.620\nMuch like what we were\njust talking about here.\n\n372\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.560\nAnd I said it's very comment\nin our industry to hear\n\n373\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.660\npeople that do storage talk about storage.\n\n374\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.350\nWe have tier one storage or tier two or\nyou hear platinum, gold, silver.\n\n375\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.070\nOr platinum, silver, bronze, or\ngold, silver, bronze whatever.\n\n376\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.860\nYou hear people tier their\nstorage in different ways.\n\n377\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.165\nThere is a thought process\nout there that does this.\n\n378\n00:18:28.165 --> 00:18:30.730\nSuch standardized per say,\nyou can do anything you want.\n\n379\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.560\nI said you could do low, medium, high.\n\n380\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.370\nGood, bad, ugly.\n\n381\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.130\nWhatever you wanna do, right?\n\n382\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.852\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n383\n00:18:34.852 --> 00:18:38.240\nPoint is these labels make sense to you,\nyou standardized them,\n\n384\n00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.115\nyou use them them to rank and\nrate what kind of storage you want.\n\n385\n00:18:41.115 --> 00:18:44.565\nAnd then the goal would be,\nwhen you're taking your storage profiles,\n\n386\n00:18:44.565 --> 00:18:47.955\nyou used that guide just part of\nthe many data, to then say, by the way,\n\n387\n00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:50.025\nI want this particular kind of storage.\n\n388\n00:18:50.025 --> 00:18:51.757\nRight, I want performance\nat this disappear.\n\n389\n00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:53.517\nSo, the concept is the same.\n\n390\n00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:56.797\nDefinitely a good idea to make that\nthought process apparent here.\n\n391\n00:18:56.797 --> 00:18:59.187\nBut, when we talk about the machine tier,\n\n392\n00:18:59.187 --> 00:19:02.447\nwe talk about networking tier,\nwe're talking about the structure\n\n393\n00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:06.658\nelement that deals with the the virtual\nmachine and the configurations of it.\n\n394\n00:19:06.658 --> 00:19:10.374\nWe've talked about the machines here,\nwe're talking about the networkings here,\n\n395\n00:19:10.374 --> 00:19:12.705\nwe are talking about\nthe settings of the networking.\n\n396\n00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:17.386\nSo, you're bringing in our load balancer,\nthe IP templates, things like that so,\n\n397\n00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:21.561\njust a way of referring to the structure\nelement that lets us configure out.\n\n398\n00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:25.604\nIf you think of it as a sandwich because\nessentially a service template is like\n\n399\n00:19:25.604 --> 00:19:26.298\na sandwich.\n\n400\n00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.674\nYou can tell I'm getting a little\nhungry right, it's like a sandwich.\n\n401\n00:19:28.674 --> 00:19:30.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're building all the layers, and\n\n402\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.450\nthe tiers are essentially nothing more\nthan those layers that we're adding in\n\n403\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.070\nto the sandwich to, in this case,\nbuild functionality.\n\n404\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.960\nIn the case of the sandwich,\nyou add flavor, right?\n\n405\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.090\nBecause we want a flavorful sandwich,\nright?\n\n406\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.040\nSo it's the same idea.\n\n407\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.381\nThere are definite similarities but\nit doesn't work quite the same way because\n\n408\n00:19:45.381 --> 00:19:47.955\nwe're not ranking performance-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n409\n00:19:47.955 --> 00:19:49.325\n&gt;&gt; Or indicating value.\n\n410\n00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:54.645\nWe're rather indicating configuration\nparameters based on a specific kind\n\n411\n00:19:54.645 --> 00:19:55.465\nof template.\n\n412\n00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:57.795\nThe machine's here will\nuse hardware profiles,\n\n413\n00:19:57.795 --> 00:20:01.410\nthings like that whereas the networkings\nhere will use the networking settings.\n\n414\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.580\nSo kinda similar but\nalso a little bit different.\n\n415\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.820\nBut it's a good idea to think about it and\nflesh out that difference so\n\n416\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.590\nwe better understand, what those\nspecifics are when we say something like,\n\n417\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.110\nwe're gonna use a machine tier.\n\n418\n00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.170\nYou may or may not know what that is.\n\n419\n00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.230\nYou may never have seen one or heard\nsomeone talk about it that way before.\n\n420\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.390\nSo it is good to definitely view that.\n\n421\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.517\nThat's like a high five right there.\n\n422\n00:20:19.517 --> 00:20:20.448\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo.\n\n423\n00:20:20.448 --> 00:20:20.996\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome, okay.\n\n424\n00:20:20.996 --> 00:20:22.966\nThat's a disembodied high five by the way,\nright.\n\n425\n00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:25.660\nAll right, so that was actually\nvery good observation on your part.\n\n426\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.850\nI'm glad you brought that up.\n\n427\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.310\nSo, let's take a look back in here.\n\n428\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.020\nWe're talking about our\nservice template designer now.\n\n429\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.450\nThis is the tool that we use to\nbuild out our service template.\n\n430\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.890\nNow, there's a couple of\nthings I want you to see.\n\n431\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.250\nLet's go full screen for just a minute.\n\n432\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.584\nWe've got to see that lower quadron on\nthe right there with that yellow warning\n\n433\n00:20:41.584 --> 00:20:42.300\nstuff going on.\n\n434\n00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.670\nWanna talk a little bit about this for\na minute.\n\n435\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.440\nBecause this is important for\nus to be aware of.\n\n436\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.920\nSo, this is a three pane design solution.\n\n437\n00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.980\nWe've got our navigation area, search\narea over here, for our VM templates.\n\n438\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.840\nWe're just gonna make that a little\nbit smaller cuz we don't need to see\n\n439\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.210\nthat whole thing there.\n\n440\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.790\nI could just get that in there.\n\n441\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.850\nWe'll just bring that over.\n\n442\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.240\nBut we can see our template over there,\n\n443\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.770\nit just give us a little\nmore room in the middle.\n\n444\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.800\nWe've got our upper area\nhere in the center quadrant.\n\n445\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.310\nThis is our work space.\n\n446\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.390\nYou can see a big arrow,,\n\n447\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.700\nhey drag your VM templates out here,\nadd some tiers out here,\n\n448\n00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.680\nadd a network, all that stuff's gonna\ntake place here on the designer area.\n\n449\n00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.020\nAnd then, we've got our properties\narea down at the bottom here\n\n450\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.500\nwhere we highlight whatever the element\nis that's up in the design area and\n\n451\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.330\nthen we're gonna be able to\nsee some information about it.\n\n452\n00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.970\nWe see the owner,\nwe could specify an owner here.\n\n453\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.750\nWe see the name.\n\n454\n00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.440\nWe can rename it if necessary.\n\n455\n00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.300\nWe see our release item, here.\n\n456\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:36.920\nWe did QA.\n\n457\n00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.990\nWe could change the label on that.\n\n458\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.220\nWe could see our priority.\n\n459\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.020\nBut down at the bottom is\nwhat I wanna show you here.\n\n460\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.250\nIt says in the yellow in the caution area,\nand we got a little pop up,\n\n461\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.596\nyou may be able to read it there.\n\n462\n00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:49.880\nService template IT PRO it says,\n\n463\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.510\nITProTV Template 2 must contain one\nof more service tier templates.\n\n464\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.030\nI goes on to say ensure\nthat there is at least\n\n465\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.050\none service tier template in the service\ntemplate and then try the operation again.\n\n466\n00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.210\nSo, it's just telling us we have\nto add in some information and\n\n467\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.780\nsome things before we finish up and\nfinalize this.\n\n468\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.130\nSo, it's giving us a warning and\ntelling us what's going on.\n\n469\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.990\nIt's always good to look in the console\nhere and be aware of this, right?\n\n470\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.760\nBecause there will be warnings\nthat pop up information.\n\n471\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.520\nThat'll be communicated to us here.\n\n472\n00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.340\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n473\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.200\nYou can see it off to the left here.\n\n474\n00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.274\nVM templates marked as Gen 2 are not\nsupported in service templates, that's one\n\n475\n00:22:25.274 --> 00:22:29.110\nof the things I was talking about when I\nsaid we have VM templates created, and\n\n476\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.424\nwe have a Gen 1 and Gen 2.\n\n477\n00:22:30.424 --> 00:22:34.010\nAnd now, you can see that I only see\nmy Gen 1, I labeled it so you can tell.\n\n478\n00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.720\nI only see my Gen 1 template, here.\n\n479\n00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.170\nIf you create templates, and then you\ngo into the service designer tool.\n\n480\n00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.130\n&gt;&gt; And they're missing, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they're missing, exactly.\n\n481\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.530\nThey're not there,\nit's because they're Gen 2 templates and\n\n482\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.690\nthey don't show up here because we don't\nsupport the use, currently anyways,\n\n483\n00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.340\nin this rev, we do not support\nthe use of generation two templates\n\n484\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.160\nin the service template designer.\n\n485\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.470\nIn other words,\nyou can't package those up.\n\n486\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.370\nInto a service template you can use them\nseparately then they are a part of service\n\n487\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.340\ntemplate, so we wanna be aware of that.\n\n488\n00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.218\n&gt;&gt; Good to know, thank you, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is good to know because otherwise if\n\n489\n00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:08.440\nyou say they've got here, you go unnoticed\nthere and I did not work on that sure.\n\n490\n00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.550\nOn that you will be caught off guard and\nyou will be wondering now that level is\n\n491\n00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.375\nthere start as a warning is aways there,\nbut how many wants gonna look at that and\n\n492\n00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.730\nnotice that without, first,\ndo some troubleshooting.\n\n493\n00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.756\nAnd maybe thinking, what did I do wrong,\nis there something, and then you go back.\n\n494\n00:23:21.756 --> 00:23:25.000\nYou spend a lot of time until you\nfinally figure it out, right?\n\n495\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.840\nSo, we do support Gen 1 templates, so\n\n496\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.330\nI created a Gen 1 and\nGen 2 just so we can use it.\n\n497\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.280\nBut we have that here, we'll drag that\nout and drop over here in a minute.\n\n498\n00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.080\nBut our service templates,\nwhen we create them will be prompted for\n\n499\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.740\nthe number of tiers.\n\n500\n00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.220\nSo we talked about this.\n\n501\n00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.471\nWe also then, we'll go in and\nconfigure the various settings.\n\n502\n00:23:42.471 --> 00:23:45.793\nNow, remember the settings will\nbe a specific two of the tier,\n\n503\n00:23:45.793 --> 00:23:49.804\nwe have a machine tier, we will then\nhave our guest LS, hardware profiles,\n\n504\n00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:50.818\nthings like that.\n\n505\n00:23:50.818 --> 00:23:51.961\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n506\n00:23:51.961 --> 00:23:53.897\nLet's add a machine tier in here.\n\n507\n00:23:53.897 --> 00:23:56.050\nAnd we have a little wizard\nthat's driven to do this.\n\n508\n00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.670\nAnd you'll see we have a selected\nsource for the new tier template.\n\n509\n00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.450\nNow we can go ahead and we can use\na copy of an existing VM template,\n\n510\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.532\nas in this template\nsitting right down here.\n\n511\n00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:07.950\nThe Gen1 template that I\nhaven't dragged in yet.\n\n512\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:12.021\nWe could go ahead and use that or\nwe can customize a copy of an existing VM\n\n513\n00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:16.098\ntemplate or create a new one based\non some stored disks in the library.\n\n514\n00:24:16.098 --> 00:24:20.760\nSo I can use what I already have as this I\ncan take what I have as a starting point,\n\n515\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.050\nwhen I say what I have I\nmean the template, right?\n\n516\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.740\nI can then go ahead and\nI can customize it.\n\n517\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.048\nThe machine tear is just the configuration\nsettings container that allows us\n\n518\n00:24:31.048 --> 00:24:34.626\nto control and specify how the VM\ntemplate will be structured for\n\n519\n00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:38.415\ndeployment when we are actually\nadding it to the service template.\n\n520\n00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:41.940\nSo we're configuring what our VM is\ngonna look like in other words just\n\n521\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.561\nas part of this configuration.\n\n522\n00:24:43.561 --> 00:24:46.847\nAnd so, I could just use that template and\ndrag it in this by the way, would\n\n523\n00:24:46.847 --> 00:24:50.510\nessentially be the same thing as dragging\nthe template over from right over here.\n\n524\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.320\nIt works the same way.\n\n525\n00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.760\nI could customize it.\n\n526\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.704\nThis template doesn't have any\ncustomizations associated with them really\n\n527\n00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:58.260\nthen all I do is create it.\n\n528\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.120\nI didn't make any changes to it.\n\n529\n00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.120\nSo if we wanna go ahead and\ncustomize it, we can go in and do that.\n\n530\n00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.540\nSo let's just go in and customize.\n\n531\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.590\nWe'll grab that.\n\n532\n00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.905\nAnd you'll notice then we get the\nopportunity here to configure hardware,\n\n533\n00:25:08.905 --> 00:25:10.937\noperating systems, things like that right.\n\n534\n00:25:10.937 --> 00:25:13.040\nSo if we go in and\nwe do browse here real quick.\n\n535\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.200\nWe'll go in and we can see, let me just\nbring this over here so you can see.\n\n536\n00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.780\nWe do see our template right there,\nthere's our Gen1 template.\n\n537\n00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.220\nNotice, even though I do have a gen two,\n\n538\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.070\nyou saw it, right, I did show it to you,\nit's not on this list, either.\n\n539\n00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.880\nBecause again, this pick list is\ngonna be following the same rules and\n\n540\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.280\nthe same restriction as this item\nright down here in this area.\n\n541\n00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.290\nWhich is hey,\nno Gen2 templates allowed right.\n\n542\n00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.680\nOnly the Gen1 templates, so\neven though I have a Gen2 template\n\n543\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.570\nsitting in the library there,\nin that area, I'm not gonna see it here,\n\n544\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.560\nI'm not gonna be able to use it, I'm only\ngonna get access to my Gen1 template.\n\n545\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.330\nSo we'll grab our Gen1 template,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n546\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.000\nGo ahead, we'll click Next.\n\n547\n00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.240\nWe then have our description here,\nMachine Tier.\n\n548\n00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.787\nNow I may decide to rename this and\ninstead of doing Machine Tier,\n\n549\n00:25:56.787 --> 00:26:04.276\nmaybe I'll go ahead and I'll call this,\nLet's say we're gonna do file or,\n\n550\n00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:09.774\nactually, better yet, instead of file,\nin print let's do web,\n\n551\n00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:16.860\nHosting, right, because this VM will be\na web server, let's say, hypothetically.\n\n552\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.580\nAnd so, we're gonna do that.\n\n553\n00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.461\nSo, you'll see here, prevent, or\nexcuse me, prevent this machine from being\n\n554\n00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:26.341\nautomatically migrated right, so we can\nspecify that it will stick where it is or\n\n555\n00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:29.480\nbe moved potentially with live\nmigration if we choose to do that or\n\n556\n00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.531\nstorage migration.\n\n557\n00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:32.330\nWe can control some of that.\n\n558\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.967\nThis machine tier can be scaled out.\n\n559\n00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:35.466\nSo what are we gonna do here?\n\n560\n00:26:35.466 --> 00:26:37.449\nWe're gonna specify as you can see.\n\n561\n00:26:37.449 --> 00:26:41.837\nWe can specify certain parameters that\nallow us to scale this machine up,\n\n562\n00:26:41.837 --> 00:26:45.681\nand enhance certain aspects of\nits performance, if required.\n\n563\n00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:48.630\nWe can go ahead and\ncreate an availability set for the tier.\n\n564\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.900\nSpecify how we're gonna deal\nwith availability parameters.\n\n565\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.006\nWe're not gonna worry about any of those\nproperties right now, but they are there,\n\n566\n00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:54.807\nand you can see them.\n\n567\n00:26:54.807 --> 00:26:56.116\nWe're gonna go ahead\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n568\n00:26:56.116 --> 00:26:59.381\nWe're then gonna get in and go under\nthe hood of it to the hardware and\n\n569\n00:26:59.381 --> 00:27:01.630\nthe operating system configuration.\n\n570\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.180\nThis is what we do using\nthese particular settings.\n\n571\n00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.011\nAnd you see I've already set it up so\nit's speced out for Hyper-V.\n\n572\n00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:11.423\nBut notice I could set this up and\nvalidate against Zen or\n\n573\n00:27:11.423 --> 00:27:15.851\nESX server deployment templates so\nthat we know this VM will be running or\n\n574\n00:27:15.851 --> 00:27:20.590\nwill be interacting with services and\ninfrastructure in one of those areas.\n\n575\n00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.380\nRemember we made the point in\nour earlier episodes that VMM\n\n576\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.970\nis the only product currently on the\nmarket SCVMM that can manage across all\n\n577\n00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.980\nthree of the big three if you\nwill of vendor platforms right.\n\n578\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.470\nCertainly Microsoft with\nHyper V Citrix with Zen.\n\n579\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.080\nAlthough Zen is a little\nbit further down the list.\n\n580\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.663\nCitrix has really made a change\nin their thought process and\n\n581\n00:27:40.663 --> 00:27:41.910\ndirection in recent years.\n\n582\n00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.180\nThey're focusing heavily on Zen desktop,\nZen app.\n\n583\n00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.855\nThose, they really Pioneer\nthey're famous for.\n\n584\n00:27:47.855 --> 00:27:51.639\nThey've done phenomenal work with, but\nthey're really moving away from the whole\n\n585\n00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:54.350\nzen server,\nwhole virtualization stacked concept.\n\n586\n00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.950\nAlthough, it's still\npart of there offering,\n\n587\n00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.840\nit's not as big a part of what they do\nanymore, but certainly the VMWare and\n\n588\n00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.060\nMicrosoft really are the two\nmajor competitors in this space.\n\n589\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.236\nAnd with CESX or CESI server capabilities\nhere as well, so we can highlight and\n\n590\n00:28:09.236 --> 00:28:10.959\nthen choose capability there.\n\n591\n00:28:10.959 --> 00:28:12.520\nWe've got our processors.\n\n592\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.670\nWe can go through and\n\n593\n00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.535\nchange out how our hardware\nconfiguration memory can be done here.\n\n594\n00:28:17.535 --> 00:28:19.132\nWe can set static or dynamic memory.\n\n595\n00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:22.760\nStatic memory, essentially hard coded,\nhey, of this amount.\n\n596\n00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.044\nDynamic, we'll go ahead and be able\nto bracket a range and say minimum or\n\n597\n00:28:27.044 --> 00:28:30.766\nmaximum, and essentially grow\nover time as our needs grow, or\n\n598\n00:28:30.766 --> 00:28:32.750\nour needs go up in terms of usage.\n\n599\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.158\nWe can do buffering and\nset up the buffering percentage here.\n\n600\n00:28:36.158 --> 00:28:40.650\nThe most important thing in the whole\nconfiguration area, a floppy drive.\n\n601\n00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.082\nSpecify that, set that up.\n\n602\n00:28:42.082 --> 00:28:45.580\nCuz you never know when you're\ngonna need that floppy.\n\n603\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.370\nWe have our com ports\nhere if we need those.\n\n604\n00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.570\nWe have our video adaptor.\n\n605\n00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:52.248\nWe can go through obviously and\nchange that out if we need to.\n\n606\n00:28:52.248 --> 00:28:55.971\nWe can add in remote FX 3D supports,\nwe can do 3D support for\n\n607\n00:28:55.971 --> 00:29:00.424\nhigh-end graphics, if you're doing\nthings like hard cam rendering,\n\n608\n00:29:00.424 --> 00:29:04.877\nif you're doing high-end graphics\nprograms or application workloads\n\n609\n00:29:04.877 --> 00:29:08.620\nthat will run in these VMs that\nrequire that kind of support.\n\n610\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.800\nWe do have it there.\n\n611\n00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.430\nAll the major vendors in the\nvirtualization stack these days support\n\n612\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.180\nsomething like this.\n\n613\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.297\nSo we have this we have, oops,\nlet's just scroll back up here.\n\n614\n00:29:18.297 --> 00:29:23.790\nWe do have our IDE versus SCSI drives\nsupports variety e drive here.\n\n615\n00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.695\nWe do have our hard drive here, our blank\nsmall VHDX template that I'm using.\n\n616\n00:29:27.695 --> 00:29:29.640\nYou can see it configured there 16 gigs,\n\n617\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.730\nyou're in production you probably\nwanna use the large VHDX right?\n\n618\n00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.690\nBecause the small one is just\nnot gonna really give you,\n\n619\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.495\nyou can't really run a VM with 16\ngigs you can barely install an OS.\n\n620\n00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:42.881\nAnd Microsoft Office today on that, and\nhave a couple of gigs left over for\n\n621\n00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:43.535\nlogging.\n\n622\n00:29:43.535 --> 00:29:45.043\nSo I'm just using this as a demo.\n\n623\n00:29:45.043 --> 00:29:48.662\nObviously clearly in the real world we'd\nbe setting up hard drives that are much,\n\n624\n00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:49.930\nmuch larger than this.\n\n625\n00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.300\nBut you can see this here, our virtual DVD\nso if you wanna load an ISO as part of\n\n626\n00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.560\nthis configuration, or mount something,\nwe would have it available to us here.\n\n627\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.320\nWe have our SCSI adaptor.\n\n628\n00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.133\nSo if we need to,\nwe can play around with our SCSI settings.\n\n629\n00:30:03.133 --> 00:30:06.606\nWe do have already configured\nout our network adaptor and\n\n630\n00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:10.728\nall of our different items here,\nmemory waiting, virtual Numa for\n\n631\n00:30:10.728 --> 00:30:14.680\nmemory spanning, CPU priority,\nthings of that nature.\n\n632\n00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.270\nBut we can also add in\nnew hardware if need be,\n\n633\n00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.170\nso maybe we need a secondary adapter.\n\n634\n00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.210\nMaybe we need another SCSI connector.\n\n635\n00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.760\nMaybe we secondary drive.\n\n636\n00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.530\nWho knows what we need.\n\n637\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.750\nIt's all sorts of stuff.\n\n638\n00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.950\nRemember this is just\nour stock template and\n\n639\n00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.610\nit may not be set up for the specificity\nof this particular deployment.\n\n640\n00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.010\nSo we can go through and\nwe can customize this as needed.\n\n641\n00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.070\nJust go add hardware, so new and\nyou can see we can add in Fiber channel,\n\n642\n00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.015\nnetwork adapter, DVD SCSI,\nhard drive, whatever the case may be.\n\n643\n00:30:42.015 --> 00:30:44.540\nWe can add those in,\nprogram them in as part of this.\n\n644\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.851\nWe'll just save this off as part of\nour configuration, and then we'll\n\n645\n00:30:47.851 --> 00:30:51.733\nbe able to go through and we'll be able to\nadd in and ultimately modify what we need.\n\n646\n00:30:51.733 --> 00:30:55.270\nOnce we're done with all this we'll\nmove to the operating system tier.\n\n647\n00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.730\nEssentially the same idea\nwith configuring the OS.\n\n648\n00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.080\nNotice that we have this set for\nserver 12 R2 standard.\n\n649\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.720\nNow up here, non-customization\nthat's requiring guest OS profile.\n\n650\n00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.041\nIf I wanna actually make changes,\nright, I can go in and\n\n651\n00:31:08.041 --> 00:31:10.953\nI can decide that I wanna\nmodify something here.\n\n652\n00:31:10.953 --> 00:31:14.963\nAnd I can go ahead and\nI can go in say, hey, admin password,\n\n653\n00:31:14.963 --> 00:31:19.470\ntime zone, whatever the case may\nbe these are all locked out.\n\n654\n00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.171\nBecause I am using\na template off the shelf,\n\n655\n00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:25.824\nI may not have the ability to\nbe able to modify every aspect.\n\n656\n00:31:25.824 --> 00:31:29.329\nI may wanna go in and\ndo a custom deployment start to finish and\n\n657\n00:31:29.329 --> 00:31:32.930\nbe able to bring in every aspect\nof this and modify what I want.\n\n658\n00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.810\nYou can see I can modify the hardware.\n\n659\n00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.276\nBut I may not be able to modify and\nadd all the roles and\n\n660\n00:31:37.276 --> 00:31:40.303\nsettings because up here,\nI'm not able to actually pull down,\n\n661\n00:31:40.303 --> 00:31:43.021\nas you can see, and\nmake a change to the guest OS profile.\n\n662\n00:31:43.021 --> 00:31:46.369\nSo, the guest OS is already\nconfigured out, but the hardware,\n\n663\n00:31:46.369 --> 00:31:48.360\nI can actually configure and modify.\n\n664\n00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.826\nThat's the customization piece\nthat we're looking at right now.\n\n665\n00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:54.229\nSo, we'll go through we'll\njust leave this intact.\n\n666\n00:31:54.229 --> 00:31:56.378\nWe'll then go ahead and\nwe'll specify we're done.\n\n667\n00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:57.321\nWe do have a script.\n\n668\n00:31:57.321 --> 00:31:59.130\nWe've talked about the scripts before.\n\n669\n00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.250\nYou could see them in here.\n\n670\n00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.110\nIf you go click, you'll be able to\nsee what the script looks like.\n\n671\n00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:08.480\nTo create this, it just goes through using\nPowerShell and does all setup for us.\n\n672\n00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.460\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll click Create.\n\n673\n00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.140\nAnd then you'll see as soon as this is\ndone, it happens almost immediately.\n\n674\n00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.260\nVery, very quick.\n\n675\n00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.510\nYou could see here, that we do now\nhave our service template up above.\n\n676\n00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.270\nWe have our machine tier here,\nfor web hosting.\n\n677\n00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.998\nWe've specified it out with our CPU,\nprocessor, configuration information, etc.\n\n678\n00:32:25.998 --> 00:32:27.546\nWhen I highlight on it, you'll notice,\n\n679\n00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:30.522\ncan we go full screen down at the bottom\njust so we could see the properties area?\n\n680\n00:32:30.522 --> 00:32:32.069\nAnd let me just drag this up,\n\n681\n00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:36.920\nmake this just a little bit bigger if I\ncan catch the edge of the window, there.\n\n682\n00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.730\nSee if I can do that.\n\n683\n00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.080\nSometimes, I'm able to.\n\n684\n00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.795\nSometimes, I'm not able to.\n\n685\n00:32:40.795 --> 00:32:43.170\nI can't just catch it so we're not\ngonna bother to try to do it right now.\n\n686\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.450\nBut you'll see down here,\nI could see the properties.\n\n687\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.128\nI could see just my general setup.\n\n688\n00:32:48.128 --> 00:32:51.430\nIf I wanna view all properties,\nI can go and grab this.\n\n689\n00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.020\nIf you'll notice, it brings me right\nback into the customization pages\n\n690\n00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.680\nthat I can just go through and\nI can start making changes again.\n\n691\n00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.250\nI wanna go and and I wanna take a look\nat that hardware configuration.\n\n692\n00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.790\nNo problem.\n\n693\n00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.950\nLet's go make a change.\n\n694\n00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.330\nAnd notice,\nour validation was successful by the way.\n\n695\n00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.900\nI can go in and\nI can modify here if need be.\n\n696\n00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.450\nLet's look at those custom properties,\nI have them put in the end.\n\n697\n00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.710\nWe do have the ability to\nadd custom properties.\n\n698\n00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.220\nThese are undeclared text areas that I\ncan essentially map as a property for\n\n699\n00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.130\nsomething.\n\n700\n00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.810\nSo I can use up to ten of them.\n\n701\n00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.250\nTen's one of those magic numbers for\n\n702\n00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.520\nMicrosoft, when we do things like property\nscreens or custom property fields.\n\n703\n00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.160\nTypically we get ten fields out of the\nbox, so it's normally a standard number.\n\n704\n00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.930\nSo I can go in, and\nI can manage my custom properties.\n\n705\n00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.610\nI don't have any selected, but\n\n706\n00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:38.950\nif I have generated properties outside,\nin the SCVMM console, I can bring them in.\n\n707\n00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.142\nAnd map them here for\nadditional items that I would like to use.\n\n708\n00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:45.430\nMaybe there's some sort of a property\nI wanna assign to this VM.\n\n709\n00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.560\nMaybe there's a unique tracking number.\n\n710\n00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.200\nMaybe there is a unique identifier of some\nkind based on my naming convention that\n\n711\n00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.722\nI might use that I wanna\nattach to this as I deploy.\n\n712\n00:33:54.722 --> 00:33:56.985\nAnd so that maybe something\nan asset attack, right?\n\n713\n00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:57.960\nI'm just trying to think\nof something like that.\n\n714\n00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.245\n&gt;&gt; Right, for inventory purposes.\n\n715\n00:33:59.245 --> 00:34:00.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just something like that.\n\n716\n00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.700\nMaybe I have a standard and so I wanna map\na custom property field and use that and\n\n717\n00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.630\nI can drop that in here as part\nof my deployment if I choose to.\n\n718\n00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.410\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; I do have\n\n719\n00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.900\nsettings where I can go in and\nspecify quota points here,\n\n720\n00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.990\nthat'll go towards the overall quota for\nthe users virtual machine allowance.\n\n721\n00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:21.110\nWe haven't really talked about quotas but\nI can actually specify users go in through\n\n722\n00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.570\nthe console and say, hey, you, as a user,\ngonna given this amount of resources.\n\n723\n00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.506\nYou actually have the ability to be able\nto run this number of VMs configured\n\n724\n00:34:29.506 --> 00:34:30.077\nthis way.\n\n725\n00:34:30.077 --> 00:34:34.481\nAnd we can specify that this deployment\nwill go against those users with a certain\n\n726\n00:34:34.481 --> 00:34:36.150\nnumber of points, right?\n\n727\n00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:40.525\nSo it's a system that essentially says,\nhey, if I give Cherokee twenty quota\n\n728\n00:34:40.525 --> 00:34:44.371\npoints to run VMs and this templated\ndeployment cost her ten points,\n\n729\n00:34:44.371 --> 00:34:48.085\nshe could essentially run this with\na combination of other virtual\n\n730\n00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:51.422\nmachines up to twenty points\nat any given time, actively.\n\n731\n00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:53.225\nAnd so that's what this represents.\n\n732\n00:34:53.225 --> 00:34:56.620\nSo we can go in and\nmodify our quota points if necessary.\n\n733\n00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.530\nAnd then whoever, ultimately,\n\n734\n00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.910\nwinds up being the owner of this, is\ngonna get dinged for those points, right?\n\n735\n00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.153\n&gt;&gt; So maybe, perhaps,\nthis is just my initial thought, here.\n\n736\n00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:08.245\nIf you knew the hardware that those\nend users were using, you could assign\n\n737\n00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:12.603\na particular quota level to a particular\nmake and model of a laptop or desktop so\n\n738\n00:35:12.603 --> 00:35:15.837\nthat they're not crashing\ntheir systems by overusing and\n\n739\n00:35:15.837 --> 00:35:18.034\npulling in too many virtual machines?\n\n740\n00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:20.560\nWould that be a useful purpose there?\n\n741\n00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, not quite that but\nbasically the same idea, yeah.\n\n742\n00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.060\nWe would use the quotas to be able to\nrestrict, and we're not really worried so\n\n743\n00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.180\nmuch about a user running it.\n\n744\n00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.458\nThe reason I said not quite,\n\n745\n00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:35.927\nyou're typically not gonna be deploying\nthese things to an end user laptop.\n\n746\n00:35:35.927 --> 00:35:38.718\nRight, what we're really worried about\nis for service deployments, right,\n\n747\n00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:41.360\nspecifically what we're looking at\nhere in VMs is a cloud service.\n\n748\n00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.461\nWe're thinking about deploying this\ninto a server running in the cloud.\n\n749\n00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:47.490\nIt's hosted real estate in a data center,\nright, traditionally.\n\n750\n00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.120\nAnd so you're absolutely right.\n\n751\n00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.740\nThe explanation is correct,\nbut what I would just augment,\n\n752\n00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.620\nI would change, is it's not so much,\nhey, the end user on a laptop.\n\n753\n00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.395\nIt's really more the service tier that\nwe're looking at in the data center on\n\n754\n00:35:59.395 --> 00:36:01.963\nthe hardware, the hosts,\nin other words, right?\n\n755\n00:36:01.963 --> 00:36:03.351\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we talk about,\n\n756\n00:36:03.351 --> 00:36:07.255\nwe don't wanna overburden the host by\nthrowing a whole bunch of VMs onto that\n\n757\n00:36:07.255 --> 00:36:08.292\nhost for this user,\n\n758\n00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:12.334\nwhen this user may suck the life out of\nthat host cuz they're running too much.\n\n759\n00:36:12.334 --> 00:36:13.896\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n760\n00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:17.928\nwe then can essentially inconvenience or\nburden or freeze out other users so\n\n761\n00:36:17.928 --> 00:36:20.290\nthat that have the host there as well.\n\n762\n00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.551\nWhat actually this is used for primarily\nand since she didn't bring it up,\n\n763\n00:36:23.551 --> 00:36:26.370\nbecause I'm gonna round out that\ncircle of explanation for us.\n\n764\n00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the way this is typically used,\n\n765\n00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:33.210\nprimarily anyway, where this is seen,\nis with cloud providers, right?\n\n766\n00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.851\nSo in the cloud, as we're talking\nabout a multi-tenant environment.\n\n767\n00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:38.158\nWe talked about this idea before where,\nand you're right.\n\n768\n00:36:38.158 --> 00:36:39.773\nIt is about resource usage and\n\n769\n00:36:39.773 --> 00:36:44.070\nvalidation of that against out limits\nto make sure we're not overconsuming.\n\n770\n00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:48.135\nBut it's really important when we're\nthinking about that from the perspective\n\n771\n00:36:48.135 --> 00:36:50.834\nof hey,\nif I'm the cloud service provider, right?\n\n772\n00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:55.741\nAnd I've got three or\nfour customers running in common hardware,\n\n773\n00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:58.553\nbecause this is very likely the case.\n\n774\n00:36:58.553 --> 00:37:01.265\nYou're gonna be running in\na multi-tenant scenario,\n\n775\n00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:04.450\nwhen you're hosting your cloud\nout at one of these data centers.\n\n776\n00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.810\nI'm not suggesting you can't pay\nextra to get dedicated hosting.\n\n777\n00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.880\nCustomers do that all the time,\nit's very common.\n\n778\n00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.545\nBut if you're doing the,\nhey, I want Office 365 for\n\n779\n00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:19.020\n$25 per month per user E3 plan along\nwith everybody else in the world,\n\n780\n00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.550\nyou're running on common infrastructure.\n\n781\n00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.170\nYou're not paying for dedicated hosting.\n\n782\n00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.970\nAnd that's where the bulk of cloud hosting\nis for many, many customers today.\n\n783\n00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.990\nWe do certainly have a very large\nsegment of customers doing dedicated\n\n784\n00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.880\nhosting right.\n\n785\n00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.100\nAnd they're paying extra for hardware\nthat's gonna be running nothing but\n\n786\n00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.970\ntheir stuff.\n\n787\n00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.220\nAnd then while quotas are still important,\nthey're not as important.\n\n788\n00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.390\nCuz we're not worried about, hey,\n\n789\n00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.500\nyou're sucking 50% of\nthe resources out of this host.\n\n790\n00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.240\nBut you're only paying for 30, and\n\n791\n00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.400\nwe've gotta make sure that you\nonly get what you pay for.\n\n792\n00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.940\nAnd so, when you're in\na multi-tennant environment and\n\n793\n00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.550\nyou're sharing infrastructure,\n\n794\n00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.720\nthat's when quotas really become very\nimportant to the cloud provider.\n\n795\n00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.480\nCuz this is essentially how they keep you\nhonest and how they make their money.\n\n796\n00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.766\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz you pay as you go, so\n\n797\n00:37:57.766 --> 00:37:59.636\nthat's exactly what we're\ndoing with this kinda stuff.\n\n798\n00:37:59.636 --> 00:38:00.457\n&gt;&gt; It makes perfect sense, yeah.\n\n799\n00:38:00.457 --> 00:38:03.306\n&gt;&gt; Or what the thought process would be,\nultimately, right?\n\n800\n00:38:03.306 --> 00:38:04.937\nAll right, so that's another high-five.\n\n801\n00:38:04.937 --> 00:38:06.243\nAwesome, that's two for this episode.\n\n802\n00:38:06.243 --> 00:38:09.333\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good job, you gotta keep that up,\n\n803\n00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:09.965\nI like that.\n\n804\n00:38:09.965 --> 00:38:12.480\nAll right, so we have here,\ncould we go back?\n\n805\n00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.500\nLet me just click.\n\n806\n00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.990\nI clicked and then I realized, hey, wait\na second, there's nothing on the screen.\n\n807\n00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.910\nSo let's just look at dependencies,\nreal quick.\n\n808\n00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.680\nYou can see here, on the Dependencies tab,\n\n809\n00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.620\nwe see all the library\nreferences that are resourced.\n\n810\n00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.273\nNow, we only brought in VHD\nas part of the demo so far.\n\n811\n00:38:26.273 --> 00:38:28.475\nSo we're not really seeing anything else,\nright?\n\n812\n00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:32.300\nWe haven't added in any of the other\napp profiles or things like that.\n\n813\n00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.094\nBut we see our blank VHD here.\n\n814\n00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:35.759\nNow I can click through here and\n\n815\n00:38:35.759 --> 00:38:38.920\nI can actually see\nthe configuration of a hard drive.\n\n816\n00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.156\nI could see how big it is.\n\n817\n00:38:40.156 --> 00:38:44.005\nLet me just move this over so you guys\ncan see that away from the box in box.\n\n818\n00:38:44.005 --> 00:38:45.605\nYou could see our blank hard drive.\n\n819\n00:38:45.605 --> 00:38:48.375\nWe could name it,\ngive it a release and a family.\n\n820\n00:38:48.375 --> 00:38:51.445\nWe don't have anything in there but\nwe could put something in if we want to.\n\n821\n00:38:51.445 --> 00:38:53.685\nWe can view equivalent resources.\n\n822\n00:38:53.685 --> 00:38:55.705\nSo if we go take a look,\nwe could specify and\n\n823\n00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:57.845\nsee if there are other\nresources that match this.\n\n824\n00:38:57.845 --> 00:39:00.895\nWe talked about equivalent objects\na little bit in one of the other episodes.\n\n825\n00:39:00.895 --> 00:39:04.005\nAnd you can see the size here and\nhow it will be provisioned out.\n\n826\n00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.660\nYou'll notice here our operating system,\nso\n\n827\n00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.340\nwe can go in, specify what OS\nwe're gonna be adding in, right?\n\n828\n00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.890\nThis is a blank template, by the way.\n\n829\n00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.630\nWe're not gonna do that here but\nwe're just showing you what could be done.\n\n830\n00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.080\nIt's validated for the Hyper-V platform.\n\n831\n00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.800\nSo we could see just all the properties\nassociated with these dependent objects\n\n832\n00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.950\nfrom the library.\n\n833\n00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.160\nAnd if there are any validation errors,\nwe don't have any.\n\n834\n00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.530\nWe saw the green circle for validation so\nwe know this profile checks out.\n\n835\n00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:35.693\nThis hardware, this OS configuration will\nrun as specced against a Hyper-V host and\n\n836\n00:39:35.693 --> 00:39:38.740\nit will be available and\nvalid, we can use it.\n\n837\n00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.092\nBut if we had errors, we would see them\nhere and we can interact with them.\n\n838\n00:39:41.092 --> 00:39:45.750\nSo we can go ahead and we can view\nall of our properties right here,\n\n839\n00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.541\nright above me, right?\n\n840\n00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:49.096\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n841\n00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:50.529\nRight there.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n842\n00:39:50.529 --> 00:39:52.631\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, right, right there.\n\n843\n00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:54.821\nI struggle to do that on\nalmost every episode.\n\n844\n00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.344\nAnd that was perfect cuz\nit's right above me.\n\n845\n00:39:56.344 --> 00:39:58.210\nI can actually reach up and grab that.\n\n846\n00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.550\nSo we actually bring up our\nproperties right there and see them.\n\n847\n00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.050\nAnd we can go ahead if we scroll down,\nwe just move down here so you can see.\n\n848\n00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.390\nWe see our nick at the bottom.\n\n849\n00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.986\nWe could actually see our nick properties,\nour IPV4 V6 and\n\n850\n00:40:09.986 --> 00:40:12.252\nMAC address template here and types.\n\n851\n00:40:12.252 --> 00:40:16.846\nAnd you could see the static or\ndynamic, and we could change that.\n\n852\n00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:19.203\nAnd go in, and\nwe could just modify those if needed.\n\n853\n00:40:19.203 --> 00:40:22.115\nSo you'll see that we can go in and\nplay around with all this and\n\n854\n00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:23.825\nsee what's going on in there.\n\n855\n00:40:23.825 --> 00:40:25.775\nAnd we're adding in all these items.\n\n856\n00:40:25.775 --> 00:40:29.005\nNow, we're gonna have to come back and\ntalk a little more about this.\n\n857\n00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:32.225\nAnd if I'm not mistaken, part two and\nprobably part four, five, and\n\n858\n00:40:32.225 --> 00:40:33.107\nsix at some point.\n\n859\n00:40:33.107 --> 00:40:34.645\nCuz we do have a lot to go through here.\n\n860\n00:40:34.645 --> 00:40:38.140\nWe're just scratching the surface\nwith service templates.\n\n861\n00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.290\nWe're gonna leave the demo environment up,\nwe're gonna leave it right where we are.\n\n862\n00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.280\nSo when we come back for the next\nepisode we'll do a little more talking,\n\n863\n00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.020\nlayout some more facts about some things.\n\n864\n00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.190\nGo back in and continue working\nthrough and taking a look at stuff.\n\n865\n00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.160\nBut we're gonna invite you to come\non back and take a look at them.\n\n866\n00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.968\nYou don't wanna miss that cuz you're\ngonna see how this all turns out.\n\n867\n00:40:53.968 --> 00:40:56.150\nAnd remember, Cherokee's gonna tap\ndance for us when we're done so\n\n868\n00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.288\nyou don't wanna miss that either.\n\n869\n00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Don't hold your breath.\n\n870\n00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.557\nAnd you know what, Adam,\nI do have to give you props also,\n\n871\n00:41:01.557 --> 00:41:04.944\nbecause I kinda gave up on giving\nhim the five minute warning here.\n\n872\n00:41:04.944 --> 00:41:09.209\nSo [LAUGH] he decided to take that and\nmake the decision to go ahead of me.\n\n873\n00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:10.622\n&gt;&gt; Now that you said that,\nI'm gonna keep going.\n\n874\n00:41:10.622 --> 00:41:11.930\nBring that screen back up.\n\n875\n00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.420\nWe're not stopping for anything.\n\n876\n00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:13.970\nI'm only kidding.\n\n877\n00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we do have a lot more\ninformation to cover, like Adam said.\n\n878\n00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.361\nSo stay tuned.\n\n879\n00:41:18.361 --> 00:41:21.422\nWe're gonna see multiple parts where\nwe continue to configure our cloud\n\n880\n00:41:21.422 --> 00:41:22.440\nservices here.\n\n881\n00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.570\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n882\n00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.600\nSo remember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n883\n00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.330\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n884\n00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.367\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n885\n00:41:30.367 --> 00:41:36.117\n[MUSIC]\n\n886\n00:41:36.117 --> 00:41:39.774\n&gt;&gt; Thank

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:08.417\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:12.018\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.283\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.577\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:21.537\nThis is actually a part two continuation\nof a discussion, where we were\n\n9\n00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:26.025\nhaving a look at configuring different\ntypes of private cloud deployments, and\n\n10\n00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.869\nwith us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studio.\n\n11\n00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.679\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.589\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n13\n00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.560\nAlways glad to be back, and\n\n14\n00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.774\nI'm glad that part one was such\na hit that you invited me back.\n\n15\n00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:36.326\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, what we have done?\n\n16\n00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:37.876\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise,\nI would have had other stuff to do now.\n\n17\n00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.848\nI could have been getting a coffee or\nwho knows what I would be doing.\n\n18\n00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:42.723\nSo, it's good to be back for\npart two, as they say.\n\n19\n00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:46.224\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\naround service templates, and\n\n20\n00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:49.385\nhow we use service templates and\nall supporting elements of them,\n\n21\n00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.279\nto drive our deployment of\na service into the private cloud.\n\n22\n00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:54.222\nSo we're going to go back in,\ntake a look at what we're doing.\n\n23\n00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:57.191\nBefore we go back into the console,\nwe are going to go into the machine,\n\n24\n00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:59.725\nbefore we go back there I just\nwanted to take us out on the web.\n\n25\n00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.278\nWe often as we try to do in most\nepisodes we'll inter-spurs some of the,\n\n26\n00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:07.609\nhey,here's where you find it, here's\nthe documentation, here's the knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.620\nA deep dive for\nMicrosoft you know where to go look for\n\n28\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.295\nsome follow up if\nnecessary thought process.\n\n29\n00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:17.201\nI want to take this out to show some of\nthe web pages from TechNet and also from\n\n30\n00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:21.115\nthe Azure documentation site that will\nbe helpful to us just to be aware of.\n\n31\n00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.986\nSo, let me just bring up the browser here,\nif we go ahead and,\n\n32\n00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:27.378\nlet me just click there, there we go.\n\n33\n00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:30.296\nWe could see How to Create\nan Application profile and\n\n34\n00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:34.022\nwe're talking through the logic\nof different kinds of profiles.\n\n35\n00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:37.964\nWe've been talking about application\nprofile so it's just one element and\n\n36\n00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:41.659\nI want to remind you all different\nkinds of profile that exist out here,\n\n37\n00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.027\nlet's go back over here.\n\n38\n00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:46.114\nAnd I'm gonna minimize the designer for\njust a minute.\n\n39\n00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:50.005\nBut you'll see that we have all of\nour profiles sitting over here.\n\n40\n00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.882\nAnd we're gonna talk about application\nprofiles in more depth here in\n\n41\n00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:53.522\njust a minute.\n\n42\n00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:56.857\nBut we have application profiles\nright at the top of the list,\n\n43\n00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:01.348\nin our library work space, right up under\nour resources here capability profile,\n\n44\n00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:04.576\nguest OS hardware physical\ncomputer SQL Server profiles.\n\n45\n00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:05.850\nAll these different profiles.\n\n46\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.206\nAnd we use them,\nas you've already seen as building blocks.\n\n47\n00:02:09.206 --> 00:02:13.123\nWe've talked about the guest OS and\nthe hardware profiles in our last episode,\n\n48\n00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:16.631\nas we're building out our service\ntemplate using the designer to bring\n\n49\n00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:20.335\nin those elements and deploy our machines\nhere so we could figure that out.\n\n50\n00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:23.243\nWe haven't deployed any of\nthe other parts yet but\n\n51\n00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.300\nwe've certainly been talking about them,\nand so.\n\n52\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.761\nWe go through and we want to be able\nto create an application profile.\n\n53\n00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.730\nWe're essentially configuring\nthe installation for or\n\n54\n00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.640\nthe instructions rather for\ninstalling an application, end-to-end.\n\n55\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.837\nAnd again, thank you Mr. console for\ntelling me you're connected once again.\n\n56\n00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:41.997\nAlways good when our console pops up and\nsays, hey, by the way,\n\n57\n00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:43.207\nyou can actually do stuff, right?\n\n58\n00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:44.397\nSo, we're going to be doing that.\n\n59\n00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.620\nAnd when we deploy the VM as\npart of the service, as you saw,\n\n60\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.846\nwe want to potentially add\napplications in on top of that and\n\n61\n00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:54.481\nuse those to configure what happens\nonce the VM itself is running.\n\n62\n00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.816\nSo, remember we talked\nabout the machine tier.\n\n63\n00:02:56.816 --> 00:03:00.133\nThat's the configuration of the hardware,\nthe guest operating system,\n\n64\n00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.724\nessentially the nuts and bolts of getting\nthe virtual machine stood up, right?\n\n65\n00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.558\nThat's what the machine tier is all about.\n\n66\n00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:09.205\nSo we're deploying a VM currently in\nour service design template there.\n\n67\n00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:10.292\nWe've got our networking tier.\n\n68\n00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:12.281\nI showed you the networking\narea at the bottom.\n\n69\n00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:17.145\nWe've got our network cards, right,\nand we have our static or dynamic IP,\n\n70\n00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:20.349\nV4, V6, Mac address,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.679\nAnd then, we're gonna have\ndifferent kinds of applications or\n\n72\n00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.722\ntypes of applications that we can use.\n\n73\n00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.943\nWe have server application\nvirtualization we call server app V.\n\n74\n00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:33.024\nWe’ll be talking about that in an upcoming\ndemo associated with these discussions,\n\n75\n00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:35.753\nafter we show you how to set up and\ninstall the sequencer.\n\n76\n00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:38.559\nAnd just talk through\nthe logic of Server App V.\n\n77\n00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.996\nBut we're using, if you're familiar with\nApp V in general, or just application\n\n78\n00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:46.986\nvirtualization, maybe from SCCMM,\nfrom the configuration management\n\n79\n00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:51.638\nproduct in Systems Center, where we can\ndeploy virtualized application packages.\n\n80\n00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:53.709\nWe are going in.\n\n81\n00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.085\nAnd I don't know if you remember many\nyears ago, some of you may remember,\n\n82\n00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:00.624\nbut Microsoft, among many companies\nMicrosoft's acquired over the years,\n\n83\n00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:03.358\nMicrosoft bought a company called\nExogrid many years ago and\n\n84\n00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:06.429\nthat's where they got the app\nvirtualization, technology from.\n\n85\n00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.590\nThey were the leader at the time in\nthe market for that technology and\n\n86\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.930\nthey've integrated that\ntechnology over time.\n\n87\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.395\nAnd now the App V and server App V\nproducts are really just an extension of\n\n88\n00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.712\nwhat that initial acquisition was.\n\n89\n00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:21.105\nApp V and server App V are very similar.\n\n90\n00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:24.423\nWe used App V on\nthe SCM Service Configuration.\n\n91\n00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.351\nThe System Center Configuration Manager\nproduct.\n\n92\n00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:30.782\nSo when we go in there, and\nwe do our application deployments,\n\n93\n00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:32.611\nwe could deploy an App V package.\n\n94\n00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:36.542\nThis is an application that is sequenced\nand sequencing is the secret or\n\n95\n00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.647\nthe trick here associated with this.\n\n96\n00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.461\nWe use a program called a sequencer.\n\n97\n00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:43.830\nWe deploy it as part of the setup\non the back end of the product, and\n\n98\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.727\nthe sequencer lets us go through and\ncapture the steps.\n\n99\n00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:51.259\nIt's almost like a macro recorder\nassociated with how we're going to deploy\n\n100\n00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.453\nthis application.\n\n101\n00:04:52.453 --> 00:04:55.751\nBut the trick is what we're\ncapturing is the memory states or\n\n102\n00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.856\nthe state of the application,\nthe registry settings and\n\n103\n00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:02.818\nthe instance information around\nthe application or the installation.\n\n104\n00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:05.811\nAnd we're gonna pull\nall that material out,\n\n105\n00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:09.608\ncreate a set of config files\nthat allow us to manage that.\n\n106\n00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:13.804\nAnd then we're going to package that up\nas an application virtualization package\n\n107\n00:05:13.804 --> 00:05:15.340\nApp V or server App V package.\n\n108\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.936\nAnd then,\nwe're going to deploy that application.\n\n109\n00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:23.522\nIn this case, we could deploy it as\npart of the App V service process,\n\n110\n00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:24.482\nif we want to.\n\n111\n00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:29.206\nAnd when we deploy that, either through\na design or rather a service template, or\n\n112\n00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:33.246\njust however we choose to do it,\nif we use that application template,\n\n113\n00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:34.547\nwhat we're doing is,\n\n114\n00:05:34.547 --> 00:05:39.285\nwe're deploying a virtualized instance of\nan application that can be set to run.\n\n115\n00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:42.382\nBut never installs locally,\nleaves a footprint behind.\n\n116\n00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:47.362\nRuns essentially in a memory bubble\ninside the host, whatever it is.\n\n117\n00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.776\nWhether it's a virtual machine or\nan endpoint, a desktop,\n\n118\n00:05:49.776 --> 00:05:53.009\nlike you were mentioning, Cherokee,\nin the last episode or whatever it may be.\n\n119\n00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.919\nAnd we have all of that information\nthat is contained in the configuration\n\n120\n00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.954\navailable, so we can drop that application\nin, run it, we can monitor it,\n\n121\n00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:02.609\nknow what's going on with it.\n\n122\n00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:05.386\nAnd then it's portable because,\nwhen we're done, we shut it down and\n\n123\n00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:06.838\nit doesn't leave anything behind.\n\n124\n00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:10.815\nAnd it's now part of a deployment that\ncan leapfrog through various systems and\n\n125\n00:06:10.815 --> 00:06:13.200\nbe set up and\nbe running exactly as configured.\n\n126\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.964\nThis is what App V is.\n\n127\n00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:16.384\nIt's really cool technology actually.\n\n128\n00:06:16.384 --> 00:06:20.698\nSo the server App V is just an extension\nof that into the server side here for\n\n129\n00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:24.805\nSCVMM for instance so we can use it\nto deploy applications as part of our\n\n130\n00:06:24.805 --> 00:06:28.092\ntemplates and\nactually have them running in our cloud.\n\n131\n00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:30.009\nThat's what Server App V allows us to do.\n\n132\n00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.237\nWe have Microsoft web\ndeployed applications.\n\n133\n00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:33.778\nWeb deployed applications.\n\n134\n00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:36.410\nI mentioned web deployed in\nthe introductory episode,\n\n135\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.202\nthe first episode in the series here.\n\n136\n00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:40.008\nSo if you haven't seen that,\nyou'll just go back,\n\n137\n00:06:40.008 --> 00:06:41.742\nat some point you'll hear\nme mention it quickly.\n\n138\n00:06:41.742 --> 00:06:45.749\nBut I talked about the idea that this\nis packaging up and giving with website\n\n139\n00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:49.569\napplications and synchronization\nof web applications across sites,\n\n140\n00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.702\ndifferent versions, you know six,\nseven, eight, that kind of thing, and\n\n141\n00:06:53.702 --> 00:06:57.105\nwe can run through,\nall of the applications and information.\n\n142\n00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:01.378\nGrab that and create a portable package\nagain that allows us to deploy that web\n\n143\n00:07:01.378 --> 00:07:02.768\napp out to any instance.\n\n144\n00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:05.584\nSo if we set up our machine tier\nto represent a web server and\n\n145\n00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:09.495\nthen we deploy that into the cloud along\nwith an application through web deploy,\n\n146\n00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:13.119\nwe've actually then got the ability to\nthrow that web service app directly\n\n147\n00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:14.871\ninto the cloud and have it running.\n\n148\n00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.820\nSo that's what that's gonna do for us,\nand we have the SQL Server data tier\n\n149\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.037\napplication, what are commonly called\nthe DAC DAC for data tier application.\n\n150\n00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:26.404\nThese define the SQL Server database\nengine, the schemas, the objects,\n\n151\n00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.874\nall the things associated\nwith the deployment of SQL.\n\n152\n00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:31.375\nI mentioned these quickly as\nwell in the last episode.\n\n153\n00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:36.045\nWe can set up and deploy, throw\na fully instantiated instance of SQL.\n\n154\n00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:39.401\nWe sys-prepped the SQL instance,\nalong with sys-prepping the OS here.\n\n155\n00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:42.901\nI'm sure you're familiar with sys-prep,\nand the concepts associated with it.\n\n156\n00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:44.693\nBut if you're not, just quickly,\nbecause you never know sometimes.\n\n157\n00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:46.383\nYou may never have used the sys-prep tool.\n\n158\n00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.625\nSys-prep tool is just a tool on the\noperating system side, that allows us to\n\n159\n00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:54.760\ngo through, after we create what we\ncommonly refer to as a golden master.\n\n160\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.235\nThat's just what we call the image.\n\n161\n00:07:56.235 --> 00:08:00.641\nBut we basically create a built out\nimage of a system we want to profile,\n\n162\n00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:02.700\nthat we want to use and save.\n\n163\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.230\nThis is going to be our machine.\n\n164\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.340\nEssentially, this configuration,\nserver 2012R2 Fully updated,\n\n165\n00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.850\ncouple of applications running on it.\n\n166\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.810\nAll the services that we need there,\n\n167\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.330\nHardin removing anything we don't want,\nright?\n\n168\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.460\nOur background setup,\nwe've done our vulnerability assessments,\n\n169\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.080\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.580\nIt's all there.\n\n171\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.510\nWe're then gonna shut that machine\ndown and say, okay, it's good.\n\n172\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.250\nWhat we're gonna do is,\njust take an image of that,\n\n173\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.800\nbecause that image is,\ncould either become, perhaps,\n\n174\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.870\nour .wm image, that ultimately, we want to\nuse through SSCM to be able to throw and\n\n175\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.170\ndeploy operating system\nimages into our environment.\n\n176\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.400\nWe're either gonna throw them into virtual\nmachines or throw them as VHDXs or\n\n177\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.270\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n178\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.805\nSo whatever that may be,\nwe're gonna use that image and\n\n179\n00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:51.755\nthat image has to be prepped, so\nthat way we remove all unique identifiers.\n\n180\n00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.999\nWe have to remove the acceptance of the U.\n\n181\n00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:56.365\n.\nWe have to generate a brand new Sid when\n\n182\n00:08:56.365 --> 00:09:00.361\nwe run that image and deploy it the next\ntime, so that it can be seen as unique and\n\n183\n00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:05.272\ninstantiated instance and not part of\nthe domain joined in with an object\n\n184\n00:09:05.272 --> 00:09:09.174\nidentifier and then we have a problem,\nwe have two instances of the same machine.\n\n185\n00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:14.491\nSo what sysprep does is it gives us\nthe tool set necessary to go through and\n\n186\n00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.301\nessentially gut the registry and\ntake out every unique identifier,\n\n187\n00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:20.891\nevery string that you could\nidentify that machine.\n\n188\n00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:24.351\nOur acceptance of the as I said, and\nthings like that, the machine name,\n\n189\n00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:25.311\nall that stuff is removed.\n\n190\n00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:29.671\nAnd then when we run a deployment wizard,\neither through, again, SCVMM,\n\n191\n00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:34.871\nif we run it through SCCM, Systems Center\nConfig Manager whatever the case may be,\n\n192\n00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:39.280\nwe're gonna be asked to go through\na wizard that asks us to provide those\n\n193\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.910\nunique identifying characteristics\nagain and import them or plant them or\n\n194\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.740\nsomehow join them together with the VM,\nwhat CIS Prep does.\n\n195\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.340\nSo we normally do CIS Prep on the OS and I\nknow most of you And probably a lot of you\n\n196\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.490\nare familiar with that, but you may or\nmay not know we also assist prep SQL,\n\n197\n00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.420\nat least in this case we will assist\nprep SQL to be able to deploy it.\n\n198\n00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.440\nSo we can create a fully\ninstantiated image of SQL and\n\n199\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.420\nwe can then run through assist prep on\nthe OS side and on the On the SQL side and\n\n200\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.100\nthen have an image that can be deployed\neither with SQL already set up,\n\n201\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.890\nready to go, in which case we're set or\nwe can go through and configure SQL.\n\n202\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.540\nCIS Prep would have essentially\njust a templated install\n\n203\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.940\nthat can then be used and customized,\nso we can throw SQL out and\n\n204\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.820\nconfigure it however we would like,\nwhen we do the deployment.\n\n205\n00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.620\nSo, we're able to do this, as well, with\nour SQL server data tier applications,\n\n206\n00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.540\nour DACS.\n\n207\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.380\nWe're going to do a walk through in\none of the upcoming demo episodes.\n\n208\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.000\nWe're actually going to show you\nhow to stack all this stuff up,\n\n209\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.840\nset up the profiles, and\nwork with all these different options,\n\n210\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.660\nincluding configuring the sequel Dax.\n\n211\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.540\nSo, you're going to see us go through and\nsee how to do that.\n\n212\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.175\nSo, what I'm showing you on the website,\nwe're going to go back in a minute Now,\n\n213\n00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:48.565\nwhat I'm showing you how the application,\nthought process application profiles\n\n214\n00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:52.195\nwere used to use the information about it,\nwe're talking this three application.\n\n215\n00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:55.635\nSo, let me this brings back up, Cherokee I\nknow wanted to throw out a question\n\n216\n00:10:55.635 --> 00:10:58.410\nreal quick So while you're asking,\nI'll just make sure we have this up and\n\n217\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.840\nthen I'll quickly go through and\nshow you this while we're talking.\n\n218\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo when you were talking about creating\n\n219\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.610\nthat sequel environment in earlier and\nprevious episode, you had given us\n\n220\n00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.120\ndefinitions by about the different types\nof cloud environment that were available.\n\n221\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.760\nSo if we look at something\nlike platform as a service and\n\n222\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.310\nwe provided that template of\nthe Sql database to our end user.\n\n223\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.330\nI just want to verify that\nthat would be perfect example\n\n224\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.600\nof platform as a service if they just\nhad there data entry to plug and chug.\n\n225\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.090\nThey might say hey I know\nI wanna Sql database,\n\n226\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.280\nI have no clue how to set one up.\n\n227\n00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.770\nAdam can you do it for me?\n\n228\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.750\n&gt;&gt; It could be platform as\na service it would depend\n\n229\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.570\non the requirements of the customer.\n\n230\n00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.400\nSo you said on your example,\n\n231\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.535\nthe customer really just wants to\nbe able to put their data in and.\n\n232\n00:11:44.535 --> 00:11:46.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then nothing else.\n\n233\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.390\nIf they were specific about SQL and\nthat's what they wanted then, yeah,\n\n234\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.510\nprobably pass would be a good explanation\nor a good way of thinking about it.\n\n235\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.990\nIf they came to us though and said,\nbecause I could easily change that with\n\n236\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.190\njust a little bit of a tweak and\nsay, okay this is really fast.\n\n237\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.510\nBecause if they came to us and\nsaid, hey I'm database agnostic,\n\n238\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.650\nI don't really care about the database,\nbut rather what I care about,\n\n239\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.060\nis you hosting for\nme your fully formed application.\n\n240\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.620\nAnd all I want is to be able to\naccess the front end, put my data in,\n\n241\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:20.220\ncontrol my user access and I want to\nbuy or rent time on sales force or\n\n242\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.850\nOffice 365 with SharePoint Online or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n243\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.120\nWe could see it described either way.\n\n244\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.200\nIn your example, you're right, it would\nbe passed based on how you described it,\n\n245\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.500\nno doubt about it.\n\n246\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.250\nBut we could also make\nthat into a SaaS model\n\n247\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.240\nif we abstracted away the specificity\nof the database and just said,\n\n248\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.250\nwhat I really need is an application\nservice as opposed to just the database.\n\n249\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.962\nAnd I want some broader, in other words,\nmore accomplishing but I want you Mr.\n\n250\n00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:45.630\nand Mrs.\nCloud Provider to run that for me.\n\n251\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n252\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.950\nwe could walk it up or down the stack\ndepending on how we choose to do it.\n\n253\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.230\nIf we wanted to strip it down\none more layer below pass,\n\n254\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.790\nwe could say they came and said, hey, all\nI need are just the servers to run it on.\n\n255\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.530\nAnd I don't even care about anything else\nbecause I'm gonna build it all out myself\n\n256\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.657\nas the customer.\n\n257\n00:13:00.657 --> 00:13:01.386\nMr. and Mrs.\n\n258\n00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:04.760\nClaverod, give me the hardware\nconfigured this way then it would IaaS.\n\n259\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.540\nSo we could see it assign to a theory any\none of those three service modules depends\n\n260\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.000\nhow you chose to have\nthe conversation with us.\n\n261\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.570\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n262\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.920\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou hit is right in the middle there so\n\n263\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.903\nit was kind of the past thought process.\n\n264\n00:13:14.903 --> 00:13:17.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's absolutely correct.\n\n265\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.220\nSo if we take a look or\n\n266\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.120\ngo back and take a look,\nhow to create the application profile.\n\n267\n00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.500\nSo this is just going to give us some\nbackground information very high level,\n\n268\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.390\non how to create these application\nprofiles like I was suggesting,\n\n269\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.270\nwe can right click on the application\nprofile under the workspace.\n\n270\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.970\nAnd then choose which one we want, just a\nlittle bit of guidance on each one, you go\n\n271\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.760\nthrough and configure the appropriate\none based on what you're doing but\n\n272\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.590\nyou'll notice down here.\n\n273\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.810\nIt's the reason I like this particular\npage, it then takes us out and shows up\n\n274\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.360\nhow to set up service templates How to\ncreate profiles and templates in VMM.\n\n275\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.520\nSo all the additional supporting\nelements that we were talking about,\n\n276\n00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.960\nplus the guest OS profiles here.\n\n277\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.980\nSo how to create a SQL Server profile for\na service deployment.\n\n278\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.600\nAll the stuff we've been talking about,\nor will talk about,\n\n279\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.260\nare all right here off this page.\n\n280\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.590\nSo going here,\nthis will give you the understanding\n\n281\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.310\nof how to interact with all\nthe information necessary.\n\n282\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.100\nWe talked about web deployment as well,\nthe web deploy tool that is here.\n\n283\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.230\nYou'll be able to go in and look at how\nto download and install Web Deploy.\n\n284\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.730\nIt is a tool.\n\n285\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.800\nYou do have to download it separately, but\nyou'll see we have download options here.\n\n286\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.760\nYou can go in and you can just follow\nthe guidance here about where to find it.\n\n287\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.860\nThere is specific guidance for hey,\nget the right version for the OS.\n\n288\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.240\nYou gotta run the 64-bit or\n32-bit depending on what you're doing.\n\n289\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.790\nYou know a lot of times you're on 32 or\nyou're on a 64 bit platform.\n\n290\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.280\nI'm just starting to\nrefer to the on the app.\n\n291\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.760\nIt works well enough, no big deal.\n\n292\n00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.990\nYou acknowledge this one.\n\n293\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.260\nYou gotta run the right version.\n\n294\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.780\n64 bits work on 64, 32 bits work on 32.\n\n295\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.590\nYou get strange results and errors if\nyou try to run s 32 bits on the 64.\n\n296\n00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.350\nSo make sure you're familiar with that.\n\n297\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.840\nMaybe to tell you specifically that\nyou do after run the appropriate\n\n298\n00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.690\nversion based on the operating\nsystem that you are gonna use.\n\n299\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.000\nJust follow that guidance.\n\n300\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.050\nYou do have some options here.\n\n301\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.710\nYou'll see we have components that\nare configured, the deployment framework,\n\n302\n00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:08.080\nthe IS manager UI, the IS set of\ndeployment handler, the non-adminstration,\n\n303\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.770\ntemplate for deployment,\nthe management service UI, etc.\n\n304\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.960\nSo you wanna just read up on this a little\nbit to understand the moving parts here.\n\n305\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.320\nBut once you get it all set up,\nit tells you how to do the install.\n\n306\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.210\nIt's very straightforward.\n\n307\n00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.400\nYou basically just unpack the MSI and\nrun it.\n\n308\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.010\nAnd then you choose your setup type.\n\n309\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.070\nAnd then you're able to,\nonce you're done, go in and configure it.\n\n310\n00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.110\nWe just got some guidance down\nhere on the various versions.\n\n311\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.360\nBut it does, also, at the bottom,\ngive you a little overview of the tool.\n\n312\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.670\nGives you a little introduction.\n\n313\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.410\nI think we're just on the tool install.\n\n314\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.280\nBut we have the key concepts and\nfeatures, requirements, limitations.\n\n315\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.550\nI encourage you to take a look at that.\n\n316\n00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.510\nHey, what can we do with this,\n\n317\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.240\nhow do we do it, where will it run,\nhow will it work?\n\n318\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.827\nThese are some things that,\nif you haven't done web deploy before,\n\n319\n00:15:47.827 --> 00:15:49.667\nwould probably be helpful for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n320\n00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:53.916\nThis tool, as I said, is used to\npackage up, to move and make portable,\n\n321\n00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:58.248\nweb applications between servers,\nbetween IIS servers specifically.\n\n322\n00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:01.492\nAnd we can sync between those\nservers as well, using this tool.\n\n323\n00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:06.204\nSo it's the purview of web app developers\nand web app administrators primarily,\n\n324\n00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:09.150\nnot suggesting you shouldn't\nlearn how to use it.\n\n325\n00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.060\nQuite the opposite.\n\n326\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.580\nI think you should, even if you don't do\nthose things, but you may not be doing\n\n327\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.300\nthem normally, and as a result you\nmay not have heard of this tool.\n\n328\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.440\nMay not have used it before.\n\n329\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.870\nSo it may take a little familiarity time\nfor you, right, to get used to it and\n\n330\n00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.780\nunderstand it.\n\n331\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.480\nBut when we run the tool we have\nthe option to do import server or\n\n332\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.950\nsite packages, cuz we can essentially\ngrab an entire website and bring it in.\n\n333\n00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.690\nWe can also export those packages.\n\n334\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.300\nSo we could import one\nfrom another site or\n\n335\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.480\nwe could export to give\nit to somebody to import.\n\n336\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.590\nThat's the whole website,\neverything in there.\n\n337\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.600\nSo if you have one, if you go grab\na server you will grab all the websites on\n\n338\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.145\nthe server and export all of them\nif you do it at the server level.\n\n339\n00:16:47.145 --> 00:16:49.860\nBut we can do an individual\nsite if necessary.\n\n340\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.145\nWe also have the ability to be able\nto import or export applications,\n\n341\n00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:56.670\nan individual instance of a web app from\nwithin there, and so we can reach in and\n\n342\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.850\ngrab one or reach in and\ngrab everything sitting there, and\n\n343\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.835\nthen once we get that we get this output\nessentially, from import, in a zip file.\n\n344\n00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:06.525\nSo, it's in a zip file format.\n\n345\n00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.815\nThat zip file is just portable,\nright, just take it and\n\n346\n00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:10.335\nmove it over where you need to put it.\n\n347\n00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:14.475\nWe then, where we will want to put it is,\nimport it into the VMM library and we want\n\n348\n00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:18.875\nto bring that in, that will be made\navailable as a resource in the library.\n\n349\n00:17:18.875 --> 00:17:20.935\nSo what we're gonna do is just\ngo back in here a minute,\n\n350\n00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:25.760\nlet me just fix my timer real quick, so\nwe keep the lab configuration running.\n\n351\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm glad you remembered that.\n\n352\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.430\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Cherokee will absolutely cry\nif we have to start over again, and\n\n353\n00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.080\nreconfigure everything.\n\n354\n00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.330\nSo in our library, right,\nwe would come in here, and\n\n355\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.010\nwe'd be able to add this in,\nas just a resource here.\n\n356\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.390\nThe zip file that we're talking about,\nand once we have that available,\n\n357\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.520\nthen when we add it in, we can add\nthe package into our app profile.\n\n358\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.350\nSo we'd be able to come up here,\ngo to our app profile.\n\n359\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.625\nLet's just click there.\n\n360\n00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:52.350\nRight-click create app profile, right?\n\n361\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.330\nAnd then you'll see here,\nwe'll go through.\n\n362\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.840\nWe're not gonna go\nthrough the whole thing.\n\n363\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.014\nWe'll just give it a name\nhere just as a demo,\n\n364\n00:18:00.014 --> 00:18:03.790\nand then you'll see we'll go through.\n\n365\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.180\nGo ahead, click, whoops,\ndon't want to do that.\n\n366\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.650\nLet's click app configure click,\nthere we go app configuration, and\n\n367\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.960\nthen, what we'll do is we'll be able\nto go in and you'll see add here, and\n\n368\n00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.970\nwe'll be able to go in and\nadd the kind of application that we want.\n\n369\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.850\nSo the script application, or DAC,\n\n370\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.130\nremember we talked about\nSQL Server data tier app.\n\n371\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.000\nIs it a virtual app?\n\n372\n00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.730\nWe're talking about Server App-V.\n\n373\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:25.330\nIs it a web app?\n\n374\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.400\nThis is where we bring\nin the web app package.\n\n375\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.520\nThe export of web deploy,\nthe zip file, we would do that, right.\n\n376\n00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.030\nSo we would click there.\n\n377\n00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.260\nWe would then have to out and\nbrowse for that web app package, and\n\n378\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.280\nit would have to be loaded as\na resource in the library.\n\n379\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.770\nOnce we have it up as a file\nin the library share,\n\n380\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.990\nwe would just bring it in\nput into our library share.\n\n381\n00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.480\nRemember we should,\nwe have to configure the storage here, and\n\n382\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.110\nadd storage into the library.\n\n383\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.940\nWe would drop it into that\nfolder that's available to us\n\n384\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.100\nthat's hosting the backend\nstorage on the library.\n\n385\n00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.810\nIf you don't remember how to do that or\nnot familiar with it, go back,\n\n386\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.765\ntake a look at that episode where\nwe configure the storage fabric,\n\n387\n00:18:57.765 --> 00:19:01.160\nthat's what the name of the episode was,\nand we show you how to set up where you\n\n388\n00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.530\nwould put this, and you would\nobviously add that zip file in there.\n\n389\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.550\nIt would then be available to you here.\n\n390\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.300\nYou grab it and then off you go because\nthat zip file has all the configuration\n\n391\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.740\nfiles associated with it and it's set up,\nand then you're gonna be able to read\n\n392\n00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.910\nthose in and actually add this app\npackage, this web app package in as part\n\n393\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.640\nof our deployment when we create our app\nprofile because then, let's just assume\n\n394\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.860\nfor a minute that we have our app profile,\nnow clearly, we're not gonna add it in.\n\n395\n00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.870\nSo we're not gonna have one.\n\n396\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.320\nI'm gonna cancel out of here.\n\n397\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.860\nBut I'm gonna show you\nwhat this would look like.\n\n398\n00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.600\nLet's go back to our\nservice template here.\n\n399\n00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.360\nLet's go up here where we were and\nwe've got our service template, our QA.\n\n400\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.910\nLet's just open up our designer.\n\n401\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.300\nSo we're just gonna open\nthe designer back up right here.\n\n402\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.100\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n403\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.300\nI think I'm not mistaken,\nthat we already have our designer open.\n\n404\n00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.630\nBut let's just open it again.\n\n405\n00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.320\nI think I left it open\ndown on the bottom there.\n\n406\n00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.500\nIf I'm not mistaken I believe I did.\n\n407\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.550\nYeah, it is open down there.\n\n408\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.439\nLet's just do this.\n\n409\n00:19:57.439 --> 00:19:59.007\nSo we can get there.\n\n410\n00:20:02.218 --> 00:20:03.250\nThere we go right there.\n\n411\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.960\nAll right so there's our designer and\nthen what we would do here right,\n\n412\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.970\nadd application or\nhost template in here, pull down and\n\n413\n00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.390\nyou could see we can do SQL Server or\nWeb Server.\n\n414\n00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.970\nI could add in a host, now when I go to\ndo this, it's gonna say, hey, by the way,\n\n415\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.000\nyou don't have any templates available.\n\n416\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.880\nIt hasn't been configured out because\nwe didn't do those parts out.\n\n417\n00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.980\nWe don't have those profiles yet.\n\n418\n00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.520\nBut I would bring this in here, and\nI can add in the appropriate items.\n\n419\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.910\nSo you'll see I can add in our web server.\n\n420\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.410\nYou'll see application host templates that\nsupport application profiles are not,\n\n421\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.880\njust wait for the connected item to\ngo away, are not available here, but\n\n422\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.900\nhad I finished my configuration of the app\nprofile, that I was just showing you,\n\n423\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.640\nI would then be able to grab that\nweb app and bring it in here.\n\n424\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.630\nIt's the same thing if I add the SQL one.\n\n425\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.850\nI'd have to set up my SQL DAC in that\nprofile that I was showing you and then\n\n426\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.320\nhave it available, and I would be able to\ngrab it here and drop it in on the page.\n\n427\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.210\nThis is how I import the application\nprofiles and bring them in for\n\n428\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.460\ndeployment as part of the service design,\nand then I throw this out into the cloud.\n\n429\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.500\nI've got my machine.\n\n430\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.439\nI've got my network.\n\n431\n00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:08.425\nI've got my application or applications,\nmy SQL server, my web server,\n\n432\n00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:12.095\nall that's configured here, and\nit's all set up, ready to go, and\n\n433\n00:21:12.095 --> 00:21:14.420\nit will become part of my deployment.\n\n434\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.585\nSo I'd be able to bring that in and\nlink that here very easily,\n\n435\n00:21:17.585 --> 00:21:22.495\nonce I'm doing this and once I bring\nthat in and include it in my template,\n\n436\n00:21:22.495 --> 00:21:26.165\nzip it up, literally, as I was saying,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n437\n00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:27.735\nSo we're back in our template,\n\n438\n00:21:27.735 --> 00:21:30.620\nsince we're talking about this and we just\ntalked about web-deploying everything.\n\n439\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.000\nLet me just quickly show you one thing\nhere, and we'll go back at it, and\n\n440\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.590\nwe'll finish talking about a couple\nof the other things out on the web.\n\n441\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.200\nSo we've got our service design\ntemplate stood up here so far.\n\n442\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.950\nWe've got our service,\nwe've got our machine tier here.\n\n443\n00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.320\nGot web tier on the brain now\nthat I'm typing up web apps.\n\n444\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.240\nSo we've got all that right and\nwe've added in a release, I showed you\n\n445\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.040\npotentially how we would add in one of our\nweb server or SQL server items, right?\n\n446\n00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.850\nEven though we're not gonna do\nthis as part of the discussion\n\n447\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.510\nwe're having right now.\n\n448\n00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.720\nBut you could see where\nwe would have them in.\n\n449\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.110\nWhen we're done we're all set and\nready to go, right?\n\n450\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.740\nWhat we could do is we could go ahead and\nSave and Validate this.\n\n451\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.930\nSo let's just go ahead Save and\nValidate, we'll just do that real quick.\n\n452\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.360\nIt saves it all for us.\n\n453\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.090\nSo, it's ready to go.\n\n454\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.900\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll close the designer out.\n\n455\n00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.170\nLet's bring our console\nback up full size here, and\n\n456\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.770\nthen we have our template all set,\nready to go, our status is okay, and then,\n\n457\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:28.120\nas we said,\nwe could use our deployment item here,\n\n458\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.625\nif we wanna configure deployment, we could\ngo through, and we could configure our\n\n459\n00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:36.075\ndeployments like the name and destination\nfor the new service instance, right?\n\n460\n00:22:36.075 --> 00:22:38.985\nAnd then we could actually\nuse this to deploy\n\n461\n00:22:38.985 --> 00:22:41.925\nthis particular in this case this\nVM really, I'm done much with it,\n\n462\n00:22:41.925 --> 00:22:46.115\nthere's so many else, but our VM and\ntheory are services, right, or web app,\n\n463\n00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:49.915\nand all that kind of stuff would all\nbe configured for deployment here, and\n\n464\n00:22:49.915 --> 00:22:54.210\nthen once we have that set up, we'll then\nbe able to actually use this and go out\n\n465\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.730\nand say, hey i want this to be deployed\nat this time or whatever the case may be.\n\n466\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.749\nSo we would be able to actually\ndrive this deployment and\n\n467\n00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:05.090\nbe able to use this to deploy out\nour search deployment configuration.\n\n468\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.380\nRight up here you can see we\ndont have any configuration\n\n469\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.800\nsetup cuz we haven't actually\nteed up any deployments, but\n\n470\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.940\nif we set one up this is where\nwe will come and see it.\n\n471\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.570\nWe would be able to interact with it.\n\n472\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.235\nIf I had clicked, just named it there, and\n\n473\n00:23:16.235 --> 00:23:20.190\nclicked OK, we'd ultimately have it show\nup and we'd be able to work with it here.\n\n474\n00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.880\nSo, this is that whole circle that we're\ncoming back to, in terms of putting\n\n475\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.010\neverything together and trying to show you\nhow all these different moving parts and\n\n476\n00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.040\npieces are gonna be available to us.\n\n477\n00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.870\nWe've talked about these\ndifferent profiles.\n\n478\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:31.950\nI've talked about applications.\n\n479\n00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.380\nYou've seen the guest OS, the hardware.\n\n480\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.470\nWe've talked about physical computer and\ncapabilities before.\n\n481\n00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.110\nWe've also talked about\nSQL server profiles.\n\n482\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.710\nLet's just quickly show\nyou one thing in here.\n\n483\n00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:49.460\nWe'll just give this a name,\nITProTV SQL 1 and\n\n484\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.630\nthen, we'll go to our\nSQL Server Configuration.\n\n485\n00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.600\nYou'll notice here,\nAdd SQL Server Deployment.\n\n486\n00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.808\nWe go in here, and I did demo this I think\none of the earlier episodes quickly.\n\n487\n00:23:59.808 --> 00:24:00.864\nWe kind of walked through and\n\n488\n00:24:00.864 --> 00:24:03.160\ntook a look at it when I showed\nyou all the different profiles.\n\n489\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.611\nWe were clicking through and\nquickly showing you more or\n\n490\n00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:07.027\nless how they could be created.\n\n491\n00:24:07.027 --> 00:24:09.791\nYou can see that we would go through.\n\n492\n00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:11.847\nWe would have a named instance here.\n\n493\n00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:15.482\nAn instance ID, product key,\nour run as account, our time out.\n\n494\n00:24:15.482 --> 00:24:18.830\nWe would then we able to go through,\ndo our configuration.\n\n495\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.640\nWho's the SA?\n\n496\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.430\nOr what will be the SA account.\n\n497\n00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.660\nWe'll have to add that in.\n\n498\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.800\nWhat kind of security we're using,\nWindows authentication or SQL Server, so\n\n499\n00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.020\nwe'll specify how we're gonna do that.\n\n500\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.540\nThen we'll specify our TCP IP form\nof connections, our name types,\n\n501\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.295\nall the plumbing, in other words all\nthe stuff we have to do to connect in.\n\n502\n00:24:36.295 --> 00:24:37.225\nSo we'll set all that up.\n\n503\n00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:40.105\nIf we have a config file to\nscript the installation for\n\n504\n00:24:40.105 --> 00:24:43.235\nthe configuration, the collation and\nall the different settings.\n\n505\n00:24:43.235 --> 00:24:46.245\nWe could actually browse out, get that,\nbring that in and apply that here,\n\n506\n00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:47.295\nif need be.\n\n507\n00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:49.840\nAnd we can detail out our\nservice accounts as well.\n\n508\n00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.480\nSo all of the specificity around setting\nup SQL, as I said, we can deploy a fully\n\n509\n00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.090\nstood up, fully configured instance\nby setting up here our profile and\n\n510\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:04.660\nthen applying that profile as essentially\na transform onto a generic instance.\n\n511\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.010\nAnd we reconfigure it, and\nthen we have it look like this.\n\n512\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.010\nSo we're able to go through and do all\nthis if we want to do our SQL deployment.\n\n513\n00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.410\nSo this is what our SQL deployment for\n\n514\n00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.090\nour SQL profile will actually look like\nsince we've been talking about that.\n\n515\n00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.337\nSo we've been in here, when we want to go\nin and we talked a bit about server app\n\n516\n00:25:22.337 --> 00:25:25.420\nmentioned it, but we didn't really show\nyou the information about sequencing.\n\n517\n00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.510\nI explained the concept of sequence but\nI didn't really-\n\n518\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.030\n&gt;&gt; You said it was important.\n\n519\n00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.576\n&gt;&gt; I said it was important.\n\n520\n00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:30.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so and it is.\n\n521\n00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.510\nRight?\nBut I didn't really go in and show you or\n\n522\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.370\nexplain them into you.\n\n523\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.140\nRemember, in a separate demo\nwe're gonna do coming up\n\n524\n00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.460\nafter this episode we're gonna actually\nwalk through how to set up server app so\n\n525\n00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.120\nwe're not gonna take\na look at it right now.\n\n526\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.520\nSo I'm gonna do a separate stand alone\nepisode as a demo specifically just to\n\n527\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.190\ninstall the sequencer and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n528\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.130\nBut the sequenced application\ninformation is here, the logic of it.\n\n529\n00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:55.685\nWe go through, and once we have the app,\nor excuse me, the server app,\n\n530\n00:25:55.685 --> 00:25:58.145\nthe setup and the sequencer installed.\n\n531\n00:25:58.145 --> 00:26:02.525\nIt's a product, it just instantiates in\nthe application there we would browse for,\n\n532\n00:26:02.525 --> 00:26:04.245\nwe open it up, we run it,\nas you can see there.\n\n533\n00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:07.765\nWe're then going to be able to create\na virtual application package, so\n\n534\n00:26:07.765 --> 00:26:09.535\nit's very straightforward to do.\n\n535\n00:26:09.535 --> 00:26:12.305\nAs I said,\nif you've done any SCVM work with that,\n\n536\n00:26:12.305 --> 00:26:15.185\nyou're gonna recognize this and\nhave a good sense with this.\n\n537\n00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:17.220\nIt's not gonna be too\ndifficult to walk through.\n\n538\n00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.600\nIf you haven't done it before,\nit'll be interesting for you.\n\n539\n00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.620\nAnd I certainly encourage\nyou to take a look at it.\n\n540\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.460\nBut it's not very hard to use,\nit's very, very simple to use, actually.\n\n541\n00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.960\nWe'll go through here, so you can see it.\n\n542\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.700\nThis kind of runs us through\nthe thought process associated with it.\n\n543\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.320\nBut why I like this page,\nagain, down here.\n\n544\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.980\nAnd by the way,\nremind me to help you out with this.\n\n545\n00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.460\nRemember you asked me,\nwhat the heck is that thing?\n\n546\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you what it's for.\n\n547\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.210\n&gt;&gt; You know?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.\n\n548\n00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; It took me five minutes last night.\n\n549\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.780\nI sat down and said,\nI gotta have a better answer.\n\n550\n00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.250\nThis is a sort of random aside by the way,\nfor our episode.\n\n551\n00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.650\nSo Cherokee came and asked me, just kind\nof out of the blue before we got started.\n\n552\n00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.290\nNot now, but earlier, hey,\n\n553\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.380\nthere's this crazy little icon thing\nthat shows up on certain web pages.\n\n554\n00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.160\nThis anchor, I have no clue what it\ndoes and do you know what it does?\n\n555\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.890\nAnd I said I don't really have a clue\neither because I've never seen it before.\n\n556\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.170\nAnd I never really paid attention to it.\n\n557\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.760\nBut I actually sat down and because\nI have absolutely nothing else to do,\n\n558\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.820\nafter we get done shooting.\n\n559\n00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.300\nI sat down and I actually figured it out.\n\n560\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.570\nSo I will tell you what it is.\n\n561\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.380\nNow that I've said that though,\n\n562\n00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.810\nprobably everybody else out there is\nlike well come on, tell us what it does.\n\n563\n00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just tell us.\n\n564\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.000\n&gt;&gt; So you can see here.\n\n565\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.900\nAnd if you hover, you can kind of see it.\n\n566\n00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.230\nRight click here, copy in link for\nthis section specifically.\n\n567\n00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.860\nThe anchor is a placeholder so\n\n568\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.290\nthat instead of linking to the page,\nfor like, probably I'm guessing.\n\n569\n00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Multi step processes, like.\n\n570\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.210\n&gt;&gt; More like, I'm thinking, just if you\nwanna throw something out on Twitter or\n\n571\n00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.440\nwhatever social media, like if you\nwant a link and say, and by the way,\n\n572\n00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.520\nit's right here as opposed to link\nto the page but rather this section.\n\n573\n00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Right,\ninstead of scrolling to the step, yeah.\n\n574\n00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.910\n&gt;&gt; That's what it's for is to anchor\nthe link at that specific spot.\n\n575\n00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; So I guess that's why they're\n\n576\n00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.970\npopping up because it's seemingly random.\n\n577\n00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.770\nThere's like some on some pages but\nthen they're in different places and\n\n578\n00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.080\nI guess it's how they chunk or break out\nthe wire frame for the page probably.\n\n579\n00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.740\n&gt;&gt; And now we know.\n\n580\n00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.193\n&gt;&gt; And so now we know.\n\n581\n00:27:51.193 --> 00:27:52.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And with that,\n\n582\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.194\nwe are done because there is nothing\nelse to say about private cloud because\n\n583\n00:27:56.194 --> 00:27:57.170\nthe anchor was it.\n\n584\n00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.270\nWe anchored our knowledge and\n\n585\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.380\nnow we've got everything we need,\nwe know how to do it.\n\n586\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.560\n&gt;&gt; So you're sailing from here on out?\n\n587\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.080\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna give a link to this piece\n\n588\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.900\nof knowledge right here and\nthen you, it's like.\n\n589\n00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.252\nI would say that's movie but\nyou wouldn't know what I'm talking about.\n\n590\n00:28:09.252 --> 00:28:09.818\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n\n591\n00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:11.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we're just take a look and\n\n592\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.570\nit was just down here as I was\nsaying with the App Vista.\n\n593\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.020\nIt was nice because they gave\nus links over here basically.\n\n594\n00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.250\nThey give us links to all the different\nelements of how we do the sequencing.\n\n595\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.950\nSo we're gonna be able to take a look and\njust see all the information associated\n\n596\n00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.070\nwith how to actually run the sequencer and\nwhat we do with it, which is nice.\n\n597\n00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.970\nThe sequencer, as I said,\nis really what makes the magic happen.\n\n598\n00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.890\nIt is what allows us to take that\napplication, record its installation, and\n\n599\n00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.260\nthen grab those files, bundle them up,\nput them into a protected bubble.\n\n600\n00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.940\nAnd then deploy them so\nwe can run them that way.\n\n601\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.380\nAnd that's really kind of nice.\n\n602\n00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.540\nIt is pretty cool.\n\n603\n00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.530\nWe do have all the package\nconfiguration that comes out.\n\n604\n00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.960\nWe throw that in with our VMM profile.\n\n605\n00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.380\nWe can actually put that in and\nhave that deployed as well as you saw.\n\n606\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.990\nAnd we can use that if we need to\nas part of our service template.\n\n607\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.640\nSo we can deploy this\nHyper V solutions and\n\n608\n00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.620\nwe've already also talked about that fact\nthey give us the ability to move and\n\n609\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.790\nmake that portable without leaving behind\nanything, which is very important and so\n\n610\n00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.940\nthat's good to you what to know and\nto be aware of.\n\n611\n00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.990\nWe did also talk about the DAC,\nI showed you more or\n\n612\n00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.260\nless how to set up the logic of one.\n\n613\n00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.570\nWe didn't actually walk\nthrough the specificity but\n\n614\n00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.710\ngiven yo some guidance\nshowing how to create a DAC.\n\n615\n00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.300\nWe usually create the data\nthrough our application and\n\n616\n00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.380\nthe configuration information around it.\n\n617\n00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.800\nIn Visual Studio more often than not.\n\n618\n00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.570\nNow there is a way to cheat\nwith that a little bit,\n\n619\n00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.870\nbecause not everybody likes Visual Studio\nor is familiar with or uses it.\n\n620\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.740\nIf you're not a web developer or\n\n621\n00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.620\nan app developer this may not be\nyou tool of choice, and I get that.\n\n622\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.160\nIt can be a little imposing if\nyou're not used to using it and\n\n623\n00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.190\nthere's a lot of strength in this tool.\n\n624\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.410\nIt is a very powerful tool but\n\n625\n00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.100\nit can be a little difficult to\nunderstand the first time out.\n\n626\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.780\nSo we do have some guidance on\nhow to create the DAC here.\n\n627\n00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.980\nPrimary go-to method.\n\n628\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.900\nBut you also can actually go in and\n\n629\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.490\ngrab the application information from\nthe SQL Server Management Studio as well.\n\n630\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.390\nSo you can actually use if you\nright-click on the database.\n\n631\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:01.840\nYou can actually go in and there is an\nexport function that comes up on the menu.\n\n632\n00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.900\nAnd you can actually create\nthe DAC right from there.\n\n633\n00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.930\nIf you go in the existing\ndatabase if you give me a second.\n\n634\n00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.780\nI will tell you exactly what it is\nbecause I don't remember the name.\n\n635\n00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.540\nOff the top and I don't have SQL open.\n\n636\n00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.350\nIt is the extract add a tier application\nwizard from within the studio.\n\n637\n00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.900\nYou can right click on\nthe existing database.\n\n638\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.320\nYou will use that little wizard.\n\n639\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.070\nAnd then when you do that we'll\nextract out the DAC definitions.\n\n640\n00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.600\nAnd as a result, patch them up,\ngive them to you,\n\n641\n00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.840\nand then you actually can use those.\n\n642\n00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.970\nThe good thing about it if you do it\nthat way, and as a matter of fact,\n\n643\n00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.930\nyou would either way here, or in\nSQL Server directly in Management Studio.\n\n644\n00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.965\nThe user stored data, so the user\nspecific data in the application or\n\n645\n00:30:37.965 --> 00:30:40.035\nin the database is not exported.\n\n646\n00:30:40.035 --> 00:30:42.005\nJust the configuration\naround how to set it up is.\n\n647\n00:30:42.005 --> 00:30:44.325\nSo in other words we purge the tables.\n\n648\n00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:47.245\nNo data comes through but\nwe take the structure of the schema and\n\n649\n00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:48.230\nthe information.\n\n650\n00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.360\nSo you're not worried about exporting\nall that user specific data.\n\n651\n00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.640\nBut more importantly, the security\nconcerns around grabbing all that\n\n652\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.680\nsensitive data are eliminated because we\ndon't have to worry about that data being\n\n653\n00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.070\nused as part of a deployment where we go\nand we roll that through into the web,\n\n654\n00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.800\nright, and ultimately out into\nthe cloud so that's just good to know.\n\n655\n00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.520\nSo if we could go back here,\nwe take a look.\n\n656\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.740\nWe could do the DAC in Visual Studio.\n\n657\n00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.390\nWe also have a little\nguidance on what are DACs,\n\n658\n00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.150\na little bit more about\nunderstanding them.\n\n659\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.000\nWe gave you a high-level explanation.\n\n660\n00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.140\nBut you may wanna go drill\nthrough a little bit.\n\n661\n00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.350\nLearn a little bit more about them.\n\n662\n00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.160\nUnderstand them a little bit more.\n\n663\n00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.590\nJust what are the moving parts and\npieces associated with them.\n\n664\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.770\nYou could see here,\nthere are, five elements.\n\n665\n00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.010\nI have these in the show notes, by\nthe way, so you'll see them in the notes,\n\n666\n00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:29.970\nif you want to take a look.\n\n667\n00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.080\nBut they're here, as well.\n\n668\n00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.070\nThe data tier application elements and\nsupport and\n\n669\n00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.330\njust have a sense of what these are.\n\n670\n00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.400\nWe have the properties that define\nall the characteristics of the DAC,\n\n671\n00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.670\ndefinitions of the data objects,\nwe have the instance-level objects,\n\n672\n00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.690\nlog ons, things like that\nthat are associated, there.\n\n673\n00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.580\nWe have the server selection policy.\n\n674\n00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.930\nWe have the file and scripts that\ncan be implemented or embedded.\n\n675\n00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.300\nSo you've got all the moving parts and\npieces.\n\n676\n00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.764\nAnd this just gives you a little more\nof a drill down and explains them all.\n\n677\n00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:58.859\nAnd then, we are also going to talk\nquickly about, cuz if I'm not mistaken,\n\n678\n00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:01.317\nI do have a couple of\nminutes left on the clock.\n\n679\n00:32:01.317 --> 00:32:04.150\nAnd I'm gonna make maximum use of those.\n\n680\n00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:09.407\nWe were gonna talk about how to deploy\na application using the App Controller,\n\n681\n00:32:09.407 --> 00:32:11.171\nout into the Azure cloud.\n\n682\n00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:13.403\nNow, I'm not gonna walk\nthrough every step,\n\n683\n00:32:13.403 --> 00:32:17.426\ncuz you have to have an Azure subscription\nand I'm not gonna set all that up for you.\n\n684\n00:32:17.426 --> 00:32:19.478\nBut I am just gonna show you,\nat a high level,\n\n685\n00:32:19.478 --> 00:32:22.181\nwhere we get documentation on\nthe Microsoft Azure Fabric.\n\n686\n00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:25.516\nWe do have a landing page,\nwhere you can go in.\n\n687\n00:32:25.516 --> 00:32:29.404\nThis URL is in the notes as well\nwhere we can get all the services and\n\n688\n00:32:29.404 --> 00:32:32.460\nwe can see all the different\nservices linked here.\n\n689\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.115\nAnd we have our Service Fabric, our Cloud\nservices, whatever the case may be.\n\n690\n00:32:37.115 --> 00:32:39.718\nWe do have all the other areas here.\n\n691\n00:32:39.718 --> 00:32:41.705\nThese are just the compute services.\n\n692\n00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:45.601\nBut you can see Networking Storage,\nthe other Cloud services like Gov Cloud,\n\n693\n00:32:45.601 --> 00:32:46.554\nthings like that.\n\n694\n00:32:46.554 --> 00:32:47.876\nWe have Security and Identity.\n\n695\n00:32:47.876 --> 00:32:49.113\nSo you wanna drill through here.\n\n696\n00:32:49.113 --> 00:32:49.626\nTake a look,\n\n697\n00:32:49.626 --> 00:32:52.435\nif you haven't really explored what's\ngoing on out there with Azure.\n\n698\n00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:55.392\nThe architecture space is\nactually really nice here.\n\n699\n00:32:55.392 --> 00:33:00.182\nThey give you, and again, give props where\nthey're do, Microsoft's done a great job,\n\n700\n00:33:00.182 --> 00:33:01.516\nas has Amazon by the way.\n\n701\n00:33:01.516 --> 00:33:05.846\nYou go to Amazon's website, you see the\nsame kind of information there for AWS.\n\n702\n00:33:05.846 --> 00:33:09.419\nBut they've done a great job of\nlaying out the case studies and\n\n703\n00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:11.766\nthe foundational knowledge elements.\n\n704\n00:33:11.766 --> 00:33:15.741\nHey, if you're new to Cloud you don't know\nanything about Cloud, and or our platform,\n\n705\n00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:16.918\nhey, start here it says.\n\n706\n00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:19.091\nCome in learn a little bit about Cloud.\n\n707\n00:33:19.091 --> 00:33:21.128\nLearn what the different\nservice models are.\n\n708\n00:33:21.128 --> 00:33:24.214\nLearn how we do Cloud,\nmeaning how Microsoft does Cloud.\n\n709\n00:33:24.214 --> 00:33:28.073\nWe have the reference architecture piece,\nall the different case studies and\n\n710\n00:33:28.073 --> 00:33:29.711\nreferencable architectures for\n\n711\n00:33:29.711 --> 00:33:32.413\nhow you would deploy along\nwith your scenario guides.\n\n712\n00:33:32.413 --> 00:33:34.477\nThere's design patterns here.\n\n713\n00:33:34.477 --> 00:33:37.723\nDifferent patterns that are associated\nwith different usage profiles and\n\n714\n00:33:37.723 --> 00:33:38.502\nbest practices.\n\n715\n00:33:38.502 --> 00:33:41.779\nSo they've done a great job, really,\nlaying out all this documentation.\n\n716\n00:33:41.779 --> 00:33:44.702\nCuz back in the wild west days of Cloud,\nwhen it was first starting out,\n\n717\n00:33:44.702 --> 00:33:46.480\ngood luck trying to\nfind any of this stuff.\n\n718\n00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.751\nIf you didn't already know it,\n\n719\n00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:50.395\nit was really tough to dig through\nthe vendor site to figure it out.\n\n720\n00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.469\nBut they've really come a long way and\nthey've put all this to good use, and\n\n721\n00:33:53.469 --> 00:33:54.534\nyou could see it all here.\n\n722\n00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:57.748\nSo I was gonna show you quickly\nwhat deploying looks like through\n\n723\n00:33:57.748 --> 00:33:58.826\nthe App Controller.\n\n724\n00:33:58.826 --> 00:34:02.404\nI'm gonna minimize down here our VMM area.\n\n725\n00:34:02.404 --> 00:34:04.305\nGonna come back in over here.\n\n726\n00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:05.870\nNow I've opened up the App Controller.\n\n727\n00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.579\nCan we go full screen here, cuz we're\ngonna need to see this dashboard.\n\n728\n00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.721\nI've opened up the App Controller.\n\n729\n00:34:09.721 --> 00:34:13.190\nNow this is a separate product\nthat we've installed and set up.\n\n730\n00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.234\nThis is part of System Center so you'd\nhave to, obviously, have this available.\n\n731\n00:34:17.234 --> 00:34:19.846\nYou get this part of your Enterprise\nagreement when you license\n\n732\n00:34:19.846 --> 00:34:20.591\nthe whole suite.\n\n733\n00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:22.929\nWe've installed and\nconfigured it separately.\n\n734\n00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.960\nAnd then when we open it up,\nand, by the way,\n\n735\n00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.433\nyou do need Silverlight as\na control element for this.\n\n736\n00:34:27.433 --> 00:34:29.587\nSo, you go to load\nthe console the first time.\n\n737\n00:34:29.587 --> 00:34:31.117\nWe've talked about this in other courses.\n\n738\n00:34:31.117 --> 00:34:32.373\nWe haven't talked about it here.\n\n739\n00:34:32.373 --> 00:34:35.835\nBut in the data center\nmonitoring with SCOM, a course,\n\n740\n00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:37.610\nthat we did all those shows.\n\n741\n00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.354\nWe talked in-depth about\nthis entire product line.\n\n742\n00:34:40.354 --> 00:34:43.482\nWe went through and actually showed you\nthe issues associated with the errors you\n\n743\n00:34:43.482 --> 00:34:45.512\nget, if Silverlight's\nnot installed correctly.\n\n744\n00:34:45.512 --> 00:34:47.091\nYou may go to launch this the first time.\n\n745\n00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:49.897\nYou'll get a little console where it says,\nhey, can't load this thing up.\n\n746\n00:34:49.897 --> 00:34:52.535\nBut it's nice, it gives you a prompt,\na big square right in the middle of your\n\n747\n00:34:52.535 --> 00:34:54.780\nscreen that says, hey,\nyou need Silverlight, download here.\n\n748\n00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.437\nYou do that, shut the web down, and bring\nit back up after you do the update, and\n\n749\n00:34:58.437 --> 00:35:00.143\nthen it'll load up with no trouble.\n\n750\n00:35:00.143 --> 00:35:02.025\nYou'll sign in with your\nappropriate account.\n\n751\n00:35:02.025 --> 00:35:03.548\nSo I've signed in here.\n\n752\n00:35:03.548 --> 00:35:08.528\nAnd then we go back,\nwe'll see that we have the ability, back,\n\n753\n00:35:08.528 --> 00:35:10.664\nback, there we go, back.\n\n754\n00:35:10.664 --> 00:35:11.882\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n755\n00:35:11.882 --> 00:35:17.341\nwe can see that we have the voice controls\njust not working the way it should today.\n\n756\n00:35:17.341 --> 00:35:20.654\nWe see that we have the ability\nto be able to load up, and\n\n757\n00:35:20.654 --> 00:35:22.757\nthis is our overview screen here.\n\n758\n00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:26.123\nWe can load up and connect directly,\nconnect a VMM server and\n\n759\n00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:30.614\nCloud, so we can actually manage private\nCloud app deployment right from here.\n\n760\n00:35:30.614 --> 00:35:33.868\nWe could do public cloud deployment\ninto the Windows Azure Subscription.\n\n761\n00:35:33.868 --> 00:35:37.607\nSo if we're gonna go in and we're\ngonna connect out the Azure Fabric and\n\n762\n00:35:37.607 --> 00:35:41.990\ndeploy applications that we've set up and\nhave available, we wanna load them up.\n\n763\n00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.522\nWe wanna use our service templates\nto deploy directly into Azure.\n\n764\n00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:47.102\nWe could do that, right, from here.\n\n765\n00:35:47.102 --> 00:35:50.554\nOr we can add external service providers\nbecause we're gonna bring in external\n\n766\n00:35:50.554 --> 00:35:52.778\nhosting, and\nwe're gonna connect out and use it.\n\n767\n00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:55.527\nSo we have options from here.\n\n768\n00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:58.785\nWhen we do connect, we would see if\nwe do have any clouds available.\n\n769\n00:35:58.785 --> 00:35:59.867\nWe would be connected to them.\n\n770\n00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:00.899\nWe would see them here.\n\n771\n00:36:00.899 --> 00:36:03.737\nIf we have our services deployed,\nwe would see them here.\n\n772\n00:36:03.737 --> 00:36:06.793\nIf we have any VMs running,\nwe would see them here.\n\n773\n00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:08.642\nWe have library resources available.\n\n774\n00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:12.226\nYou would see that we've been able to go\nin through Azure and see what those are,\n\n775\n00:36:12.226 --> 00:36:13.254\nwhatever they may be.\n\n776\n00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:17.870\nWe could see the jobs that been running\nhere under settings we have connections.\n\n777\n00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:23.319\nWe do have, as you can see here a Windows\nAzure connection already built-in.\n\n778\n00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:27.934\nSo that we have a pipe essentially which\nis pre-configured for us to set up and\n\n779\n00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:32.344\nlay in our subscription on top of and\nconnect us right to the Azure Fabric.\n\n780\n00:36:32.344 --> 00:36:33.847\nSpeaking of subscriptions,\n\n781\n00:36:33.847 --> 00:36:37.341\nwe would see our Azure subscription\ninformation here if we set it up.\n\n782\n00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:39.896\nHasn't been programmed in yet,\nbut we would see it here.\n\n783\n00:36:39.896 --> 00:36:44.130\nAnd our user roles by default we have\nan admin role, as you can see here,\n\n784\n00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.057\nout of the box.\n\n785\n00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:48.322\nAnd that admin role is what's\nused to configure into ctually\n\n786\n00:36:48.322 --> 00:36:50.124\nrun the App Controller console.\n\n787\n00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:53.302\nAnd that's what we remember of when\nwe get to set up and we install.\n\n788\n00:36:53.302 --> 00:36:56.324\nSo from here, it's probably the easiest\nplace to go in and do this.\n\n789\n00:36:56.324 --> 00:36:57.339\nYou would go ahead and\n\n790\n00:36:57.339 --> 00:37:00.790\nyou would either connect the Virtual\nMachine Manager server and cloud.\n\n791\n00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:01.860\nSo you would click here.\n\n792\n00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.332\nYou'd have to specify the information,\nspecify the VMM connection,\n\n793\n00:37:06.332 --> 00:37:08.953\nlink the two together here as you can see.\n\n794\n00:37:08.953 --> 00:37:12.769\nAnd if we did that,\nwe would then be able to bring VMM in.\n\n795\n00:37:12.769 --> 00:37:13.769\nSo we'll give this a name.\n\n796\n00:37:13.769 --> 00:37:18.202\nWe could do IT ProTV VMM.\n\n797\n00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:20.832\nWe would do Server Name.\n\n798\n00:37:20.832 --> 00:37:22.321\nOur server name is,\n\n799\n00:37:22.321 --> 00:37:27.409\njust let me make sure that I'm on\nthe right server, just one second.\n\n800\n00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:31.597\nI believe it's PlatVMM,\nbut let me just make sure.\n\n801\n00:37:31.597 --> 00:37:35.183\nYeah, platvmm01, okay, so we're just gonna\nmake sure we connect to the right machine.\n\n802\n00:37:35.183 --> 00:37:38.269\nSo platvmm01, so you can see there,\n\n803\n00:37:38.269 --> 00:37:43.237\nport 8100, which is the port\nthat we use for the consoles.\n\n804\n00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:45.365\nThat's what we're using to connect.\n\n805\n00:37:45.365 --> 00:37:46.566\nClick okay.\n\n806\n00:37:46.566 --> 00:37:48.340\nWhat do we do there.\n\n807\n00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.684\nI got to, that was stupid of me.\n\n808\n00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:52.096\nGot to do the fully qualified domain.\n\n809\n00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:53.396\nYeah, I got to do\nthe fully qualified domain.\n\n810\n00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:54.608\nI wasn't thinking.\n\n811\n00:37:54.608 --> 00:37:59.099\nPlatVM1, practicelabs.com,\nokay, there we go.\n\n812\n00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:01.751\nCuz DNS isn't smart enough to figure out,\nI mean that.\n\n813\n00:38:01.751 --> 00:38:05.368\nCuz it's not like I have a host\ndirector that says that's what it is.\n\n814\n00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:07.674\nBut then again,\nnobody asked me these things.\n\n815\n00:38:07.674 --> 00:38:09.962\nSo there you go,\nyou see these things, it is set up.\n\n816\n00:38:09.962 --> 00:38:12.373\nNow, it will, and\nit does tell you down here.\n\n817\n00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:15.514\nSee if I can get that import\ncertificates completed for.\n\n818\n00:38:15.514 --> 00:38:17.940\nSo we get little notifications\nat the bottom there,\n\n819\n00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.262\nlike I showed you in the other,\nin the SCVM Services Designer console.\n\n820\n00:38:21.262 --> 00:38:24.811\nI don't know the logic, but hey, let's put\nit on the bottom because everybody looks\n\n821\n00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:28.280\nthere as opposed to hey, let's put it up\non the top, where people actually see it.\n\n822\n00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.416\nBut that's just where they pop up,\njust so you know.\n\n823\n00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:32.385\nSo they are sitting down there.\n\n824\n00:38:32.385 --> 00:38:36.209\nYou could see it, we'll just kind\nof click there to get rid of it.\n\n825\n00:38:36.209 --> 00:38:37.773\nJust so we know that it's there.\n\n826\n00:38:37.773 --> 00:38:40.468\nBut now that we've done that,\nand hooked that up,\n\n827\n00:38:40.468 --> 00:38:43.484\nwe do have a virtual machine\nmanager server right there.\n\n828\n00:38:43.484 --> 00:38:48.237\nYou'll see we can go click there and\nyou'll see that we do have our connection\n\n829\n00:38:48.237 --> 00:38:50.956\nnow to IT Pro IC VMM and\nso we've set that up.\n\n830\n00:38:50.956 --> 00:38:54.539\nWe can remove it, can import certificates,\nlook at just the general properties.\n\n831\n00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:57.023\nThere's really nothing to look at but\nyou can just see it there.\n\n832\n00:38:57.023 --> 00:39:01.481\nBut we do now have that capability,\nand so now we've connected that up.\n\n833\n00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:03.917\nWe're gonna do the same\nthing with Windows Azure.\n\n834\n00:39:03.917 --> 00:39:06.304\nI won't be able to go any further than\njust showing you the beginning of\n\n835\n00:39:06.304 --> 00:39:09.353\nthe wizard here, but we would click, we'd\nhave to have our subscription information.\n\n836\n00:39:09.353 --> 00:39:12.753\nSo immediately, pretty much you gotta\nknow yeah, your tenant information,\n\n837\n00:39:12.753 --> 00:39:15.134\nyour account information to\nbe able to go any further.\n\n838\n00:39:15.134 --> 00:39:18.284\nWell, we do have the steps for\nthe step by step broke them out for you.\n\n839\n00:39:18.284 --> 00:39:20.973\nI put them in the show notes, so you'll be\nable to walk through the logic of that.\n\n840\n00:39:20.973 --> 00:39:25.297\nIf you own a subscription, you haven't\nalready bound your app controller to it,\n\n841\n00:39:25.297 --> 00:39:27.877\nto bring the capability\nto work with the fabric.\n\n842\n00:39:27.877 --> 00:39:30.939\nYou can walk through the steps, based on\nwhat we detail for you in the show notes.\n\n843\n00:39:30.939 --> 00:39:33.482\nI'll walk through all the steps in\nthe wizard, and show you how to set it up.\n\n844\n00:39:33.482 --> 00:39:34.249\nIt's very straightforward.\n\n845\n00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:36.017\nSo, won't be hard for you to do, but\n\n846\n00:39:36.017 --> 00:39:38.542\nyou can at least see how we\nconnect it out to VMM here.\n\n847\n00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:42.324\nAnd then from there, we obvious then\ncan use this to be able control our app\n\n848\n00:39:42.324 --> 00:39:44.225\ndeployments since we're on cloud.\n\n849\n00:39:44.225 --> 00:39:46.563\nThat's what App Controller is used for.\n\n850\n00:39:46.563 --> 00:39:50.132\nIt's able to define for us and\nthen control the deployment and\n\n851\n00:39:50.132 --> 00:39:53.369\nthe management of those\napplications if you choose to.\n\n852\n00:39:53.369 --> 00:39:57.089\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam, thank you so\nmuch for taking the time to show us all of\n\n853\n00:39:57.089 --> 00:40:00.119\nthose many, many moving pieces\nof this wonderful machine.\n\n854\n00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:03.202\nAll the different service templates and\napplication profiles.\n\n855\n00:40:03.202 --> 00:40:06.431\nYou know it really seems like this\nmay be a lot to set up initially.\n\n856\n00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:09.679\nBut having the availability,\nthe agility to go ahead and\n\n857\n00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:13.479\nchange and set things up on the fly\nis really worth it all in the end.\n\n858\n00:40:13.479 --> 00:40:15.979\nSo thank you so much for\nbeing with us today and stay tuned.\n\n859\n00:40:15.979 --> 00:40:17.724\nWe have more information headed your way.\n\n860\n00:40:17.724 --> 00:40:19.917\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n861\n00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:22.290\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n862\n00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:22.826\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n863\n00:40:22.826 --> 00:40:23.975\n&gt;&gt; See you next time on ITProTV.\n\n864\n00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:24.956\n&gt;&gt; Can I be Cherokee next

Yeah.\n\n868\n00:40:27.823 --> 00:40:29.058\n&gt;&gt; All right, see you guys.\n\n869\n00:40:29.058 --> 00:40:31.067\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n870\n00:40:31.067 -->

--> 00:00:33.020\nGood to be here, good to be able to\ntalk about Server App-V with you.\n\n14\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.620\nIn our prior episodes we\nactually mentioned Server App-V,\n\n15\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.509\nwe did talk about it.\n\n16\n00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:39.162\nTalked a bit about how we're gonna\nutilize it, what it's good for.\n\n17\n00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.059\nBut we didn't actually go through and\nshow you how to set it up.\n\n18\n00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.741\nWe said we're gonna push that off and\ndo a dedicated segment for it.\n\n19\n00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:48.169\nSo hopefully you'll be able to take a look\nat that with us now and go through it.\n\n20\n00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:51.626\nIf you haven't used Server App-V before,\njust to remind you quickly.\n\n21\n00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:55.536\nApp-V, the concept of virtualizing an\napplication is the idea of being able to\n\n22\n00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.658\ngo through, install an application,\nrecord essentially all the settings,\n\n23\n00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:04.060\nconfiguration parameters, registry\ninformation, all that kind of stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.947\nPut that together in a package alone with\nthe application binary themselves and\n\n25\n00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:11.222\nthen use that as a portable\nsolution that we can throw and\n\n26\n00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:14.299\ndeploy when needed\nvirtualizing the application.\n\n27\n00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.929\nIn this case, Server App-V so\n\n28\n00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.962\napplication that will be deployed\nin virtualize as part of it.\n\n29\n00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:20.846\nService deployment traditionally,\n\n30\n00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.578\nwe'll throw that into our\nservice design template.\n\n31\n00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:26.046\nWe'll take a look at how to do that\ntalked about that in a prior episode.\n\n32\n00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:30.908\nAnd, when we throw that, then that becomes\npart of the deployment into the cloud for\n\n33\n00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:32.045\nthe application.\n\n34\n00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:35.814\nThe nice thing about running\nan application that's virtualized is we're\n\n35\n00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:39.236\nnot actually installing the app\nwith the full footprint on the box.\n\n36\n00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:43.632\nBut rather running it, essentially its\nown isolated space without any worry or\n\n37\n00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:45.738\nconcern about what it does to the box.\n\n38\n00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:48.286\nBecause when we're done,\nshut the application off, essentially\n\n39\n00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:51.729\nthere's nothing left behind, because\nthat we we're using to run the app and\n\n40\n00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.652\nconfigure it is part of the application\npackage, so it is totally portable and\n\n41\n00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:57.493\nleaves behind no footprint, essentially.\n\n42\n00:01:57.493 --> 00:01:59.974\nSo this is nice, we are going to\ntake a look at how to set this up.\n\n43\n00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.715\nSo we go and we'll take a look here,\nwhat we are going to see is that I've\n\n44\n00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:04.585\nalready set up the beginning\nof the demo for us.\n\n45\n00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:05.902\nSo, we want to take a look at my screen.\n\n46\n00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:09.637\nWe are going to go ahead and you'll see\nthat I mapped out a drive to where we\n\n47\n00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:12.311\nare going to install\nthe Server App-V sequencer firm.\n\n48\n00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:14.734\nWe are going to start by\ninstalling the app sequencer.\n\n49\n00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.515\nAnd what I have done is that\nI've just mapped out a path,\n\n50\n00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.357\nas you can see here to my Z drive.\n\n51\n00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:23.421\nAnd I've done this to my\nvirtual machine manager box, so\n\n52\n00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:27.496\nI've mapped it over to Pladd VMM01 and\nour demo environment.\n\n53\n00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:31.316\nAnd it's going to the path program\nfiles Microsoft System Center 2012R2,\n\n54\n00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:36.980\nvirtual machine manager, SAV for Server\nApplication Virtualization, and then X64.\n\n55\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.729\nWe talked about in the discussion of App-V\nServer update, that we have two versions.\n\n56\n00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.522\nWe have the x86 and/or x64.\n\n57\n00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:49.176\nWe wanna make sure we're using\nthe right version of the sequencer for\n\n58\n00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:50.930\nthe operating system in question.\n\n59\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.448\nSo we're using the 64 bit one.\n\n60\n00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:56.727\nWe're gonna load the SeqSetup,\nthe sequencer setup, binary here.\n\n61\n00:02:56.727 --> 00:02:59.478\nWe're gonna right-click,\njust run this as administrator.\n\n62\n00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:01.646\nGive this just a second, to extract.\n\n63\n00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:04.698\nAnd then what we're gonna do is walk\nthrough the installation of the sequencer.\n\n64\n00:03:04.698 --> 00:03:06.590\nConfiguring is very straight forward.\n\n65\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.068\nThe only things we have to worry about\nis where we're going to install,\n\n66\n00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:10.202\nwhat's the destination path.\n\n67\n00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:13.138\nAnd we'll choose the default there and\nthen we'll have it up and running.\n\n68\n00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:14.743\nSo let me just move\nthis over a little bit.\n\n69\n00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.929\nYou'll see we have our app\nvirtualization sequencer setup wizard.\n\n70\n00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.180\nWe'll click Next.\n\n71\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.209\nWe'll go ahead and\naccept our end user license agreement.\n\n72\n00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.724\nWe could go ahead and read through it and\nprint it out if necessary.\n\n73\n00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:28.852\nWe'll click Next.\n\n74\n00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.430\nWe will, during the demos we always talk\n\n75\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.010\nabout we're not going to opt into the\ncustomer experience improvement program.\n\n76\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.999\nJust because the of fact that we're not\nusually connecting it out to the web.\n\n77\n00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.823\nAnd doing things in the demo that would\nallow us to actually utilize that but in\n\n78\n00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:45.839\nthe real world we always encourage you to\ndo that, give Microsoft the opportunity,\n\n79\n00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.139\nor whatever vendor it may be for\ndoing a different vendor and\n\n80\n00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.741\nthey have similar program as\nalmost every vendor does.\n\n81\n00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:56.049\nGive the vendor the opportunity to learn\nfrom your experience of using the program,\n\n82\n00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.090\nusing the product.\n\n83\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.098\nLet them gather, anonymously, the data\nthey need to be able to understand how\n\n84\n00:04:01.098 --> 00:04:04.987\nyour utilization compares to others, and\nbe able to work through any issues or\n\n85\n00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:06.129\nconcerns that come up.\n\n86\n00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.891\nAnd that way it makes the product better\nfor all for us, not just for you but\n\n87\n00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.610\nfor all of us.\n\n88\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.068\nSo definitely wanna recommend\nthat you opt in there.\n\n89\n00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.506\nIn the real world we're\ngonna opt out right now but\n\n90\n00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.789\nyou could see here we'll\nchoose I do not want to.\n\n91\n00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.954\nAnd you could read more about\nthis if you're interested,\n\n92\n00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.157\nI'm gonna click Next here.\n\n93\n00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:22.985\nWe're going to accept our\ndefault installation path,\n\n94\n00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:26.885\nprogramfiles/x86/serverapplication/virtua-\nlization/sequencer is where\n\n95\n00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:28.929\nwe're gonna be installing by default but\n\n96\n00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:33.131\nyou can put this into or\nwhatever you would like it's up to you.\n\n97\n00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.697\nWe'll click Next,\nweve just got our summary screen there.\n\n98\n00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:38.737\nClick Next, let the install go forward.\n\n99\n00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.309\nNot gonna take very long.\n\n100\n00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.576\nOnce this happens,\nyou'll see we have requirement for\n\n101\n00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:47.720\nthe C sharp or C++ re distributable so\nwe get that package out there.\n\n102\n00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.946\nThat comes up and then when we're done,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n103\n00:04:50.946 --> 00:04:51.950\njust click finish.\n\n104\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.607\nAnd we just minimize this and\nwe talked about the fact that once we\n\n105\n00:04:56.607 --> 00:05:01.929\ninstall we'll be able to go out here\ninto our application work space.\n\n106\n00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:05.054\nWe'll go out to the start area,\nwe'll go to our applications area and\n\n107\n00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:06.438\nwe'll be able to then go in.\n\n108\n00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:10.264\nYou'll see server application of\nvirtualization sequencer right here so\n\n109\n00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:14.217\nwe have the install Information\nour tile has been created.\n\n110\n00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:17.613\nWe're going to pin this to our start menu.\n\n111\n00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:20.370\nHave it right here so\nwe could stack it up and use it.\n\n112\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.580\nLike the nice little orangeish, reddish\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's very vibrant.\n\n113\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.843\n&gt;&gt; Kind of fall or autumn color,\n\n114\n00:05:24.843 --> 00:05:25.960\nit's very nice\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n115\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Stands out, that's for sure.\n\n116\n00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.414\n&gt;&gt; It does, it's against the blue,\nall the other ones that are blue or\n\n117\n00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:30.382\nshades of blue, or green.\n\n118\n00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:34.380\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna right\nclick and just run this as administrator.\n\n119\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.200\nJust load this up, we can see\nthe sequencer then loads up for us.\n\n120\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.110\nOnce the sequencer is up and running\nwe'll just quickly take a look around,\n\n121\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.700\nmake sure we're comfortable\nwith what's here.\n\n122\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.940\n&gt;&gt; Not a lot to figure out when\nyou really have two options.\n\n123\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.966\nCreate a new virtualized or\nvirtual application package,\n\n124\n00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:50.241\nmodify an existing one.\n\n125\n00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:53.361\nWe don't have one that's been created yet,\nso clearly we're going to go in and\n\n126\n00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:54.081\ncreate a new one.\n\n127\n00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.656\nSo we're going to create a new\nvirtual application package.\n\n128\n00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:00.169\nWe'll click here, we have to walk\nthrough some steps now we talked about.\n\n129\n00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.358\nWe'll just move this\nover while we're talking.\n\n130\n00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:05.723\nWe talked about the fact that\nthe idea behind application\n\n131\n00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:08.809\nvirtualization specifically\nbehind the sequencer,\n\n132\n00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.384\nis we're gonna record all the steps\nthat we're engaging in or\n\n133\n00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:16.890\nhave knowledge of them as part of\npackaging this up and making it available.\n\n134\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.180\nAnd so\nyou'll see we're gonna prep the computer,\n\n135\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.760\nissues that may corrupt the package,\nand or add extraneous data.\n\n136\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.990\nOther applications are running.\n\n137\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.710\nStop these before continuing.\n\n138\n00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.079\nSo we have to make sure we have\nnothing else open and running.\n\n139\n00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.071\nYou'll notice that I have note pad up and\nrunning, right.\n\n140\n00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:35.223\nI've got Server Manager up and running,\nthere's stuff in other words that would\n\n141\n00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:39.814\nget recorded as part of this setup that is\nnot normally gonna be necessary or indeed\n\n142\n00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:44.420\neven wanted on the target server or on the\ntarget instance when we deploy this app.\n\n143\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.300\nAnd that can get in the way and\nscrew things up.\n\n144\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.350\nAnd that's what it's telling us.\n\n145\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.752\nSo we gotta pay attention to these\nscreens, pay attention to the warnings,\n\n146\n00:06:50.752 --> 00:06:53.092\nmake sure we understand\nwhat we're doing here, and\n\n147\n00:06:53.092 --> 00:06:54.810\nthat we follow the recommendations.\n\n148\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.650\nSo we're gonna go through and just do\na little tidy-up here, if you will.\n\n149\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.206\nWe've already seen the path\nthat we installed for us, so\n\n150\n00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:01.600\nI'm gonna get rid of Notepad.\n\n151\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.560\nWe don't need that anymore,\nso we'll get rid of that.\n\n152\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.270\nWe have, let me just see here.\n\n153\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.810\nI think, yeah, we didn't have that up and\nrunning so we don't need that.\n\n154\n00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.940\nAnd we do have, Explorer,\nFile Explorer open, we'll get rid of that.\n\n155\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.310\nWe just get rid of our\nserver manager as well.\n\n156\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.990\nWe'll clean all that up.\n\n157\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.260\nLet's do a refresh there.\n\n158\n00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.410\nYou'll see now, you'll see we're good.\n\n159\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.660\nNo warning, no concerns,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n160\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.551\nSo it is important for us to pay attention\nnot only what's going on there, it's also,\n\n161\n00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.121\nyou know, note what is happening and make\nsure that we are aware of any issues and\n\n162\n00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.740\naddress them in real time here.\n\n163\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.830\nSo we've got this, let's click Next.\n\n164\n00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.288\nWe are going to select our packaging\noptions so, select the installer for\n\n165\n00:07:41.288 --> 00:07:43.150\nthe application.\n\n166\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.260\nWhere are we going to get this from?\n\n167\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.630\nWe'll perform a custom installation.\n\n168\n00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.920\nSo we are going to go ahead and type in\nthe UNC, the path to get the installer.\n\n169\n00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.020\nSo we are going to go ahead.\n\n170\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.610\nWe are going to do this, we are going\nto do Club DC or domaincontroller01.\n\n171\n00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.646\nSo clubdc01.\n\n172\n00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.222\nSW And then we're gonna do seven zip.\n\n173\n00:08:02.222 --> 00:08:10.745\nAnd then we're gonna do seven z920.MSI.\n\n174\n00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:14.780\nAnd we can go ahead and browse and see\nwhether or not that's available or not,\n\n175\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.970\nbut we're gonna take it on faith\nthat it's gonna be there for us.\n\n176\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Gonna take your word for it, yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're just gonna believe me\ncause I'm a believable kind of guy.\n\n178\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.090\nWhy would I not tell you the truth.\n\n179\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.565\nAfter all,\nI'm wearing a bright yellow shirt.\n\n180\n00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:27.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The sign of\n\n181\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.180\nan honest person if I've ever seen one.\n\n182\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.360\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead.\n\n183\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.060\nWe know it's there.\n\n184\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.650\nNow, to be fair we did\nobviously set this up.\n\n185\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.770\nWe do have the installation media there.\n\n186\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.400\nYou would have to have staged that.\n\n187\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.250\nYou would would have to have either\ncreated a share and populated it or\n\n188\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.930\nhave it available locally and\nthen go to get it.\n\n189\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.770\nWhatever the case may be,\nwe've just set that up so\n\n190\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.040\nwe can go grab that install medium,\nthat's what we're gonna use.\n\n191\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.130\nSo just make sure you're aware of that and\nyou obviously understand what that is.\n\n192\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.740\nSo for the package name we're\ngonna be using seven zips so\n\n193\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.530\nwe just use seven zips there.\n\n194\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.290\nAre then we have under edited\nadvance here, we can go in,\n\n195\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.820\nor rather not edit advance but\nclick edit advance.\n\n196\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.490\nI should say, wanna say under but\njust use the dialogue.\n\n197\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.420\nYou'll see here we have the ability to\nspecify a path and instead of q, which\n\n198\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.310\nis just our default generic one, I don't\nwant to delete the whole thing actually,\n\n199\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.710\nI just want to delete just\nthe beginning of that, except I forgot\n\n200\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.590\nwe're using the delete key without\nthe proper delete key functionality, so\n\n201\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.090\nI have to be in front of it to backspace.\n\n202\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.230\nWe're gonna set this up for\n\n203\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.290\nthe proper path we actually\nwant this to install into.\n\n204\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.740\nWhat is, in other words,\nour virtual application directory?\n\n205\n00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.550\nWhat's our working directory?\n\n206\n00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.740\nWhere are we going to put this?\n\n207\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.320\nWe're not going to install\nit to the Q drive,\n\n208\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.690\ncuz chances are we don't have\na Q drive on that machine.\n\n209\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.060\nWhat we are going to do is install it\ninto the C programs file drive, or\n\n210\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.210\nprogram files x86.\n\n211\n00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.070\nSo go into C program files,\nand then we're gonna do,\n\n212\n00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:55.446\nWe're gonna use x86 and\n\n213\n00:09:55.446 --> 00:10:00.270\nI'm gonna do that, for 7zip.\n\n214\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.720\nSo we're gonna put it into C program\nfiles, x86 7zip, just to make sure.\n\n215\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.890\nGot my screen that does that whole light\nthing dark thing half way through, so\n\n216\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.270\nas I'm typing it goes 50%\ndarker than it is normally.\n\n217\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.770\nYou guys don't see that on the screen,\nbut it actually does and so\n\n218\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.470\nsometimes it's hard for me to see what's\ngoing on in front of me while I'm typing.\n\n219\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.050\nAll right, so we're gonna click next.\n\n220\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.370\nWe're gonna wait for the installer,\nit's gonna start up momentarily.\n\n221\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.100\nTakes a minute or so,\ndoesn't take very long traditionally.\n\n222\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.030\nWe'll get a security warning as it is\ngoing to, or potentially when we hit run,\n\n223\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.160\nwe'll get a security warning here.\n\n224\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.260\nSo we'll wait.\n\n225\n00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.150\nIf we don't, no big deal.\n\n226\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.470\nBut if we do, we'll just deal with it and\nallow it to run.\n\n227\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.450\nRemember, user account control,\nif it's on, will typically prompt and say,\n\n228\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.450\ndo you wanna install with admin rights?\n\n229\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.640\nIf it doesn't,\nthen you're fine, no big deal.\n\n230\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.440\nBut we have our 7-Zip setup here so\nwe're gonna be able to run through this.\n\n231\n00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.170\nNow keep in mind the steps\nthat we are going through\n\n232\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.130\nare what are gonna be ultimately recorded\nand used when we deploy the app.\n\n233\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.750\nSo we don't wanna do anything extraneous,\nwe don't wanna go through and\n\n234\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.560\nstart opening up Internet Explorer and\n\n235\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.105\nnotepad and check an email and\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n236\n00:11:03.105 --> 00:11:06.590\nRemember it prompted us hey\nclose all those open apps\n\n237\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.670\nbecause you don't have anything open that\ncould screw up or corrupt the packaging.\n\n238\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.110\nSo we really got to be focused\nwhile we're doing this\n\n239\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.500\njust on the actual application\nsequencing over itself.\n\n240\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.232\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n241\n00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:20.930\nSo we've got our 7Zip setup here.\n\n242\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.640\nWe're just gonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n243\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.750\nWe'll hit I accept, and\njust accept the EULA.\n\n244\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.410\nWe then have to specify where we're\ngonna do this, with what options.\n\n245\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.110\nSo if we were gonna modify the options for\nany reason, do anything like that,\n\n246\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.660\nwe'd go ahead and make those choices here.\n\n247\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.070\nWe're just gonna leave those alone.\n\n248\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.670\nWe're not gonna bother making any changes,\nbut you know,\n\n249\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.450\nif you wanted to install certain\nfeatures or remove certain features,\n\n250\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.230\nwhatever you do you make\nsure you do that here.\n\n251\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.160\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click next,\n\n252\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.270\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nready for install.\n\n253\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.250\nLet's install, just give that a moment.\n\n254\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.730\nIt doesn't take very long,\nit's a very small program.\n\n255\n00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.100\nSo once we're done with this,\nwe'll click Finish.\n\n256\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.830\nAnd then you'll see we're here.\n\n257\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.060\nAnd then down here below.\n\n258\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.780\nCan we go,\njust go full screen for a second.\n\n259\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.150\nMaybe it's easier for you to see this.\n\n260\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.520\nYou'll see here, if there are no\nadditional programs necessary for install,\n\n261\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.695\nselect I'm Finish, for\ninstalling click Next.\n\n262\n00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:10.573\nWhat we're then gonna do\nis essentially say hey Mr.\n\n263\n00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:13.685\nand Mrs. Wizard I'm done, stop recording.\n\n264\n00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:16.745\nNow go in and\nlet's make sure we have an opportunity to\n\n265\n00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:19.065\ncollect all the system\nchanges that have occurred.\n\n266\n00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:21.205\nSo we're gonna to gather\nup all the settings.\n\n267\n00:12:21.205 --> 00:12:25.315\nEssentially we look at a delta solution,\nhey this is what it was like before.\n\n268\n00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:29.010\nAll the deltas have happened, let's\ncapture those deltas, deltas are changes.\n\n269\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.900\nAnd then we're gonna have the settings and\n\n270\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.770\nthe information necessary\nto complete the package.\n\n271\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.160\nSo that's what we're gonna do now.\n\n272\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.540\nNow if we did want to install and\nrun another application,\n\n273\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.810\nwe could sequence out one or\nmore applications.\n\n274\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.520\nBut we're fine with just the one we did.\n\n275\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.790\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're to click\nI am finished installing right here,\n\n276\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.210\nwe're gonna click next.\n\n277\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.800\nGive that a moment, cuz it's so\ngood you click it twice, because we love\n\n278\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.770\nour mouse that we're using here, so we're\ncollecting system changes as you can see.\n\n279\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.530\nAnd depending on the application,\n\n280\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.440\nhow long it takes is variable\ndepending on how big it was.\n\n281\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.260\nHow many things you did, so, don't be\nsurprised if this takes five, six, seven,\n\n282\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.050\nten minutes in the real world,\nfor doing the big application.\n\n283\n00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.200\nSomething small like 7zip's\nnot going to take very long.\n\n284\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.470\nSo we're going to wait for this to finish.\n\n285\n00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.640\nWe'll go ahead, and we will,\nas soon as this is done,\n\n286\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.850\nyou'll see we have our shortcuts here.\n\n287\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.480\nRun each program to\nmanage first-use tasks.\n\n288\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.630\nCan we go full screen again,\njust so you can see this?\n\n289\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.560\nYou'll see, we can run each program if we\nwant to, complete any required application\n\n290\n00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.170\nand configuration tasks,\nthings like setting up, licenses,\n\n291\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.310\nwe've already done the basic license,\nbut there may be additional stuff.\n\n292\n00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.430\nHey, who's the user, you know,\ncustomize and things like that.\n\n293\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.270\nSo, we can go through and we can do all\nthat if required and they encourage us to.\n\n294\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.880\nIn addition, it says changes made by any\nother running programs will also be saved\n\n295\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.410\ninto the virtual application package.\n\n296\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:55.960\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nrun our 7zip file manager shortcut.\n\n297\n00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.170\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll go in and we'll do this one.\n\n298\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.120\nWe will run selected.\n\n299\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.390\nSo, when we do this,\nwe will be able to use\n\n300\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.410\nthis Run Selected here, really quickly.\n\n301\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:18.840\nYou never know if it actually clicks or\nnot, that's why you have to do it twice.\n\n302\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.475\nSo you see it does open 7-Zip file\nmanager, and by the way just to show you,\n\n303\n00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:26.030\nit put a little check mark there\nnext to the one that I selected.\n\n304\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.890\nSo you could just see that's the one\nI'm running just so you know.\n\n305\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.280\nSo I went ahead and did that.\n\n306\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.390\nEven if I wanted to,\nI could go in and add something.\n\n307\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.480\nI don't know what I would do to configure.\n\n308\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.430\nIt really doesn't have anything to do\nwith 7-Zip, but in general you get\n\n309\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.960\nthe idea just so that we know that we\nwould go in and configure something.\n\n310\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.090\nSo once we're done we'll\nclose out of that.\n\n311\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:47.180\nWe'll click next, again it's gonna\ncollect system changes just to make sure\n\n312\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.450\nthat we know that everything is good.\n\n313\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.970\nAnd then, as soon as that finishes,\nagain it won't take very long,\n\n314\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.890\nwe'll go ahead we'll be able to complete\nand we'll get this set up and finished up.\n\n315\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.600\nAnd then once this is\nfinished we'll see in\n\n316\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.770\nthe application virtualizing\npackage manager here.\n\n317\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:10.370\nYou'll see we have, let me see\nan unsupported Shell extension detected.\n\n318\n00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.355\nOkay, so patch is complete, it looks okay,\nbut we may just want to go and\n\n319\n00:15:14.355 --> 00:15:17.605\ntake a look at that, that's just something\nthat we would perhaps want to deal with,\n\n320\n00:15:17.605 --> 00:15:20.825\nmaybe an extension that perhaps is\nnot going to be supported fully.\n\n321\n00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:22.835\nBut other than that looks like we're good.\n\n322\n00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:24.740\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll click Close.\n\n323\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.870\nNo big deal.\n\n324\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:33.312\nAnd then what we have here is we have\nnow our 7-zip package if you can see.\n\n325\n00:15:33.312 --> 00:15:35.332\nI should pull this down right there.\n\n326\n00:15:35.332 --> 00:15:39.420\nYou could see just underneath our\nlittle blue square so you can read it,\n\n327\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.978\n7zip-MicrosoftApplicationVirtualizationSe-\nquencer.\n\n328\n00:15:42.978 --> 00:15:47.658\nSo you'll see now that we do have our\nproperties, got our package name here,\n\n329\n00:15:47.658 --> 00:15:52.410\npackage version, got our glid,\nour unique identifier, route directory and\n\n330\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.370\ninformation about creation,\npackage size, you got less than.\n\n331\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.752\nTen megs, about nine megs uncompressed.\n\n332\n00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:03.058\nWe've got any information about change\nhistory if we've gone through and\n\n333\n00:16:03.058 --> 00:16:04.740\nrun notable iterations.\n\n334\n00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.440\nWe got file information here,\nfile name, file size, the version,\n\n335\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.830\ncreation date just you\nknow general information.\n\n336\n00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.530\nGot a registry settings in here.\n\n337\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.500\nNotice it says virtual registry\nbecause we're creating the registry,\n\n338\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.170\nstructuring it in the package,\nin the IV patch we're gonna overlay this\n\n339\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.460\non top of the system that we\nactually deploy the app into.\n\n340\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.470\nAnd as a result of that,\nwhat we're doing is we're inserting or\n\n341\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.730\ninjecting, I used that\nword hesitantly because\n\n342\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.620\nwe don't wanna confuse us with some sort\nof malware, some sort of injection attack.\n\n343\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.610\nNothing like that but\njust describing what we're doing.\n\n344\n00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.200\nWe're taking these settings and\nwe are injecting them into the system.\n\n345\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.050\nThe target system when we run it but\nthen we're removing them when we're done.\n\n346\n00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.290\nSo we're essentially bringing our program\nand all supporting elements with us.\n\n347\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.990\nWe're laying them out on\ntop of the machine and\n\n348\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.080\nthen when we're done running them,\nwe remove them.\n\n349\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.200\nSo this is what we're thinking about\njust so we have a sense to this.\n\n350\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.220\nTo go with that with our virtual registry,\n\n351\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.960\nwe have our virtual file system, these\nare all the settings and all the files\n\n352\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.470\nthat are gonna be use to actually support\nthe implementation of the application.\n\n353\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.390\nYou could see there's fair number of\nfiles in the virtual file systems.\n\n354\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.890\nSo we have all that.\n\n355\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.610\nIf we need any services to go with this,\nthis doesn't require some service but\n\n356\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:22.030\nthere are many applications that will have\nservices that spawn that actually run it.\n\n357\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:26.255\nIf this was iTunes or something like that,\nwe'd have what the iTunes helper and\n\n358\n00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:30.480\nwhatever else runs for iTunes we would\nhave them all there that's funny because\n\n359\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.167\nI'm a Zune guy not an iTunes guy so-\n&gt;&gt; I don't do either, so yeah.\n\n360\n00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.924\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about iTunes, I'm probably\none of the only Zune guys left on\n\n361\n00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:38.191\nthe planet who's actual able to\nsay he not only owns a Zune but\n\n362\n00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:39.231\nuses it on a regular basis.\n\n363\n00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:41.490\n&gt;&gt; At least it's not Napster Adam.\n\n364\n00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.430\n&gt;&gt; Well with Zune do\nyou know what Zune was?\n\n365\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.390\n&gt;&gt; It's like a twisty logo and\n\n366\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.620\nI think it connects-\n&gt;&gt; Zune, well yes, but\n\n367\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.217\nthe Zune is the Microsoft version of the-\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n368\n00:17:51.217 --> 00:17:51.830\nAndroid and it's-\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n369\n00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.420\nno it's the Microsoft version of the iPod.\n\n370\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Just Microsoft?\n\n371\n00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft put out\ntheir own media player.\n\n372\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.960\n&gt;&gt; I got one, but it was a Dell called\nthe Jukebox, ages and ages ago.\n\n373\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.020\n&gt;&gt; Maybe but I have,\nI actually have two Zunes.\n\n374\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.358\nI loved them so much,\nI went out and got two.\n\n375\n00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:05.968\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n\n376\n00:18:05.968 --> 00:18:09.290\n&gt;&gt; They are awesome.\nI think that they are just way, way cool.\n\n377\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.210\nAnd a little secret, better than iPod,\nbut I didn't say that.\n\n378\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.708\nAll right, so anyway, cuz I have that\nconversation with my kids all of the time.\n\n379\n00:18:15.708 --> 00:18:17.449\nNo Daddy, Apple is better.\n\n380\n00:18:17.449 --> 00:18:19.269\nThen again, they're kids,\nwhat do they know?\n\n381\n00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:20.885\nSo we have all of that, right.\n\n382\n00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:22.879\nSo we've done our setup, if you will.\n\n383\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.250\nRather, we do have our program.\n\n384\n00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.850\nIt's all setup and ready to go.\n\n385\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.340\nAnd so now that we've done this, right.\n\n386\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.580\nWe can go ahead, just go up here to file.\n\n387\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.120\nWe'll just go ahead, whoops.\n\n388\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.940\nLet's go to file.\nWe'll just do a save real quick.\n\n389\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.840\nAnd we can go ahead and save this.\n\n390\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.700\nI'll just out it on the desktop,\njust so we can see where it is.\n\n391\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.660\nBut you'll notice here,\nsequencer project file, right?\n\n392\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.790\nWe've got our own extension,\nI'll show you this once we save it.\n\n393\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.150\nSo let's just save it off,\nput it on the desktop so we can see it.\n\n394\n00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.650\nJust close this out.\n\n395\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.000\nAnd here's all the supporting\nfiles associated with it.\n\n396\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.320\nRight over here, we've got quite a few of\nthem and we've got all the manifest files,\n\n397\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.650\nthe list, the icon folder, all that stuff.\n\n398\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.860\nAll that is part of sequencing.\n\n399\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.030\nAnd what I should have done was create\na folder, dropped them in there.\n\n400\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.370\nBut we have our application files and\n\n401\n00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.890\nif I hover .sft, you'll see there\nis the extension file type SFT.\n\n402\n00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.680\nAnd you could see and this is our\nSPRJ file which is our project file.\n\n403\n00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.650\nYou could see that we have all of\nthat information and that's what,\n\n404\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.820\nthat's essentially the guts\nof the package, right?\n\n405\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.340\nWhen we do the actual package deployment\nwhere we go into the VMM and we say,\n\n406\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.590\nhey we've got an app view package.\n\n407\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.350\nWe have to pull in all of these files and\n\n408\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.480\nthat's ultimately, then we'll get the\npackage up and is ready for deployment.\n\n409\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.290\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, when it's time to retract\nthis, or if we plan to retract this\n\n410\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.590\nparticular application, will it leave any\nresidual files there on the host itself?\n\n411\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.370\n&gt;&gt; No, everything is self-contained,\nso when we do this,\n\n412\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.570\nwe don't have anything left behind.\n\n413\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Assuming, of course,\n\n414\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.160\nthat we do this the right way,\nthere should be nothing left behind.\n\n415\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.880\nSo let's take a look at how we\ninstall the other piece of the puzzle.\n\n416\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.990\nWe just did a sequencer,\nshowed you how to set up a sequencing app.\n\n417\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.050\nSmall one, but still.\n\n418\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.370\nSo if we just extrapolate that out,\nto anything as large as you want,\n\n419\n00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.220\nas many as you want, you would do the same\nthing to some more files, ultimately.\n\n420\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.280\nRight, so this is one of those,\nhey, let's just keep doing it.\n\n421\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.930\nIt just gets broader in the sense weighing\nmore file because it's a little bit of\n\n422\n00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.790\na bigger package but it's the same step.\n\n423\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.140\nSo there be nothing different at all.\n\n424\n00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.970\nIf you were sequencing exchange or\nanything like that.\n\n425\n00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.180\nIt would be essentially the same idea.\n\n426\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.960\nYou wouldn't have any difference,\njust the package size will be bigger.\n\n427\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.360\nWhat we wanna do is install the server\napplication virtualization agent.\n\n428\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.580\nSo we wanna see the other piece,\nwhich is the agent that allows us to run,\n\n429\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.290\nto virtualize the application.\n\n430\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.860\nSo we're gonna go over to another machine,\nback to our virtual machine manager.\n\n431\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.610\nSo just bear with me here, have a second\nwhile I just switch over our console.\n\n432\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.600\nAnd also I just make sure our\nlab timer is fully stocked, so\n\n433\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.480\nthat we have enough time to\nrun through the demo here.\n\n434\n00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.110\nWe're gonna go back over to\nour Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n435\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.200\nYou can see this is where we\nwere using and demoing earlier.\n\n436\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.320\nYou can tell it is still our same machine,\n\n437\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.400\nbecause there are our service\ntemplates from before.\n\n438\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.620\nSo, you can see them there.\n\n439\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.270\nI'm gonna minimize the console for\nVMM, for the moment.\n\n440\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.980\nAnd we're gonna ahead,\nwe're gonna open up the Server Manager.\n\n441\n00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.330\nWe have it up and running there.\n\n442\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.910\nWhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n443\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.800\nWe're gonna go in, and\njust make sure we're on the right machine.\n\n444\n00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.430\nYou can see we are.\n\n445\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.940\nWe're gonna go in and we're going to\ninstall another piece of software.\n\n446\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.150\nBut instead of the sequencing\nagent the way we did,\n\n447\n00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.780\nwe're gonna install the agent,\nthe virtualization agent.\n\n448\n00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.790\nSo, same idea but just a different file.\n\n449\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.650\nSo, let's go in here real quick.\n\n450\n00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.710\nLet me actually just minimize that, and\n\n451\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.130\ngo to our file explorer,\nit would be easier to do that.\n\n452\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:29.420\nWe're gonna go in to our C drive here,\ngonna go in to program files,\n\n453\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.410\nand right there,\nwe're gonna go to system center 2012 R2.\n\n454\n00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.770\nWe're gonna go in to our\nvirtual machine manager.\n\n455\n00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:41.880\nAnd inside Virtual Machine Manager,\nSAV for server app virtualization, x64.\n\n456\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.180\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do our Agent Setup right here.\n\n457\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.310\nSo we're gonna run this\none as our administrator.\n\n458\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.120\nGive that just a moment\nto extend itself out.\n\n459\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.175\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll run our wizard here.\n\n460\n00:21:57.175 --> 00:22:02.520\nAnd we've got this time our setup for the\nserver application virtualization agent.\n\n461\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.630\nRight, we're going to click next\nwe're going to accept the EULA.\n\n462\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.710\nLet's just do that,\ngo through here our default install path.\n\n463\n00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.207\nGo ahead, let that finish\ninstalling we'll do the virtual or\n\n464\n00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:17.950\nthe Visual Studio redistributable,\nVisual C++ rather.\n\n465\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.165\nSo we see that come out we'll\njust wait for that to finish.\n\n466\n00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:21.650\nIt shouldn't take very long.\n\n467\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.620\nAnd once we get that installed,\nthere we go.\n\n468\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.460\nClick Finish.\n\n469\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.090\nWe now have our agent installed.\n\n470\n00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.810\nThere really is nothing to do\nonce we install the agent.\n\n471\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.750\nWe would then use the agent\nobviously to be able to drive\n\n472\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.970\nthe use of a virtual application.\n\n473\n00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.330\nBut the agent itself just has to be\ninstalled and running in the system so\n\n474\n00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.980\nwe can run applications\nthat are virtualized.\n\n475\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.290\nBut once we install it there's\nreally nothing we would have to do\n\n476\n00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:49.540\nother than make sure it is available.\n\n477\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.810\nWe're just showing you how to install\nto understand that this piece has to be\n\n478\n00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.000\non the targeted machine where\nwe wanna run the actual app,\n\n479\n00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.540\nthe virtualized the app, excuse me.\n\n480\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.020\nThat way we can receive the app package\nand also have supporting infrastructure to\n\n481\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.560\nrun it inside the virtual memory space or\nthe bubble, if you will, that we create\n\n482\n00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.100\nin order to run this virtualize app and\nthen remove it when we're done.\n\n483\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.590\nSo we would instantiate or put the virtual\nagent into whatever machine or\n\n484\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.280\nmachines we want to target for\nad virtualization deployment.\n\n485\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.390\nAnd we would use the virtualized\ninfrastructure creates for\n\n486\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.310\nus to then host the apps as they run.\n\n487\n00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.680\nSo just so you could see how that\npiece gets setup and instantiated, and\n\n488\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.970\nonce the agent is there we would then be\nable to drive our deployments whenever\n\n489\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.870\nnecessary and we could throw our\nvirtualized apps into our system, and\n\n490\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.280\nif you remember, I'll just bring up our\nVMM console here for just one second.\n\n491\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.106\nAnd there we are right there.\n\n492\n00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:44.755\nSo we were able to go in and\n\n493\n00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:48.460\nif you remember we could\ncreate inside of our template.\n\n494\n00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.326\nLet's just drop this in here.\n\n495\n00:23:50.326 --> 00:23:52.582\nLet's just open our designer.\n\n496\n00:23:52.582 --> 00:23:56.168\nJust to show you, there we are.\n\n497\n00:23:56.168 --> 00:24:00.147\nAnd remember,\nwe were talking about adding in our web or\n\n498\n00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:03.457\nour application, web app or\na SQL Server app.\n\n499\n00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:05.280\nWe talked about the DAC and of all this.\n\n500\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.568\nWe could bring these in, so\n\n501\n00:24:06.568 --> 00:24:09.485\nwe have the opportunity there\nto work with those kind of apps.\n\n502\n00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:14.141\nWe also, remember, have the ability\nunder Application Profiles,\n\n503\n00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:16.880\nCreate an App Profile, specifically.\n\n504\n00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.650\nLet's just do that, and\nwe'll just go over here so we can name it.\n\n505\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.734\nRemember when we do add,\nwe can bring in our app profile, and\n\n506\n00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.621\nwe have our virtual app right there.\n\n507\n00:24:25.621 --> 00:24:29.112\nIf we were gonna run our virtual app,\nwe would then have to go in, and\n\n508\n00:24:29.112 --> 00:24:31.278\nthis is where we browse for that package.\n\n509\n00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:33.603\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, it's all integrated and\nyou can start seeing that-\n\n510\n00:24:33.603 --> 00:24:35.082\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It is, yeah, and remember,\n\n511\n00:24:35.082 --> 00:24:37.955\nwe would just have to go find all those\nfiles that I needlessly scattered across\n\n512\n00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:38.923\nthe [LAUGH] other desktop.\n\n513\n00:24:38.923 --> 00:24:41.239\nCuz I didn't bother to create\na folder to put them in.\n\n514\n00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:44.276\nBut you could see if we did have that\ndirectory and it was local to the machine,\n\n515\n00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:47.112\nor if we had a sharer going out there,\nwe could go and grab that package.\n\n516\n00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:49.286\nAnd we'd then be able to bring it in.\n\n517\n00:24:49.286 --> 00:24:53.387\nSo we could just go grab the file\nright from there, set it up here.\n\n518\n00:24:53.387 --> 00:24:55.511\nAnd then we would actually\nbe able to sequence out, or\n\n519\n00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:58.360\nrather because we sequenced it,\nactually add this to our deployment.\n\n520\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.670\nAnd we would have an app profile for-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] We can even delegate work\n\n521\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.615\nwith something like this,\n[LAUGH] imagine that.\n\n522\n00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:07.101\n&gt;&gt; We could, well, if we give somebody\nconsole rights to be able to do the setup\n\n523\n00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:09.730\nfor our profiles, and\nthen create them, they could.\n\n524\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:10.620\nYeah, sure.\n\n525\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.742\nThrough the roles that we have, we could\n\n526\n00:25:11.742 --> 00:25:13.928\ndelegate responsibility to do this kinda\nstuff if we wanted to, absolutely.\n\n527\n00:25:13.928 --> 00:25:15.229\nSo we could go in and do this and\n\n528\n00:25:15.229 --> 00:25:18.313\ngive everybody the ability to then\nbe able to use these applications.\n\n529\n00:25:18.313 --> 00:25:20.247\nThis is where we would tie it back in and\n\n530\n00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:23.759\nbring the virtual app in under\nthe app profile and have it available.\n\n531\n00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:27.165\nAnd if we give them the half\nsecond if you bear with me,\n\n532\n00:25:27.165 --> 00:25:30.062\nyou could probably go out and\nreach for that.\n\n533\n00:25:30.062 --> 00:25:33.496\nWe don't have the app package available\nbut let me see if I can go in,\n\n534\n00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:35.195\nwhat was the name of the machine?\n\n535\n00:25:35.195 --> 00:25:37.999\nThat was\n\n536\n00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:45.614\nplaidsys02-c$.\n\n537\n00:25:45.614 --> 00:25:47.636\nLet's see if we can go out.\n\n538\n00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:53.050\nNo, I won't be able to search forward from\nthere cuz I won't be able to get to it.\n\n539\n00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.510\nSo we would have to\nhave the package local.\n\n540\n00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.207\nI'd have to bring it over before I can\ngrab it because I won't be able to path to\n\n541\n00:25:58.207 --> 00:25:59.175\nit, it's not shared out.\n\n542\n00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:00.201\nBut you get the idea.\n\n543\n00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:02.426\nIf I have the files locally, I was gonna\njust see if I could go grab them for\n\n544\n00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:03.095\nyou really quickly.\n\n545\n00:26:03.095 --> 00:26:04.280\nBut if I had the files locally,\n\n546\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.385\nI'd actually be able to grab them and\nadd them in here.\n\n547\n00:26:06.385 --> 00:26:08.893\nAnd then once, I'm done hit OK and\nthen all the settings are there,\n\n548\n00:26:08.893 --> 00:26:10.086\nwe have everything available.\n\n549\n00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:12.251\nAnd then we could actually\nuse that package.\n\n550\n00:26:12.251 --> 00:26:14.417\nAnd then we could deploy that virtual app.\n\n551\n00:26:14.417 --> 00:26:15.291\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n552\n00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:15.968\n&gt;&gt; How do we do that.\n\n553\n00:26:15.968 --> 00:26:18.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there you go,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n554\n00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.500\nThat's Server App-V in a nutshell.\n\n555\n00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.600\nAnd thank you, Adam, for showing us that.\n\n556\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.250\nBut stay tuned, we have more cloud\nconfiguration headed your way.\n\n557\n00:26:26.250 -->

00:00:17.740\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.988\nIn this episode, you'll see demonstration\non how to create new service templates.\n\n7\n00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:25.034\nWith us to go ahead and\ncreate this demonstration, we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:26.390\nAdam Gordon in the studio.\n\n9\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.830\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.985\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\nI thought this one we're gonna switch-\n\n11\n00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:31.193\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That's right,\n\n12\n00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:32.139\nI'm Adam Gordon today.\n\n13\n00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.727\n&gt;&gt; So you're gonna do the demonstration.\n\n14\n00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:34.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna sit back and\n\n15\n00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:35.240\nI'm gonna be Cherokee.\n\n16\n00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.359\nCherokee's gonna be me and Cherokee's\ngonna show you how to export and\n\n17\n00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.420\nimport service templates along with\nconfiguring the VMM templates.\n\n18\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.260\nSo take us away, Cherokee.\n\n19\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the first thing you\nneed to do is push the power button and\n\n20\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.130\npower up your machine.\n\n21\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.553\n[LAUGH] And make sure that our labs\nare not gonna run out of time during this\n\n22\n00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.078\nepisode.\n\n23\n00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:55.488\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm gonna take back over.\n\n24\n00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we're actually gonna do\n\n25\n00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:57.460\nthis for real.\n\n26\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.380\nWe're just fooling around with you.\n\n27\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.272\nBut we are gonna walk through,\nall kidding aside,\n\n28\n00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:01.953\nCherokee is gonna help\nme walk through this.\n\n29\n00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:04.890\nShe is gonna play a very important\npart in what we're gonna do.\n\n30\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.680\nShe's gonna keep track\nof what we're doing.\n\n31\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.980\nAsk some good questions and\n\n32\n00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.620\nI know make some good observations\nabout certain things we're doing.\n\n33\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.090\nAnd she's also gonna\nmake sure that we don't\n\n34\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.080\nrun out of time which is\nvery important as well.\n\n35\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.620\nBut we are gonna take a look\nat both exporting and\n\n36\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.520\nimporting a template if I'm not mistaken.\n\n37\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.310\nAnd we may through in\na discussion really quickly about\n\n38\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.390\nmaking sure that we just\ntake a look at what else?\n\n39\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.444\nI'm thinking it's gonna be,\nI'm gonna guess.\n\n40\n00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:27.997\nShould I guess, or are you gonna tell me?\n\n41\n00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:28.855\n&gt;&gt; You can guess.\n\n42\n00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.849\n&gt;&gt; I can guess?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n43\n00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:32.583\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm thinking it's gonna be\n\n44\n00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.950\ntaking a look at the VMM template and\nmaking sure we know what's going on.\n\n45\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.593\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\nI thought you were gonna bring up\n\n46\n00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:39.370\nthe whole tap dancing thing again.\n\n47\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.896\n&gt;&gt; No, the VMM template,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n48\n00:01:40.896 --> 00:01:43.209\nI could bring that up,\nbut I know you're so\n\n49\n00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.920\npro tap dancing that you\njust can't wait to do it.\n\n50\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.100\nSo we'll let you do that on your own.\n\n51\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.270\nAll right, so\nlet's go ahead and talk a look.\n\n52\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.899\nWe've been talking, remember,\n\n53\n00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.445\nprior episodes about the service design\ntemplate, a builder if you will.\n\n54\n00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:57.182\nService design tool that we\nuse to be able to go in and\n\n55\n00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.200\nbuild out our service templates.\n\n56\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.203\nWe've shown you that extent.\nSo we're gonna pop back in there for\n\n57\n00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:04.570\na minute, show you something with\na multi-tier template designs, so\n\n58\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.410\nthat we could see where we\npop those applications in.\n\n59\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.030\nIn our last demo, showed you how\nto do the sequencing on app v.\n\n60\n00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.196\nAt the very end I walked through and said,\nand this is by the way where you would go\n\n61\n00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:17.370\nadd your application and\nusing your application profile.\n\n62\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.800\nBut I didn't actually show you\nwhere in the service designer we\n\n63\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.860\nwould bring that in and\nactually drop the application in.\n\n64\n00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.844\nSo just wanted to show you that\nas part of what we're doing.\n\n65\n00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:27.900\nBut then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll export one of these templates.\n\n66\n00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.690\nI got a few lined up there as you'll see.\n\n67\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.030\nI'm also gonna quickly give you a heads up\non what this whole needs attention thing\n\n68\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.090\nunder status may mean, and\nwhy that's gonna be important.\n\n69\n00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.950\nWe'll export one, go ahead and we'll show\nyou that, with the package template up.\n\n70\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.627\nExport it out, hand it over, in theory to\nsomebody who may wanna use it in their\n\n71\n00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.530\ninstall, or their instantiation,\ntheir instance of VMM.\n\n72\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.148\nWe'll go ahead and we'll import it just to\nshow you we can do go in the other way.\n\n73\n00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:52.093\nAnd then we'll just poke around\nunder the hood a little bit,\n\n74\n00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:54.480\nwe'll take a look at our\nVM templates over here.\n\n75\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.120\nRemember we have a gen one,\n\n76\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.610\ngen two template sitting around from\none of our prior conversations.\n\n77\n00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.651\nWe'll just go in and we'll remind\nyou how we can go in there and\n\n78\n00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:02.994\nmodify a little bit what's happening.\n\n79\n00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:06.207\nYou've seen us in various episodes\nbring the template in and\n\n80\n00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:07.560\nmodify it as a one-off.\n\n81\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.290\nWe'll just modify it\ndirectly from here and\n\n82\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.690\nshow you what's going\non with that as well.\n\n83\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.211\nSo let's just go back in here.\n\n84\n00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.510\nLet's go to our service templates.\n\n85\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.040\nAnd let's start by talking about what\nwe can do to just go back into our\n\n86\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.130\ntemplate designer and\nbring in those application profiles.\n\n87\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.460\nAnd specifically,\nwe're gonna be talking about App-V.\n\n88\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.140\nAnd where would we add that application,\nthat web app, from web deploy, abv, or\n\n89\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.070\nSQL DAC?\n\n90\n00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.630\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n91\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.198\nLet's just take a look at how\nwe drop that into our templates.\n\n92\n00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:37.185\nWe keep saying, hey, we could use\nit as part of our template, right?\n\n93\n00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.339\nWe bring in those profiles.\n\n94\n00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.240\nWe showed you how to create the profile.\n\n95\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.540\nLet's show you how to link it back\nto service designer really quickly.\n\n96\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.720\nSo we're gonna go back in\nhere to our templates.\n\n97\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.280\nNow I'm gonna use the new template\nthat's been added since last time\n\n98\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.800\nwe were in here.\n\n99\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.370\nIt's amazing the amount of stuff we\nget done when nobody's around and\n\n100\n00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.930\nlooking,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.080\n&gt;&gt; And it's like that.\n\n102\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.440\nIt's so quick, and yet it takes hours and\n\n103\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.700\ndays of preparation to set all\nthis stuff up for you guys.\n\n104\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.700\nBut what we did, is I just went ahead and\ncreated a new service template.\n\n105\n00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.270\nI made this a three tiered template.\n\n106\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.850\nIf you remember,\nwhen we right click New Service Template,\n\n107\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.800\nwe have a couple of\ndifferent options there.\n\n108\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.224\nBlank, one tier, two tier, three tier.\n\n109\n00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:15.140\nI just went ahead and chose three tier\njust to show you what this looks like,\n\n110\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.360\nit's a little change.\n\n111\n00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.011\nBut I didn't bother to configure anything.\n\n112\n00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.474\nI didn't bother to add any machines,\nI didn't even do anything.\n\n113\n00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:24.950\nI just created the template, saved it off,\nand that's why it says needs attention.\n\n114\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.520\nSo, when you go in here and\nyou see your template listing, and\n\n115\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.020\nyou see it needs attention.\n\n116\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.210\nThat tells you that there's something\ngoing on with the template that has to be\n\n117\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.360\nrectified, before you can\nfully use the template.\n\n118\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.980\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n119\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.350\nSo, we're gonna head,\nwe're gonna right-click here.\n\n120\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.944\nWe'll go ahead, we'll open our designer\nand we'll give it just a second.\n\n121\n00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:47.375\nYou can see this design looks little bit\ndifferent than the ones we've been playing\n\n122\n00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:47.973\nup until now.\n\n123\n00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:50.830\nIt's built out.\nWe do have our service up here.\n\n124\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.940\nAnd then of course we\nhave our three tiers.\n\n125\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.950\nAnd then we're gonna be able to as you\ncan see, have a network connection for\n\n126\n00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.530\neach the tiers.\n\n127\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.668\nSo we have information\nthat we can interact with.\n\n128\n00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:01.948\nBut we're gonna have to\nprogram in not just our OS,\n\n129\n00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:05.070\nnot just our hardware\nconfig in the tier here.\n\n130\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.435\nBut now we have this nifty little box,\nnifty.\n\n131\n00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:10.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a formal ITPro term by the way.\n\n132\n00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:13.195\nYou can use that, but\nonly if you are an IT professional.\n\n133\n00:05:13.195 --> 00:05:16.255\nWe have a nifty box here,\ncalled Add Applications.\n\n134\n00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:20.705\nThis is where we bind our\napplication profiles into each tier.\n\n135\n00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:23.765\nAnd allow us to select what\napplication gets bundled as\n\n136\n00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.422\npart of the tier here for\nour service template deployment.\n\n137\n00:05:28.422 --> 00:05:32.233\nSo I'm gonna show you how this works right\nhere while Cherokee asks the question.\n\n138\n00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:37.528\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if this has any real value\nin it, but most of, it is an observation.\n\n139\n00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:41.604\nAnd most of the drawings and diagrams that\nI've seen before, when you say tiers,\n\n140\n00:05:41.604 --> 00:05:44.340\nI always think of a vertical\nhierarchical structure.\n\n141\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.450\nIn this particular diagram, when you\nspecify tiers, we're stretching outward,\n\n142\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.660\nor laterally.\n\n143\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.536\nAnd it's kind of a different shift there,\nAdam.\n\n144\n00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:53.554\n&gt;&gt; Just another way of looking at things.\n\n145\n00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:54.422\n&gt;&gt; Just a little, yeah.\n\n146\n00:05:54.422 --> 00:05:58.653\n&gt;&gt; It's just when we talked about this I\nthink one of the other episodes you had\n\n147\n00:05:58.653 --> 00:06:02.900\nmentioned the idea, hey, is this kind\nof a tiering in the diagram models?\n\n148\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.250\nWe talked about the first time just\nlaying this out, talked about the blank\n\n149\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.741\nversus the secondary third tier or\njust individual and adding machine tiers.\n\n150\n00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.060\nYou'd made reference to the fact\nwe've talked about tiering and\n\n151\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.637\nhow do we configure storage fabric, right?\n\n152\n00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:15.626\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And we went through that, and\n\n153\n00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.250\nwe've talked about the fact,\nit is very similar.\n\n154\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.994\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm obviously having\nan issue with this concept.\n\n155\n00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:20.016\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're hung up on\n\n156\n00:06:20.016 --> 00:06:20.518\nthe whole theory concept.\n\n157\n00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:21.121\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n158\n00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.285\n&gt;&gt; So, third time's a charm,\nas they say, right?\n\n159\n00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:26.359\nSo it is a thought process, right?\n\n160\n00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:30.884\nIt's one that we just have to understand\nthe concept of tearing is really this idea\n\n161\n00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:35.343\nof setting up, in this case, we're setting\nup as you can see as you pointed out,\n\n162\n00:06:35.343 --> 00:06:37.045\nessentially, right?\n\n163\n00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:41.996\nThree, in this case it's three to\nyour model, we're choosing to put in\n\n164\n00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:46.720\nthree specific instantiations of\na machine running applications.\n\n165\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.785\nIt's not that one\n\n166\n00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:49.756\nnecessarily is going to be-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n167\n00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:50.734\nHas more precedence than the another.\n\n168\n00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:51.515\n&gt;&gt; It may or may not.\n\n169\n00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:52.092\n&gt;&gt; May or may not.\n\n170\n00:06:52.092 --> 00:06:56.850\n&gt;&gt; But it's not necessarily that, hey,\nnumber one is better than number three,\n\n171\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.050\nbut we gotta have three, so we said,\nlet's label them first of all.\n\n172\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.082\nEach of them is going to be set up and\navailable for us so that we can,\n\n173\n00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:09.114\nfrom the computer standpoint,\neach tier represents a computer or\n\n174\n00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:13.653\na machine in an application payload\nthat we're gonna deploy and deliver.\n\n175\n00:07:13.653 --> 00:07:16.113\nEach of them can be monitored,\nmanaged, and\n\n176\n00:07:16.113 --> 00:07:19.235\nconfigured essentially in\nindividually of each other.\n\n177\n00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:21.855\nSo it's not an architectural\nhierarchy thing.\n\n178\n00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:22.366\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n179\n00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:23.344\n&gt;&gt; It is just the language we use.\n\n180\n00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:24.298\n&gt;&gt; That's the design, that's right.\n\n181\n00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:25.480\n&gt;&gt; That's just the way we talk about it.\n\n182\n00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.873\nCuz remember, we defined the idea\nthat we have the machine tier,\n\n183\n00:07:28.873 --> 00:07:32.545\nthe networking tier, the service\ntemplate tier or the service tier.\n\n184\n00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:36.059\nWe're just configuring different\nelements of the deployment architecture.\n\n185\n00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:38.240\nAnd that's what those tiers\nare meant to represent.\n\n186\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.510\nAll right, so if we go back here,\nwe'll take a look.\n\n187\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.930\nWe're just gonna go in and show you.\n\n188\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.740\nNow can we go full screen,\nI want you to see the error or\n\n189\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.560\nthe warning on the bottom.\n\n190\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.048\nRemember, we put these things down on\nthe bottom in this particular console.\n\n191\n00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:51.230\nSo we just have to be looking,\nas we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n192\n00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.750\nat the bottom to see those\nyellow bars that are coming up.\n\n193\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.730\nPopping up and warning us, or reminding\nus, about something that has to happen.\n\n194\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.849\nNow it says, Hey,\nthe first template, first tier here,\n\n195\n00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:03.180\nis not connected out to any VM network.\n\n196\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.060\nMake sure, we have one.\n\n197\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.241\nOkay, we know that.\nBut then it also says, Hey, by the way,\n\n198\n00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:09.310\nfirst template must contain at\nleast one virtual hard drive.\n\n199\n00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.160\nAnd, we don't have anything.\n\n200\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.942\nAnother words, Hey, you did this.\n\n201\n00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:12.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But guess what,\n\n202\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.270\nyou forgot to add a machine.\n\n203\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.370\nAnd configure it, and\nyou forgot to network it,\n\n204\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.210\nthat's what they're telling us.\n\n205\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.705\nSo, we got to fix that.\n\n206\n00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:20.720\nNow, you saw me mention as,\n\n207\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.950\nCherokee was asking her question, I went\nand I highlighted the first tier here.\n\n208\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.230\nLet me just, click away just so\nyou can see.\n\n209\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.161\nI just highlighted it, and\nI'm about to right click,\n\n210\n00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:31.019\nthat's how I got that pop up menu.\n\n211\n00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:35.483\nI go to properties, cuz what we're gonna\ndo, is go in and actually drop into,\n\n212\n00:08:35.483 --> 00:08:39.900\nthe wizard that pops up to edit the\nproperties and start fixing these issues.\n\n213\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.101\nAnd along the way,\none of the screens we'll see,\n\n214\n00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:44.630\nis that we'll be able to add\nin those application items.\n\n215\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.200\nWhen we click Add Application,\nwe're gonna actually be able to go in.\n\n216\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.225\nWe're gonna be able to to drop in,\n\n217\n00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:51.385\none of those application\npackages from our app profile.\n\n218\n00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:53.165\nSo, I just wanted to\nshow you this quickly.\n\n219\n00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:56.025\nSo, let's just take a look and\nremind ourselves of what's going on.\n\n220\n00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:57.555\nWe've got, our general tab here.\n\n221\n00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:58.875\nWe're, not gonna make any changes here.\n\n222\n00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.605\nBut you know, that we've talked\nabout what goes on here all ready.\n\n223\n00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:04.392\nHardware configuration,\nwe'll spec this out for Hyper V.\n\n224\n00:09:04.392 --> 00:09:06.745\nRemember, we do the validation for that.\n\n225\n00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:07.925\nWe know, that's important.\n\n226\n00:09:07.925 --> 00:09:10.145\nYou've seen me do this,\nin the walk through,\n\n227\n00:09:10.145 --> 00:09:12.540\nas we set up our design\ntemplate initially.\n\n228\n00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.626\nSo we're not gonna spend a lot of\ntime going back through stuff,\n\n229\n00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:16.921\nwe've already discussed with you,\nbut you know what goes on in here.\n\n230\n00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.880\nWe need to add some hardware in here,\nwe can add that in if we need to.\n\n231\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.020\nWe're gonna go to OS configuration, and\n\n232\n00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.400\nin here you'll see that we can choose\nwhatever OS we're gonna specify.\n\n233\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.650\nWe can go in, and we can specify,\nyou know, our admin configurations,\n\n234\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.870\nour roles whatever the case may be.\n\n235\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.840\nI would love to be able to pull this down,\n\n236\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.770\nand be able to get at the top\nof that wizard, but that's okay.\n\n237\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.230\nYou could see here, that we can go in,\nwe've got all this.\n\n238\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.340\nLet's, do our application configuration.\n\n239\n00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.660\nYou'll see here,\nthat this is where we can go in,\n\n240\n00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.710\nand this is what I wanted to show you.\n\n241\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.139\nBecause we have the add\napplication feature, or\n\n242\n00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.220\nfunctionality in the machines\nhere now that we've added in,\n\n243\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.715\nwe actually have the ability to bring in,\nall those applications from\n\n244\n00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:02.685\nthe application profiles we were talking\nabout, our SQL DAC application, our\n\n245\n00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:06.861\nvirtual apps of what we had just sequenced\nin the prior episode where we were doing.\n\n246\n00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:07.497\n&gt;&gt; 7-Zip.\n\n247\n00:10:07.497 --> 00:10:09.460\n&gt;&gt; 7-Zip, our package,\nif it was available.\n\n248\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.178\nIf we had loaded the package up, made\nit available in the library so we could\n\n249\n00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:15.176\npull it in, we would then be able to bring\nit in here so we'd have that capability.\n\n250\n00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:15.872\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n251\n00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:18.200\n&gt;&gt; If we did a web deploy, we had our web.\n\n252\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.553\n&gt;&gt; App, here remember we would\nget that out as a zip files.\n\n253\n00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.980\nSo we'd have that, zip file added\nto the Library as a resource.\n\n254\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.220\nGo back in go to Library,\nadd that into our library server share,\n\n255\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.500\nwherever that is wherever\nwe specified that.\n\n256\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.830\nThose things, would then become\navailable as a resource we'd be able to\n\n257\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.960\ndeploy them here.\n\n258\n00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.150\nSo we can see that we can bring in,\nthis application or\n\n259\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.360\nwhatever application,\nWe may be using in each of these tiers.\n\n260\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.840\nAnd this is one of the pieces,\nthat we were missing, right?\n\n261\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.420\nBecause, now what we're able to do,\nis go in and add in these applications,\n\n262\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.100\nthis thing we've been talking about.\n\n263\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.560\nBut I wanted you to see now, we've gotten\nto that point where we actually have,\n\n264\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.410\nthese service templates that\nare fully configure, or\n\n265\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.700\nat least, we're setting them up and\nyou can see what goes on.\n\n266\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.850\nSo I would choose,\nthe appropriate application here.\n\n267\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.880\nIf I then wanted to spec it out, you'll\nsee since the OS we chose in the prior\n\n268\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.530\nscreen, is similar to our 2008\ndata center, we could specify\n\n269\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.880\nthe compatibility, our OS listing for\nthat if we had other operating systems.\n\n270\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.980\nYou literally still could choose select\nall, which we wouldn't want to do,\n\n271\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.540\nby the way just so you know because\nthe likelihood of this application,\n\n272\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.530\nrunning on every version from\n2003 small business server,\n\n273\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.630\nall the way up through 1202 data center.\n\n274\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.770\nProbably not likely, right?\n\n275\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.410\nI mean, more often than not that apps\nprobably not going to be scaled to run on\n\n276\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.270\neverything, so\nwe may want to be selective here.\n\n277\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.705\nJust really question,\nwhat we would like to do.\n\n278\n00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:39.860\nWe could do, sequel server configuration.\n\n279\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.440\nWe've been through this, where we do our\nconfiguration of a sequel instance, or\n\n280\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.540\nremember we could, go through and actually\nscript out the install, start to finish.\n\n281\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.050\nCould sys prep SQL if we had to, so\nthere's a lot of things we could do.\n\n282\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.720\nWe'd walk through all of this,\nand finish this out.\n\n283\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.510\nI'm not worried about fixing the template\nright now, but I am worried about\n\n284\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.170\njust making sure you see, this tie in with\nthe application piece that's brought in,\n\n285\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.170\nby using the add application feature, in\nthis particular version of the template,\n\n286\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.670\nwe actually have devoted drop those in,\nas part of what we were talking about.\n\n287\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.080\nSo, we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll click OK there.\n\n288\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.840\nWe're not gonna, as I said, solve\nthe problem right now with the hard drive.\n\n289\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.169\nWe're not worried about all that,\njust showing you that,\n\n290\n00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:17.106\ncuz we're not actually gonna bother,\nwith this template for the moment so\n\n291\n00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:18.515\nI'm not too concerned about that.\n\n292\n00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:20.640\nAll right, so we're gonna get out of here.\n\n293\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.346\nNow, we're gonna go, export a template\nthat we've already worked on.\n\n294\n00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:25.660\nWe'll go grab, this template right here.\n\n295\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.980\nWe'll go ahead, we'll right click on this.\n\n296\n00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.780\nAnd you'll see, we have our Export option.\n\n297\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.620\nNotice we could, export right off the top\nhere from our area up above in our ribbon.\n\n298\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.810\nSo, if we wanna do that under\nService Template, could do it either way.\n\n299\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.170\nClick Export, we have a little\nwizard here, not too difficult.\n\n300\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.940\nWe have, our template selected.\n\n301\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.470\nWe can go ahead and overwrite,\nthe existing export files,\n\n302\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.880\nif we've exported already.\n\n303\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.010\nGonna, export again.\n\n304\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.780\nNow, I've create a folder to export into,\nso I have a container to catch all this,\n\n305\n00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.730\nso that we can actually\nsee what happens with it.\n\n306\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.130\nBut, if we had done this already,\nmaybe made some changes.\n\n307\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.821\nUpdated the template, and\nwanna exported again.\n\n308\n00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.350\nIf we overwrite, were just going\nto get the most recent version.\n\n309\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.550\nSo its up to us to decide, how to do that.\n\n310\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.880\nYou'll notice we can add here,\nif we choose to.\n\n311\n00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.580\nAnd we can select templates to\nimport if we wanna bring in,\n\n312\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.360\na VM template as part of this.\n\n313\n00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.280\nRemember our, VM templates.\n\n314\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.649\nI can go ahead and export that out,\nas part of that if I choose to.\n\n315\n00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:20.560\nBe up to me, whatever the case may be or\nother templates that I wanna add in.\n\n316\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.810\nExport, any sensitive template settings.\n\n317\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.240\nI can do those as well, if I wanna\nexport any or all of those things.\n\n318\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.060\nI can just move this over,\nso you can see my browser.\n\n319\n00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.680\nI'm gonna move that just,\na touch more there, there we go.\n\n320\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.890\nSo I can decide, to override it if there\nis something on the site to export.\n\n321\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.270\nYou'll notice my export\nsensitive template settings,\n\n322\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.410\nI then have the option\nto encrypt the template.\n\n323\n00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.990\nSo I can actually add,\nencryption capabilities here.\n\n324\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.100\nEncrypt is really,\nhey lets put a password on and protect it.\n\n325\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.281\nBut I can actually protect it so\nas a result, when I do that,\n\n326\n00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:52.718\nI have to have a password to be\nable to access the export file, and\n\n327\n00:13:52.718 --> 00:13:55.665\nI'm going to be prompted for\nthat when I want to use it.\n\n328\n00:13:55.665 --> 00:13:58.981\nSo, your encrypt is a little strong, but\nwe just want to know that we're adding\n\n329\n00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:02.040\npassword protection in here just so\nwe're aware of that.\n\n330\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.360\nSpecify the location,\nwe want to export to.\n\n331\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.780\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do this, let's just browse.\n\n332\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.940\nNow I created a file,\nin the C drive already.\n\n333\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.700\nSo I've gone in, on this PC and\nI've gone to the C drive,\n\n334\n00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.620\nlet me just scroll down here, and\ninside the C drive, service template VMM,\n\n335\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.760\nI just went ahead and\npre-created that folder.\n\n336\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.990\nBut notice you can create a new\nright here, make new folder, so\n\n337\n00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.870\nwe can do it on the fly if necessary.\n\n338\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.410\nSo, Service Template VMM, just click OK.\n\n339\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.640\nThat's where, we're gonna drop that.\n\n340\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.024\nWe'll go ahead, and we'll click OK.\n\n341\n00:14:30.024 --> 00:14:33.680\nSo just let that export out,\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n342\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.588\nAnd when that is done,\nyou can see it is done,\n\n343\n00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:37.310\nlet's just minimize our console down.\n\n344\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.620\nNow I've got the folder, already set up\nand just waiting for us so we can see it.\n\n345\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.483\nAnd you'll see we have our, File that's\nan XML file here that's exported out with\n\n346\n00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:48.310\nessentially just the settings and\nthat's really all it is.\n\n347\n00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.501\nIt's a settings file that when we import\nit, will then tell us how to repopulate or\n\n348\n00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:54.021\nrehydrate that template, so\n\n349\n00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:57.448\nwe can lay the service template\nback into another instance of VMM.\n\n350\n00:14:57.448 --> 00:15:00.900\nAnd we could then use,\nthat template to drive deployment.\n\n351\n00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.683\nSo, if I made this up and I wanted\nto give this to let's say Cherokee,\n\n352\n00:15:04.683 --> 00:15:08.406\ncuz maybe she's gonna run,\nanother instance of VMM and I want her to\n\n353\n00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:12.949\nhave this already set up, ready to go so\nthat she doesn't have to do all this work.\n\n354\n00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:13.524\n&gt;&gt; So nice, of you Adam.\n\n355\n00:15:13.524 --> 00:15:14.741\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; She's tired,\n\n356\n00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:15.839\nshe's been on her feet all day,\n\n357\n00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:18.570\nI want to give her a break right she's\nbeen real helpful and I want to give her.\n\n358\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Present, and\nI couldn't afford anything else.\n\n359\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.495\nI'm gonna get her, a template right.\n\n360\n00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna give you that template.\n\n361\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.720\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n362\n00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.425\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely welcome,\ncuz you are the best Cherokee.\n\n363\n00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so,\n\n364\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.230\nwe would export this out as we've done.\n\n365\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.080\nI'm gonna show you,\nhow to import it in just a minute.\n\n366\n00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.640\nBut this is the nice thing,\nbecause we could then import this.\n\n367\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.930\nThis would save Cherokee,\na lot of time and trouble.\n\n368\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.630\nSo let's imagine, the real world\nwhere this scenario makes sense.\n\n369\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.450\nFor a minute, right.\n\n370\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.740\nBecause you know, if you're running a\nsingle VMM instance, you're not exporting.\n\n371\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.480\nI mean, you can export, but\nwhy are you gonna export templates.\n\n372\n00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.934\nThere's really no reason to, because-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, backup configuration files in\n\n373\n00:15:48.934 --> 00:15:49.914\ncase you had-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n374\n00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:52.730\nwe would do a backup of the system and\ndeal with backup and restore, but\n\n375\n00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.801\nI mean,\nthat's not necessarily the main driver.\n\n376\n00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:56.660\nWhat I'm getting at, is that.\n\n377\n00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.370\nNormally you wouldn't have a reason to\nexport them because you're not giving them\n\n378\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.480\nto anybody if that's our main driver.\n\n379\n00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.570\nWhat I'm suggesting is in a multi country\ndeployment, a large organization.\n\n380\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.815\nLet's say you know we are,\nACME Mega Corp, right?\n\n381\n00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:13.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know we have offices\n\n382\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.640\naround the world.\n\n383\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.210\nAnd many companies that are very\nbig have centralized IT but\n\n384\n00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.030\nthey may also have regional\nIT configurations.\n\n385\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.340\nThey may run their own infrastructure\nby region, by country,\n\n386\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.835\nand then it'll all be centrally\nmanaged and centrally accessible.\n\n387\n00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:29.890\nA lot of customers that\nfall into these categories.\n\n388\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.305\nThey're very large corporations globally.\n\n389\n00:16:32.305 --> 00:16:35.725\nA lot of them have central directory\nsystems and things like that.\n\n390\n00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:39.601\nBut they have local instantiated\ninstances of things like VMM, and\n\n391\n00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:42.253\nsystems under ops manager, config manager,\n\n392\n00:16:42.253 --> 00:16:46.472\nthings like that because they're\nrunning their own domains by country.\n\n393\n00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:49.796\nThey're essentially all in a forest but\neach domain may be separate.\n\n394\n00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:53.640\nSo as a result, they're instantiating\ntheir own instances, right?\n\n395\n00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.090\nAnd doing these kinda things.\n\n396\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.390\nAnd in that case, they being central IT,\n\n397\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.170\nthey may wanna provision\nservices templates.\n\n398\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.250\nAnd then hand them out and say,\nhey, import these and use them.\n\n399\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.984\nSo that way when you deploy and app,\nif we deploy like our web app or whatever,\n\n400\n00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:11.004\nit is standardized and everyone gets it.\n\n401\n00:17:11.004 --> 00:17:13.200\nIn the military, for instance,\nin the government and\n\n402\n00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.634\nthe military in the US in particular,\nbut around the world,\n\n403\n00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.760\nyou've got centralized oversight from\na command and control perspective.\n\n404\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.114\nBecause of IA information assurance and\nthe need to do things a certain way,\n\n405\n00:17:23.114 --> 00:17:24.415\nbecause of security.\n\n406\n00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:27.467\nIn the US, you have DISA,\nwhich is putting out all the STIGs,\n\n407\n00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:30.370\nsecure technical guidance for\nan implementation.\n\n408\n00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:34.520\nAnd so they may put out a central STIG\naround how to do a deployment for\n\n409\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.370\nservice, and\nexport the config as part of that.\n\n410\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.250\nAnd say, okay, here you go,\nthis is what you need.\n\n411\n00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.800\nAnd then, when you import it,\nthis is what you get.\n\n412\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.840\nYou stand it up,\nthis is how you deploy it.\n\n413\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.020\nAnd essentially everybody gets\nthe service deployed the same way.\n\n414\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.530\nSo these would be some of\nthe compelling business cases, right?\n\n415\n00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.515\nWhy we may do some of the stuff.\n\n416\n00:17:52.515 --> 00:17:53.231\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n417\n00:17:53.231 --> 00:17:54.690\nLet's just go back in here real quick.\n\n418\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.190\nWe have exported it out.\n\n419\n00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.810\nLet's take a look under the hood.\n\n420\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.570\nSee what's in there while we're here.\n\n421\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.180\nSo let's just open this up with Notepad,\n\n422\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.230\nthe Swiss Army knife of\nnetworking professionals, right?\n\n423\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.040\nSo let's just open this up you'll see\nthat literally it is an XML file.\n\n424\n00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.498\nAnd I know it's hard to keep\ntrack of everything in there and\n\n425\n00:18:10.498 --> 00:18:11.790\nI'm not worried about you\nseeing all the settings.\n\n426\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.845\nBut all we're looking at is a file\nthat just goes through and says,\n\n427\n00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:17.627\nokay, this is the name of the thing\nthis is where you find it,\n\n428\n00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:20.310\nthis is what it's called,\nthis is how it's built.\n\n429\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.027\nAnd just stand it all\nup in that console so\n\n430\n00:18:22.027 --> 00:18:24.260\nwhen somebody imports this\nthing it looks the same.\n\n431\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.340\nCuz that's really all we're doing.\n\n432\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.553\nSo we have this file here, right?\n\n433\n00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:31.690\nAnd so now what we're gonna do,\nlet's just go back here.\n\n434\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:37.313\nLet's go back in here, so if wanna\nimport very simple we can go ahead and\n\n435\n00:18:37.313 --> 00:18:40.140\nwe've given this out to somebody.\n\n436\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.680\nSo now what we're gonna do,\nnow that we've gone ahead and exported,\n\n437\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.780\nlet's go ahead and let's bring this in.\n\n438\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.510\nAnd let's make sure that we\nare gonna import this template.\n\n439\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.108\nI'm just gonna go back here.\n\n440\n00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:54.215\nLet's go to the service template\narea which is right, wait,\n\n441\n00:18:54.215 --> 00:18:57.216\nlet's actually highlight right here,\nsorry about that.\n\n442\n00:18:57.216 --> 00:18:58.610\nAnd what are we gonna do?\n\n443\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.712\nWe are going to do the following.\n\n444\n00:19:03.712 --> 00:19:05.840\nGo away from here for\njust one second go back over here.\n\n445\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.882\nAnd come up here and I wanna go over here.\n\n446\n00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:17.010\nWhat am I looking for?\n\n447\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.898\nThere we are right there, okay.\n\n448\n00:19:18.898 --> 00:19:25.442\nThere it is right there,\nI'm looking at it and I can't even see it.\n\n449\n00:19:25.442 --> 00:19:28.268\nI wana import my template,\nthat's the icon I'm looking for.\n\n450\n00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.183\nI keep thinking,\nit's like a of swiss cheese,\n\n451\n00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:31.660\nit's kind of a square\nwith all the holes in it.\n\n452\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.878\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But looking right at it,\n\n453\n00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:33.420\nI wasn't seeing it.\n\n454\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.876\nI guess it's getting later in\nthe day than I thought it was.\n\n455\n00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:37.904\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna import our template.\n\n456\n00:19:37.904 --> 00:19:40.690\nSo you could see our icon right there,\nwe're gonna go ahead and click import.\n\n457\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.892\nSpecify our package path, so we'll go\nahead and grab our package, right,\n\n458\n00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:46.480\nwherever that's gonna be.\n\n459\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.060\nLet's go out here.\n\n460\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.930\nActually, you know what we're\ngonna do before we do this?\n\n461\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:50.828\nLet's just do it this way.\n\n462\n00:19:50.828 --> 00:19:52.676\nJust one second.\n\n463\n00:19:52.676 --> 00:19:55.950\n&gt;&gt; And we can pull this over the network\nif we needed to, if we were connected?\n\n464\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me just.\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do this.\n\n465\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.848\nSo let's do this, we had that out there.\n\n466\n00:19:59.848 --> 00:20:01.496\nThis is the one we exported, right?\n\n467\n00:20:01.496 --> 00:20:06.336\nSo let's go ahead and let's just get\nrid of the one that we just kinda-\n\n468\n00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:07.390\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Clean it up a bit?\n\n469\n00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll just get it out of there.\n\n470\n00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.254\nAnd then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll import it back in.\n\n471\n00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:12.222\nThat way, when we add it back in,\nwe could see it there, right?\n\n472\n00:20:12.222 --> 00:20:16.716\nLet's just go in here, let's just go\nto our, we did this on the C drive,\n\n473\n00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.160\nservice template right there.\n\n474\n00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.830\nThere is our template, so\nlet's go ahead and we'll grab that.\n\n475\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.520\nWe did say export sensitive,\nso we'll import sensitive.\n\n476\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.600\nI didn't bother to put a password or\nanything on there, so\n\n477\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.200\nwe're not gonna get prompted but\nwe will go ahead, we will export that.\n\n478\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.918\nSo let's just go ahead and do that.\n\n479\n00:20:30.918 --> 00:20:34.690\nWe'll go ahead and hit Import.\n\n480\n00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.310\nWe'll hit Next,\nwe'll then see configure references.\n\n481\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.542\nYou'll see here capability profile,\nhyper V, right, that's what was in there.\n\n482\n00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:44.950\nIf we have to edit that for some reason,\nyou'll see the current mapping.\n\n483\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.790\nWe can go into edit Universal edit icon.\n\n484\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.380\nIf we want to delete,\nyou'll see we can remove that.\n\n485\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.660\nIf we decide, hey, you know what,\n\n486\n00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.650\nwe don't want that, there's our disk in\nour hard drive, our blank disk small.\n\n487\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.940\nOur template for the hard drive for\nthe VM template that we had used.\n\n488\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.880\nThat's all sitting there.\n\n489\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.730\nSo we're gonna leave that there.\n\n490\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.404\nBut if we wanna edit,\nlet me just show you real quick.\n\n491\n00:21:04.404 --> 00:21:06.558\nYou can go in and\nwe could choose to change this profile.\n\n492\n00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:07.698\nIf we said you know what?\n\n493\n00:21:07.698 --> 00:21:10.345\nThis is gonna be for\nESX instead of Hyper-V,\n\n494\n00:21:10.345 --> 00:21:12.720\nI could actually modify that on the fly.\n\n495\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.258\nWe're gonna leave that of course.\n\n496\n00:21:14.258 --> 00:21:17.350\nWe're not gonna bother changing it cuz we\nknow it checks out and validates that.\n\n497\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.478\nWe don't wanna start actually modifying\nthat because we're not sure whether or\n\n498\n00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.320\nnot the compatibility\nwill actually match up.\n\n499\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.970\nAnd it would be configured properly for\nan ESX server.\n\n500\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.200\nIf we knew that ahead of\ntime we could do that, but\n\n501\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.190\nwe're not sure that's gonna happen.\n\n502\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.050\nSo we're gonna leave that alone.\n\n503\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.548\nWe'll click Next, we'll do that,\nwe'll go ahead and do Import.\n\n504\n00:21:33.548 --> 00:21:34.410\nLet's just bring that back in.\n\n505\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.910\nGive this just a moment,\ncommand takes a moment or\n\n506\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.650\ntwo to import so,\nno big deal just wait for it.\n\n507\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.930\nYou can see our job just\nran successfully there.\n\n508\n00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.562\nAll right, so let's just go ahead,\nwe'll do that.\n\n509\n00:21:46.562 --> 00:21:48.755\nAnd you'll see that I didn't\nbother to rename it or\n\n510\n00:21:48.755 --> 00:21:50.950\ndidn't bother to change the version or\nanything.\n\n511\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.760\nBut you could see, it's now back.\n\n512\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.050\nSo we removed it and\nwe could certainly reinstall.\n\n513\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.260\nSo to your point about backing up,\n\n514\n00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.450\nwe could export this as we do\nhave a copy of the templates.\n\n515\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.495\nThere's nothing wrong with doing that.\n\n516\n00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:03.114\nAnd we obviously then would\nbe able to bring them in.\n\n517\n00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:06.155\nBut remember, one of the key drivers\nhere would be that we can hand\n\n518\n00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:09.417\nthis template to somebody and\nallow them to import, if necessary, so\n\n519\n00:22:09.417 --> 00:22:11.600\nthat they can establish or\nuse this template.\n\n520\n00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.951\n&gt;&gt; And that was a pretty easy\nwalkthrough that you just did, so\n\n521\n00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:15.180\nit's not like it's too hard.\n\n522\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.201\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the hardest part was\nremembering where the icon was, so\n\n523\n00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:18.280\nI could actually see it, right?\n\n524\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.768\nBecause I was looking right at her,\nI didn't see it.\n\n525\n00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:21.992\nAs long as you could know what\nthe icon looks like, you're fine.\n\n526\n00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:22.880\nIt doesn't take very long at all.\n\n527\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, it's very easy to export and\n\n528\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.620\nimport.\n\n529\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.220\nIt's really nothing that is at\nall gonna take a long time.\n\n530\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.335\nClearly, if the template is very large\nthere's a lot of configuration associated\n\n531\n00:22:33.335 --> 00:22:36.642\nwith a three tier template,\nwith several application packages.\n\n532\n00:22:36.642 --> 00:22:37.970\nIt would be a bigger file.\n\n533\n00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.645\nYou would have maybe 100 kilobyte or\nsomething like that.\n\n534\n00:22:40.645 --> 00:22:43.836\nIt's still not massive, it's not\ngonna take a huge amount of time, but\n\n535\n00:22:43.836 --> 00:22:45.710\nit would be a more substantial file.\n\n536\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:50.280\nIf we had added physical\nresources like the hard drives and\n\n537\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.220\nthings like that,\nit would obviously take a lot longer.\n\n538\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.203\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And that export would then\n\n539\n00:22:53.203 --> 00:22:53.809\nbecome much bigger.\n\n540\n00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:57.553\nCuz we may export those VHDs,\nwe may export those resources,\n\n541\n00:22:57.553 --> 00:23:00.455\nthose app packages, things like that.\n\n542\n00:23:00.455 --> 00:23:03.725\nBecause then this becomes a complete\ncontainer that we hand to somebody\n\n543\n00:23:03.725 --> 00:23:05.895\nwith all the associated resources.\n\n544\n00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:08.415\nWe just did a very simple,\njust send out the config and\n\n545\n00:23:08.415 --> 00:23:10.125\nbring it back kind of show and tell.\n\n546\n00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.735\nBut if we added in,\nif you remember, those resources,\n\n547\n00:23:12.735 --> 00:23:15.380\nwhen I went to Add X,\nadd those resources in.\n\n548\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.610\nWe just chose not to add them for\ntemplates or hard drives.\n\n549\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.850\nWe would extend the time to do this,\nand it would obviously,\n\n550\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.580\nbe a little bit bigger.\n\n551\n00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.330\nSo it may take a little longer,\nmaybe a little bit more complex.\n\n552\n00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.266\nBut in general,\nit's gonna be pretty straightforward.\n\n553\n00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:30.241\nWe also said we were gonna take\na look at the VM templates, so\n\n554\n00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:31.680\nwe were just going quickly.\n\n555\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.261\nWe remind ourselves of where they are,\n\n556\n00:23:34.261 --> 00:23:36.040\nshow you that we do have\na couple on Gen 1, Gen 2.\n\n557\n00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.196\nAnd we're just gonna take a look\nat how to edit them real quick.\n\n558\n00:23:39.196 --> 00:23:45.355\nI'm just going to go in and I'm going\nto take a look at the VMM Template.\n\n559\n00:23:45.355 --> 00:23:48.804\nSo we'll go in and\nwe'll take a look at this.\n\n560\n00:23:48.804 --> 00:23:51.301\nWe'll also take a look at the service\ntemplate and just show you one or\n\n561\n00:23:51.301 --> 00:23:52.824\ntwo other quick things about it in there.\n\n562\n00:23:52.824 --> 00:23:54.809\nBut the VMM template you can see.\n\n563\n00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:55.891\nLet's do our gen one.\n\n564\n00:23:55.891 --> 00:23:57.595\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhich one we choose.\n\n565\n00:23:57.595 --> 00:24:00.953\nRight-click, you'll see we can\ngo in go to properties here.\n\n566\n00:24:00.953 --> 00:24:05.536\nAnd we have our general properties,\nagain the name is kind of up the top.\n\n567\n00:24:05.536 --> 00:24:07.678\nAnd my apologies i can't\npull the wizard down, so\n\n568\n00:24:07.678 --> 00:24:10.489\nthe screen is just where it is and\nthat's going to be up at the top.\n\n569\n00:24:10.489 --> 00:24:12.060\nBut we're just looking\nat our hardware here.\n\n570\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.605\nAnd you've seen me go through this before,\nremember we can go in specify our\n\n571\n00:24:16.605 --> 00:24:19.800\ncompatibility solution,\nwant to do Xan or ESX.\n\n572\n00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.948\nWe can modify our hardware here.\n\n573\n00:24:20.948 --> 00:24:24.760\nWe've talked about adding in, or\nmodifying hardware on the fly.\n\n574\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.600\nHard drive is there, for instance.\n\n575\n00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.932\nSpecify the channel being used for\ncommunication, you know, primary channel,\n\n576\n00:24:30.932 --> 00:24:33.943\none of our SCSI adapter channels,\nso we can change this,\n\n577\n00:24:33.943 --> 00:24:36.099\nmake this into a SCSI drive, if need be.\n\n578\n00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:39.840\nWe can go ahead, change the path\nassociated where the hard drive is stored.\n\n579\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.189\nThis is all the editing and configuration\nthat we may want to go through.\n\n580\n00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:47.398\nWe talked about being able to go in and\ntake a look at the quota settings and\n\n581\n00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:50.020\nwe explained all that and\nwhat that would be.\n\n582\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.604\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n\n583\n00:24:50.604 --> 00:24:52.175\n&gt;&gt; We talked about our dependencies.\n\n584\n00:24:52.175 --> 00:24:53.664\nCherokee likes that little quota idea.\n\n585\n00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:55.657\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We talked about looking for\n\n586\n00:24:55.657 --> 00:24:59.260\nour validation errors just to make\nsure that we're aware of this.\n\n587\n00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.967\nBut you'll see we also, there we go,\nwe also have access here.\n\n588\n00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:04.268\nWe didn't look at this before,\n\n589\n00:25:04.268 --> 00:25:06.886\nthis is just one of the new things\nthat I wanted to cover with you.\n\n590\n00:25:06.886 --> 00:25:08.988\nWe have our self service access here,\n\n591\n00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:12.283\nyou'll see shared with these\nself service users or roles.\n\n592\n00:25:12.283 --> 00:25:14.823\nWe can actually specify,\nusing our delegated model.\n\n593\n00:25:14.823 --> 00:25:16.075\nYou mentioned, we can delegate.\n\n594\n00:25:16.075 --> 00:25:17.525\nAnd I said, yeah,\nwe can definitely do that.\n\n595\n00:25:17.525 --> 00:25:22.147\nWith roles, we can actually specify\nwhich users would have rights to this\n\n596\n00:25:22.147 --> 00:25:24.002\nparticular VM template.\n\n597\n00:25:24.002 --> 00:25:25.292\nSo that they could use it for deployment.\n\n598\n00:25:25.292 --> 00:25:29.002\nRemember, we said that one of the key\nvalue propositions here would be that we\n\n599\n00:25:29.002 --> 00:25:32.872\ncould start empowering users to come\nin and start to deploy their own VMs.\n\n600\n00:25:32.872 --> 00:25:35.772\nIn theory, if we wanted to do that,\nin a self service model.\n\n601\n00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:39.982\nAnd so controlling who gets\naccess to them on this tab,\n\n602\n00:25:39.982 --> 00:25:43.502\nonce we have the template stood up, is\none of the key steps involved with that.\n\n603\n00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:46.150\nSo you'll potentially come in here,\nhit add,\n\n604\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.390\nwe would then have to specify either\nour user here or our user role.\n\n605\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.280\nNow you noticed,\nno self user roles were found.\n\n606\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.140\nI have not programmed them in yet.\n\n607\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.160\nWe haven't populated them.\n\n608\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.730\nThat's something we'll talk about and\ndo separately.\n\n609\n00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.040\nBut assuming we have them in, we would\nthen be able to start delegating here.\n\n610\n00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.390\nWe haven't stood up a self\nservice function yet.\n\n611\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.350\nBut we could go in and\n\n612\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:09.160\ndo that we could select a user here let's\nassume go to our old trusty standby guest.\n\n613\n00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.595\n&gt;&gt; That's what we've been using.\n\n614\n00:26:10.595 --> 00:26:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Because we love using\nthe guest account, right?\n\n615\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.520\nIn the real world we don't ever recommend\nyou use the guest account by the way.\n\n616\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.608\n&gt;&gt; They should actually be disabled,\nright Adam?\n\n617\n00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:19.416\n&gt;&gt; They should be by default,\nit wouldn't normally be.\n\n618\n00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:21.096\nBut just for purposes of demonstration,\n\n619\n00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:22.921\nget us away from that admin account,\nright.\n\n620\n00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:25.926\nSo we don't have a lot of users set up\nin the domain environment that we're\n\n621\n00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:26.467\ndemoing in.\n\n622\n00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:29.611\nAnd so we know that we can always go\nto the guest account as standby, right?\n\n623\n00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:32.760\nSo we can specify that we can\nhave a guest account there.\n\n624\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.730\nBut you'll see we don't have\na role that's available to us.\n\n625\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.730\nThe user's optional, it's the user role\nthat we will be delegating to here,\n\n626\n00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.510\nbecause the role is the container.\n\n627\n00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.580\nAnd then we drop it.\n\n628\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.660\nThink of it like a group, right.\n\n629\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.520\nWe drop users into the roles\nwhen we instantiate them.\n\n630\n00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.850\nAnd that's how we actually\ncreate the association here.\n\n631\n00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.780\nSo setting the user itself is optional,\nright?\n\n632\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.280\nIt says you select a user.\n\n633\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.620\nWe'll filter a list of user\nroles associated with that user.\n\n634\n00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.770\nWe have no user roles, so\nwe're not going to see anything.\n\n635\n00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.160\nIt's really the user roles\nthat we set up ahead of time.\n\n636\n00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.087\nUsers have to be dropped in here for\nus to do this.\n\n637\n00:27:03.087 --> 00:27:07.129\nBut assuming we've done, we would\nbe able to start delegating access.\n\n638\n00:27:07.129 --> 00:27:09.636\nAnd this is a very effective\nmethod of access control,\n\n639\n00:27:09.636 --> 00:27:13.030\nbecause we start to eliminate users\nthat should not use these templates.\n\n640\n00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.850\nAnd only restrict them to users that will,\nor indeed should have rights to use them.\n\n641\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.730\nSo these are some of the steps\ninvolved with editing out or\n\n642\n00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.460\nmake it change the VM template.\n\n643\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.510\nWe've also talked about service templates.\n\n644\n00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.350\nRight, remember we've been in and\nout of here.\n\n645\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.380\nBeen talking a lot about\nservice templates.\n\n646\n00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.720\nWe talked about importing and\nexporting already.\n\n647\n00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.990\nWe've talked about the fact that when a\ntemplate says, needs attention, definitely\n\n648\n00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.520\nhave to go in, modify, and or deal with\nwhatever issues you may see there.\n\n649\n00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.760\nSo we just want to make sure that we're\nkeeping track of these things, and\n\n650\n00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.940\nunderstand the logic of this.\n\n651\n00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.510\nBut keep in mind also that we do\nhave the ability to do versioning.\n\n652\n00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.230\nI talked a bit about this before, where\nwe versioned out our first template and\n\n653\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.380\ndid 1.1 or QA or whatever.\n\n654\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.830\nAnd you'll see our new one that\nneeds attention there is set to new.\n\n655\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.901\nBut if we make a change if we go in\nhypothetically let's say in the QA\n\n656\n00:28:00.901 --> 00:28:03.391\ntemplate, and we make a change in here.\n\n657\n00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:06.346\nSo let's just go in and\nwe'll go to properties.\n\n658\n00:28:06.346 --> 00:28:11.211\nIf we're going to go in and start making\nchanges we may want to, instead of QA,\n\n659\n00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:13.817\nput it in a release number, like 1.1.\n\n660\n00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:18.371\nAnd the standard way of doing this, just\nfrom a tracking perspective, versioning,\n\n661\n00:28:18.371 --> 00:28:22.356\na 1.0 release, whatever the number\nto the left is doesn't matter, but\n\n662\n00:28:22.356 --> 00:28:24.210\na .0 release is a major release.\n\n663\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.506\nJust as a standing rule\nof thumb in the industry.\n\n664\n00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:31.291\nSo a .0 is a major release, a .1 or\n.2 or whatever is it interm\n\n665\n00:28:31.291 --> 00:28:36.635\nrelease inside that major release,\nso 1.0 would be a major release.\n\n666\n00:28:36.635 --> 00:28:41.811\n1.1 will be a minor release sub version\nrelease within the major category.\n\n667\n00:28:41.811 --> 00:28:46.764\nAnd then 1.1.1 would be just an update\nto that minor release while we're going\n\n668\n00:28:46.764 --> 00:28:47.408\nthrough.\n\n669\n00:28:47.408 --> 00:28:48.669\nSo you may, again,\n\n670\n00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:53.730\nyou don't know necessity to follow\nstandard operating procedure all the time.\n\n671\n00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.180\nBut certain things are standardized,\nothers you have a little flexibility with.\n\n672\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.910\nYou can do versioning\nhowever you would like.\n\n673\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.990\nIt's really unique to your dev\nenvironment through thought process,\n\n674\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.330\nthe methodology and\nthe frameworks you may use.\n\n675\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:09.410\nBut which ever one you choose, pretty much\neveryone of them has this thought process\n\n676\n00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.300\nassociated with it and you'll see\nit's a standardized thought process.\n\n677\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.770\nSo you may want to start using\nthe release area here to actually signify\n\n678\n00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.888\nversioning and\nas a result track that over time.\n\n679\n00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:23.045\nAnd that may be something that will\njust help you to keep track and\n\n680\n00:29:23.045 --> 00:29:24.754\niterate through your templates.\n\n681\n00:29:24.754 --> 00:29:27.590\nIf you're going to do that,\nwhat you may do,\n\n682\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.920\nis instead of just updating\nthe main template,\n\n683\n00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.930\nyou may have noticed since I've gone in\nand done this, I can copy the template.\n\n684\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.470\nSo, I can make a copy of it, you'll see,\nand then I can use the copy, and\n\n685\n00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.210\nI can start creating changes in the copy.\n\n686\n00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.506\nSo, I may freeze kind of a golden master\ntemplate that's set up and is structured,\n\n687\n00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:49.596\nand then I make iterated copies and then\nmake changes from there if I choose you.\n\n688\n00:29:49.596 --> 00:29:53.157\nSo you could see the copy of QA, right,\nwhich is just right-click-copy, and\n\n689\n00:29:53.157 --> 00:29:56.899\nit's there, and then I'm going to be able\nto go in and I'm able to modify the copy.\n\n690\n00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:59.009\nAnd then I could change\nthe versioning on that.\n\n691\n00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:04.314\nBecause if I do that and I change\nthe release, instead of copy of QA,\n\n692\n00:30:04.314 --> 00:30:08.240\nyou know, I may make this QA 1.1 or\nsomething.\n\n693\n00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.102\nAnd just by doing that alone, you'll\nsee that now I can stack them up, and\n\n694\n00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:13.797\nI can kind of keep track of them.\n\n695\n00:30:13.797 --> 00:30:16.221\nAnd I can see when they're created,\nor at least look at the properties,\n\n696\n00:30:16.221 --> 00:30:17.230\nhave a sense of that.\n\n697\n00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.310\nBut I can then start creating\na burgeoning solution.\n\n698\n00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.110\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, even by just that naming\nconvention you don't even have to\n\n699\n00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.930\nguess you just use the logic.\n\n700\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.160\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely or you can just use\nThe Force, whatever makes more sense.\n\n701\n00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.245\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n702\n00:30:27.245 --> 00:30:29.974\n&gt;&gt; All right, so one other thing I just\nthought I'd show you really quick since\n\n703\n00:30:29.974 --> 00:30:32.662\nwe've been talking about user roles,\nand just using that access tab, and\n\n704\n00:30:32.662 --> 00:30:34.174\nseeing how the rule would get delegated.\n\n705\n00:30:34.174 --> 00:30:37.310\nI haven't really showed it to you, we've\ntalked about it in a prior episode, but\n\n706\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.180\nI thought, what should we do to round\nthis out and make this perfect?\n\n707\n00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.730\nPut the proverbial cherry\non the Cherokee rule.\n\n708\n00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.698\nSo, we're going to go ahead, and we're\ngoing to create that rule for Cherokee.\n\n709\n00:30:45.698 --> 00:30:47.754\nI've actually already created it,\nso we have it in there.\n\n710\n00:30:47.754 --> 00:30:49.756\nBecause I was quick in doing\nthat while she was talking, but\n\n711\n00:30:49.756 --> 00:30:51.930\nI'm just going to quickly show\nyou where those rules come from.\n\n712\n00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.310\nSo we're going to go ahead and\ntake a look.\n\n713\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.033\nWe're over here in the settings area,\nin the work space.\n\n714\n00:30:56.033 --> 00:31:00.289\nWe're going to go up under security,\nwe have our user roles right here.\n\n715\n00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:04.553\nSnd just click on that, and you'll see,\naside from the administrator role that's\n\n716\n00:31:04.553 --> 00:31:07.512\nthere by default,\nI've created a role called Cherokee.\n\n717\n00:31:07.512 --> 00:31:11.555\nAnd we're going to use that Cherokee role\nor delegate it back over to that template.\n\n718\n00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:13.104\nAnd then I'm going to\nwalk you back through and\n\n719\n00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.342\njust show you where that comes from.\n\n720\n00:31:14.342 --> 00:31:17.703\nBut let me just start the wizard up to\nshow you which templates you want to use.\n\n721\n00:31:17.703 --> 00:31:20.134\nCuz there's several\ndifferent user templates and\n\n722\n00:31:20.134 --> 00:31:22.405\nonly one of them actually\ngives you this right.\n\n723\n00:31:22.405 --> 00:31:25.230\nSo let's just take a look here,\nwe're going to go in, right-click.\n\n724\n00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.040\nAnd or let's just actually do\nit up here create user role.\n\n725\n00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.880\nI'll give it a name, doesn't really matter\nwhat we call it because we're not going to\n\n726\n00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.770\nbother to go all the way through.\n\n727\n00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.950\nBut under profile this\nis where we want to be.\n\n728\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:39.220\nWe want this right here the application\nadministrator self service user.\n\n729\n00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.320\nJust highlight that, you'll see it does\nadd in some additional items here.\n\n730\n00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.800\nBut this role once we go through set\nit all up is then going to actually be\n\n731\n00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.070\nthe role that will show up on that list,\nwe'll check it off and we'll assign it to\n\n732\n00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.220\nthat template and we're going to go back\nand show you how to bind that right now.\n\n733\n00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.860\nBut we go through,\nwe'd specify the members of the role here.\n\n734\n00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.180\nSo admin, the users, administrator, guest,\n\n735\n00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.620\nwhoever, make sure they're domain members\nbecause we're going to validate their ID.\n\n736\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.630\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe'll specify our networking.\n\n737\n00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.740\nSo if we do have a network we'll bind it,\nif not we can create one.\n\n738\n00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.368\nResources, what resource do you want\nto make available what template do we\n\n739\n00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:16.130\nwant to bind.\n\n740\n00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.690\nWe could skip that and\nalways just add it in after the fact,\n\n741\n00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.040\ndoesn't matter either way.\n\n742\n00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.750\nPermissions that's a big one.\n\n743\n00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.703\nDo we want to go ahead and do we want\nto be able to narrowly define or\n\n744\n00:32:25.703 --> 00:32:29.020\nbroadly allow permissions and\naccess to resources.\n\n745\n00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.670\nSo can we turn on a VM,\nturn it off, power it off,\n\n746\n00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.330\npause it there's different\npermission levels.\n\n747\n00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.550\nYou see them if you run all\nthe way through the Wizard.\n\n748\n00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.655\nSo we're just going to cancel out here,\n\n749\n00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.960\nbecause we're not going to bother\ncreate that, we already have it.\n\n750\n00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.090\nSo what we're going to do is come back\nover here, we'll go back to fabric.\n\n751\n00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.290\nGo back to our, excuse me,\nback to library rather.\n\n752\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.700\nTo our library, to our template.\n\n753\n00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.750\nI would choose whatever template,\nit doesn't really matter which one.\n\n754\n00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.580\nRight click, we'll go into properties.\n\n755\n00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.000\nGo down to our access area and\nyou'll see here when we go in and\n\n756\n00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.970\nadd that our Cherokee role that\nwe've created is there, and so\n\n757\n00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.920\nif we grab that and click okay,\nthat's how we then say okay for\n\n758\n00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.640\nthis role whoever's the member, they're\nnow going to have rights specifically\n\n759\n00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.320\nto use this template based on\nthe permissions and scoping that we did.\n\n760\n00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.560\nSo we can start to narrowly define and\n\n761\n00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.100\ncreate these self-service options for\nusers.\n\n762\n00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.625\nWhich gives a lot more flexibility,\n\n763\n00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:20.350\nbut also a lot more control,\nas an administrator, ultimately,\n\n764\n00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.780\nover the resources we create and\nthe deployments of them.\n\n765\n00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.541\nAnd then who's going to ultimately be able\nto use them to drive the use of and/or\n\n766\n00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:29.170\nthe deployment of this template,\n\n767\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:33.119\nversus maybe users that we don't want\nusing this template, for various reasons.\n\n768\n00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:36.038\nSo that's what we would do here,\nwe would just simply click, OK.\n\n769\n00:33:36.038 --> 00:33:39.470\nAnd once we've done that,\nwe would have the user roles set up here.\n\n770\n00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.579\nClick OK again.\n\n771\n00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:42.901\nAnd then that user role is\nscoped to this template,\n\n772\n00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:46.790\nand we'll now be allowed to use it\nbased on whatever settings we provided.\n\n773\n00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, that does bring us to\nthe end of this particular episode, but\n\n774\n00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.140\nwe've covered a lot, right?\n\n775\n00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.330\nWe've looked at importing,\nexporting, looking at how to\n\n776\n00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:58.280\ncreate service templates, and also\nlooking at our virtual machine templates.\n\n777\n00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:58.860\nAnything else?\n\n778\n00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.840\nAm I forgetting anything?\n\n779\n00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.594\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that was everything.\n\n780\n00:34:01.594 --> 00:34:02.691\nExcept for the fact that-\n&gt;&gt; All right, high-five!\n\n781\n00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:04.108\n&gt;&gt; High-five.\nExcept the fact that you and\n\n782\n00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:06.900\nI are switched, so when you said\nall right, Adam, it's actually you.\n\n783\n00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n784\n00:34:07.429 --> 00:34:08.078\n&gt;&gt; Because you're me, and I'm you.\n\n785\n00:34:08.078 --> 00:34:09.214\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and sign off.\n\n786\n00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:09.782\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.\n\n787\n00:34:09.782 --> 00:34:13.560\n&gt;&gt; So, for this particular episode,\nremember, I'm your show host, Adam Gordon.\n\n788\n00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.199\n&gt;&gt; I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n789\n00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.029\nYou like my hair?\n\n790\n00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:17.845\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next\ntime here at ITProTV.\n\n791\n00:34:17.845 -->

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.425\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.395\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:21.835\nyou'll see a demonstration on how\nto create application profiles.\n\n9\n00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:25.795\nAnd to walk us through this demonstration,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.555\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:30.068\nYes, walking through the demonstration.\n\n12\n00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:31.848\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Walking through the demonstration,\n\n13\n00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:32.930\nhere we are walking.\n\n14\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.510\nSo we're gonna go through and take a look\nat, very quickly kind of remind ourselves\n\n15\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360\nof what application profiles\nare on the console.\n\n16\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.940\nI know you've seen them,\n\n17\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.090\nwe've talked about them, probably not\na lot of mystery there at this point.\n\n18\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.570\nBut in case you haven't seen our prior\nepisodes in this area remind you that you\n\n19\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840\nshould think about going in and\ntaking a look.\n\n20\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.800\nIf you have and\n\n21\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.130\nyou're keeping up-to-date with us, we're\ngoing to do a quick run through the app\n\n22\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.870\nprofile creation process focusing on one\nof the elements we haven't touched on yet.\n\n23\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.530\nWhich is adding in pre and\npost install scripts and\n\n24\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.220\njust talking about what we can do there.\n\n25\n00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.560\nShow you how we'd stack those apps up,\nand configure them.\n\n26\n00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.908\nWe're gonna go ahead and jump right in.\n\n27\n00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:08.510\nIf we take a look,\ngot our console open, our SCVMM console.\n\n28\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.010\nWe are in, as you can see,\nour library workspace.\n\n29\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.951\nWe have our profiles area selected,\nour application profiles,\n\n30\n00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:14.971\nover here on the left.\n\n31\n00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:17.979\nWe're just gonna either right click and\nchoose go in and\n\n32\n00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.880\ncreate an app profile,\ndepending on the item.\n\n33\n00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.800\nJust wait for\nit to connect here, there we go.\n\n34\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.230\n[LAUGH] We can either go in,\nright-click, Create App Profile,\n\n35\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.910\nand/or just come up here,\nCreate App Profiles.\n\n36\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.980\nAgain, we have different options,\ndepending on where we are.\n\n37\n00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.250\nDoesn't matter by the way, both\nthe options wind up in the same place.\n\n38\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.300\nWe get our wizard here,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll give it a name.\n\n39\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.730\nSo let's just call this\nITProTV app profile one.\n\n40\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.300\nAnd then under compatibility\nwe can choose either general\n\n41\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.490\nyou'll see we can choose SQL server\napplication host or web application host\n\n42\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.240\ndepending on what it is this particular\napplication profile is gonna focus on.\n\n43\n00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.250\nRemember under application profiles we\ncan add in our sequel data application.\n\n44\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.650\nWe can add in our web application.\n\n45\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.410\nAnd so our web deploy zip file that\ngives us the output of the web app.\n\n46\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.840\nWe can do application virtualization.\n\n47\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.930\nSo we have different options.\n\n48\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.831\nSo we are gonna make a choice here.\n\n49\n00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.029\nWe can obviously decide if\nwe do web application host,\n\n50\n00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:21.825\nthen when we come over here and we start\nadding in our applications you'll see that\n\n51\n00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:23.931\nwe limit ourselves just to web app.\n\n52\n00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:28.035\nYou can see it's filtered the list,\nso that way we only get the app or\n\n53\n00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.768\nthe application category.\n\n54\n00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:34.109\nOr categories that are specific to that\nkind of compatibility that we chose on\n\n55\n00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:34.988\nthe prior tab.\n\n56\n00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:40.980\nIf we go back here to general and\nwe choose SQL Server Application Hosting.\n\n57\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.669\nCome over here and we choose add.\n\n58\n00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.200\nYou'll see that we are limited just to\nour SQL DAC, our data tier application.\n\n59\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.810\nSo we're just constraining and\n\n60\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.790\nlimiting ourselves in the template to\njust this specific kind of application.\n\n61\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.560\nNo mistake by saying, hey,\nlet me click and do both.\n\n62\n00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.490\nAnd then, you know, we only support one.\n\n63\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.500\nSo we can be narrowly defined we can scope\nand tailor here, or we could go general.\n\n64\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.490\nAnd if we go general we'll have access\nto any and all of the application types.\n\n65\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.467\nLet's just choose general and you'll\nsee under application configuration.\n\n66\n00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:16.982\nYou'll see we have our script\napplication virtual app,\n\n67\n00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:20.375\nas well as SQL, and the data application.\n\n68\n00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.115\nThe DAC SQL application and the web apps.\n\n69\n00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:23.945\nSo we could choose any or all of these.\n\n70\n00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:26.925\nSo it's really up to us to\ndecide how we want to do this.\n\n71\n00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:30.461\nThere's no right and wrong, but if we\nknow we're gonna deploy a web app there's\n\n72\n00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.697\nno harm in doing general and\njust choosing web app.\n\n73\n00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:36.426\nOr we can go ahead and just choose\nweb app compatibility up front, and\n\n74\n00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:40.750\nthen it just tailors and scopes that for\nus and only allows us to choose web apps.\n\n75\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.250\nSo it's up to us to decide.\n\n76\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.120\nWe'll just go ahead and we'll choose one\njust now for purposes of demonstration.\n\n77\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.230\nBut before we do that let me go\nback up here to OS compatibility.\n\n78\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.470\nWe would wanna choose the appropriate\noperating system compatibility.\n\n79\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.790\nLet me move that over just a little bit so\nyou could see that.\n\n80\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.771\nWe would wanna choose the appropriate\noperating system compatibility setting.\n\n81\n00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.186\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n82\n00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:04.411\nIt's highly unlikely, as I think I said\nin the last episode when we did this,\n\n83\n00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:08.766\nthat we would have an application that\nruns the gamut from Small Business Server\n\n84\n00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:12.020\n2003 all the way up through\nlet's say 12 or 12 R2.\n\n85\n00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.288\nSo it would behoove us,\nit would be a good idea, for\n\n86\n00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.480\nus to choose or\ncheck off which operating system or\n\n87\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.046\noperating systems, may be more than one,\nwould be appropriate here.\n\n88\n00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:27.334\nIf we're not sure, than obviously it\nwill be up to us to decide how to\n\n89\n00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:32.230\neither error on the side of caution or\ndecide just to select everything.\n\n90\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.650\nAnd then just let the application\nrun based on whatever we decide to\n\n91\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.700\ndeploy this on.\n\n92\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.380\nIf we know for a fact, for instance,\n\n93\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.590\nwe're not gonna be deploying this on\nanything other than 12 R2 instances and\n\n94\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.250\nthe app runs on 12 R2, let's just select\nthose to make sure we're covered.\n\n95\n00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.270\nBut let's not worry about all those other\nones because we're not gonna see them and\n\n96\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.910\nthey're not gonna be used.\n\n97\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.260\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna be breaking anything\nif we just check all of them are we?\n\n98\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.740\n&gt;&gt; No, it's just a matter\nof the app may not actually\n\n99\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.550\nrun properly in some of the other\nones cuz the code wont be supported,\n\n100\n00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.990\nbut we wont hurt anything\nby making that choice.\n\n101\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.275\nSo we could error on the side of caution,\nbut the reality is we know for\n\n102\n00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:09.745\na fact we're not supporting 2008 or\nanything prior to that.\n\n103\n00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:10.875\nNo reason to select those,\n\n104\n00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:14.475\nwe're just making selections which\ndoesn't really matter in our world.\n\n105\n00:05:14.475 --> 00:05:17.995\nSo we'll just go ahead,\nwe'll just choose let's just say 64-bit,\n\n106\n00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:22.295\nWindows Server 2008 data center\nR2 standard or whatever.\n\n107\n00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:25.115\nI'm not actually gonna configure\nthis profile end to end so\n\n108\n00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.015\nit doesn't really matter what I choose.\n\n109\n00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.505\nBut in the real world it would\njust be something to consider.\n\n110\n00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:30.509\nSo we'll just select that.\n\n111\n00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.062\nJust didn't want that to get\nlost in our conversation.\n\n112\n00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:36.230\nSuch a small little item up there\nthat the minute you click off and\n\n113\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.050\nyou add the app it goes away, and you may\nforget it's there and not even realize it.\n\n114\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.070\nPut a big neon, hey you didn't\nfill me out yet, kinda flash.\n\n115\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.050\nOr something on there.\n\n116\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.190\nAll right so we could stack up one or\nmore of these applications.\n\n117\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.470\nWe've done our web app\njust as a choice here, and\n\n118\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.680\nyou could see we would go out we\nwould find our web app package.\n\n119\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.770\nWe've talked about this,\nit would be in the library.\n\n120\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.160\nRemember we'd import\nfrom our web deploy tool,\n\n121\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.950\nthe exported zip file\nwe get as the output.\n\n122\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.092\nThrow that in the library so\nit's available as a resource.\n\n123\n00:06:01.092 --> 00:06:03.061\nWe would go out and browse and\nbring that in here.\n\n124\n00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:05.173\nAnd then that package\nwould actually show up.\n\n125\n00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:06.899\nWe're not as concerned about that,\ncuz we've talked about that.\n\n126\n00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.040\nYou guys have a sense of\nhow to deal with that.\n\n127\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.990\nWhat I am concerned about,\nwhat I wanna show you here,\n\n128\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.580\nwhich we haven't done yet, is this\nother little area here called scripts.\n\n129\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.290\nWe haven't really spent any time on it.\n\n130\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.110\nWe haven't talked about what goes on here.\n\n131\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.030\nMove this over a little more.\n\n132\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.155\nAnd it's all kinda empty and\nlonely all sitting off by itself there.\n\n133\n00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:26.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be unhappy if we don't give\n\n134\n00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.110\nit something that represents\nits ability to contribute here.\n\n135\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.970\nSo we're gonna go to add.\n\n136\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.260\nAnd instead of adding the app what we see\ndown here is we can add now since we've\n\n137\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.010\nchosen the app, Script to Application.\n\n138\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.944\nAnd so we can add a script.\n\n139\n00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:41.737\nAnd you'll see it adds a script\nin right below the app,\n\n140\n00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:46.070\nand you'll see we can do pre install\nscript but we can actually change that.\n\n141\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.220\nSo this is an app, or\nrather a script that would run,\n\n142\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.770\nat least the way it's set right now,\nto do some stuff pre install.\n\n143\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.510\nSo we would say okay,\nwhat do we wanna run ahead of time?\n\n144\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.790\nMaybe we want to format out a drive,\nmaybe we want to go ahead and map a drive,\n\n145\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.700\nwho knows what we would do with a script.\n\n146\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.200\nBut whatever we would do,\nwe could do that here.\n\n147\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.709\nWe'll specify our executable, our\nparameters, the script resource package,\n\n148\n00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:06.634\nRun As account.\n\n149\n00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.313\nThe really cool thing,\nand also the time out,\n\n150\n00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:13.584\nreally cool thing though is we go in\nunder advanced if we choose to do that.\n\n151\n00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:14.688\nCan we go full screen, just to see this?\n\n152\n00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:17.666\nIt may be easier for you to see this\nwhile we're talking, than it is for\n\n153\n00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:20.818\nyou to watch me talk and point at\nthe screen, but you can't see anything.\n\n154\n00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:23.960\nBut you can see here that we\nhave our output persistence,\n\n155\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.181\nour file path, our failure policy,\nour restart policy.\n\n156\n00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:31.002\nWe have detailed settings about how to\ndeal with the script if things go right\n\n157\n00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:34.010\nand where they happen,\nbut also if they go wrong.\n\n158\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.920\nAnd if something goes wrong, what kind of\nerror codes or exit codes do we want here?\n\n159\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.300\nWhat do we want our responsibility or\n\n160\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.430\nour operational output to be,\nif we have a problem?\n\n161\n00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.430\nWhat actions do we wanna take?\n\n162\n00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.510\nAnd you'll see,\nwe can match a string here for output.\n\n163\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.380\nYou'll see that Action when matched.\n\n164\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.440\nIf our exit code is any value\nother than zero or not match.\n\n165\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.360\nWe can specify and\n\n166\n00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.228\nbe very prescriptive here,\nvery detailed about what's gonna happen.\n\n167\n00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:04.090\nWe also, after the computer\nvirtual machine is restarted,\n\n168\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.590\nrestart the script if there's a pause or\nsome sort of a problem.\n\n169\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.950\nSo we can re-engage the script,\ntry to run it again.\n\n170\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.250\nThere's been a challenge,\nif something isn't working the right way.\n\n171\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.250\nSo, we can go ahead and\n\n172\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.990\nprogram in all of the necessary\nadditional depth or details here,\n\n173\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.950\nunder advanced, for any of the scripts you\nwant to look at in one form or another.\n\n174\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.890\nNow, we have pre-install,\n\n175\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.220\nbut that's not all, because we are going\nto be able to do post-install.\n\n176\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.250\nSo we can change this\nscript by toggling here.\n\n177\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.290\nWe could do a post-install\nscript instead of pre.\n\n178\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.830\nWe could just have it\nrun after the install.\n\n179\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.230\nMaybe at that point we wanna map\nthe drive instead of beforehand.\n\n180\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.130\nSpecify where we want\nthis action to take place\n\n181\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.865\ncuz sometimes you feel like a preinstall.\n\n182\n00:08:44.865 --> 00:08:47.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like a post install.\n\n183\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.600\nJust a matter of what you're feeling for.\n\n184\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.960\nYou'll see we could do a save state,\nrestore state.\n\n185\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.700\nWe may be capturing\nstate from the machine.\n\n186\n00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.155\nWe could be doing a pre-service,\npost-service, pre-uninstall,\n\n187\n00:08:57.155 --> 00:08:58.090\npost-uninstall.\n\n188\n00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.910\nMaybe this application will have to have\na script routine that runs that actually\n\n189\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.490\ndoes an uninstall for\nsomething before that's there,\n\n190\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.250\nmaybe a prior instance, and then goes\nahead and does an install of this new one.\n\n191\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.838\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; So there's a lot of stuff we could do\n\n192\n00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:14.380\nin theory,\ndepending on what we want it to do.\n\n193\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.190\nSo don't want to underestimate\nthe value of scripts here,\n\n194\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.900\nbecause this gives a lot of additional\ncapabilities with the application\n\n195\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.470\nto add functionality outside that\napplication, around it in some way.\n\n196\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.210\nThat then allows us to\nbe able to hard code or\n\n197\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.955\nat least program in what program,\nwhat script, and\n\n198\n00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:37.250\nwhat application are bound to what script\nand what application and script together.\n\n199\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.500\nBased on that and\nthe commands that we issue with the script\n\n200\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.900\nwill then tell us what\nthe outcome will be.\n\n201\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.020\nWe can do just about anything.\n\n202\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.960\nSo can we be doing PowerShell here,\nwe can do a batch file of some kind,\n\n203\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.450\nsome sort of command script, any or\n\n204\n00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.800\nall of those things can be done,\nit's just a matter of what we're gonna do.\n\n205\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.050\nSo we could go in now and do this.\n\n206\n00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.957\nNow if we add, let's say,\nstack up another application,\n\n207\n00:09:54.957 --> 00:09:58.056\nlet's do our sequel application,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n208\n00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.724\nBut you'll see here,\nwe have this, we actually,\n\n209\n00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:04.700\nyou'll see, have the ability to put\na SQL server script in as well.\n\n210\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.239\nSo you'll see we can add scripts for\nthe SQL server.\n\n211\n00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:10.730\nYou can click add here and\nwe can specify for the SQL server.\n\n212\n00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:15.570\nPre-install, post-install same\nkind of format, if you will.\n\n213\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.430\nBut specify the authentication\ntype because we have to typically\n\n214\n00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.550\nauthenticate to run\nagainst the SQL Server.\n\n215\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.830\nTo run the scripts,\nwe have to provide credentials for that.\n\n216\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.780\nA little bit different than what we may\ndo otherwise, you did the credential but\n\n217\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.660\na run as account.\n\n218\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.310\nThis is a SQL account specifically.\n\n219\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.310\nWe also need permission to do\nthe sequel box in the instance, so\n\n220\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.970\nit's a little bit of a different account.\n\n221\n00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.112\nBut you'll see there,\n\n222\n00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:36.495\nwe could also encrypt the connection-\n&gt;&gt; Applying our password.\n\n223\n00:10:36.495 --> 00:10:40.709\n&gt;&gt; No, this would actually encrypt\nthe connection back to SQL.\n\n224\n00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:43.149\nThis would actually encrypt\nthe connection back to the database, so\n\n225\n00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:45.177\nthat information is exchanged\nover encrypted, right?\n\n226\n00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:45.901\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n227\n00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:46.717\n&gt;&gt; So nobody could see it.\n\n228\n00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:48.404\nBecause, we may be running a script,\n\n229\n00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:51.908\nnot only that will provide credentials\nto see Windows authentication or SQL.\n\n230\n00:10:51.908 --> 00:10:55.490\nWe want to protect that password exchange,\nusername exchange.\n\n231\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.100\nBut also, we wanna to protect\nthe data that may be going back and\n\n232\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.090\nforth as a result of the script.\n\n233\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.110\nSo it is important for\nus to take advantage of that, or\n\n234\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.920\nat least know that we can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n235\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.941\nSo we have that here, and if we add in,\nlet's just add in one more.\n\n236\n00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.355\nOur virtual application if\nwe decide we wanna do that,\n\n237\n00:11:11.355 --> 00:11:14.083\nremember we made this general so\nwe could just stack them up and\n\n238\n00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:17.142\nshow them to you as opposed to hey\njust web app or something like that.\n\n239\n00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:19.440\nSo we're gonna show you\nthe different types in other words.\n\n240\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.228\nWe could add a script here as well.\n\n241\n00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:24.282\nRemember virtual applications\nis an application.\n\n242\n00:11:24.282 --> 00:11:25.510\nIt's just a virtual application.\n\n243\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.960\nIt works the same way as a web\napp does in the sense that\n\n244\n00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.380\nwe consider it an application,\nit's just a type of application.\n\n245\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.243\nAnd so the script options themselves\nare going to be the same, as you can see,\n\n246\n00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:37.451\nthey work the same as\nthe web app scripts do.\n\n247\n00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:41.280\nWe just choose which ones we want to\nuse and program them in accordingly.\n\n248\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.670\nSo we're able to add in these scripts,\nmodify them as we go, or\n\n249\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.080\nspecify, hey this is what I want or\nwhatever the particular option will be.\n\n250\n00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.540\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe can go ahead and click okay and\n\n251\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.510\nthen we'll finish everything out and\nthen we'll have our app profile.\n\n252\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.015\nSo creating the app profile is really\njust a matter of bringing in one or\n\n253\n00:11:59.015 --> 00:12:00.435\nmore of these app types.\n\n254\n00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:04.088\nObviously, I've got the associated package\nor deployment items that we can have in\n\n255\n00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.875\nthe library traditionally, so\nwe'll pull them in from there.\n\n256\n00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:10.155\nBut then we wanna make sure we use or\nat least think about investigating\n\n257\n00:12:10.155 --> 00:12:13.615\nthe use of these scripts to further\nrefine our deployments if necessary.\n\n258\n00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:16.355\nSo that's what we wanted to make\nsure we spent a little time on here.\n\n259\n00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:18.057\nNow that you've seen how to do this, or\n\n260\n00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:20.947\nhopefully have a better sense of\nhow to use application profiles,\n\n261\n00:12:20.947 --> 00:12:24.164\nremember we can link those profiles\nback to our service design template.\n\n262\n00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:27.092\nWe talked about that, in our service\ntemplate in the designer route.\n\n263\n00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:30.420\nAnd we've shown you how to do that\nwith our tiered-based deployment in\n\n264\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.920\nthe template,\nadding those applications in.\n\n265\n00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.350\nYou pull them in, and now we have\nthem all set up and associated.\n\n266\n00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.078\nWe can add our deployments in, or\nour applications into our deployments, and\n\n267\n00:12:39.078 --> 00:12:41.338\nthrow the application as\nwell as the machines,\n\n268\n00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:44.250\nas part of provisioning\nout to the private cloud.\n\n269\n00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n270\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.240\nThat is Application Profiles.\n\n271\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.510\nFor this particular episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n272\n00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.150\nBut remember,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n273\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n274\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.229\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n275\n00:12:57.229 --> 00:13:03.198\n[MUSIC]\n\n276\n00:13:03.198 -->

00:00:09.407\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.407 --> 00:00:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\noperating a private cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.630\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.920\nIn this episode we'll be looking at how\nto monitor cloud-based applications.\n\n7\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.070\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n8\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.080\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.630\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.550\nAlways a pleasure to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.900\nWe're going to continue talking\nabout all things cloud, as they say.\n\n12\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.285\nCloudy with a chance of cloud,\nI guess is how we would put that.\n\n13\n00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:38.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to continue talking\n\n14\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.600\nabout cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.520\nWe've been talking up until now some of\nthe highlights from prior episodes incase\n\n16\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.970\nyou haven't seen them all.\n\n17\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.860\nWe have been talking about just\na general overview of what cloud is.\n\n18\n00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.360\nWe've gone through Cloud\nfrom the perspective of\n\n19\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.050\nwhat are the service models,\nhow to deliver services,\n\n20\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.140\ninfrastructure platform\nsoftware as a service.\n\n21\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.770\nWe've talked extensively about\nthe virtual machine manager,\n\n22\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.230\nthe fabric in the Microsoft System\nCenter Sweep, how we configure that,\n\n23\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.720\nhow we use that,\nhow we build out library capabilities for\n\n24\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.565\nstoring and referencing information\npackages, whatever we may have.\n\n25\n00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:15.030\nTalked about how to set up networks and\nthe network components,\n\n26\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.710\nIP pools, Mac pools, logical networks.\n\n27\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.840\nWent in and took a look at the IP\ntemplates, virtual IP configuration.\n\n28\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.710\nWe took a look at and talked about\nhow to use all three elements of our\n\n29\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.530\nfabric networking storage and the\nconfiguration of the servers themselves.\n\n30\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.960\nAnd we've also gone\nthrough the VMM console.\n\n31\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.620\nAnd really just spend time in there\nunderstanding how we can leverage that\n\n32\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.050\nmanagement solution to be able to set\nup and stage our packages that can then\n\n33\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.830\nbe used in either a service\ndesign template of some kind and\n\n34\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.720\nuse those service templates to be able\nto deploy not just virtual machines, but\n\n35\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.710\nan entire solution around them.\n\n36\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.580\nThat includes the applications,\n\n37\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.850\nthat includes the virtual machine\nconfiguration, the operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.942\nwe call it the guest OS, the hardware\nprofiles, maybe a SQL solution,\n\n39\n00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:10.340\nor a SQL application, and\na database that is all configured and\n\n40\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.430\nready to go, along with all the\nVirtualized applications we may wanna use.\n\n41\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.720\nWe talked about Server App-V and\nhow all that's gonna happen.\n\n42\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.070\nSo we've done all of that up until now.\n\n43\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.500\nWe've done a lot of stuff, right?\n\n44\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.000\n&gt;&gt; We really have.\n[LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.700\n&gt;&gt; We've been really busy.\n\n46\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.120\nSo if you haven't seen all that stuff,\ndefinitely encourage you to go back,\n\n47\n00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.630\ntake a look at all those episodes in\nthe earlier part of our discussions,\n\n48\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.430\ncuz they're gonna set you up to have\na better sense of what we're gonna start\n\n49\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.690\nfocusing on here.\n\n50\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.700\nAnd for next Several of our conversations,\nnext several episodes we're\n\n51\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.340\ngoing to be going through and talking\nabout SCOM, System Center Ops Manager.\n\n52\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.145\nThe other major component of what we\ndo with regards to monitoring and\n\n53\n00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:51.195\ninteracting with data in the cloud in\nthe data center in our private cloud.\n\n54\n00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:53.995\nWe have to create the fabric and\ncreate the actual\n\n55\n00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:57.515\ninfrastructure we're gonna run and then we\nhave to monitor that infrastructure and\n\n56\n00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:00.185\nsystems, and our ops manager\nis where we do the monitoring.\n\n57\n00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:03.385\nSo we're gonna take you through and\ntalk about how we set it up,\n\n58\n00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:06.855\nwhat are moving parts, the component\npieces, what's the management group,\n\n59\n00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:10.460\nwhat's gateway server,\nwhat's an agent, why do we need them.\n\n60\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.180\nWhat is going to be,\n\n61\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.200\nwhat are gonna be the important\nrequirements about setting all this up.\n\n62\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.720\nWhat kind of databases do we\nhave to be concerned with,\n\n63\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.170\nthe ops database,\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n64\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.570\nWhy do we need reporting, how do we set\nup and integrate a reporting service.\n\n65\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.790\nUsing SSRS.\n\n66\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.920\nWe're gonna be going through and talking\nabout all this stuff, but also a lot more.\n\n67\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.090\nWe're gonna be talking about\nhow to configure the agent,\n\n68\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.580\ndifferent ways to deploy it.\n\n69\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.700\nWe're gonna be talking about and going\ninto the role of Management Packs and\n\n70\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.500\nall sorts of stuff that\nsupports that conversation.\n\n71\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.310\nI could do the whole intro for\nwhat we're gonna cover, and\n\n72\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.150\nit would take just one\nepisode to get through.\n\n73\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.720\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; All that information.\n\n74\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.760\nThat's how much stuff we\nhave to share with you.\n\n75\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.700\n&gt;&gt; Be prepared.\n\n76\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.460\n&gt;&gt; About SKOM.\n\n77\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.850\nSo this is gonna be like\ndrinking from the SKOM fire hose.\n\n78\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.550\nThat's what we should call\nthis series of episodes.\n\n79\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The SCOM fire codes.\n\n80\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.960\n&gt;&gt; What a great visual there, Adam.\n\n81\n00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.000\n&gt;&gt; We don't have a visual for\nthat, cuz that wouldn't be pretty.\n\n82\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.120\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n83\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.310\nWe're gonna get started.\n\n84\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.440\nWhat I'd like to do is actually talk\na little about the moving parts and\n\n85\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.520\npieces associated with SCOM.\n\n86\n00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.650\nBut before we even do that What we really\nneed to do is take a look at what it means\n\n87\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.300\nto get started with implementing and\ndeploying SCOM.\n\n88\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.150\nSo if you bear with me here just\none second, because as always we've\n\n89\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.400\ngot some interesting stuff to show you\nboth on the web and in the infrastructure.\n\n90\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.230\nWe're gonna take a look at both.\n\n91\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.880\nWe could start, we're just gonna give you\nan overview of what you're gonna need to\n\n92\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.270\nbe concerned with, how do we get\nthis thought process kicked off.\n\n93\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.120\nBest way to do that, look at some of\nthe technet real estate out there,\n\n94\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.150\nlet's talk about quickly what some of\nthe key things we want to be aware of are.\n\n95\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.630\nRemember, system center ops managers,\n\n96\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.160\nlike all of the different suite products,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.800\nWe've got and we've talked about VMM.\n\n98\n00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880\nWe've got SC,\nsystem center config manager, SCCM.\n\n99\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.270\nWe've got service manager,\ngot the orchestrator product.\n\n100\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.520\nWe've got the endpoint protection manager.\n\n101\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.800\nWe've got the app controller.\n\n102\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.570\nI've shown you a little bit about\nthat in some prior episodes.\n\n103\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.600\nWe've got our DPM product,\ndata protection manager.\n\n104\n00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.710\nYou've got all these\ndifferent moving parts.\n\n105\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.630\nThey're all going to be at, hopefully,\nsince we're talking about 12R2,\n\n106\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.680\nthe most, or second the most recent\nversion of System Center sweep,\n\n107\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.550\nbecause we're now looking\nat System Center 2016.\n\n108\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.510\nBut the reality is we do have 2012R2 and\nthat's what we're focussed on.\n\n109\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.870\nWe gotta make sure that we're\nrunning the right version.\n\n110\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.630\nNow with SCOM, there's 2007 R2\nthat you may be seeing and using,\n\n111\n00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.690\nas that's older, but certainly a lot\nof you may still have that deployed.\n\n112\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.920\nWe certainly can see\n2012 SP1 and/or 2012 R2.\n\n113\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.190\nAnd as I said, perhaps you may\nhave 2016 already deployed.\n\n114\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.910\nSo there may be different versions\nof infrastructure out there.\n\n115\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.380\nWe're focusing on 12 R2.\n\n116\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.800\nAnd so\nwhen we take a look at this area here,\n\n117\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.690\nwe can see that we have,\nthe what's new in Ops Manager area?\n\n118\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.830\nSo you can drill through and\n\n119\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.050\nsee some of the features I'm\nabout to discuss with you.\n\n120\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.495\nYou'll see See the key concepts,\nthe release notes.\n\n121\n00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:59.385\nI always talk about,\nwhen we do these kind of shows, and\n\n122\n00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:03.335\nwhen I talk about this with customers, or\nI talk about it with students in class,\n\n123\n00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:06.925\nI always talk about the fact that reading\nthe release notes for the product is so\n\n124\n00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:08.675\nimportant for you to understand.\n\n125\n00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:11.235\nNot just the capabilities of\nthis particular release, but\n\n126\n00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:15.165\nall the features that are focused on\nthings that are new, certainly, but\n\n127\n00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:17.560\nalso things that have been marked for\ndeprecation.\n\n128\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.560\nThings that are going to be going away.\n\n129\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.420\nMicrosoft does a good job of saying hey,\n\n130\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.380\nyou know we're going to start zeroing\non these particular set of features and\n\n131\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.950\ndeveloping them, and\nreally giving you additional capabilities.\n\n132\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.710\nBut we're also going to start\nignoring these features and\n\n133\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.170\neventually get rid of them.\n\n134\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.710\nSo start moving away from these\nthings because over time,\n\n135\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.770\nyou're not going to be able to use them.\n\n136\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.700\nAnd they document all this and\ntalk about all this in the release notes.\n\n137\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.370\nSo you want to make sure you\ngo through that deprecation,\n\n138\n00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.350\nis the word you would look for because\nthings that are deprecated are releases or\n\n139\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.230\nrather features that\nare gonna be ultimately,\n\n140\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.790\nprobably in the next cycle or perhaps\nthe next few cycles, done away with.\n\n141\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:53.390\nAnd more often than not,\n\n142\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.248\nthey will be removed from the products so\nyou wanna check that out.\n\n143\n00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:59.960\nYou also will get a list of all\nthe features that have been removed or\n\n144\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.590\nreleased in this particular,\n\n145\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.280\nremoved from this particular\nrelease is what I meant to say.\n\n146\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.660\nSo you wanna make sure you\ntake a look at that as well.\n\n147\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.430\nAnd always go through those release notes.\n\n148\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.220\nYou'll be amazed at what you find in\nthere especially for those of you, and\n\n149\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.840\nwe are setting this conversation up along\nwith the 7247 conversations we will\n\n150\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.050\nhave on another set of shows\naround on the MCSC private cloud.\n\n151\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.320\nYou wanna make sure that because this is\ntestable material, how do we use SCOM?\n\n152\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.640\nHow do we set it up?\n\n153\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.170\nHow do we integrate SCOM and VMM?\n\n154\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.910\nHow do we do fabric monitoring?\n\n155\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.400\nAnd all the stuff we're doing.\n\n156\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.590\nAll of this is part of what\nmakes up the knowledge base for\n\n157\n00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.250\nthe two examines that go into\nmaking you a MCSC private Cloud\n\n158\n00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.380\nplus the MCSA as Cherokee knows that we've\ntalked about in prior episodes, right.\n\n159\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.530\nYou're half way there, by the way, right.\n\n160\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you just gotta think about that-\n\n161\n00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.590\n&gt;&gt; Over half way there.\n\n162\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.860\n&gt;&gt; You're over half way there, right\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.660\n&gt;&gt; You've done the hard part.\n\n164\n00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.560\nYou've just gotta get over\nthe finish line with these.\n\n165\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.279\nBut my point is, a lot of the minutiae, a\nlot of those little off in the corner kind\n\n166\n00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.618\nof things that get asked about in\nquestions that you look at afterwards,\n\n167\n00:07:57.618 --> 00:08:00.958\nyou scratch your head and you go I've\nbeen using this product for years,\n\n168\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.633\nI have no idea where that came from.\n\n169\n00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:03.227\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen that.\n\n170\n00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:06.400\nI would never have known\nthe answer to that question,\n\n171\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.650\neven if it was in front of me.\n\n172\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.350\nWe've all seen those kind of questions\nthat just show up on the exam.\n\n173\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.450\nThey're legitimate,\nthey do deal with features,\n\n174\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.960\nbut usually features that\nare very deep inside the product.\n\n175\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.480\nThey may be a command line feature through\nPowerShell or something like that.\n\n176\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.830\nWe are gonna show you some basic\nPowerShell commands, demo a few things for\n\n177\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.020\nyou along the way.\n\n178\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.120\nHow do we install,\na management agent through PowerShell?\n\n179\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.340\nHow do we specify the RMS emulator role?\n\n180\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.660\nHow do we look at things like that?\n\n181\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.850\nI'll show you some basic stuff, but\nthere is so many cmdlets in there,\n\n182\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.010\nI can't go through all of them,\nwe could do probably five or\n\n183\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.410\nsix shows just on\nthe operation shell alone.\n\n184\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.680\nSo, when you read the release notes,\n\n185\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.460\nthis is where you tend to find a lot\nof those little off-in-the-corner,\n\n186\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.135\ncrazy things that you got to know just\nthe minutiae of the stuff for the exam.\n\n187\n00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:54.895\nI'm not suggesting that means you\nread that, you're gonna pass.\n\n188\n00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:55.715\nI'm just pointing out,\n\n189\n00:08:55.715 --> 00:09:00.010\nyou wanna be able to understand as\nmuch about these products as possible,\n\n190\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.562\nA) because clearly it's very important for\nyou to do your job, and do it well.\n\n191\n00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:06.202\nYou wanna be able to be knowledgeable\nabout these products as you use them so\n\n192\n00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:09.192\nyou wanna make sure you have as much\nat your fingertips as possible.\n\n193\n00:09:09.192 --> 00:09:10.472\nBut you also clearly, and\n\n194\n00:09:10.472 --> 00:09:13.992\nlet's be honest, you wanna be successful\non the exams, you wanna pass,\n\n195\n00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:16.880\nyou wanna get that certification\nas well as get the knowledge.\n\n196\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.530\nAnd reading these release notes is\none of the ways that will help you\n\n197\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.110\nto be able to be better prepared for both.\n\n198\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.120\nSo just pointing that out for you.\n\n199\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.820\nObviously important for\nyou to think about.\n\n200\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.650\n&gt;&gt; That's a really great advice.\n\n201\n00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.400\nFor sure, a great advice.\n\n202\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Of course it's a great advice.\n\n203\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.890\nI never give bad advice.\n\n204\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.525\n&gt;&gt; I know it's from Adam, but I'm just,\nI mean really knowing that overall\n\n205\n00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:33.800\ndomain-function level, also you\nmight have a mixed environment, and\n\n206\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.310\nyou might need to be aware\nof the compatibility.\n\n207\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.602\nSo real life just as important.\n\n208\n00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:40.330\n&gt;&gt; We will specifically, we'll actually\ntalk about that particular a little bit\n\n209\n00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.420\nlater on, but with active\ndirectory integration specific to\n\n210\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.380\nmanagement agents being able to get\ntheir management group association.\n\n211\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.420\nWe actually have a very specific\nset of domain requirements.\n\n212\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.570\nWe've got to be at a certain level.\n\n213\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.850\nSo functionally basically\na native mode 2000 or above,\n\n214\n00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.670\nso there's some things\nwe would want to know.\n\n215\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.640\nThat kind of stuff is going\nto be in the release notes.\n\n216\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.800\nAlthough buried in there,\nit's stuff you got to go through and read.\n\n217\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.700\nSo it is very important\nto know that absolutely.\n\n218\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.200\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to where we were.\n\n219\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.930\nIf we could just, put that back up.\n\n220\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.800\nSo just going through this just\nshowing you that we've got quite\n\n221\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.520\na number of resources here as well.\n\n222\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.200\nThere are links that the bottom for\n\n223\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.300\na lot of other stuff you\ngoing to want to look at.\n\n224\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.610\nSupported configurations to deploy ops\nmanager, hey, what's the hardware?\n\n225\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.850\nWhat's the minimum RAM,\nthe minimum storage,\n\n226\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.770\nall that kind of stuff we\nalways gotta go through.\n\n227\n00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.030\nYou know you get asked those kind of\nquestions on the exam without fail.\n\n228\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.160\nThere's always two or three of those,\nhey, can I install on this OS,\n\n229\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.700\nthis config kind of stuff.\n\n230\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.640\nSo just do yourself a favor,\ngo through, look at that stuff.\n\n231\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.070\nYou'll be a lot happier for it.\n\n232\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.940\nYou got the main page for\nOps Manager, so you can go through,\n\n233\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.320\ndrill through all\nthe different documentation.\n\n234\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.050\nHow we set up and manage,\nthere's a deployment guide.\n\n235\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.180\nThere's the author's guide, if you're\ngoing to be writing management packs.\n\n236\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.010\nWe're not going to get too much into\nhow do we customize management packs\n\n237\n00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.690\nin this set of episodes in this show,.\n\n238\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:01.730\nBut we've done an entire set of shows,\nprobably 20+ hours worth of content,\n\n239\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.270\non datacenter monitoring and\noperating a private cloud with SCOM.\n\n240\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:12.790\nThe 10964 class, which is specific just to\nSCOM and cloud and data center management.\n\n241\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.340\nIt's a deep dive,\nessentially, on this product.\n\n242\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.710\nAnd Cherokee helped me\npresent part of that content.\n\n243\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.520\nDaniel helped me do a lot of it as well.\n\n244\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.570\nWe spent a great deal of time going into\nevery little crevasse and corner and\n\n245\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.060\nnook and cranny in that program,\nexplaining everything to you,\n\n246\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.960\nincluding how to create and\ncustomize management packs.\n\n247\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.530\nAnd how to go through all the setup and\neverything associated with it.\n\n248\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.740\nWe're going to summarize that\ndown into a few episodes for\n\n249\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.010\nyou here as part of the broader\ncontext of the 7246 material.\n\n250\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.280\nBut if you need a really go deep and\nwide on that,\n\n251\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.630\nI encourage you to take a look\nat that set of episodes.\n\n252\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.598\nOr that entire set of shows, I guess.\n\n253\n00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:52.080\nBecause literally it's probably close to\n20 hours I would think, worth of stuff,\n\n254\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.020\nif not more.\n\n255\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.110\nAnd most of it is going to be very\npertinent to a lot of the things\n\n256\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.708\nthat you're probably doing\nevery day with SCOM.\n\n257\n00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:04.060\nThere's some off-in-the-corner business\ncase stuff that you may or may not do.\n\n258\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.980\nBut the majority of it is\nabout everyday tactical\n\n259\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.030\noperational things you're going to\nengage in as you use this product.\n\n260\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.430\nSo just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n261\n00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:18.370\nWith regards to what's new,\nin System Center 2012 R2 Ops Manager,\n\n262\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.780\nso we add new features,\nas I said, every time.\n\n263\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.120\nYou can see a list of them\nup on the screen here.\n\n264\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.550\nWe're gonna go through them with you,\n\n265\n00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.905\njust kind of give you\na sense of what's in there.\n\n266\n00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:31.445\nBut some of the key different\nfeatures that are available to you,\n\n267\n00:12:31.445 --> 00:12:35.515\njust gonna call out a couple as we're\ngonna focus on some of them, are things\n\n268\n00:12:35.515 --> 00:12:39.500\nlike fabric monitoring and fabric health\ndashboards, integrating with VMM.\n\n269\n00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.212\nWe're gonna take a look at how to do that.\n\n270\n00:12:41.212 --> 00:12:43.462\nYou've gotta link these\ntwo products together.\n\n271\n00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.902\nFrom the VMM side,\nyou go into the console.\n\n272\n00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:49.932\nYou go to Settings, and there's an ability\nin there to be able to go in and\n\n273\n00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:51.762\nlink to System Center Ops Manager.\n\n274\n00:12:51.762 --> 00:12:53.211\nThere's a wizard you follow.\n\n275\n00:12:53.211 --> 00:12:57.201\nAnd you provide the instance name for\nSCOM, you provide the credential,\n\n276\n00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:59.271\nthere's some information you put in.\n\n277\n00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:01.631\nTakes about 15 to 20\nminutes to configure it.\n\n278\n00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.473\nOnce you kick it off,\n\n279\n00:13:02.473 --> 00:13:07.610\nyou then gotta activate the SSAS,\nthe SQL server analysis servers tie-ins,\n\n280\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.040\nso that we do reporting and\nall the data can be aggregated properly.\n\n281\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.460\nSo there's a separate little tab and\n\n282\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.970\na check box that you activate in\nonce you go through and do that.\n\n283\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.120\nWe actually walk through\nthat entire demo for\n\n284\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.875\nyou in the other show I was just\nreferencing, the 10964 show.\n\n285\n00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:23.055\nI'll show you how to\ntie those two together.\n\n286\n00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:25.995\nActually do a full hands-on\ndemo to show that to you.\n\n287\n00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:27.235\nSo you could see that.\n\n288\n00:13:27.235 --> 00:13:30.485\nWe do have the new version\nof the SCOM agent.\n\n289\n00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:34.825\nIf you're familiar with SCOM for\nprior versions, 2007 R2, etc.\n\n290\n00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:37.305\nYou would have known it is just SCOM,\n\n291\n00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:41.910\nthe SCOM, the monitoring agent is\nnot what we called it back then.\n\n292\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.550\nNow in 2012 R2, we've branded this\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n293\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.300\nAnd so now,\n\n294\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.660\njust quickly give you a little preview,\nlittle taste of what it looks like.\n\n295\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.470\nWe're just extending our lab\ntimer before we do that.\n\n296\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.760\nCuz that's not what\nthe Monitoring Agent looks like.\n\n297\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.140\nThat's just the lab timer\nenvironment behind the scenes.\n\n298\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.750\nBut if we go in, go to Control Panel,\non the System Center Ops Manager,\n\n299\n00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.670\nyou can see right here,\ncenter screen Microsoft monitoring agent.\n\n300\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.478\nThis is what the agent is\nnow going to look like.\n\n301\n00:14:07.478 --> 00:14:09.430\nIt's been re-branded, it's installed and\n\n302\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.630\nconfigured here on my system\ncenter ops manager box.\n\n303\n00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.150\nIt's set up here, and\n\n304\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.040\nyou can see that the interface doesn't\nlook that different from what you would be\n\n305\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.700\nexpected or see, but you'll see that\nwe do have the ops manager tab.\n\n306\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.330\nWe can automatically update management\ngroup membership from ADDS, this is what I\n\n307\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.370\nwas just talking about when Cherokee\nmentioned a couple of minutes ago, hey,\n\n308\n00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.390\nmaybe there's some AD-related stuff.\n\n309\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.000\nFor instance, in those release notes,\nand versioning or\n\n310\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.790\ncertain levels that we have to be at.\n\n311\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.460\nAnd we actually do,\nwe need that information.\n\n312\n00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.440\nAnd so understanding how this\nfunctionality gets activated and\n\n313\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.270\nworks will be one of the things\nyou could find out about there.\n\n314\n00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.290\nSo we have this information,\nwe would see our management groups here.\n\n315\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.700\nWe can add in one or\nmore management groups, and\n\n316\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.570\ndo what's called multihoming this agent.\n\n317\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.880\nConnecting this agent up to not one,\nnot two,\n\n318\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.430\nnot three, but four different\nmanagement groups, potentially.\n\n319\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.950\nWe actually can report in, and\nbe a member of, or be interactive with,\n\n320\n00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.110\nup to four management groups\nsimultaneously through multi-homing,\n\n321\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.420\nwhich maybe important especially\nin scenarios where we're running\n\n322\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.660\nmultiple instances of the products\nthat we're migrating or updating.\n\n323\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.240\nAnd we have perhaps the parallel\ninstall that we're dealing with.\n\n324\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.962\nAnd we're reporting in to an older and\nnewer version.\n\n325\n00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:23.300\nSo there's different things that would be\ngoing on and reasons why we would do this.\n\n326\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.740\nSo we just set that up here.\n\n327\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.240\nWe could then also have a Properties tab.\n\n328\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.580\nIt doesn't really show us much.\n\n329\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.190\nBut it does give the qualified\ndomain name here.\n\n330\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.810\nIt tells us what we're running in terms of\nthe product, and also most importantly,\n\n331\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.820\nproduct version.\n\n332\n00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.560\nWhich is essentially the build number, but\n\n333\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.250\nthat tells you the actual\ninstall that you've used.\n\n334\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.440\nSo this is the build for 12R2 with\nwhatever patch level we may be at.\n\n335\n00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.150\nSo you do wanna take a look at that\nkind of stuff and be aware of it.\n\n336\n00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.160\nSo we have all of that.\n\n337\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.774\nSo we talk a bit about that,\nthe agent's been re-branded.\n\n338\n00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:55.430\nWe do have the ability to be able to\ndo application performance monitoring.\n\n339\n00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.417\nWe're gonna do a whole set of episodes\njust on application monitoring.\n\n340\n00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:02.134\nAll those will be upcoming after we\nget down with our discussions about\n\n341\n00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:04.218\n[INAUDIBLE], you wanna look for those.\n\n342\n00:16:04.218 --> 00:16:07.903\nWe do support IPv6 and do other\ncapability to be able to do that for\n\n343\n00:16:07.903 --> 00:16:09.490\nnetwork discovery.\n\n344\n00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.140\nWe do job application monitoring now.\n\n345\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.144\nSo we could do Java enterprise level\napplication monitoring, we've had Unix and\n\n346\n00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:19.560\nLinux capabilities for a little bit now,\nbut we can do this as well.\n\n347\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.080\nSo we bring in Java and we can do\nalternate stack monitoring which is nice,\n\n348\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.060\nwe do have a tie in for\nSystem Center Advisor.\n\n349\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.280\nWeb based component of\nthe System Center Fabric and\n\n350\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.154\nthe monitoring through Azure\nthat we can interact with.\n\n351\n00:16:33.154 --> 00:16:40.560\nIn 12 R2, System Center Advisors actually\nintegrated directly into the SCOM console.\n\n352\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.430\nIn earlier versions, you had to install\nit and configure it separately,\n\n353\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.220\nbut here it is actually already up and\nrunning available for you.\n\n354\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.290\nSee right down here on the left,\nSystem Center Advisor.\n\n355\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.560\nYou do have to connect it up.\n\n356\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.350\nIt's not totally configured I should say,\ncuz I misspoke a little bit.\n\n357\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.400\nIt is integrated is what I meant to say.\n\n358\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.340\nBut it is installed and available for you,\nwhere as in prior versions you would have\n\n359\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.970\nto actually download the software from\nthe Azure site and integrate totally.\n\n360\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.960\nWe've already done that piece,\nnow you really just need your Azure\n\n361\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.900\ncredentials to be able to go out and\nset up the connection.\n\n362\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.580\nAnd then start to be able to\nflow the data back and forth and\n\n363\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.150\nuse the Azure log analytics and\nsome of the other stuff up there.\n\n364\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.380\nWe'll take a look at some of that\nstuff in a while to be able to drive\n\n365\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.420\nthe System Center Advisor role.\n\n366\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.600\nThis is a best practice analyzer, right?\n\n367\n00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.150\nEssentially for Microsoft.\n\n368\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.870\nThat let's us look at machine\nconfigurations, allows us\n\n369\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:36.760\nto get the benefit of that information\nbeing monitored and being managed.\n\n370\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.775\nAnd then recommendations being made\nagainst what we should be doing\n\n371\n00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:44.015\ndifferently in order to get the full\nvalue out of what we're doing.\n\n372\n00:17:44.015 --> 00:17:49.065\nSo it is nice you do have your advisor\nconnection here right, getting started.\n\n373\n00:17:49.065 --> 00:17:51.077\nYou've got to register\nwith the advisor service,\n\n374\n00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:52.541\nyou see where the little link there.\n\n375\n00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:57.185\nYou go out, you create the connection, you\nset it all up, and then once we do that.\n\n376\n00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:59.770\nWe could take a look at\nwhat this advisor managed.\n\n377\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.240\nSo we would see the list or the ink for\nresources that are being monitored here.\n\n378\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.274\nWe would then be able to start\ngetting information back for them.\n\n379\n00:18:07.274 --> 00:18:09.547\nWe're not gonna ultimately\nsee anything right now, but\n\n380\n00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.200\nyou get the general idea, right?\n\n381\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.425\nSo when we go in and configure this and\n\n382\n00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:19.375\nwe get started, you'll see here, we can\nlearn a little bit more about this, right?\n\n383\n00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:21.335\nHow we connect up but\nyou would have to go out and\n\n384\n00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:24.715\nconnect our SCOM management group to\na newer existing advisor account.\n\n385\n00:18:24.715 --> 00:18:25.655\nYou would need that account,\n\n386\n00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:29.205\nthat's the piece I'm talking about that\nyou would get from Microsoft, right?\n\n387\n00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:31.235\nYou would have to set that up and\nconfigure that.\n\n388\n00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:35.620\nSo we have all of those capabilities, but\nwhat I wanted to do, just as we're getting\n\n389\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.330\nstarted, is just really talk about\nwhat the structure of SCOM looks like.\n\n390\n00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.350\nWhat's that architecture?\n\n391\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.270\nWe've seen some of the features, talked\na bit about some of the moving parts.\n\n392\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.650\nBut what does that really\nmean when we do a deployment?\n\n393\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.460\nWe've got this diagram that we can use to\ntalk a bit about the different pieces.\n\n394\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.025\nI want to point them out to you, to spend\na few minutes talking about what they do,\n\n395\n00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:55.924\nwhy they're useful, what we can\nexpect as we do our deployment.\n\n396\n00:18:55.924 --> 00:18:58.423\nWe'll refer back to this from\ntime to time if we need it,\n\n397\n00:18:58.423 --> 00:19:02.390\njust to remind ourselves of various\ncomponent and they're part of function.\n\n398\n00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.370\nBut what we see here is a generic diagram,\n\n399\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.060\nbasic representation of what\na SCOM deployment may look like,\n\n400\n00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.750\nif we scale it out and\nscale it up for the Enterprise.\n\n401\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.450\nWe've got some important moving parts, so\nlet's start talking about what they are.\n\n402\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.010\nIn prior version of SCOM 2007 R2,\nlet's say you would have had,\n\n403\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.520\ninstead of a resource pool of\nmanagement servers right here,\n\n404\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.540\nyou would have had management\nservers that would have been set up.\n\n405\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.730\nBut you would have had what was called\nthe RMS, the Root Management Server.\n\n406\n00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.470\nAnd that would have been the top\nof the hierarchy essentially.\n\n407\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.650\nThe first management server installed that\nyou would have designated with certain\n\n408\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.270\nspecific roles and functions.\n\n409\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.200\nThat would have taken care of\ncreating the hierarchy for\n\n410\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080\nmanagement and for\nreporting and things like that.\n\n411\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.180\nSo, we no longer have that role.\n\n412\n00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.820\nIf you're interested in it,\nyou can go back and\n\n413\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.850\nresearch it in the earlier\nversions of the product.\n\n414\n00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.000\nBut it's not pertinent anymore.\n\n415\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.450\nWe just don't do that anymore.\n\n416\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.790\nWe've changed the architecture and\nnow, what we do instead or\n\n417\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.993\nwhat we have instead.\n\n418\n00:19:57.993 --> 00:20:01.126\nWe have resource pool or\nresource pools, more than one,\n\n419\n00:20:01.126 --> 00:20:03.620\nthat are just groups\nof management servers.\n\n420\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.530\nThat are gonna then logically be\norganized, so we can manage them and\n\n421\n00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.760\ngroup them and\nadminister them in whatever way see fit.\n\n422\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.125\nWe do have some resource pools that are\ncreated out of the box as we have install\n\n423\n00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:14.820\nSCOM.\n\n424\n00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.960\nSome resource pool for\nActive Directory integrations.\n\n425\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.560\nSome other stuff that's already there.\n\n426\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.480\nWe create our own and put our service\ninto those resource pools if needed.\n\n427\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.690\nSo be able to side hash structure this,\nbut\n\n428\n00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.640\nthis is gonna be made up of several\nmanagement servers group together.\n\n429\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.206\nSo I just put a kind of bit oval there to\nrepresent that and show you that's put,\n\n430\n00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:33.352\nthat's label does now.\n\n431\n00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:37.672\nThe other nice thing about this is from\na HA, a high availability standpoint,\n\n432\n00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:42.130\nthis simplifies things because all root\nservers are all resource pool members.\n\n433\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.120\nAll [INAUDIBLE] servers in\nthe resource pool are now equal.\n\n434\n00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.215\nSo any of them are going to all be able\nto run any service or any function.\n\n435\n00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:56.345\nAny request, any string that is being\nexecuted can be jumped over and\n\n436\n00:20:56.345 --> 00:20:59.625\nmoved to any one of these servers\nfrom a continuity perspective,\n\n437\n00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.365\neverybody's equal at the same level.\n\n438\n00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:04.035\nThey're all considered\nprimary servers if you will,\n\n439\n00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:07.385\nand as a result of that if one\nserver were to drop out or fail.\n\n440\n00:21:07.385 --> 00:21:11.270\nWe can simply pick up the slack out\nof the pool and continue operating.\n\n441\n00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.180\nSo this is a load balance solution\n\n442\n00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.070\nthat allows us to be able\nto have high availability.\n\n443\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.900\nBuilt right in to our architecture\nif we think about using\n\n444\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.440\na deployment the right way.\n\n445\n00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.320\nAnd as a result, we'll more scalable but\n\n446\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.850\nwe're also more stable In\nour architecture these days.\n\n447\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.100\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n448\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.128\nThis is some of the highlights\nassociated with that.\n\n449\n00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:33.160\nWe do have the Microsoft\nmonitoring agent that I mentioned.\n\n450\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.830\nI just labeled it generically agents\nat the bottom, meaning infrastructure,\n\n451\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.960\nif you think of these\nas servers most likely.\n\n452\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.880\nAnd these are servers that\nare being monitored and\n\n453\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.200\nthe agents are running on\nthem just like I showed you.\n\n454\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.900\nThey would be in the control panel\nthat I was just demoing with\n\n455\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.500\nthe actual agent that's installed.\n\n456\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.990\nSo all of this infrastructure,\n\n457\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.260\neverything to the right-hand side of this\ndiagram, is running behind our firewall.\n\n458\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.660\nIt's on the inside on\nthe LAN let's say internal.\n\n459\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.370\nAnd so we're just seeing a switch here,\nsome sort of a network fabric.\n\n460\n00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.240\nWe're seeing servers that\nare being monitored up into our\n\n461\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.050\nresource pool of management servers.\n\n462\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.720\nWe have our ops manager database,\n\n463\n00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720\none of two databases,\npotentially three databases overall.\n\n464\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.810\nBut two out of the box that\nwill be configured, set up, and\n\n465\n00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.490\nrunning as you install this product.\n\n466\n00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.780\nThird one is optional, we'll talk about\nthat in a minute, it's called ACS,\n\n467\n00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.330\nthe auto collection services.\n\n468\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.750\nYou may not configure that, but\n\n469\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.300\nif you do, we'll have a third set of\ndatabases that we'll address there.\n\n470\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.730\nBut the Ops Manager\ndatabase is set up here.\n\n471\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.040\nYou could this is where we are moving\ninformation in and out as we are reporting\n\n472\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.260\nstuff into the system through the agents\ncoming in and being monitored.\n\n473\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.140\nThen we have our\nOps Manager data warehouse,\n\n474\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.970\nit's called the opsmanagerdw database for\ndata warehouse.\n\n475\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:46.090\nThis database over here is where\nwe're gonna store data long term for\n\n476\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.420\nusually 13 months,\nabout 400 days approximately.\n\n477\n00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.400\nIs a magic number for that for\nour data retention periods.\n\n478\n00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.100\nAnd what we are gonna see and\nthat is modifiable by the way,\n\n479\n00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.840\nyou can modify those\ndata retention periods.\n\n480\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.100\nBut we keep roughly 400 days of data\non hand in the data warehouse database\n\n481\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.890\nas we go, sowWhen you're first starting\nout, we're building towards that, right.\n\n482\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.730\nBut as we get over that thirteen or\nso month mark, we've got a rolling\n\n483\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.150\ncycle where we start culling the data,\nright, and that's what we're doing.\n\n484\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.260\nBut the idea here is that this database is\nwhere we go from our reporting servers,\n\n485\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.290\nsitting up here off to the side.\n\n486\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.400\nSeparate instance of SQL that is\nstructured specifically to run SSRS,\n\n487\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.370\nSQL Server Reporting Services.\n\n488\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.820\nAnd that is gonna tie in to\nthe data warehouse database and\n\n489\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.890\npull all the data through SQL Query.\n\n490\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.260\nSo that we can start generating reports,\nand\n\n491\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.320\nthen ultimately use those\nreports to make good decisions.\n\n492\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.390\nAnd drive the value of our data that\nwe're gathering through monitoring and\n\n493\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.910\nthrough using SCOM into\nthe hands of administrators.\n\n494\n00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.855\nSo they can start to better\nunderstand our environment.\n\n495\n00:23:44.855 --> 00:23:48.378\nSo we're querying against the Ops Manager\ndata warehouse database to\n\n496\n00:23:48.378 --> 00:23:51.616\nuse a reporting infrastructure\nrunning on SSRS on the back end.\n\n497\n00:23:51.616 --> 00:23:54.957\nAnd that is set up separately from\nthe other management servers,\n\n498\n00:23:54.957 --> 00:23:58.250\nseparately from The databases\nthat are being used live by SCOM.\n\n499\n00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.130\nWe have a separate instance, in other\nwords, that we recommend you run that on.\n\n500\n00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.320\nAnd then we have our\nconsole sitting over here.\n\n501\n00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.180\nI've only got two of the consoles there,\nthere's actually a total of four.\n\n502\n00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.600\nThere's a set of consoles,\ntwo other consoles not represented here.\n\n503\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.230\nFor application performance monitoring,\napplication diagnosis, that we can use.\n\n504\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.190\nWe'll talk more about those in some\nupcoming episodes, but for now\n\n505\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.920\nthe two main consoles, the ops console,\nthe one I was just showing you briefly,\n\n506\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.950\nwhere system center adviser was,\nis our main console.\n\n507\n00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.785\nWe have a web console as\nwell we can interact with.\n\n508\n00:24:28.785 --> 00:24:32.730\nIt's typically what you give to users\nwho need to do some basic monitoring and\n\n509\n00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.910\nconsume some basic information but don't\nneed the full admin rights to the product.\n\n510\n00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.950\nSo the web console is truncated or\nessentially a scoped console that is gonna\n\n511\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.840\ncut out the majority of\nthe administrative functions and\n\n512\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.930\nreally just let users focus on\nconsuming the monitoring piece.\n\n513\n00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.510\nSo looking at management pack and\nmonitoring and\n\n514\n00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.890\nreally not much more than that.\n\n515\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.560\nWe install those depending\non how we do our install\n\n516\n00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.860\ntypically through several iterations.\n\n517\n00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.600\nWe will install our\nfirst management server.\n\n518\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.480\nWe can install our ops console as part of\nthat install if we want, kind of as we go,\n\n519\n00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.650\nor install the console separately.\n\n520\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.140\nWe will then install typically one or\nmore management servers after the fact,\n\n521\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.090\nsecond, third, fourth, whatever.\n\n522\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.620\nAgain, ops console could be installed\nduring that round or installed separately.\n\n523\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.550\nThen we will typically install the Web\nconsole after we have at least one or\n\n524\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.220\nmore management servers stood up.\n\n525\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.500\nSo we'll typically do\nthat as a separate step.\n\n526\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.450\nSo we would see that being done.\n\n527\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.520\nWe then would go through, most likely at\nthat point, we would configure reporting.\n\n528\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.840\nSo we would go ahead and\nget our reporting infrastructure stood up.\n\n529\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.880\nAnd then we have to think about\nwhat's going on over here,\n\n530\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.470\nin the lower left-hand\ncorner of our diagram.\n\n531\n00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:41.660\nThis thing outside the firewall I\nhaven't really talked about yet,\n\n532\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.340\nwhich is our gateway server.\n\n533\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.390\nGateway servers are used in\nvery specific circumstances.\n\n534\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.170\nThere is a kind of a business case,\nif you will,\n\n535\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.370\nor use case, that we define around\nthe use of gateway servers.\n\n536\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.470\nSpecifically what we're doing here\nis we are looking at two criteria.\n\n537\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.630\nNumber one intermittent and\na high-latency environment.\n\n538\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.100\nSo where we do not have\ndedicated reliable bandwidth.\n\n539\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.730\nWhere we're not gonna be able to\nconnect reliably and consistently.\n\n540\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.280\nAnd when we do, we've a lot of\nlatency involve in those connections,\n\n541\n00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.400\nGateway servers may be a good choice.\n\n542\n00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.620\nYou'll see, and\nremember I specifically said hey,\n\n543\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.370\non the right-hand side\nof the firewall here,\n\n544\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.420\nwe're assuming all of this stuff is gonna\nbe on the LAN, most likely internal.\n\n545\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.870\nWhich means that we're thinking\nthat this is gonna have\n\n546\n00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.990\ndedicated network connections.\n\n547\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.970\nGood reliable bandwidth, low-latency\nnetworks, things like that that we would\n\n548\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.108\ntake for granted in many\ncases in the infrastructure,\n\n549\n00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:37.180\nin the enterprise that we need in order\nto drive this kind of interaction.\n\n550\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.590\nBut we can't always take that for granted.\n\n551\n00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.640\nWe can't always assume\nthat that's the case.\n\n552\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.300\nSo outside the firewall we may have remote\n\n553\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.490\nlocations where where we don't\nhave good reliable bandwidth.\n\n554\n00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:46.550\nWhere there is a lot of latency.\n\n555\n00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.140\nAnd so that's one of the two\ncriteria we're thinking about here.\n\n556\n00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.835\nThe other one is,\n\n557\n00:26:49.835 --> 00:26:54.310\nnon-domain joint, machines that\nare not joined to the domain.\n\n558\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.160\nThey're outside of our LDAP directory,\nthey sit outside of our\n\n559\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.420\nsecurity perimeter, but\nalso outside of our directory services.\n\n560\n00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.620\nSo they're remote, and\nthey are not joined to the domain.\n\n561\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.970\nIn other words, no ability to do Kerberos\nauthentication for these machines.\n\n562\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.800\nIf that's the case,\nit's the other major driving criteria,\n\n563\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.830\nthen the gateway server\nis usually deployed.\n\n564\n00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.580\nIf we have five or\n\n565\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.790\nmore of these systems that we need to\nmonitor from outside to interact with,\n\n566\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.830\nwe need to then use a gateway server\nto coordinate those activities.\n\n567\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.620\nAnd so the gateway server is gonna\nbe deployed in some very specific\n\n568\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.620\ncircumstances.\n\n569\n00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.910\nWe do still deploy agents\nthere as you can see.\n\n570\n00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.960\nSo we would have Microsoft\nmonitoring agent.\n\n571\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.720\nBut what would happen is the gateway\nserver needs a little more\n\n572\n00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.870\nconfiguration it's a little\nbit more involved.\n\n573\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.960\nThere is documentation out on\nthe web on technet how to do this,\n\n574\n00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.070\nnot very difficult.\n\n575\n00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:45.650\nBut just a little specific, you gotta be\nfocused on the details as we would say.\n\n576\n00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.510\nWe need to generate some certificates\nwe gotta put those certificates\n\n577\n00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.370\ninto the gateway so that the gateway and\nmanagement servers can talk.\n\n578\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:56.100\nSo the gateway has to be authenticated and\nthose server certificates will be\n\n579\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.995\ngenerated from inside from our\nusually internal PKI or we'll use\n\n580\n00:28:00.995 --> 00:28:04.090\nthird-party certificates that are\npurchased and used specifically for this.\n\n581\n00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.800\nWe'll implement that, step the gateway up,\n\n582\n00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.380\nthere's a little PowerShell we got to deal\nwith and do a couple of things there.\n\n583\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.300\nOnce we get that all bound and set up so\nthe gateway becomes our authenticated\n\n584\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.930\nsecure communication point, we then have\nthose agents reporting to the gateway.\n\n585\n00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.010\nThe agent machines never talk directly\nthrough to the management servers,\n\n586\n00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.180\nbecause they are unsecured,\nfrom our perspective.\n\n587\n00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.640\nThey are not authenticated.\n\n588\n00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.525\nInstead, all of the agents,\n\n589\n00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:30.190\nall the managed infrastructure\nthat's outside that's reporting,\n\n590\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.640\nwill go through the gateway, and then\nthe gateway reports in on their behalf.\n\n591\n00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.210\nSo we are talking to a trusted end\npoint by using the gateway server.\n\n592\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.990\nSo just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that, we're thinking about this,\n\n593\n00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.220\nand we have a sense of the architecture.\n\n594\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.090\nIt's very important.\n\n595\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.370\nWe've got our management servers,\nwe've got our databases.\n\n596\n00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.430\nWe've got our agents.\n\n597\n00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.600\nWe talked about agents.\n\n598\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.090\nRemember, we do have agents for\nUnix and Linux systems, as well.\n\n599\n00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.900\nBy the way, we talked about managing and\n\n600\n00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.200\nmonitoring non-Microsoft stack\ninfrastructure, so we can do that.\n\n601\n00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.270\nWe have separate agents we would install\nfor those, but we could do that.\n\n602\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.340\nWe have reporting.\n\n603\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.550\nWe talked about management packs,\nthe basic unit of administration and\n\n604\n00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.360\nmonitoring.\n\n605\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.840\nWe didn't really put them into context.\n\n606\n00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.350\nThey would sit on the management servers,\nbut we will have more to say about them.\n\n607\n00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:16.660\nManagement packs are preconfigured\nsoftware items that we download.\n\n608\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.648\nWe integrate into SCOM by importing them\neither locally from a disk, essentially\n\n609\n00:29:21.648 --> 00:29:25.820\nalready downloaded and ready to go, or\nwe download them from a web catalog.\n\n610\n00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.370\nAnd we just integrate them directly to\nthe console, but they are preconfigured\n\n611\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.510\nmonitors, rules,\nobjects that are used for monitoring.\n\n612\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.600\nWe've got a list of them,\nwe'll talk to you about what they are,\n\n613\n00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.110\ntasks, and all sorts of different things.\n\n614\n00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.650\nAll of that comes together.\n\n615\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.060\nAnd we will then, discovery mechanisms,\nas well, I forgot those.\n\n616\n00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.990\nThose go in there, overrides, in theory,\ngo to management packs, as well.\n\n617\n00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.820\nAll of that will be done, and\nwe get a lot of them from Microsoft.\n\n618\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.300\nBut we also get a lot of them\nfrom third-party vendors.\n\n619\n00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.290\nAnd so we're able to download those,\ninstall those, tune those,\n\n620\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.530\nwhich is really the art and\nscience of using SCOM.\n\n621\n00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.280\nAnd as a result of that,\ntarget our monitoring efforts on specific\n\n622\n00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.564\nkinds of servers or\nspecific infrastructure.\n\n623\n00:30:07.564 --> 00:30:08.200\nWe have management packs for Azure.\n\n624\n00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.120\nWe have management packs for Office 365.\n\n625\n00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.700\nWe have management packs for any of your\ninfrastructure on the Microsoft side,\n\n626\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.680\neven if it's not Microsoft.\n\n627\n00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.600\nWe have management packs for VMWare.\n\n628\n00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.400\nManagement packs for IBM, for\nHP, for everything, you name it.\n\n629\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.430\nWe can monitor and\n\n630\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.460\nmanage your Horizon View VDI installs\nin VMWare with management packs.\n\n631\n00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.030\nWe can monitor your VMWare stack\ninfrastructure with management packs.\n\n632\n00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.170\nSo, we've got tremendous\ncapabilities in this platform.\n\n633\n00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.870\nWe just have to go out and download them.\n\n634\n00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.200\nMajority of those\nmanagement packs are free.\n\n635\n00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.570\nA few of them you may have to pay for\ndepending on what we're doing and\n\n636\n00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.610\nwho your getting them from,\nbut the bulk of them are free.\n\n637\n00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.430\nYou just download them and integrate them.\n\n638\n00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.990\nCisco, we got a lot of\nCisco-related management gear,\n\n639\n00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.160\nstuff like that we can do.\n\n640\n00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.705\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent functionally.\n\n641\n00:30:50.705 --> 00:30:53.915\nWe've also got, as I mentioned,\nseveral different consoles.\n\n642\n00:30:53.915 --> 00:30:56.605\nI believe I mentioned the fact,\nlet me just scroll back down,\n\n643\n00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:59.685\ncuz I'm trying to keep up with my notes\nwhile I talk to you to make sure we're\n\n644\n00:30:59.685 --> 00:31:01.705\ncovering all the different things\nwe want to throw out there.\n\n645\n00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:04.515\nI mentioned the other\ntwo management consoles.\n\n646\n00:31:04.515 --> 00:31:06.345\nWe go back to the diagram for\njust one second.\n\n647\n00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:07.675\nI just wanna show you something.\n\n648\n00:31:07.675 --> 00:31:10.585\nSo, I did mention that we have\ntwo consoles sitting up here, but\n\n649\n00:31:10.585 --> 00:31:12.485\nthere were two more that\nI threw out quickly.\n\n650\n00:31:12.485 --> 00:31:15.070\nI said, hey, they're application-based for\nmonitoring, we'll\n\n651\n00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.500\ntalk more about them with what's called\nAPM, Application Performance Monitoring.\n\n652\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.980\nThey will get installed,\nthey are web-driven as well.\n\n653\n00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.340\nThree of the four consoles rely\non web services to connect.\n\n654\n00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.370\nAnd I've talked about this a couple other\nepisodes, but you do need Silverlight\n\n655\n00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.080\nas a result of that to be able to\ndrive the console integration.\n\n656\n00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.290\nSo the first time you connect\nyou'll typically get a prompt for\n\n657\n00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:37.000\nSilverlight, especially if you don't have\nthe most recent version available to you.\n\n658\n00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.440\nAnd you will then be\nable to download that,\n\n659\n00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.460\ntypically then close out the browser,\nopen it back up and then it will come up.\n\n660\n00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.380\nBut the application diagnostics and\n\n661\n00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.920\napplication adviser consoles\nwill also be there.\n\n662\n00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.800\nI didn't put them on the diagram but\nthose the other two consoles you'll see.\n\n663\n00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.890\nSo we've talked about all of that.\n\n664\n00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.230\nWe've talked about the gateway server.\n\n665\n00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.520\nWe've talked about the role for this.\n\n666\n00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.670\nWe've talked about the fact that the\nconsole, or rather the resource pool for\n\n667\n00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.980\nservice, makes this highly available.\n\n668\n00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.390\nSo we just wanna keep that in mind and\njust be aware of that.\n\n669\n00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.990\nAnd we also have laid out\nthe foundational thought process for\n\n670\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.980\nyou around just what SCOM is and\nhow it's gonna operate.\n\n671\n00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.390\nIf I'm not mistaken, Ms.\nCherokee, that means we are ready for\n\n672\n00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.940\nanother episode cuz we're out of time,\ncorrect?\n\n673\n00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.570\n&gt;&gt; We've covered a lot in this episode so\nfar.\n\n674\n00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.200\nYou've laid a great foundation here.\n\n675\n00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.420\nShowed us the components.\n\n676\n00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.970\nBut I have a feeling we have several\nother episodes to continue our,\n\n677\n00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.700\nwhat did you say, your fire hose of?\n\n678\n00:32:26.700 -->

out\ntoo prematurely, but stay tuned,\n\n681\n00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.580\nwe have a lot of more interesting\ninformation so don't go anywhere.\n\n682\n00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.920\nFor this show, Adam's right,\nwe are out of time so we will go ahead and\n\n683\n00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.730\nsign out, remember I am your\nshow host Cherokee Boose.\n\n684\n00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.490\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.321\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:11.975\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.045\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.775\nThis is actually a part two,\na continuation of a previous discussion\n\n8\n00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:24.135\nthat we were having about monitoring\ncloud based applications.\n\n9\n00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.265\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.165\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:29.739\n&gt;&gt; You are welcome.\n\n12\n00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.667\nLet's shake [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Let's shake all that, that's awesome.\n\n13\n00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're so nice, that was just so cool.\n\n14\n00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.088\nAll like nice and friendly, and that's\nwhat we are here at ITPro.TV, nice and\n\n15\n00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:40.448\nfriendly or friendly and nice, depending\non how you choose to interpret that.\n\n16\n00:00:40.448 --> 00:00:42.116\n&gt;&gt; I guess depending on\nwho you talk to too.\n\n17\n00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:43.657\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It also depends on who you talk to,\n\n18\n00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:44.165\nthat's right.\n\n19\n00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:46.613\nCuz I hear those things about Wes and\nMike,\n\n20\n00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.254\nbut you just rumors-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:49.305\n&gt;&gt; Nothing more then rumors.\n\n22\n00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:53.552\nAll right, so anyway we're gonna continue\ntalking about, as we said part two,\n\n23\n00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:57.556\ncloud application monitoring,\nmonitoring of cloud based applications.\n\n24\n00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.716\nWhat we really need to do now that\nwe've talked about all the basics,\n\n25\n00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:04.382\nlaid out the foundation for you, given\nyou a little overview of architecture.\n\n26\n00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:06.424\nIf you haven't seen that episode,\nby the way, want to go back and\n\n27\n00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.064\ntake a look at that.\n\n28\n00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:10.268\nWe walked through all the pieces that\nmake up the System Center Option Manager\n\n29\n00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:13.124\ninstallation, how we put that all\ntogether, what that looks like,\n\n30\n00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:14.073\nhow we structured it.\n\n31\n00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.824\nAnd we do wanna make sure you have that\nknowledge going into the rest of these\n\n32\n00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:17.487\nconversations.\n\n33\n00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.622\nCuz we'll start referring to those things,\nwe'll talk about the resource pool,\n\n34\n00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.355\nwe'll talk about management servers,\nwe'll talk about the gateway,\n\n35\n00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.270\nwe'll talk about the consoles,\nthe databases.\n\n36\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.395\nSo you wanna make sure you know what\nthose are and how they come together.\n\n37\n00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:31.090\nSo definitely take a few minutes, go back\nand look at that if you haven't seen that.\n\n38\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.140\nWe'll be here patiently waiting for you,\nand when you're ready come on back and\n\n39\n00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.510\nwe'll go through the rest of this.\n\n40\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.224\nBut what we're gonna do now is take\nyou into the console just like I did\n\n41\n00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.763\nin the earlier episodes in some\nof the discussions around SCVMM.\n\n42\n00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:46.364\nCuz we've talked about the fabric side,\nwe walk through the SCVMM console.\n\n43\n00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:49.008\nExplain to you what all the different\nwork areas are, how they work,\n\n44\n00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.018\nwhy they're important.\n\n45\n00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:52.702\nI want to do the same thing with you here\nin SCOM, so you have a good understanding\n\n46\n00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:54.927\nof what we're gonna be able to do and\nwhere we do it in the product.\n\n47\n00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.565\nSo if you can join me in the console,\nwe're we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n48\n00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:58.563\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n49\n00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:02.532\nWe're gonna start here at the bottom\nin the Administration workspace, and\n\n50\n00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:04.460\nwhat we have is several workspaces.\n\n51\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.256\nI'm calling these workspaces by their\nnames here, Administration, Reporting,\n\n52\n00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.492\nAuthoring, Monitoring.\n\n53\n00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:12.905\nBut we're gonna just take a look top to\nbottom here, as we go through each one at\n\n54\n00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:15.690\nsome of the highlights,\nthings that we wanna be aware of.\n\n55\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.100\nWe saw the system center advisor\nintegration in the other episode,\n\n56\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.370\njust talked a bit about that,\nhow that would work.\n\n57\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.987\nBut let's start up at the top\nhere with Administration,\n\n58\n00:02:23.987 --> 00:02:25.960\nwe do have our Management Group area here.\n\n59\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.478\nSo if we have Management Groups,\nthe council can be used to monitor and\n\n60\n00:02:30.478 --> 00:02:33.397\ninteract with multiple management groups.\n\n61\n00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:37.282\nSo one console could be used to\nsee multiple different pieces of\n\n62\n00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.464\ninfrastructure.\n\n63\n00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:40.974\nAnd if we have more than one\nManagement Group, we can bring them in and\n\n64\n00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:41.552\nconnect them.\n\n65\n00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:45.084\nWe would see them here,\nwe have Device Management.\n\n66\n00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:46.319\nAny of our devices,\n\n67\n00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.950\nany of our targeted end points that\nhave agents on them will show up here.\n\n68\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.254\nAnd so when we deploy an agent,\nassuming we do it through the console,\n\n69\n00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:55.832\nwhat's known as a console push.\n\n70\n00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:59.249\nAnd we'll talk about different\nways to deploy agents in a bit.\n\n71\n00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.142\nBut if you give console a push,\nthen once we are successful,\n\n72\n00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:05.855\nthe agent managed endpoint will show up\nhere within about five minutes or so.\n\n73\n00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:08.690\nAnd we can start to see\nit highlighted of course.\n\n74\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.878\nYou can kind of get an indication here\na little bit if there was something here.\n\n75\n00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.006\nWe would see Health State,\nFQDN, Name, Domain, Version,\n\n76\n00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.969\nAction, Account that's being used,\nthings like that.\n\n77\n00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.262\nSo we have a bunch of information\nthat we would know about these.\n\n78\n00:03:21.262 --> 00:03:24.761\nAnd then over here we'd be able to look,\nalthough they are grayed out right now,\n\n79\n00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.299\nProperties, we'd be able to do a Repair,\nan Uninstall.\n\n80\n00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.285\nWe could change our Primary Management\nServer, associate this particular agent or\n\n81\n00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:33.931\nthis infrastructure with\nanother management server.\n\n82\n00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.338\nSo we have some actions, right?\n\n83\n00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.527\nActivities that we can engage in here.\n\n84\n00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:40.647\nWe tend to call them actions or\ntasks depending on what we're doing.\n\n85\n00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:44.548\nYou'll see tasks up here, but usually\nthey're referred to as actions, right?\n\n86\n00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:46.047\nSo we can see those.\n\n87\n00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:47.564\nWe have Agent List Managed,\n\n88\n00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:50.478\nif we are managing without\nhaving an agent installed.\n\n89\n00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:53.352\nWe would see those and\nbe able to go in and use that or\n\n90\n00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:57.534\nrather use that category to see\nthe differentiation between these two.\n\n91\n00:03:57.534 --> 00:04:00.699\nWe have our Management Server, so\nall the infrastructure that makes up\n\n92\n00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.302\nthe various management servers that go in\nour resource pool will be listed here.\n\n93\n00:04:04.302 --> 00:04:07.323\nYou'll see we have one right now,\nthat's the one we're demoing from.\n\n94\n00:04:07.323 --> 00:04:09.568\nThe console is connected to this machine.\n\n95\n00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:12.890\nThe PLAD SYS or PLAD SYS 01 machine.\n\n96\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.240\nYou'll see here that we have\na Warning state under Health.\n\n97\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.460\nTalk about this and drill under\nthe hood here in just a minute.\n\n98\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.174\nCaution danger Will Robinson-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:21.713\n&gt;&gt; Danger, right?\n\n100\n00:04:21.713 --> 00:04:23.270\nWe'll take a look at what that is.\n\n101\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.291\nBut we do have different levels\nof warnings that we will see.\n\n102\n00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:30.267\nWarning, critical alert, information,\nyou're probably familiar with them from\n\n103\n00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:32.181\nall the other products you\nwould be interacting with.\n\n104\n00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:33.742\nBut we'll go ahead and we'll take a look.\n\n105\n00:04:33.742 --> 00:04:36.042\nBut you'll see here Client Monitoring\nis currently Disabled.\n\n106\n00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.278\nWe have an agent deployed,\nas you saw in the last episode, but\n\n107\n00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.221\nit's not configured and set up yet.\n\n108\n00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:44.060\nSo we've put it in there but we haven't\nreally turned it on in other words,\n\n109\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.152\nand that's why we see that.\n\n110\n00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:49.742\nWe have our version number, I did mention\nbriefly in passing in the last episode\n\n111\n00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:51.531\nthis idea of the RMS emulator.\n\n112\n00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:52.804\nI talked about the RMS,\n\n113\n00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:56.400\nthe root management server\nfrom prior versions of SCOM.\n\n114\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.520\nWe no longer have that, but\nwe do maintain backwards compatibility.\n\n115\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.898\nSo that if we have mixed environments\nwhile we're still running,\n\n116\n00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:05.565\nagents that are from\nthe 2007 infrastructure.\n\n117\n00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:08.554\nAnd we may very well be running them,\nand or\n\n118\n00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:11.968\nwe may be running 2007 R2 servers, right?\n\n119\n00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:13.960\nSo we may have a mixed environment.\n\n120\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720\nWe need the ARM assembulator\nto be able to deal with that.\n\n121\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.258\nSo this role is set up on the first\nmanagement server we installed in 2012 R2.\n\n122\n00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:24.995\nTo build out our resource pool relative\nto set up our management servers and\n\n123\n00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:25.952\nput them in a pool.\n\n124\n00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:29.413\nAnd this role is configured and\nwe can see there just under the header or\n\n125\n00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:32.889\nunder the column our MS emulator yes or\nno, that's how we would tell.\n\n126\n00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.670\nAnd so we can see that,\nwe see that that role is assigned.\n\n127\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.173\nWe actually can set that through\nPowerShell through the SCOM operations\n\n128\n00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.874\nshell or through PowerShell\nby importing the SCOM module.\n\n129\n00:05:44.874 --> 00:05:49.295\nAnd I mentioned that I would show you how\nto do some of these things in PowerShell.\n\n130\n00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:53.965\nWe do have an Ops Manager Shell that is\ndedicated specifically to the use of or\n\n131\n00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:56.425\nmanagement of the Ops Manager.\n\n132\n00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:58.820\nAnd this is separate\nfrom normal PowerShell.\n\n133\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.080\nIt is PowerShell,\nlet me be clear about that.\n\n134\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.485\nWell what it is, is PowerShell with\nthe SCOM module already loaded.\n\n135\n00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:10.000\nSo we have access to all the cmdlet\nspecific to monitoring and managing SCOM.\n\n136\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.596\nIf we did this from PowerShell normally,\nwe would not be able to run\n\n137\n00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:17.466\nthe command you see or the set of\ncmdlets you see on the screen right now.\n\n138\n00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:20.345\nUnless we had imported right here, right?\n\n139\n00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:26.590\nUnless we had imported the management\nmodule for SCOM into PowerShell.\n\n140\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.748\nNow, I showed you how to do this with ICE.\n\n141\n00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:32.221\nWe did this in some prior\nepisodes earlier on in the show.\n\n142\n00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:35.597\nCherokee and I, we're talking about\nPowerShell, and she said, what about ICE?\n\n143\n00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:37.442\nAnd we threw ICE up, if you remember.\n\n144\n00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:39.393\nThat didn't come out the right way,\nwe threw ICE up.\n\n145\n00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:40.853\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Probably not the best way to say that.\n\n146\n00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:43.811\nWe put ICE up and then, and\nbrought up the console, right?\n\n147\n00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:45.937\nKinda think through those\nthings before we just ad lib.\n\n148\n00:06:45.937 --> 00:06:47.537\nAnd we put up the console, and\n\n149\n00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:50.870\nI showed you that just in\nthe standard implementation of ICE.\n\n150\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.354\nWhile we certainly get the value of\nhaving the editor be able to debug and\n\n151\n00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:57.532\nwrite our scripts and do all that.\n\n152\n00:06:57.532 --> 00:07:01.507\nThe real nice thing was the right hand\nside a search area where we can search for\n\n153\n00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:03.910\ncmdlets and understand more about them.\n\n154\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.180\nBut that by default and by design, the\nindividual modules specific things like\n\n155\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.280\nSCOM, Azure AD, whatever the case may be.\n\n156\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.680\nThey may or may not be available,\nbut they're not loaded by default.\n\n157\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.772\nAnd so we would have to go grab them and\nport them,\n\n158\n00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:18.113\nwe took a look at how to do that.\n\n159\n00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:21.628\nAnd then we did a search, and I showed\nyou how to use the Get-Command cmdlet to\n\n160\n00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:24.980\nexport the list of all the cmdlets\navailable and put them into a TXT file and\n\n161\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.628\nwork, we did all that kinda stuff.\n\n162\n00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:32.609\nSo here what we're looking at is\nOps Manager Shell, specific to SCOM.\n\n163\n00:07:32.609 --> 00:07:36.845\nSo this is PowerShell ported specifically\nto SCOM with the addition of the SCOM\n\n164\n00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:38.420\nmanagement module.\n\n165\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.560\nAnd now I've put up just a command typed\nin ahead of time that will let us actually\n\n166\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.170\nset that RMS emulator role, if we wanted\nto move it from one machine to another.\n\n167\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.787\nWe may not wanna keep it on the first\nmachine that it's installed on.\n\n168\n00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:52.079\nMaybe we're gonna take that\nout of service for a while and\n\n169\n00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.767\nwanna set this up move it somewhere else.\n\n170\n00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.782\nSo get SCOM management server, name and\n\n171\n00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:58.812\nthen whatever the name is I just\nput a name in there in quotes.\n\n172\n00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:03.169\nYou would obviously substitute a value\nthere for whatever machine, You wanna use,\n\n173\n00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:06.599\npipe that, we'll talk about the role\nof the pipe here in a second,\n\n174\n00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:09.330\nover to the other cmdlet,\nSet-SCOMRMSEmulator.\n\n175\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.560\nNow when we do everything on\nthe left hand side of the pipe,\n\n176\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.170\nwe execute those commands.\n\n177\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.060\nIn this case, Get-SCOMManagementServer\n-Name Adam01-itpro.tv.\n\n178\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.140\nIn other words, go out and connect\nto that server, validate it's there.\n\n179\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.460\nThen, take that information, pass it\nover the pipe to the right-hand side and\n\n180\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.930\nuse that information as input for\n\n181\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.540\nthe next series of cmdlets that\nare executing on the right.\n\n182\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.410\nThat's what the pipe\nrepresents in PowerShell.\n\n183\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.400\nAnd the pipe is this item right\nhere that's standing straight up,\n\n184\n00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.780\nlike a pillar in other words.\n\n185\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.960\nWe call that a pipe.\n\n186\n00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.920\nAnd so when we use the pipe, we take input\nfrom the left, execute it, pass it over to\n\n187\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.310\nthe right and use it as input for\nthe next series of actions or iterations.\n\n188\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.270\nSo that's what we're doing here,\nit's a very simple, basic idea.\n\n189\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.170\nAnd by using this cmdlet we're actually\nable to remove that RMS emulator role that\n\n190\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.455\nwe just saw assigned to whatever machine\nis available as a management server\n\n191\n00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:02.775\nwithin the infrastructure.\n\n192\n00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.515\n&gt;&gt; I think you answered my question, Adam.\n\n193\n00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:05.395\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to say-\n\n194\n00:09:05.395 --> 00:09:06.928\n&gt;&gt; No, I answered, that's it, you're done.\n\n195\n00:09:06.928 --> 00:09:08.015\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I absolutely can't say anything else.\n\n196\n00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's all I have to say.\n\n197\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm only kidding.\n\n198\n00:09:10.665 --> 00:09:11.585\nSo what was the question?\n\n199\n00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:12.250\nLet's-\n&gt;&gt; Backwards\n\n200\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Compatibility-\n\n201\n00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.990\n&gt;&gt; Backwards compatibility.\n\n202\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.940\n&gt;&gt; And by running this emulator role, but\n\n203\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.020\nthis is kind of off the wall, so why did\nthey use SCOM 2007 if we have Server 2008?\n\n204\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.440\nHow does that work?\n\n205\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Why do they use SCOM 2007?\n\n206\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Like how did they, did they come\nout before the 2008 operating system?\n\n207\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.494\n&gt;&gt; That's why it's\nseemingly out of sequence.\n\n208\n00:09:32.494 --> 00:09:33.515\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I noticed you mentioned it\n\n209\n00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:36.294\na couple times I thought well maybe\nhe said 2007 instead of 2008 but\n\n210\n00:09:36.294 --> 00:09:37.190\nthen you said it again.\n\n211\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.880\n&gt;&gt; No, No, No.\nFor instance before that we had MOM 2005\n\n212\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.030\nbefore we started calling\nthe product SCOM.\n\n213\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.840\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n214\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.030\nGo back several generations,\nwe had MOM, Microsoft Ops Manager.\n\n215\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.950\nThat's what it was.\n\n216\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We had MOM 2005,\n\n217\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.706\nthat was just the name of\nthe product back then.\n\n218\n00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:56.215\nSo the [COUGH], let me step back and\nframe the conversation Cherokee asked,\n\n219\n00:09:56.215 --> 00:09:59.340\ncuz that was the start of the question.\n\n220\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.330\nSo the idea really is, hey,\ndo we name products, and\n\n221\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.640\ndo we name operating systems in different\nways in terms of sequencing and time for\n\n222\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.370\nrelease, and the answer is yes.\n\n223\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.960\nSo any one of these products,\nyou see Exchange, as an example.\n\n224\n00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.765\nExchange 2007, Exchange 2010, Exchange\n2013, Exchange 2016 now, /Exchange Online,\n\n225\n00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:22.365\nso that's kind of where we're\nheading with all the cloud stuff.\n\n226\n00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:24.335\nSharePoint you could\nthink of it the same way.\n\n227\n00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.925\nThey're not always or any of the products\nthat we have for that matter so\n\n228\n00:10:26.925 --> 00:10:27.725\nno matter what.\n\n229\n00:10:27.725 --> 00:10:31.455\nBut they're not necessarily in lock\nstep or sync with the operating systems.\n\n230\n00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.945\nSo you pointed out Server 2008,\n2008 R2, 2012, 12 R2 Server 16 now.\n\n231\n00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:37.745\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n232\n00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:43.860\n&gt;&gt; Shortly but quickly coming on\nwith 16 R2 at some point here.\n\n233\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.610\nWe've already got, I think,\nthe first major service pack out for that.\n\n234\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.700\nWe've got Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows 8.1, Windows 10.\n\n235\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.300\nNow we just have editions of\nWindows 10 kind of a cloud based.\n\n236\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay so it's not married to that OS.\n\n237\n00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.965\n&gt;&gt; It's not linked at all there.\n\n238\n00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:59.160\nThey're actually different\nproduct groups at Microsoft.\n\n239\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.590\nWhole different, think of them as\nlines of business or businesses in and\n\n240\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.110\nof themselves essentially.\n\n241\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.640\nAnd these groups release their products,\nand\n\n242\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.120\nthere is a master plan to that thought\nprocess, but they're not syncing\n\n243\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.660\nthose different streams up in\nterms of versioning and naming.\n\n244\n00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.916\nOffice is another good example, Office 10.\n\n245\n00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:17.329\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Office of 7, 10, 13, 16, it is,\n\n246\n00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:21.050\nthose product names are tied\nto the year they are released.\n\n247\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.230\nSo Office 16, release going into 16.\n\n248\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.360\nBut yeah, that may be in market for two or\nthree years before you see an update to it\n\n249\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.570\nthrough a couple of different revisions,\nservice packs, etc.\n\n250\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.070\nSo the next major release of Office\nwill probably be Office 18 or\n\n251\n00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.140\nsomething like that in theory.\n\n252\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.730\nOr if we go through a full\nSaaS model now where,\n\n253\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.690\nliterally it's just going\nto be Office in the cloud.\n\n254\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.360\nJust Office as a service.\n\n255\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.690\nIf that's the case, then-\n&gt;&gt; With those continuous updates and\n\n256\n00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.000\nthat model that they're going-\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n257\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.020\nit would probably no longer be even called\nOffice 16 or Office 18 or whatever.\n\n258\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.300\nIt would probably just be Office.\n\n259\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.620\nLike we're seeing with Windows 10,\nyou would have updates and versions and\n\n260\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.240\nthey may have names, but\n\n261\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.940\nyou're not gonna necessarily have\na unique release year tied to it anymore.\n\n262\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.600\nSo it may not actually be\nthat way going forward, and\n\n263\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.122\nby the time you watch this several\nmonths from the time we film it.\n\n264\n00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:09.119\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It may have changed again,\n\n265\n00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:11.030\nand they may be using colors.\n\n266\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.160\nMaybe it's fuchsia and green, who knows.\n\n267\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.560\nI'm guessing of course, I have no idea.\n\n268\n00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.370\n&gt;&gt; And I kinda feel bad because I did,\nI saw your shirt that day.\n\n269\n00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.190\nWe were talking about fuchsia and green,\nand Adam was wearing a fuchsia-colored\n\n270\n00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.420\nshirt but that was actually\nthe Google operating system.\n\n271\n00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.630\nSo I wasn't stealing from them.\n\n272\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.810\nIt was a lovely fuchsia.\n\n273\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.370\nI do have it on tape,\nI can prove she said my shirt was lovely.\n\n274\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.270\nNobody else calls it lovely, but\nCherokee said it was lovely.\n\n275\n00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.940\nSo that is kind of the breakdown and\nthe answer from that.\n\n276\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.340\nWe do have all these different\nproduct groups that go out,\n\n277\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.660\nthey do have to get their\nnaming solution approved.\n\n278\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.940\nEverything is kind of\nmanaged top-down there, but\n\n279\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.690\nultimately they will go ahead and\nname based on the release window.\n\n280\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.770\nThat year that they target.\n\n281\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.870\nAnd that's what the product\nyear designation becomes.\n\n282\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.600\nSo going back to the consoles,\nwe were talking about some stuff.\n\n283\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.490\nSo we showed you a little bit\nof Ops Manager PowerShell, so\n\n284\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.540\nyou got to see that at\nleast one area here.\n\n285\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.210\nWanna continue walking through\nthe console with you if we could.\n\n286\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.050\nSo we've got our management servers here.\n\n287\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.110\nNow interestingly, if we do a manual\ninstall on the agent, as opposed to what\n\n288\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.820\nwe call the console push where we deploy\nthe agent through the console, and\n\n289\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.720\nwe do that through a discovery process,\nI'll preview that for you just give you\n\n290\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.140\na sense of how that works and what\nthat looks like here in just a moment.\n\n291\n00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.450\nBut if we do a manual install, we go to\nthe machine we want to install the agent\n\n292\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.745\non and we pull down the Agent MSI file and\nwe install it.\n\n293\n00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:35.550\nMOMAgent.msi is the name of the file,\nby the way.\n\n294\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.280\nAnd so interesting,\ncuz MOM, as I told you,\n\n295\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.130\nwas the original name of the product\nMicrosoft Office Manager.\n\n296\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.160\nAnd we still maintain that for\ncertain things.\n\n297\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.710\nAnd yet, SCOM is now kinda the product\nname System Center Integration.\n\n298\n00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.760\nSo you see this in certain\nproducts where with SCCM as well,\n\n299\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.260\nSystem Center Config Manager,\n\n300\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.285\nused to be called SMS,\nSystem Systems management server.\n\n301\n00:13:55.285 --> 00:13:57.455\nThat's what the name of\nthe product was for years.\n\n302\n00:13:57.455 --> 00:14:00.735\nAnd a lot of the underlying\narchitecture and certain file names and\n\n303\n00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:02.625\nthings are still referencing SMS.\n\n304\n00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:04.475\nThey have not been updated to SCCM.\n\n305\n00:14:04.475 --> 00:14:07.795\nSo, we see these little things here and\nthere that kind of pop out.\n\n306\n00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:08.655\nBut the MOM agent,\n\n307\n00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:12.305\nwhen you do an install manually,\nthe agents are not approved automatically.\n\n308\n00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:16.095\nAs a matter of fact, by design or\nby default in SCOM, we do not allow manual\n\n309\n00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:20.120\nagents to go forward unless we modify\nsettings that allow us to do that.\n\n310\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.530\nThey will be denied.\n\n311\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.330\nIn other words, if you try to\ninstall manually out of the box.\n\n312\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.480\nWe have to modify settings in the console.\n\n313\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.220\nThen they will come in here assuming we\nallow that, we will see them pop in here.\n\n314\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.450\nThey will be in a pending state.\n\n315\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.450\nAnd I know it's kinda hard to see,\nit's grayed out,\n\n316\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.940\nbut right there I'm pointing to the fact\nthat you would then highlight the machine.\n\n317\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.110\nAnd you would have an approve/reject,\nand you could then approve and\n\n318\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.150\napprove with them, you'll toggle that\nagent into the operational state.\n\n319\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.960\nAnd then it would move up into\nan agent manage category up here\n\n320\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.090\ninstead of pending.\n\n321\n00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.530\nSo we have to just be aware of the fact\nthat there's some subtlety going on\n\n322\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.700\nunder the hood that we\nwanna take account of and\n\n323\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.840\nunderstand that it may not be as simple\nas just throwing an MSI onto a machine.\n\n324\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.750\nYou actually have to have rights to\ndo it and it has to be structured\n\n325\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.090\nin such a way that the console will\naccept it or we turn a blind eye to it,\n\n326\n00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.100\npretend it doesn't exist and just\nessentially deny that is going to happen.\n\n327\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.685\nWe are the proverbial ostrich\nputting its head in the sand.\n\n328\n00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:15.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; You know by the way,\n\n329\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.450\npeople often talk about the, you know,\n\n330\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.970\nostrich putting their heads in the sand,\nthat's actually a myth, though.\n\n331\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.800\nThey don't really do that.\n\n332\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Really?\nWell, then where did it come from?\n\n333\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Somebody, who really just had nothing\nbetter going on that day and said,\n\n334\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.740\nwell I'm going to just\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Trick everybody,\n\n336\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.310\nand that's, I'm gonna make this thing and\nsee how far we can go with it.\n\n337\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.770\nAnd they were passionate, and guess what?\n\n338\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.910\nEverybody in the world believes that,\n\n339\n00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.610\nbut they don't actually do that,\nthat is a myth.\n\n340\n00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.280\n&gt;&gt; Hm, why would they do that anyways,\nright?\n\n341\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Because they're antisocial and\nthey're scared, and\n\n342\n00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.620\nthey would prefer to be in\nthe warm confines of sand.\n\n343\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.930\nI have no idea why, I don't know.\n\n344\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.440\nI'm not an ostrich,\nnever having met one, I couldn't say.\n\n345\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.775\nNor could I speak authoritatively\nto the habits of ostriches.\n\n346\n00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:54.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I do just want to point that out.\n\n347\n00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.790\n&gt;&gt; Well now I know.\n\n348\n00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.070\n&gt;&gt; It's myth and legend.\n\n349\n00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.680\n&gt;&gt; I can, yeah, be happy with my life.\n\n350\n00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.300\n[LAUGH].\n\n351\n00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.884\n&gt;&gt; So if anybody asks, you now armed to\nunderstand how to interact with ostriches,\n\n352\n00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:03.788\nthey do not do that.\n\n353\n00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:06.576\nSo they do,\nlet's go back to our console here,\n\n354\n00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:09.037\nIt's amazing what you learn at ITProTV.\n\n355\n00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:11.946\nMost of it is relevant, however as\nwe freely admit, some of it, well,\n\n356\n00:16:11.946 --> 00:16:12.725\njust not, right?\n\n357\n00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:15.670\nUnless you're an ostrich farmer,\nin which case that was highly relevant.\n\n358\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.489\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n&gt;&gt; But they probably already know that,\n\n359\n00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.030\nin which case,\nwe probably taught them nothing.\n\n360\n00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.552\nAnd the likelihood of them watching\nthis episode is also pretty low,\n\n361\n00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:23.735\nif they're an ostrich farmer.\n\n362\n00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:26.806\nUnless we've changed the name and\ncalled it, Fun Facts About Ostriches,\n\n363\n00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:29.437\nin which case they may actually\nget suckered into watching it and\n\n364\n00:16:29.437 --> 00:16:31.960\nthen it may actually work out well for\neverybody.\n\n365\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.993\nAll right, so Unix Linux computers,\nif we are monitoring them,\n\n366\n00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:36.325\nwe will see them set up here.\n\n367\n00:16:36.325 --> 00:16:37.877\nAgain you would see them listed,\n\n368\n00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:41.050\nremember we have to install\nthe appropriate agent to get that done.\n\n369\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.949\nSpeaking of agents, speaking of agents,\nI keep talking about agents.\n\n370\n00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:47.240\nLet's go take a look at something,\nshall we?\n\n371\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.862\nSo let me just open this up real quick.\n\n372\n00:16:49.862 --> 00:16:53.770\nIt being the installation on media, right?\n\n373\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.432\nFor SCOM?\n\n374\n00:16:54.432 --> 00:16:57.180\nAnd what we see here if\nwe go up under agent.\n\n375\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.445\nI keep talking about it.\nI just thought I'd show it\n\n376\n00:16:58.445 --> 00:16:59.490\nto you real quick.\n\n377\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:04.685\nWe have the agent folder, and\nwe have AMD64 I386, right?\n\n378\n00:17:04.685 --> 00:17:07.310\nI'm sure you could figure\nout what we do with those.\n\n379\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.287\nAnd then you'll see up\nunder each one here,\n\n380\n00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:11.270\nthere is our MOMMagent windows installer.\n\n381\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.540\nI said MOMMagent.msi, that's\nessentially what installs the agent.\n\n382\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.787\nThat is our file that we would execute or\nuse if we were doing a manual install.\n\n383\n00:17:19.787 --> 00:17:24.150\nSo right off the media you have that\nthere for both 64 and 32-bit solutions.\n\n384\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:28.470\nIn addition, if we go just over here-\n&gt;&gt; Look at all those agent files.\n\n385\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.560\nI wonder if that's where they got Agent\nSmith, all the clones from The Matrix.\n\n386\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.224\nMovie-speak.\n\n387\n00:17:34.224 --> 00:17:36.350\nI'm speaking your language here.\n\n388\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wow.\n\n389\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:43.565\nI'm gonna go with no, but no,\nI'm still gonna go with no.\n\n390\n00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:44.788\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna think about it,\n\n391\n00:17:44.788 --> 00:17:45.830\nI'm just gonna go with no.\n\n392\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.260\nBut that was a good option,\nit was a good try.\n\n393\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:53.150\nBut I'm thinking that this was probably\nout after the original Matrix.\n\n394\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.809\nAnd as a result probably had no bearing on\nthe fact that that's what they named it.\n\n395\n00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:56.636\n&gt;&gt; Unless they had a time machine.\n\n396\n00:17:56.636 --> 00:17:59.099\n&gt;&gt; Unless they have that time machine\n&gt;&gt; If they had the Tardis,\n\n397\n00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:01.620\nthen maybe perhaps that\ncould've been the case.\n\n398\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.199\nBut I'm thinking that may not have\nbeen the exact connection that we were\n\n399\n00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:04.714\nlooking for.\n\n400\n00:18:04.714 --> 00:18:06.600\nBut that's like a half high five.\n\n401\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.870\nWe're gonna do an air high five.\n\n402\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.220\nLike come in to the screen.\n\n403\n00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.000\nCome in to the screen.\n\n404\n00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.340\nOkay, we're gonna pretend.\n\n405\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.598\nWe're gonna pretend, but\nwe're not gonna connect all the way.\n\n406\n00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:16.120\nCuz it wasn't quite on target but\nit was close.\n\n407\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.884\nAll right, good.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next time.\n\n408\n00:18:16.884 --> 00:18:17.909\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next time.\n\n409\n00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:20.982\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat was a truly random one.\n\n410\n00:18:20.982 --> 00:18:23.637\nAs randomness goes,\nthat was a real good random one.\n\n411\n00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:24.291\nAll right so\n\n412\n00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:28.590\nlet's talk about where the other parts\nof the agent install comes from.\n\n413\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.055\nAnd this is actually something that you\nand I mentioned, or at least talked\n\n414\n00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:35.310\nabout off air before we came on,\nwhich is we do different agent types.\n\n415\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.100\nAnd so I just showed you where\nthe general agent install was.\n\n416\n00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.350\nBut let's take a look at where we get\nsome of the other agent files from.\n\n417\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.530\nCuz there are other agent types in there.\n\n418\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.851\nSo when we go under the actual install,\nso now instead of just the media,\n\n419\n00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.683\nwhen we actually take a look at hey,\nwe've installed SCOM and\n\n420\n00:18:48.683 --> 00:18:51.133\nnow where do we see it inside\nof the operating system or\n\n421\n00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:53.705\nin the machine that we're on,\nin other words, right?\n\n422\n00:18:53.705 --> 00:18:56.060\nSo let's go in and let's take a look.\n\n423\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.057\nSo if we go in here up under program\nfiles Microsoft System Center 2012\n\n424\n00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:01.027\nR2 Ops Manager.\n\n425\n00:19:01.027 --> 00:19:05.300\nSo this is where the actual\ninstall takes place.\n\n426\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.740\nAnd then from here you'll\nsee we have different areas.\n\n427\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.880\nAnd if we go in we go to server, and\nyou'll see here up under Server,\n\n428\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.440\nwe've got all sorts of different stuff.\n\n429\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.038\nWe have Advisor, AgentManagement.\n\n430\n00:19:18.038 --> 00:19:23.730\nUp under AgentManagement, we have\nAgent Logs, we have amd64, UnixAgents.\n\n431\n00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.363\nSo this is where we go to get the\ndifferent agents that we need to install.\n\n432\n00:19:27.363 --> 00:19:31.720\nOur Unix Linux agents are sitting\nthere in the UnixAgents folder.\n\n433\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.058\nAnd so, whoop, without renaming,\nlet's try that one more time.\n\n434\n00:19:37.058 --> 00:19:37.615\nThere we go.\n\n435\n00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:41.334\n[LAUGH] And so we could see the sh\nfile that we use to be able to\n\n436\n00:19:41.334 --> 00:19:44.214\ndrive the install for\nthe Unix Linux agent.\n\n437\n00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:47.329\nYou'll see we have,\nup under amd64, are, again,\n\n438\n00:19:47.329 --> 00:19:51.540\nbasically a mirror of that content we\njust took a look at off the media.\n\n439\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.375\nIt's sitting right there.\n\n440\n00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:56.130\nAnd we have, and these are all\nthe language files as you pointed out.\n\n441\n00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all the different versions for\n\n442\n00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.404\nlanguage installs if we needed them would\nbe there because we support all the major\n\n443\n00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:03.120\nlanguages.\n\n444\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.873\nWe do have X86 equivalent.\n\n445\n00:20:03.873 --> 00:20:06.740\nSame thing basically,\nso we see that there.\n\n446\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.419\nAnd then, all the logs that will get\ngenerated around agent deployment and\n\n447\n00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.141\nuse we'll find sitting, ultimately,\n\n448\n00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:15.992\nas we start doing deployments,\nsitting in the agent logs folder.\n\n449\n00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:18.104\nSo we'll see them all sitting in here, and\n\n450\n00:20:18.104 --> 00:20:21.250\nthis is where we would be going\nin to be able to interact.\n\n451\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.117\nSo we do have all this structure\navailable to us, once we do the install.\n\n452\n00:20:24.117 --> 00:20:27.830\nWe can grab those files and\nthen drive installs if we need them.\n\n453\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.241\nIf we need perhaps an updated version,\n\n454\n00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:31.138\nmaybe the version we have\nisn't the most up to date.\n\n455\n00:20:31.138 --> 00:20:35.110\nCould always go and download those\noff the web, if necessary also.\n\n456\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.067\nSo we do have some different\noptions here okay.\n\n457\n00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:38.284\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n458\n00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:42.972\nWe do have our management packs area here,\nour management packs got about 120 or so\n\n459\n00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:45.840\nout of the box as you can\nsee there by default.\n\n460\n00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.812\nAnd that number varies a little bit\nbased on the install you do, but\n\n461\n00:20:48.812 --> 00:20:52.220\nin general we load well over 100\nmanagement packs as you do your install.\n\n462\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.940\nYou'll see that the majority of them\nare sealed, we'll see sealed yes here.\n\n463\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.682\nI think you and\nI had this conversation, right?\n\n464\n00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:02.695\nIn one of the prior episodes we did\nspecific about the fact that you'll seal\n\n465\n00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:06.670\nthis yes, but then when there's no seal\nthat doesn't say no, it's just blank.\n\n466\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.390\nOr maybe that might have been?\n\n467\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.213\n&gt;&gt; Maybe Daniel.\n&gt;&gt; May have been Daniel.\n\n468\n00:21:09.213 --> 00:21:12.046\nIt may not been you, but when we take\na look at sealed versus unsealed.\n\n469\n00:21:12.046 --> 00:21:15.320\nIt's interesting that you'll\nnotice that sealed is set to yes\n\n470\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.470\nmeaning the management pack is\nimported from Microsoft, or\n\n471\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.880\na third party vendor, or\neven ourselves, if we made our own.\n\n472\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.138\nCuz we can write our\ncustom management packs.\n\n473\n00:21:23.138 --> 00:21:24.157\nBut we sealed it.\n\n474\n00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:27.763\nWe used a set of utilities to sign and\nseal it, the Sn key utility that\n\n475\n00:21:27.763 --> 00:21:32.100\nwe get through Visual Studio to create\nthe digital signatures and the keys.\n\n476\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.989\nAnd then we sealed it with a tool\nthat allows us to essentially say,\n\n477\n00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:38.050\nhey no changes were made to this\nmanagement pack, it's locked down.\n\n478\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.170\nOr if we bring it in,\nif we write our own and it's unsealed.\n\n479\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.591\nThen we see it doesn't say no, which we\nwere just kind of pointing out was ironic.\n\n480\n00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:48.550\nBut instead it just has a blank or\nnull value there for no sealed.\n\n481\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.960\nSo no doesn't show up when\nyou go to look for it.\n\n482\n00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.843\nI have this conversation sometimes\nwith people, I say just look for\n\n483\n00:21:53.843 --> 00:21:55.175\nthe unsealed management packs.\n\n484\n00:21:55.175 --> 00:21:55.926\nLook in the sealed column.\n\n485\n00:21:55.926 --> 00:21:56.908\nAnd they say, I looked for no.\n\n486\n00:21:56.908 --> 00:21:59.855\nAnd I said no, just look for\nblank because it doesn't say no,\n\n487\n00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:04.155\nit just essentially indicates that they're\nnot sealed by leaving that as a null.\n\n488\n00:22:04.155 --> 00:22:06.695\nBut you can see over here to the left,\nand I know it's hard to see.\n\n489\n00:22:06.695 --> 00:22:09.185\nCould we go full screen for\njust one second?\n\n490\n00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:11.882\nIt may be easier for\nyou to see it this way.\n\n491\n00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:14.403\nThe sealed management packs\nlook kind of like a box,\n\n492\n00:22:14.403 --> 00:22:17.190\nit's almost like an open cereal box or\nsomething.\n\n493\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.011\nIt's all gold, this little gold padlock,\nlower right hand corner.\n\n494\n00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:23.830\nKind of pointing to it right there so\nyou can see it.\n\n495\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.101\nAnd then the ones that are not sealed,\nkind of the same icon,\n\n496\n00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:30.066\nit is that open box but\nit has a grey kind of little item.\n\n497\n00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:33.320\nLooks almost like a little toolbox or\nsomething at the bottom there.\n\n498\n00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.706\nMaybe unlock,\npadlock depending how you view that.\n\n499\n00:22:35.706 --> 00:22:37.055\n&gt;&gt; If you have a microscope, yeah.\n\n500\n00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:41.150\n&gt;&gt; If you do, if you have a microscope,\nyeah, cuz you do need one to see that.\n\n501\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.561\nBut that's sitting there and\nthen those are unsealed.\n\n502\n00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:44.900\nThose are the ones that are unsealed.\n\n503\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.524\nThere are some unsealed management packs\nthat come in by default that we need to be\n\n504\n00:22:48.524 --> 00:22:50.302\nable to use for things like overrides.\n\n505\n00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:51.191\nWe'll talk more about this later on.\n\n506\n00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:55.330\nBut you have things like the client\nmonitoring override management pack.\n\n507\n00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.420\nThe default management pack from\nMicrosoft is loaded unsealed.\n\n508\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.720\nBut the majority of the management\npacks coming in are sealed.\n\n509\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.980\nAnd then we create our own, if we want to.\n\n510\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.672\nAnd obviously, as a result,\nwe're able to go in and\n\n511\n00:23:07.672 --> 00:23:12.270\nto do or\ncreate our own management packs as needed.\n\n512\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.239\nSo we'll take a look in depth\nmore at that as we go and\n\n513\n00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:17.186\nhave some other conversations.\n\n514\n00:23:17.186 --> 00:23:21.510\nBut remember, management pack's heart and\nsoul of what it is we're doing in SCOM.\n\n515\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.300\nWithout management packs,\nwe've got a lot of infrastructure,\n\n516\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.645\nwe've got a lot of stuff showing up in\na console that we can tell nothing about,\n\n517\n00:23:27.645 --> 00:23:28.830\nunderstand nothing from.\n\n518\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.710\nAnd we don't have a clue.\n\n519\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.259\nThere's no proactive or\neven way to tell ahead of time, or\n\n520\n00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:36.078\neven reactively tell what's\nhappening with infrastructure.\n\n521\n00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:38.190\nIt is the magic, literally.\n\n522\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.040\nIt's the catalyst, the ingredient\nthat makes everything work in SCOM.\n\n523\n00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.266\nEverything else we install doing configure\nis essentially just supporting material\n\n524\n00:23:45.266 --> 00:23:47.300\nfor Management Packs to do their jobs.\n\n525\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.390\nSo without Management Packs you got\nnothing, so it's really critical.\n\n526\n00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.810\nIt is the centerpiece of all\nthe work we do inside of SCOM.\n\n527\n00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.756\nWith regards to network management,\nI mentioned that I would show you how we\n\n528\n00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:02.285\nactually would be able to do a client\npush install from the console.\n\n529\n00:24:02.285 --> 00:24:05.852\nSo we can go in and you'll see here we\nhave what are called discovery rules And\n\n530\n00:24:05.852 --> 00:24:08.975\nwe can go ahead and do discovery for\neither Windows machines Unix,\n\n531\n00:24:08.975 --> 00:24:11.180\nLinux machines or network devices.\n\n532\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.700\nWe could discover SNMP capable devices,\nswitches,\n\n533\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.280\nrouters, whatever those things may be.\n\n534\n00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.930\nHow they can actually tell some\nbasic information about them and\n\n535\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.170\nmanage them as well.\n\n536\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.840\nNot fully manage the way we will\nwith a full agent on a server.\n\n537\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.790\nBut we'll be able to get processor usage,\nmemory usage iOS,\n\n538\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.890\nor firmware updates, things like that,\nin terms of build numbers.\n\n539\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.280\nWe get basic information about them.\n\n540\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.337\nI can tell whether or not they're helping\nbased on the set of rules that we devise,\n\n541\n00:24:38.337 --> 00:24:39.590\nand manage the packs that we use.\n\n542\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.360\nSo that's kind of interesting, but\nwith discovery rules, we go and\n\n543\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.630\nwe run the discovery wizard.\n\n544\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.650\nAnd we have three options here,\nas you can see.\n\n545\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.063\nLet me just move this over.\n\n546\n00:24:48.063 --> 00:24:50.100\nWe're gonna take a look here.\n\n547\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.940\nAnd we can go through and run the Windows\ncomputer discovery, Unix or Linux and,\n\n548\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.450\nas I said, network devices.\n\n549\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.630\nWe do Windows computer.\n\n550\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.070\nWe could do automatic computer discovery,\n\n551\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.120\nessentially go out and\nprobe the directory.\n\n552\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.160\nPull back all machines that\npotentially are going to be manageable\n\n553\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.770\nthat we may want to target with install so\nwe can do that.\n\n554\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.231\nWe can also go through\nto advanced discovery,\n\n555\n00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:15.150\nspecify whether we wanna find servers and\nclients, only servers or only clients.\n\n556\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.668\nClients are end points or not server based\nso, you know, a desktop for instance.\n\n557\n00:25:19.668 --> 00:25:24.130\nOr a mobile device would be a client as\nopposed to a server just so you know.\n\n558\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.570\nWe specify the management\nserver we're gonna use so\n\n559\n00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.352\nwe would then be able to\nselect it to a certain degree.\n\n560\n00:25:29.352 --> 00:25:31.830\nI was gonna do an automatic\ndiscovery just cuz it's quicker and\n\n561\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.430\neasier, I don't have to program in,\nas you can see, a lot of stuff.\n\n562\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.120\nWhen I do the advanced\ndiscovery you'll notice,\n\n563\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.430\nI have to add more information here and\nI have to provide more information.\n\n564\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.280\nSo I'm just gonna do an automatic\ndiscovery real quick.\n\n565\n00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.960\nDo I wanna use the selected\nManagement Server, a action account or\n\n566\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.750\nanother account?\n\n567\n00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.320\nWhen we do an install of SCOM.\n\n568\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.910\nAnd remember, we have done installs\non all the products, configured them,\n\n569\n00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.820\ntalked extensively about them in\nthe first couple of episodes of the show.\n\n570\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.520\nAnd we went in and\nactually did a whole series of hands on\n\n571\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.755\nepisodes specific to\nconfiguring each product.\n\n572\n00:26:03.755 --> 00:26:07.175\nWe did a deep dive on SCOM,\nhow to set it up, how to configure it.\n\n573\n00:26:07.175 --> 00:26:10.890\nWe talked about all of the moving parts,\nthe choices we make, and the four types of\n\n574\n00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.370\nrun as accounts we need to create in\norder to be able to set this product up.\n\n575\n00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.340\nSo if you haven't seen that episode,\nplease go back and take a look.\n\n576\n00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.780\nCuz we've spent a significant amount\nof time building this out for\n\n577\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.120\nyou to help you understand that.\n\n578\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.835\nWe're gonna use our server\naction account here.\n\n579\n00:26:22.835 --> 00:26:24.720\nGonna go and do discover.\n\n580\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.500\nIt'll take just a moment.\n\n581\n00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.290\nIt doesn't take very long.\n\n582\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.320\nYou ever see Battle Star Galactica?\n\n583\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.820\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n584\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then.\n\n585\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.920\nI don't have anything to say right here.\n\n586\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm going to pretend that I\n\n587\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.440\njust have something to do while I'm\nwaiting opposed to talking to you.\n\n588\n00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.570\nAbout how that looks like a Cylon\nfrom Battlestar Galactica but\n\n589\n00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.770\nyou wouldn't know what that is.\n\n590\n00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.490\n&gt;&gt; I could imagine it's a spaceship like\nzooming across the universe or something.\n\n591\n00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a good way of thinking about it.\n\n592\n00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.590\nIt looks like that as well.\n\n593\n00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.660\nIf it was a green spaceship,\nthat would be the case.\n\n594\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.830\nSo, yeah, we'll just call it a spaceship\nzooming across the universe.\n\n595\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.225\nLook, it's traveling.\n\n596\n00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:53.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n597\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.050\nas soon as it finishes the discovering,\nit would take about a minute or so.\n\n598\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.550\nIt doesn't take very long.\n\n599\n00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.200\nOnce that is done,\nwe'll then get a list of machines.\n\n600\n00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.270\nYou could see here,\nwe've got three or four of them.\n\n601\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.170\nAnd we can decide which ones we\nwant to install on, so let's\n\n602\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.640\njust say hypothetically, that we wanted\nto put this out on our domain controller.\n\n603\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.720\nWhere you could see this first one there.\n\n604\n00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.960\nWe want to go ahead and\nput it on our virtual machine manager.\n\n605\n00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.650\nSo, another machine we're using\nto run the SCVMM console.\n\n606\n00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.300\nWe could select those two,\ngo ahead then and\n\n607\n00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.180\nclick Next Specify the agent\ninstall directory.\n\n608\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.695\nYou'll see here.\n\n609\n00:27:24.695 --> 00:27:26.540\nCould we go full screen just so\nyou can see this real quick?\n\n610\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.705\nI just want you to see the path.\n\n611\n00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:31.330\n%programfiles%systemvariablestringplaceho-\nlder for\n\n612\n00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.698\nwherever Program Files is on\nthe local machine typically right?\n\n613\n00:27:34.698 --> 00:27:39.130\nYou know, c:/programfiles, but\nwherever it is we'll fill in the blank for\n\n614\n00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.320\nthat locally.\n\n615\n00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.190\nAnd then, Microsoft Monitoring Agent, that\nwill be the subdirectory we install into.\n\n616\n00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.150\n&gt;&gt; We need our action accounts\nto be able to drive the install.\n\n617\n00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.510\nLocal system and or\nanother account we specify.\n\n618\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.520\nWe'll do local system, we'll click Finish.\n\n619\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.330\nNow we have our job monitor here and\nwe'll see this going on.\n\n620\n00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.950\nAnd you see that it has got a job task for\neach one of them taking place.\n\n621\n00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.650\nSo you could see,\nit's kind of started and,\n\n622\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.325\nwe would just monitor the output here.\n\n623\n00:28:04.325 --> 00:28:07.190\nIt takes a couple of minutes, we're not\ngonna sit and actually wait for all of it.\n\n624\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.020\nWe're gonna be doing some other stuff,\nbut you could see this is running.\n\n625\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.000\nAnd if we decide we wanna close this and\nnot watch it finish.\n\n626\n00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.070\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll close that.\n\n627\n00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.180\nWe can always bring that back up later\nby going in and looking at the tasks and\n\n628\n00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.410\nseeing the running tasks and\nunderstanding what's happening with them.\n\n629\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.490\nBut eventually,\nthose agents will be deployed and\n\n630\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.360\nthen over time,\nthey will show up here under agent manage.\n\n631\n00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.210\nSo we'll be able to see them up here\nonce the agents are fully deployed.\n\n632\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.422\nAnd we'll be able to\nstart using that agent or\n\n633\n00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:37.790\nthose agents to monitor those services.\n\n634\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.360\nReally not more complicated than that,\nthat's a console push.\n\n635\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.980\nNow if we decided that we wanted\nto manually target those machines.\n\n636\n00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.400\nTake that mam agent.msi file I showed you,\ngrab that, install that\n\n637\n00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.770\non a machine with the appropriate rights,\nhave admin rights to the box.\n\n638\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.290\nRun that and then,\nthat would come up manually.\n\n639\n00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.970\nBut remember, we would have\nto then go in and allow that.\n\n640\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.470\nYou can actually see here that one of\nthe machines has already been configured.\n\n641\n00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.850\nYou see there, PLAIDEC1, we already got\nthe the agent up and running on it.\n\n642\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.380\nSo we know, that one's already started,\nnot monitored yet but you can see,\n\n643\n00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.310\nit's already been installed\nbecause it popped in.\n\n644\n00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.940\nSo, we're starting to see\na configurate itself and\n\n645\n00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.680\nover time,\nthe other one will come up as well.\n\n646\n00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.070\nAnd then, as a result,\nwe'll actually see them both.\n\n647\n00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.170\nUsually when you do this,\n\n648\n00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.810\nit takes about 15 minutes maybe to 30\nminutes, depending on your infrastructure.\n\n649\n00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.780\nTo get the install done and\nthen to have it show up in the console and\n\n650\n00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.200\nchange from that monitor.\n\n651\n00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.470\nTo starting to kick off and do some stuff\nso, don't be afraid and don't be worried\n\n652\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.793\nabout the fact that you do this enough\nthat it seems to be happening for a while.\n\n653\n00:29:34.793 --> 00:29:37.156\nAnd also by the way,\nnotorious just so you know,\n\n654\n00:29:37.156 --> 00:29:39.146\nthe console does a pretty\ngood job of refreshing.\n\n655\n00:29:39.146 --> 00:29:43.010\nI wanna be fair and honest with you\nin our assessment of the console.\n\n656\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.030\nAnd, there's the other one\njust popping in right now.\n\n657\n00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.330\nBut every so often, and\n\n658\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.620\nwe see this a little bit more in\nSCOM sometimes, that we do an SCVMM.\n\n659\n00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.675\nBut I mentioned this in\nSCVMM when I said to you-\n\n660\n00:29:52.675 --> 00:29:54.072\n&gt;&gt; To stop and start the service,\n\n661\n00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:55.480\nsometimes you need to do that?\n\n662\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.240\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no not so much the service.\n\n663\n00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.700\nThat's one of the things I mentioned\nabout the console not working right.\n\n664\n00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.620\nAnd that's a very important\nimportant one for SCVMM.\n\n665\n00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.640\nBut, that's really unique to SCVMM,\n\n666\n00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.960\nthat service not necessarily starting\nup because it's on delayed start.\n\n667\n00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.913\nAnd, it doesn't always kick in, but that's\neasy to do cuz you start that and then,\n\n668\n00:30:08.913 --> 00:30:09.800\nit's usually running.\n\n669\n00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.740\nNo big deal.\n\n670\n00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.188\nBut no, the console refresh, in fact,\nin some sense we do stuff, and\n\n671\n00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:15.485\nthen it wouldn't pop in.\n\n672\n00:30:15.485 --> 00:30:17.608\nWe would have to restart\nby either refreshing or\n\n673\n00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:20.080\nshutting the console down and\nopening back up.\n\n674\n00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.440\nSo, that's just the part I wanted to\npoint out to you because SCOM especially,\n\n675\n00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.490\nit's pretty good and\nthe refresh is pretty good.\n\n676\n00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.460\nBut, because we're changing state and\n\n677\n00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.030\nthings are happening,\nit doesn't always reflect that accurately.\n\n678\n00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.655\nAnd so, while you may be refreshing a lot.\n\n679\n00:30:33.655 --> 00:30:35.280\nF5, don't be afraid to use that.\n\n680\n00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.130\nApply liberally whenever needed but, if\nnecessary, if you're doing a refresh and\n\n681\n00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.380\nit still doesn't work.\n\n682\n00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.940\nDon't be afraid to close that console\nout and just open it back up.\n\n683\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.730\nThat will force a reconnection to\nthe database, refreshing all the data and\n\n684\n00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.740\nactually tends to solve a lot of those.\n\n685\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.350\nHey, it's not showing up,\nwhat am I doing wrong?\n\n686\n00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.993\nProblems that you think you're\nhaving when in fact, you're not.\n\n687\n00:30:53.993 --> 00:30:55.835\nIt's just that the connection\nbetween the console and\n\n688\n00:30:55.835 --> 00:30:58.675\nthe database may not be\naccurately pulling all the data.\n\n689\n00:30:58.675 --> 00:31:00.565\nThere may have been a lock or\nsomething may have gone on.\n\n690\n00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:02.785\nSo that does happen in the real world,\nbut don't be afraid to address.\n\n691\n00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:06.192\n&gt;&gt; Did you know, there's an actual\npick up line for the F5 key?\n\n692\n00:31:06.192 --> 00:31:09.252\n&gt;&gt; There is a what?\n\n693\n00:31:09.252 --> 00:31:09.850\n&gt;&gt; A pickup line.\n\n694\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.402\n&gt;&gt; A pickup line?\n\n695\n00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:11.867\n&gt;&gt; You know what that is?\n\n696\n00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:13.632\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As in, two guys walked into a bar and\n\n697\n00:31:13.632 --> 00:31:16.102\nfound a girl sitting on a bar stool and\nboth of them hit on her?\n\n698\n00:31:16.102 --> 00:31:17.769\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah because she's.\n&gt;&gt; If you remember, I've been married for\n\n699\n00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:19.532\nso long that I don't get\nto do this very often.\n\n700\n00:31:19.532 --> 00:31:21.612\nOkay, I'm game, so let's play.\n\n701\n00:31:21.612 --> 00:31:22.922\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; A pick up line for F5?\n\n702\n00:31:22.922 --> 00:31:23.712\n&gt;&gt; A pick up line for F5.\n\n703\n00:31:23.712 --> 00:31:24.732\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n704\n00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:25.622\n&gt;&gt; Are you the F5 key?\n\n705\n00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.090\nAre you the F5 key?\n\n706\n00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:28.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n707\n00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.910\n&gt;&gt; So, I would say that to somebody?\n\n708\n00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, I say are you the F5 key?\n\n709\n00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.345\n&gt;&gt; Because you're so refreshing.\n\n710\n00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:34.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you're so refreshing.\n\n711\n00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.980\nSneaky and subtle, but awesome.\n\n712\n00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.250\nI get that so,\nthat's cool because we're both IT geeks.\n\n713\n00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:42.820\nAnd so I'm sure,\n\n714\n00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.620\neverybody out there listening who\nis also into IT would know that.\n\n715\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.490\nBut, that's like a very limited use.\n\n716\n00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, you would probably just\ncreep people out if you said it.\n\n717\n00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, cuz they may not know what it is.\n\n718\n00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.352\nI get the fact but I mean like,\nif they don't work with computers and\n\n719\n00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:58.320\nknow F5, they would probably\nlook at you like, okay.\n\n720\n00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.425\nAnd say, what's the point?\n\n721\n00:31:59.425 --> 00:32:02.019\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering, do people get that?\n\n722\n00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:02.722\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I haven't tried.\n\n723\n00:32:02.722 --> 00:32:03.335\n&gt;&gt; I like that though.\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n724\n00:32:03.335 --> 00:32:05.682\ndon't take any kind of advice,\ndating advice from me.\n\n725\n00:32:05.682 --> 00:32:08.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that one though,\nI didn't know about that.\n\n726\n00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.387\nThat's very innovative,\nI like that, that's cool.\n\n727\n00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:11.287\nThat is worth the full high five.\n\n728\n00:32:11.287 --> 00:32:12.126\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That was awesome-\n\n729\n00:32:12.126 --> 00:32:12.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n730\n00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:14.172\n&gt;&gt; That was a good one, I like that.\n\n731\n00:32:14.172 --> 00:32:19.940\nI'd never heard of that before, it's\nactually a really good one, I like that.\n\n732\n00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.282\nAll riht, so we're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n733\n00:32:21.282 --> 00:32:22.009\n&gt;&gt; So what we're doing,\n\n734\n00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:24.470\n[LAUGH] my God, all right,\nlet's get back to what we're doing here.\n\n735\n00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.438\nAll right, we got some stuff to finish up.\n\n736\n00:32:25.438 --> 00:32:30.260\nSo it is happy Tuesday here at ITPro.TV.\n\n737\n00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.528\nSo you can see now we do have both\nagents installed in the console.\n\n738\n00:32:33.528 --> 00:32:36.240\nWe obviously then would be able to\nstart working with them over time.\n\n739\n00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.813\nTheir status will ultimately update and\nchange.\n\n740\n00:32:37.813 --> 00:32:40.330\nAll right, so we have that in there,\nwhere else were we?\n\n741\n00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.100\nWe've got our Notification\narea here in Administration.\n\n742\n00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.269\nWe've got Channel subscriptions and\nSubscribers.\n\n743\n00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:48.724\nThis is where we start to setup\nour communication pathways for\n\n744\n00:32:48.724 --> 00:32:52.577\nupdates via email for alerts coming out,\ninstant messaging, SMS,\n\n745\n00:32:52.577 --> 00:32:55.714\nconsole scripts,\nthings like that can be configured.\n\n746\n00:32:55.714 --> 00:33:00.090\nAnd we can setup groups that will then be\nable to get those updates as necessary.\n\n747\n00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.540\nYou see our first one just came online,\nit's now Healthy.\n\n748\n00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.320\nSo our domain controller's coming up,\nstarting to show up as healthy.\n\n749\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.890\nIn a couple of minutes, our VMM machine\nwill probably show up there as well.\n\n750\n00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.020\nAnd as I said, if you wait long enough,\n\n751\n00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.750\nthose things do just usually\niron themselves out.\n\n752\n00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.190\nWe do have our product connectors.\n\n753\n00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.200\nOur product connectors allow us\nto create literally as they say,\n\n754\n00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.690\nconnections out into other systems.\n\n755\n00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.005\nAnd we'll explore that and\ntalk about that at another time.\n\n756\n00:33:22.005 --> 00:33:24.380\nWe're not gonna spend so\nmuch time on it right now.\n\n757\n00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.870\nOur resource pools that I mentioned,\nwe've been talking about those.\n\n758\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.600\nJust click here, those are here.\n\n759\n00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.968\nI did mention,\nwe have a few out of the box by default.\n\n760\n00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:33.420\nThe AD Assignment Resource Pool,\n\n761\n00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.134\nI think I mentioned that one when\ntalking about AD integration.\n\n762\n00:33:36.134 --> 00:33:39.185\nNotification Resource Pool and\nAll Management Service Resource Pool,\n\n763\n00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:42.035\nthat's the one that I just kind of\nshowed you on the diagram in theory\n\n764\n00:33:42.035 --> 00:33:45.940\nthat we would be joining automatically is\nthe All Management Service Resource Pool.\n\n765\n00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.348\nAnd then if we have others we can\ncreate other resource pools as needed.\n\n766\n00:33:48.348 --> 00:33:51.639\nSo we would be able to do that and\nyou would be able to go in and\n\n767\n00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:52.998\nuse the resource pool.\n\n768\n00:33:52.998 --> 00:33:55.070\nYou could see here, I can click.\n\n769\n00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.290\nI can view the Resource Pool Members.\n\n770\n00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.239\nI'll be able to create a resource\npool here, if I needed to.\n\n771\n00:33:59.239 --> 00:34:01.887\nGot a little property tab down here.\n\n772\n00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:04.950\nA little property area where I can\nsee some information about it.\n\n773\n00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:05.674\nSo that kind of stuff is available.\n\n774\n00:34:05.674 --> 00:34:10.170\nRunAS accounts are very important to think\nabout our accounts and our profiles.\n\n775\n00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.980\nWe do have some accounts that\nare set up ahead of time.\n\n776\n00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.050\nAnd you could see them here and again in\nour episode where we did the install and\n\n777\n00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.380\nthe configuration of SCOM.\n\n778\n00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.400\nWe go through this and\n\n779\n00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.560\ntalk about different kinds of run outs\naccounts that would be available.\n\n780\n00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.070\nBut we'll see here, we do have\nour Local System Action Account,\n\n781\n00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.590\nour Practice Lab Admin Account that\nwe're using just to drive demos.\n\n782\n00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:33.780\nAnd then we have our Profiles,\nwe have a lot of Profiles here.\n\n783\n00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.576\nThis is how we delegate authority\nto be able to do things,\n\n784\n00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:38.457\nstandard Windows permission model.\n\n785\n00:34:38.457 --> 00:34:42.039\nPut a user into a role, think of a role\nas a group, essentially the same thing.\n\n786\n00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:44.624\nPut them into a role,\npredefined set of permissions and\n\n787\n00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:47.470\nactivities that they've been\nscoped to be able to use.\n\n788\n00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:49.645\nAnd then as a result,\nthey are given certain rights.\n\n789\n00:34:49.645 --> 00:34:52.903\nSo when you wanna give somebody rights\nto run or managed the to console,\n\n790\n00:34:52.903 --> 00:34:56.020\nbut not necessarily rights to do\neverything, you would use a role.\n\n791\n00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.089\nSo you could see, we have something like,\n\n792\n00:34:58.089 --> 00:35:01.719\nlet me just extend this out here at least\nwe could see this a little bit more.\n\n793\n00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:04.984\nWe would have something like\nNotification Account or\n\n794\n00:35:04.984 --> 00:35:08.430\nAlwaysOn Monitoring Account or\nvarious things.\n\n795\n00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.580\nScroll down, you could see we have\nReporting, Privilage Monitor Accounts,\n\n796\n00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.420\nSQL Server Default Action Accounts, etc.\n\n797\n00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.950\nSo we have all these different\nones that are created and\n\n798\n00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.103\nwe can use others if needed and\ncreate our own.\n\n799\n00:35:19.103 --> 00:35:21.909\nYou'll see them create a run as profile\nright over here to the right, and\n\n800\n00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:23.120\nwe can create our own.\n\n801\n00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.593\nWe do have our UNIX/Linux accounts\nthat are set up here as well.\n\n802\n00:35:25.593 --> 00:35:28.872\nAnd if we're doing administration and\nmonitoring our UNIX/Linux systems,\n\n803\n00:35:28.872 --> 00:35:29.920\nwe would be using those.\n\n804\n00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.207\nWe do have our UserRoles.\n\n805\n00:35:33.207 --> 00:35:35.182\nWe're talking about the UserRoles.\n\n806\n00:35:35.182 --> 00:35:38.010\nActually, I think I said put them in\nthe profiles, I didn't mean to say that.\n\n807\n00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.914\nWhat I meant is that the profile and\nthe account are joined together.\n\n808\n00:35:40.914 --> 00:35:43.621\nAnd the user role is gonna be linked\nto the profile, so I apologize.\n\n809\n00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:47.610\nSo I made that sound kinda crazy, cuz that\nwasn't the right way to explain that.\n\n810\n00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.142\nIn my head,\nit actually sounded good, but I was-\n\n811\n00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:49.751\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n812\n00:35:49.751 --> 00:35:51.688\n&gt;&gt; Mulling over that whole F5 pickup\n\n813\n00:35:51.688 --> 00:35:52.438\nline thing.\n\n814\n00:35:52.438 --> 00:35:52.990\nI'm just-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n815\n00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.946\n&gt;&gt; Totally threw me off of base here, so.\n\n816\n00:35:54.946 --> 00:35:59.577\nBut what we have with our UserRoles is\nactually the containers that we would use\n\n817\n00:35:59.577 --> 00:36:04.150\nto delegate the administration I was\ntalking about and assign those rights.\n\n818\n00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.750\nSo things like Read Only Operator and\nor Report Operator, you get the idea.\n\n819\n00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.403\nYou've probably seen\nthis on other programs,\n\n820\n00:36:10.403 --> 00:36:12.135\nyou certainly have a sense\nof what they would be.\n\n821\n00:36:12.135 --> 00:36:15.739\nI just wanted to wrap up our\nconversation about the first area,\n\n822\n00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:18.734\nthe first of the work spaces\nhere with the settings.\n\n823\n00:36:18.734 --> 00:36:21.900\nJust quickly show you a couple of these\nsettings we've been mentioning at least\n\n824\n00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.330\nhinting at that are here.\n\n825\n00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.900\nYou'll see that we do have under Agent,\nwe've deployed our agent, so\n\n826\n00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.780\nwe do have our agent heartbeat setting.\n\n827\n00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.180\nAnd any one of these typically,\nyou can go to Properties to look at.\n\n828\n00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.820\nAnd you'll see here that every 60 seconds,\n\n829\n00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.070\nwe have by default\nthe agent heart beating.\n\n830\n00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.660\nMeaning, tell the agent every 60 seconds,\ncheck in with the management server,\n\n831\n00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.130\ntell me I'm alive and report in.\n\n832\n00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.140\nNow these are all modifiable, so\nwe can change these if we want.\n\n833\n00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.424\nIf we think 60 seconds is either too\naggressive or not aggressive enough,\n\n834\n00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:52.055\nyou make the change accordingly,\nand do what you need to do.\n\n835\n00:36:52.055 --> 00:36:54.702\nBut we do recommend as I've\nsaid of best practices,\n\n836\n00:36:54.702 --> 00:36:57.810\nthat you don't tend to go in and\nmodify these settings.\n\n837\n00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:59.216\nUnless you've number one, read up on them,\n\n838\n00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.740\nyou understand the implications\nof doing this.\n\n839\n00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:06.979\nCuz you may generate a lot of additional\nnetwork traffic and load on the system.\n\n840\n00:37:06.979 --> 00:37:10.455\nAnd there's some cost\nbenefit analysis here, right?\n\n841\n00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:12.752\nMore frequent updates, more data comes in.\n\n842\n00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:15.400\nBut now we gotta scale our databases\non the backend to accommodate that.\n\n843\n00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.885\nAnd make sure our systems are scaled\nappropriately, so we can handle that load.\n\n844\n00:37:19.885 --> 00:37:22.220\nSo that's not a bad thing,\nbut it is a thing,\n\n845\n00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.490\nwe do need to take that into account and\nbe aware of that, right?\n\n846\n00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.501\nWas that something you were gonna ask me?\n\n847\n00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:28.070\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if it was\na good question here.\n\n848\n00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.537\nI was thinking about the guest\nintegration services, if you were using\n\n849\n00:37:31.537 --> 00:37:35.194\na Microsoft network operating system,\nbut then you mentioned database.\n\n850\n00:37:35.194 --> 00:37:38.410\nSo I don't think that that would be\ncompletely dependent on those guest\n\n851\n00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.480\nintegration services with that\none particular operating system.\n\n852\n00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.224\n&gt;&gt; You find your heart beating through\n\n853\n00:37:42.224 --> 00:37:43.000\nthe integration-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n854\n00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.084\n&gt;&gt; Systems for the VMs and Hyper-V.\n\n855\n00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:45.569\n&gt;&gt; Allowing that extra setting,\nbut I don't think-\n\n856\n00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:46.567\n&gt;&gt; This is different.\n\n857\n00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:47.277\n&gt;&gt; That's related?\n\n858\n00:37:47.277 --> 00:37:49.460\n&gt;&gt; This is a heartbeat.\n\n859\n00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.920\nWe do reference the same idea, and\nit is essentially the same thing.\n\n860\n00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.040\nA heartbeat is a heartbeat, so\nyou're absolutely right about that.\n\n861\n00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.200\nBut with integration services or\nif you're more familiar with VMware,\n\n862\n00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.630\nwe would call these the VM Tools.\n\n863\n00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.728\nIt's essentially the same thing but\njust on the VMware platform.\n\n864\n00:38:01.728 --> 00:38:04.820\nThe VM Tools and or\nthe integration services in Hyper-V.\n\n865\n00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.976\nOne of the key things they\ndo is they inject drivers,\n\n866\n00:38:07.976 --> 00:38:10.934\nDLL files that allow us to manage the VM,\nright?\n\n867\n00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:11.793\nThe guest operating system.\n\n868\n00:38:11.793 --> 00:38:14.580\nAnd one of those elements\nis the heart beat.\n\n869\n00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.359\nEssentially hey,\n\n870\n00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.971\nI'm alive every 30 seconds, 60 seconds,\nwhatever like we were discussing here.\n\n871\n00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:21.780\nSo that is the same idea,\nit is definitely the same thing.\n\n872\n00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.890\nBut the heartbeat here is\ncoming from the agent, right?\n\n873\n00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.501\nSo it's coming from\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent,\n\n874\n00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:29.795\nthe MOMAgent.msi that we installed.\n\n875\n00:38:29.795 --> 00:38:32.357\nSo it works the same way,\nit does update us, and\n\n876\n00:38:32.357 --> 00:38:35.445\nit does add extra data into\nthe database with extra load.\n\n877\n00:38:35.445 --> 00:38:39.535\nBut it's not gonna be driven\nby the same software.\n\n878\n00:38:39.535 --> 00:38:40.762\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it's not the integration services\n\n879\n00:38:40.762 --> 00:38:43.201\nthat's driving it, because a lot of\nthe infrastructure we're monitoring.\n\n880\n00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:47.025\nIt certainly can be virtualized,\nbut it may not be.\n\n881\n00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:49.512\nAnd for instance,\nif we don't connect SCOM to VMM and\n\n882\n00:38:49.512 --> 00:38:52.010\nwe don't have knowledge of\nthose virtual machines.\n\n883\n00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.667\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Through the VMM, we may or\n\n884\n00:38:53.667 --> 00:38:55.220\nmay not be monitoring VMs.\n\n885\n00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.900\nWe may just be monitoring\nphysical infrastructure.\n\n886\n00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.230\nSo we don't just rely on that,\nwe rely on this agent to give it to us.\n\n887\n00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.286\nBut it's the same exact idea because,\nwe're using a piece of software to do\n\n888\n00:39:04.286 --> 00:39:06.355\nthe heart beating for us,\nso it works the same way.\n\n889\n00:39:06.355 --> 00:39:08.810\nSo in your mind,\nI understand what you're saying.\n\n890\n00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:12.050\nIt's essentially the same idea, it just\ncomes from a different piece of software.\n\n891\n00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.700\nWe do have Alerts,\nwe can go back to the console here.\n\n892\n00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.361\nWe do have Alerts, we can go in and\n\n893\n00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:21.476\nwe can specify here as you'll\nsee Properties and then we wait.\n\n894\n00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:22.890\nThere we go again.\n\n895\n00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:27.220\nWe do have our ability to be able to\ncreate custom Alert Resolution States.\n\n896\n00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.810\nWe can program at our own and\nuse those to be able to then tag and\n\n897\n00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.320\nalert as it goes through its escalation\nand de-escalation life cycle.\n\n898\n00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.270\nWe tie this to service manager.\n\n899\n00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.822\nWe can actually mirror these and\nmarry these together and\n\n900\n00:39:38.822 --> 00:39:41.970\nhave customized alert resolution settings.\n\n901\n00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.567\nAnd a lot of my customers want this or\ndo this,\n\n902\n00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:45.760\nbecause they have there own\nspecial way of dealing with this.\n\n903\n00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.630\nTheir own language and their own\nidentifiers and so we can do that.\n\n904\n00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.522\nWe can also specify the retention\nsettings on Automatic Alert Resolution,\n\n905\n00:39:53.522 --> 00:39:56.949\nif something is healthy for\na certain number of days, resolve it.\n\n906\n00:39:56.949 --> 00:40:00.876\nAnd if it's in the system for a certain\nnumber of days after it is there,\n\n907\n00:40:00.876 --> 00:40:01.605\nresolve it.\n\n908\n00:40:01.605 --> 00:40:02.778\nAnd we can specify those.\n\n909\n00:40:02.778 --> 00:40:06.459\nWe do have default settings, we can\nmonitor or maintain these or change them.\n\n910\n00:40:06.459 --> 00:40:10.646\nWe can also change these from PowerShell\nthrough the SCOM ops manager console if we\n\n911\n00:40:10.646 --> 00:40:11.810\nchoose to.\n\n912\n00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.670\nWe have our database\ngrooming settings here.\n\n913\n00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.382\nThis is a very important one.\n\n914\n00:40:16.382 --> 00:40:21.016\nThis is where we go in and change the\nretention periods on data that is being\n\n915\n00:40:21.016 --> 00:40:23.940\nput into the ops manager database.\n\n916\n00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.600\nNow remember we said\nwe have two databases.\n\n917\n00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.570\nThe ops manager database, right, and\nwe have the data warehouse database.\n\n918\n00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.050\nAll the active data goes into\nthe ops manager database first.\n\n919\n00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.080\nStays there for a period of time,\nas you saw based on the retention periods.\n\n920\n00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.230\nEventually, we move stuff into the ops\nmanager data warehouse database.\n\n921\n00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.620\nAnd remember, we keep data there for\nroughly 400 days, about 13 months.\n\n922\n00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.830\nSo we can report on it for\na longer period of time.\n\n923\n00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.590\nSo we have two distinctly\ndifferent databases doing\n\n924\n00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:53.100\ndifferent things based on\nretention periods and access.\n\n925\n00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.214\nAnd the reporting services doesn't\ntalk to the ops manager database.\n\n926\n00:40:56.214 --> 00:40:58.560\nIt only talks to the data\nwarehouse database.\n\n927\n00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.780\nSo it's looking at archival\ndata over long periods of time.\n\n928\n00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.780\nIt can pull real time data as well, but\n\n929\n00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.590\nit's pulling it through\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n930\n00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.740\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n931\n00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.970\nWe can modify these settings if necessary.\n\n932\n00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.570\nAgain, either here if we want to,\nor we can do it through the SCOM\n\n933\n00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.160\nmanagement shell,\ndo it through PowerShell if we choose too.\n\n934\n00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.142\nWe do have privacy.\n\n935\n00:41:16.142 --> 00:41:19.712\nThis where we go to opt in, opt out of the\ncustomer experience improvement program,\n\n936\n00:41:19.712 --> 00:41:21.385\nthings like that we've talked about.\n\n937\n00:41:21.385 --> 00:41:23.767\nWe do have reporting here.\n\n938\n00:41:23.767 --> 00:41:27.844\nAnd we do have the ability to go in and\nspecify the reporting server URL.\n\n939\n00:41:27.844 --> 00:41:30.702\nRemember that's set up on a separate\nserver, and so we can go in and\n\n940\n00:41:30.702 --> 00:41:32.865\nsee that here if we're\nnot sure what it is.\n\n941\n00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:35.328\nAnd we can check to make sure\nwe have it the right way.\n\n942\n00:41:35.328 --> 00:41:38.350\nWe have our web address here for\nour console.\n\n943\n00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.690\nSo for the web console, you can see and\nwe can go in and we can test this.\n\n944\n00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.600\nWe can go in and see what the web console\nlooks like if you haven't seen it before.\n\n945\n00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.047\nAnd remember I told you that we\nwould typically need the Silverlight\n\n946\n00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:51.915\nconfiguration or Silverlight.\n\n947\n00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:53.701\nWe'd get a prompt something like this.\n\n948\n00:41:53.701 --> 00:41:56.445\nAnd so you can go in,\nyou're gonna see configure here.\n\n949\n00:41:56.445 --> 00:41:58.098\nYou'll see it prompts me to download.\n\n950\n00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:00.670\nCan we go full screen cuz we're only\nseeing like half of what I'm doing?\n\n951\n00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.749\nYou could see we're downloading\nthe Silverlight configuration here.\n\n952\n00:42:03.749 --> 00:42:06.300\nWe'd just run this first time,\nno big deal.\n\n953\n00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.263\nIt's configured.\n\n954\n00:42:07.263 --> 00:42:10.280\nNow it says, hey, close it out or\nhit skip or whatever.\n\n955\n00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.482\nYou don't have to worry about that.\n\n956\n00:42:11.482 --> 00:42:16.654\nJust literally go through and just hit F5,\nit'll just come right back up and go in.\n\n957\n00:42:16.654 --> 00:42:18.859\nYou don't even have to worry about\ngoing and doing the whole Skip thing.\n\n958\n00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:20.743\nI'm not gonna pay attention to you, and\n\n959\n00:42:20.743 --> 00:42:24.740\nI am not taking any information that you\noffer me by tapping your arm, young lady.\n\n960\n00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.190\nSo you can see here that\nwe have monitoring.\n\n961\n00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.040\nAnd remember I said that the web\nconsole is actually gonna be\n\n962\n00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.442\na constrained console, right?\n\n963\n00:42:32.442 --> 00:42:34.420\nIt's gonna be a console that\ndoesn't have the full rights.\n\n964\n00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.160\nBut what it does have, is the ability to\nlook at monitoring and also create views.\n\n965\n00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.559\nAnd this is the console you would give to\na general everyday admin who needs to go\n\n966\n00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:42.754\nin and look at monitoring.\n\n967\n00:42:42.754 --> 00:42:45.319\nBut it's not gonna configure\nthe back end administrations.\n\n968\n00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:46.650\nSo that's what we see here.\n\n969\n00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.300\nSo this is our web console,\nin case you haven't seen it before.\n\n970\n00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.687\nAnd I do know we do need to wrap up.\n\n971\n00:42:50.687 --> 00:42:52.690\nWe'll do that in just a minute,\nall kidding aside.\n\n972\n00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.040\nYou do get your Silverlight\nupdate here as well.\n\n973\n00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.090\nWe'll put that off to the side for the\nmoment, but you can test that from here.\n\n974\n00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.400\nI just also wanted to show you\njust down here one other thing.\n\n975\n00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.800\nDown here under type server, this is\nthe one that's really critical, right?\n\n976\n00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.670\nThis is the one that I was talking about.\n\n977\n00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:08.636\nLet's highlight this.\n\n978\n00:43:08.636 --> 00:43:12.199\nThis is the one about manual agent\ninstalls that we have to go configure and\n\n979\n00:43:12.199 --> 00:43:16.470\nallows so that manual agent installs can\nactually be entertained in the console.\n\n980\n00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.311\nCuz without setting the setting,\nremember they're denied automatically,\n\n981\n00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:21.904\nwe don't get the option to go in and\nsay, hey, let me approve you mode.\n\n982\n00:43:21.904 --> 00:43:25.600\nWe just get the, sorry, we're not\ninterested, and it just doesn't show up.\n\n983\n00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.462\nSo this is the one, as they say.\n\n984\n00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:29.344\nYou see The Matrix?\n\n985\n00:43:29.344 --> 00:43:31.483\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or Highlander?\n\n986\n00:43:31.483 --> 00:43:32.221\n&gt;&gt; Not Highlander.\n\n987\n00:43:32.221 --> 00:43:33.055\n&gt;&gt; Not Highlander.\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n988\n00:43:33.055 --> 00:43:34.666\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthere can be only one, as we say.\n\n989\n00:43:34.666 --> 00:43:36.646\nSo this is the setting\nyou go into right here.\n\n990\n00:43:36.646 --> 00:43:40.753\nAnd you could see with security reject\nthe manual agent installs, by default, and\n\n991\n00:43:40.753 --> 00:43:41.670\nby design.\n\n992\n00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.522\nWe do not allow manual agent installs.\n\n993\n00:43:43.522 --> 00:43:47.271\nBut if we choose to change that review\nnew management agent installs, and\n\n994\n00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:50.907\neven automatically approve them if\nnecessary, we could do that here.\n\n995\n00:43:50.907 --> 00:43:55.309\nHit Apply, hit OK, and then what will\nhappen is once we do that, whoops,\n\n996\n00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:56.670\nlet me go back up here.\n\n997\n00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.460\nOnce we do that, if we do a manual install\nof an agent, when it goes to pending,\n\n998\n00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.620\nwe'll actually see it show up\nhere instead of being denied.\n\n999\n00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.060\nAnd we'll have the opportunity to approve\nit as opposed to simply not having it\n\n1000\n00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.090\nshow up at all.\n\n1001\n00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.770\nAnd remember there we go, under agent\nmanage we do have our agents that we've\n\n1002\n00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.750\nalready installed through\nthe console push.\n\n1003\n00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:17.569\nThey do show up.\n\n1004\n00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:20.042\nAnd you could see the other\none hasn't come online yet,\n\n1005\n00:44:20.042 --> 00:44:21.942\nwe talked about that whole refresh thing.\n\n1006\n00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:26.180\nYou might refresh and maybe a refresh will\nbring that one up, maybe it will not.\n\n1007\n00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.126\nIt's hard to say.\n\n1008\n00:44:27.126 --> 00:44:31.420\nLike I told you, don't be afraid to\nclose out that console if necessary.\n\n1009\n00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.706\nOpen it back up,\ncuz sometimes it actually is refreshed,\n\n1010\n00:44:33.706 --> 00:44:35.347\nyou're just not necessarily seeing it.\n\n1011\n00:44:35.347 --> 00:44:37.644\nThat's usually the interaction\nwith the database.\n\n1012\n00:44:37.644 --> 00:44:40.495\nSo when we do that, if we just take\na look as we're finishing up here,\n\n1013\n00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:42.380\nwe'll see if maybe that shook it free.\n\n1014\n00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.960\nIt may not have actually reported and\nthe status may not have changed yet.\n\n1015\n00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.364\nThat is also potentially accurate-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n1016\n00:44:47.364 --> 00:44:49.290\n&gt;&gt; But you could see that when we do that,\nit does come back up.\n\n1017\n00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.890\nAnd so sometimes that console locks up\na little bit eventhough you refresh it.\n\n1018\n00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.420\nIt may be the connection\nwith the database.\n\n1019\n00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.970\nAnd shut the console out, closing it,\nopen it back up forces the database of\n\n1020\n00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.940\nthe console that will reconnect,\nall that update comes streaming back in.\n\n1021\n00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.250\nAnd all of a sudden it\nshows up on the console.\n\n1022\n00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.100\nIt's all good.\n\n1023\n00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah,\nI hate to be the Debbie Downer here.\n\n1024\n00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.890\nI know you guys are really\nanticipating more information here.\n\n1025\n00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.338\nBut you're gonna have to tune into the\nnext show, because we are out of time for\n\n1026\n00:45:12.338 --> 00:45:13.499\nthis particular series.\n\n1027\n00:45:13.499 --> 00:45:15.264\nOr this particular show, not series.\n\n1028\n00:45:15.264 --> 00:45:17.874\nWe're not cutting it off that prematurely,\nbut.\n\n1029\n00:45:17.874 --> 00:45:19.156\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n1030\n00:45:19.156 --> 00:45:21.258\nI was gonna sit down and take a break,\nbut if we're gonna do more,\n\n1031\n00:45:21.258 --> 00:45:22.150\nthen I'll keep standing.\n\n1032\n00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.288\n&gt;&gt; We'll be back, yeah, so stay tuned.\n\n1033\n00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:26.593\nSo just remember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n1034\n00:45:26.593 --> 00:45:27.749\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n1035\n00:45:27.749 --> 00:45:30.344\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n1036\n00:45:30.344 -->

00:00:08.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.543\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your monitoring and\noperating a private cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.350\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.380\nSo we've made it to part three, and\n\n8\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.940\nwe're gonna continue talking about\nmonitoring cloud based applications.\n\n9\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.012\nAnd of course you know it we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon himself in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:27.510\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.264\n&gt;&gt; I'm not feeling like myself,\nI'm feeling more like-\n\n12\n00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:29.983\n&gt;&gt; Someone else?\n\n13\n00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:31.017\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking more like Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:33.061\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm a short version of Daniel,\n\n15\n00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.151\ncuz he towers above me.\n\n16\n00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:36.714\nBut I will do my best to\nimpersonate myself and\n\n17\n00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:41.550\ncontinue to spread knowledge about SCOM\nfor you as we continue with part three.\n\n18\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.695\nSo we've been looking in parts one and\ntwo at SCOM overall.\n\n19\n00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.055\nWe talked about the architecture, how\nwe set it up with the moving parts are.\n\n20\n00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:51.165\nPart two we talked about some of\nthe functionality in the console.\n\n21\n00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:54.165\nWe're gonna continue go and through there,\ndive a little deeper in some things.\n\n22\n00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:57.147\nTalk a little more about matters from\npack I'll show you some of the other\n\n23\n00:00:57.147 --> 00:00:59.047\ninteresting work areas.\n\n24\n00:00:59.047 --> 00:01:01.827\nThe reporting, authoring, and\nmonitoring work areas, what goes on there.\n\n25\n00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:05.635\nAnd see if we can just put together some\nadditional information that will make you\n\n26\n00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:06.587\neven more focused.\n\n27\n00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.869\nAnd as a result more valuable\nas a cloud monitoring and\n\n28\n00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.210\noptimizing professional as you seek to,\nnot only go to a new SCOM.\n\n29\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.532\nBut also link it through\nour Fabric through CVMM.\n\n30\n00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:22.705\nAnd more importantly, seek to really\nacquire all the knowledge it's necessary\n\n31\n00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:26.018\nto ultimately become MCNC with\nthe private cloud designation,\n\n32\n00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.569\nthe 7246 in this series.\n\n33\n00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.411\nAnd also 7247 information in the other\nseries that we've put together for you.\n\n34\n00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.640\nAlong with this SCOM datacenter monitoring\noptimization of a private cloud\n\n35\n00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.820\ndiscussion that I told you we've had,\n\n36\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.830\nthat goes deep into really much\nbroader into this program end to end.\n\n37\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.910\nAnd if you wanna really specialize on\nSCOM, and learn how to use that product.\n\n38\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.503\nThat whole show and\nthat series of episodes we did there,\n\n39\n00:01:48.503 --> 00:01:50.944\nwould be a valuable addition\nto your knowledge base.\n\n40\n00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:56.055\nSo just be thinking about that, and that\nway you will be able to better understand\n\n41\n00:01:56.055 --> 00:02:00.655\nsome of the things that you are needing\nto do in order to use this product.\n\n42\n00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:01.855\nLet's go back and take a look and\n\n43\n00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.903\njump back in if you will,\nback into the console.\n\n44\n00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:08.633\nI just wanna go back to a point we\nmade earlier in the last episode.\n\n45\n00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.740\nI didn't actually show you\nthe membership on the resource pools.\n\n46\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.960\nBut I said hey,\nby the way that middle one,\n\n47\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.468\nthe all management service resource pool,\nthat's where we would see all the managers\n\n48\n00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:22.763\nwe're piling in by default as\nwe build out our resource pools.\n\n49\n00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:25.391\nIf you remember as we look\nat our architecture here,\n\n50\n00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:29.579\nour resource pools management servers will\nbe that highly available load balanced\n\n51\n00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.906\nsetup that we're going to start becoming a\nmember of, as we install and come online.\n\n52\n00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:37.420\nAnd we become a member of that one\nautomatically, and we can create our own.\n\n53\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.221\nI thought this would be a good way to\njump in and to be able to go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.236\ntalk about some of the other things\nthat we can do in the management pack.\n\n55\n00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:49.016\nOr excuse me, management pack, in\nthe console with management pack by way of\n\n56\n00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.730\ntalking about some of the monitoring\nviews that we're gonna see.\n\n57\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.390\nSo let's go in here,\nright-click on Resource Pools.\n\n58\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.395\nYou can see where we are, middle one,\nAll Management Service Resource Pool\n\n59\n00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:01.105\nright-click and\nwe choose Resource Pool Members.\n\n60\n00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:05.775\nYou can also do it right from over here,\nand what we'll find, let's go in there for\n\n61\n00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:07.334\na second, we click there.\n\n62\n00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:09.573\nWe will get our default management server,\n\n63\n00:03:09.573 --> 00:03:14.080\nthe one that we are using right now which\nis the one we're running the console off.\n\n64\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.200\nThat's not too exciting in and\nof itself, it's just there,\n\n65\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.400\nyou could see it's healthy.\n\n66\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.189\nNo big deal, that is important but\nnot really surprising.\n\n67\n00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.661\nBut what we do when we highlight that,\n\n68\n00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.600\ncan we go full screen so\nyou can see this behind me?\n\n69\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.985\nYou will see we have all of these actions\nand tasks and navigation items and\n\n70\n00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:32.523\nreports and all these stuff that come\nup that we're able to use in this view.\n\n71\n00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:35.841\nAnd what we're seeing is all\nthe activities associated with this.\n\n72\n00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.645\nAnd if we just kind of drag this down,\n\n73\n00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.813\nyou'll see we're seeing a window\na separate from the console.\n\n74\n00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:43.250\nWe've popped up in other words,\nanother console window and\n\n75\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.140\nthe main console is still sitting\nbehind those and we're drilling in.\n\n76\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.952\nThis is one of the features\nof the console.\n\n77\n00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:51.960\nWe start opening other window and\ndrilling down to see these views.\n\n78\n00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.752\nAnd so what we can do is run a series of\nreports that will give us information.\n\n79\n00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:59.212\nWe'll take a look at report\ntasks in a minute, but\n\n80\n00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:01.790\nwe have a serious of\nnavigation items here.\n\n81\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.500\nViews that are used to be able\nto show us information and\n\n82\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.200\nviews are one of the elements that\nare part of the management packs.\n\n83\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.006\nWe get these views,\n\n84\n00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.769\nbecause they come in as part of\nthe management pack that we imported.\n\n85\n00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe're gonna show you how to import\nmanagement packs, talk more about\n\n86\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.542\nthe management pack objects that make\nthem up in just a couple of minutes here.\n\n87\n00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.079\nBut you'll see, and\nsince we see this is healthy,\n\n88\n00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.383\nwe probably don't have\nany alerts right now.\n\n89\n00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:26.238\nWe could go to the alert view, but\nthere probably won't be anything there.\n\n90\n00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:28.125\nBut let's go to the Diagram View,\n\n91\n00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:31.975\nthis is one that we've looked at\nbefore in some of our other episodes.\n\n92\n00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:36.105\nAnd we can see the Diagram View shows us,\nnow we only have one management server in\n\n93\n00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:39.070\nthe management group right now,\nin the resource pools.\n\n94\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.469\nSo there's really not a lot to see,\nit's not gonna be linked to other stuff.\n\n95\n00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.550\nBut I've shown you, in other episodes,\nsome of the diagram views.\n\n96\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.970\nCherokee has seen some of\nthem that we've worked with.\n\n97\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.460\nAnd some upcoming episodes you will\nsee them in, where we drill down,\n\n98\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.010\nand we look at an application for\ninstance.\n\n99\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.560\nRemember some of the application\nviews that we've done,\n\n100\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.350\nwhere we actually open up an application\nand show you all the layers.\n\n101\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.780\nWe were talking about multi tier service\ndesign templates in VMM, right, remember?\n\n102\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.864\nAnd we're not gonna go back and\nhave the whole conversation again.\n\n103\n00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:05.641\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna get started on that,\nyep, [LAUGH].\n\n104\n00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:06.581\n&gt;&gt; But we did talk about them.\n\n105\n00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.925\nCherokee had helped us to better\nunderstand the concept of tiering and\n\n106\n00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:11.420\nwhat it would represent.\n\n107\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.019\nBut when we looked at that\nmultilevel architecture,\n\n108\n00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:18.015\nimagine that broken out into a diagram,\nmuch like you saw in the design template.\n\n109\n00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.998\nBut interactive, and\nactually able to click on that-\n\n110\n00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:21.869\n&gt;&gt; Now that part was really cool.\n\n111\n00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:22.972\n&gt;&gt; And that part was really cool, right?\n\n112\n00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:26.269\nCuz we could get the real time monitoring\ndata, we could see the status.\n\n113\n00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:29.849\nWe could go and depending on the context\nand the focus of what we've clicked on,\n\n114\n00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.067\nhave object activities and use the things\nthat would line up to be used.\n\n115\n00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:34.022\n&gt;&gt; Back together.\n\n116\n00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:36.692\n&gt;&gt; And we could drill in and\nsee what was healthy, what was not.\n\n117\n00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:41.314\nAnd then we could take action right\nfrom there inside of the console using\n\n118\n00:05:41.314 --> 00:05:42.830\nthe Diagram View.\n\n119\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.400\nSo this is actually a really\nimportant part of and\n\n120\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.990\na very interactive part of what\nwe do with management in SCOM and\n\n121\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.830\ngetting familiar with the views and\nhow they work.\n\n122\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.081\nAnd to be able to use to your\nadvantage as an administrator,\n\n123\n00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.203\nit's gonna be very helpful,\nvery beneficial for you.\n\n124\n00:05:56.203 --> 00:05:57.784\nSo I wanted to show this to you.\n\n125\n00:05:57.784 --> 00:06:00.406\nIf we highlight this, we click here.\n\n126\n00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:03.470\nYou can see that we really don't\nhave too much going on right now.\n\n127\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.849\nIt is healthy, there's probably not\na lot of things we have to remediate.\n\n128\n00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.052\nBut we can put this machine into\nmaintainance mode, take it offline, right?\n\n129\n00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:14.220\nDo some sort of service on it during\nwhat we call our service window.\n\n130\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.310\nWe call maintenance windows in our\nproduct by the way service windows.\n\n131\n00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.596\nIn the industry generically\ncalled a maintenance windows,\n\n132\n00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:22.879\nbut Microsoft calls them service windows,\nthat's just what we'll refer to them as.\n\n133\n00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.910\nSo you can put them into a service window,\ntake them offline for servicing.\n\n134\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.244\nDo what we need to do, we may live migrate\nour VMs off the machine as part of that.\n\n135\n00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:35.011\nSo there's different things we may do when\nwe put something into maintenance mode, so\n\n136\n00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:36.828\nwe could do that as\na task right from here.\n\n137\n00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:40.205\nWe could then stop maintenance mode,\nif we put it into maintenance mode.\n\n138\n00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:43.505\nWe can also right click on\nthe Diagram object, and\n\n139\n00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:45.295\nyou'll see we have some options here.\n\n140\n00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.875\nWe can open up any of\nthe views that are down here.\n\n141\n00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:50.695\nCan we go back to full screen,\ncuz half the views are hidden behind,\n\n142\n00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:51.670\nyou can't see them.\n\n143\n00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.939\nBut we could see the views here,\nwe could open up the views.\n\n144\n00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.714\nWe can go in and look at\nthe Health Explorer, which is right here.\n\n145\n00:06:57.714 --> 00:07:00.117\nAnd Health Explorer is that explorer view.\n\n146\n00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:02.357\nAnd you and\nI have looked at this before as well,\n\n147\n00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:05.700\nwhere we see all the different\nchange states that have occurred.\n\n148\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.670\nSo hey, I went from healthy to warning.\n\n149\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.364\nAnd what time did I do that?\n\n150\n00:07:08.364 --> 00:07:09.910\nAnd what was the cause of that?\n\n151\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.820\nAnd we could see those shifts and\ntrack that over time.\n\n152\n00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.820\nThat's all sitting in the Health Explorer.\n\n153\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.140\nNotice we can open\nthe Ops Manager Shell right from here,\n\n154\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.130\nand we can interact with PowerShell.\n\n155\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.130\nWe could put it in the Maintenance Mode\nright from here if necessary.\n\n156\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.610\nAnd of course standard Refresh and\nHelp available as well, so\n\n157\n00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.860\nwe do have a lot of options here.\n\n158\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.250\nHealth Explorer, right now,\n\n159\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.060\nwe don't really have anything\nassociated with it, we just installed.\n\n160\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.532\nThere's probably nothing other than\na change of state from not monitored into\n\n161\n00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:38.017\nhealthy and that's what we\nwould see when we go in here.\n\n162\n00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:41.225\nBut other than that you'll see\nfrom not monitored to healthy.\n\n163\n00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.791\nWe just haven't been running the system\nlong enough or done anything with it just.\n\n164\n00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:48.156\nCuz we literally installed, if you\nremember, the agent was just installed and\n\n165\n00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:49.992\nconfigured in the last episode.\n\n166\n00:07:49.992 --> 00:07:53.146\nIt hasn't been all that long, and so\nwe really don't have anything going on.\n\n167\n00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:56.154\nBut if we saw a different phase shifts or\nchange states,\n\n168\n00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:57.953\nwe would see them recorded here.\n\n169\n00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:02.369\nAnd so it's nice to know that we can\nmonitor, and we can interact with this.\n\n170\n00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:06.282\nWe also have a performance view,\nlet's just go in and take a look at this.\n\n171\n00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:08.946\nThe performance view, because we\ndon't have any counter selected,\n\n172\n00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:11.410\nwe haven't customized it,\nwon't show us anything right now.\n\n173\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.560\nBut think PerfMon, performance monitor.\n\n174\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.340\nThis is PerfMon,\n\n175\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.205\npreconfigured and available to us\nto do monitoring in real time.\n\n176\n00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.800\nThat's what the perf or\nperformance view allows us to do.\n\n177\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.495\nAnd so we can go in and\nlook at a time range,\n\n178\n00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:25.865\nwe just haven't really generated\nany data significantly,\n\n179\n00:08:25.865 --> 00:08:29.075\nbecause we just haven't monitored long\nenough for there to be anything in here.\n\n180\n00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:32.175\nBut over time, in a real production\nenvironment, you'd see this come up, and\n\n181\n00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.245\nwe'd be able to interact with this view.\n\n182\n00:08:34.245 --> 00:08:35.635\nSo we'd be able to see that from here.\n\n183\n00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:38.610\nWe would be able to see\nthe event view right here.\n\n184\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.890\nAnd if we have events going on,\nthere aren't any right now cuz we haven't\n\n185\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.160\ndone anything, in the system, but\nwe would see all the events listed here.\n\n186\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.060\nThink of events as log entries, right?\n\n187\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.810\nOr informational entries,\nthat tell us something has happened.\n\n188\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.145\nWe would see those.\n\n189\n00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:56.245\nWe can see the network vicinity dashboard.\n\n190\n00:08:56.245 --> 00:09:00.295\nAnd the network vicinity dashboard also\ngives us the ability to look at, and\n\n191\n00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:03.765\nagain, with only one machine in the pool,\nand one system being monitored,\n\n192\n00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:05.242\nit's very limited view.\n\n193\n00:09:05.242 --> 00:09:08.472\nBut imagine we had a large scale\ninfrastructure, scaled out,\n\n194\n00:09:08.472 --> 00:09:12.272\nwhere we had multiple management servers,\nwe had reporting server, gateways, etc.\n\n195\n00:09:12.272 --> 00:09:15.052\nWe would see all of this in\nthe network vicinity view.\n\n196\n00:09:15.052 --> 00:09:19.131\nWe would then be able to go ahead and\ninteract with these shapes,\n\n197\n00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:22.131\nand essentially see what's connected to\nwhat, and we'd be able to interact and\n\n198\n00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:23.761\nsee how they all line up.\n\n199\n00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:28.171\nSo the network vicinity view becomes very\nimportant because again, we can go in.\n\n200\n00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.011\nAnd we can, as you can see here,\ninteract, right?\n\n201\n00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:35.418\nWe can do our navigation,\ninformation, do our report tasks.\n\n202\n00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:36.600\nThese are the report tests for\n\n203\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.450\nall the items that are sitting\nover here on this list.\n\n204\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.050\nLet's just launch one really quickly.\n\n205\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.852\nSo let's take a look at, and let's see,\n\n206\n00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:46.870\nAgent Counts by\nDate Management Group Inversion, right.\n\n207\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.510\nIf we go and we do that,\nthis is what a report looks like,\n\n208\n00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.240\nfrom the reporting server.\n\n209\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.870\nAgain, reports are pre-populated.\n\n210\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.190\nThey come in with management packs.\n\n211\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.590\nWe can build our own.\n\n212\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.453\nAnd add them in separately, we could\nuse what's called the SQL Server, or\n\n213\n00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.450\nPort Services, or Port Designer tool.\n\n214\n00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.840\nWe could build our own reports.\n\n215\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.880\nWe're not gonna go through how to do\nthat in this set of discussions, but\n\n216\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.710\nyou certainly can build those and\nload them into the SSRS stack, and\n\n217\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.400\nthen have them made available, and\nimport them if you wanted to use them.\n\n218\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.980\n&gt;&gt; Choosing your own metrics, that\n\n219\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.480\nmight be-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n220\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.245\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n221\n00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:16.536\n&gt;&gt; Just something more specific,\n\n222\n00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:20.123\nlike kind of a one-size-fits-one, instead\nof the off-the-shelf ones that aren't\n\n223\n00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:22.580\nvery valuable.\nI mean, most of the reports that are there\n\n224\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.050\nare very useful, but you may wanna\ntweakk them a little bit to your point.\n\n225\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.070\nAnd then, as a result,\n\n226\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.540\nhave a better understanding\nof what that data looks like.\n\n227\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.240\nThe thing you do have to realize here,\nwhen you setup the report.\n\n228\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.500\nEvery report is different.\n\n229\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.660\nThere will be areas there that\nyou may have to program in.\n\n230\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.010\nWhat's the starting and ending date?\n\n231\n00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.130\nThings like that.\n\n232\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.250\nWhat's the aggregation?\n\n233\n00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.430\nIs it daily?\n\n234\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.430\nHow often do we wanna\nsee the data aggregated?\n\n235\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.910\nWeekly, quarterly, yearly, etc.\n\n236\n00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.580\nWe have different options.\n\n237\n00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.790\nSo we'll be able to do that.\n\n238\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.790\nWhat's our management group?\n\n239\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.600\nWe'd have to specify all that.\n\n240\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.090\nSo, then we run, once we actually\nhave all the data specified.\n\n241\n00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.440\nDepending on what the fields are,\nwe may actually have to go in and\n\n242\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.440\ndo a little programing in there\nto put certain things in place,\n\n243\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.860\nchoose certain options or hit certain\nbuttons, browse for certain things.\n\n244\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.570\nCan we go full screen?\n\n245\n00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.460\nIt'll be easier to see this if we do that.\n\n246\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.160\nThen, we get these beautiful reports and\nthey really are.\n\n247\n00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.150\nI mean,\njust when you look at what the outcome is.\n\n248\n00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.040\nYou look at the language,\nwe can interact with these.\n\n249\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.310\nThe graphics,\nthe drill-through capabilities.\n\n250\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.290\nThese reports are incredibly\nwell structured.\n\n251\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.330\nThey really are.\n\n252\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.830\nAnd, so, if you haven't seen them before,\nyou definitely should go in.\n\n253\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.970\nYou should spend some time looking at\nthe different reports in here, and\n\n254\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.620\ninteract with them to get a better\nsense of what it is we can see, and\n\n255\n00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.170\nhow we can manage and break that down.\n\n256\n00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.950\nNow this is a very basic report,\n\n257\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.310\njust showing me what agents\nare installed by version.\n\n258\n00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.100\nYou could see the color\ncoding in the key here.\n\n259\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.790\nIt's the most recent version of the agent,\n\n260\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.000\nthe SCOM 2012 R2 agent,\nbased on build number.\n\n261\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.150\nWe could see the date range where\nwe have installed the agents.\n\n262\n00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.030\nRemember, we installed\nthe agents in our last episode.\n\n263\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.210\nSo we went through and\ndid that just to show you.\n\n264\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.410\nAnd we do have the number of agents\nyou can see right here, right?\n\n265\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.280\nThat random mystery floating number.\n\n266\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.781\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm like,\nthat's kind of strange, but okay.\n\n267\n00:11:57.781 --> 00:11:58.588\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just that's\n\n268\n00:11:58.588 --> 00:12:00.720\nthe number of agents that we see,\nthat's the actual breakdown.\n\n269\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.800\nSo we could see that all right here,\nright?\n\n270\n00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.700\nAnd we could see information about this,\nwhen this occurred, that kind of thing.\n\n271\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.770\nAnd notice down here at the right, it's\nkind of subtle, you see page one of one.\n\n272\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.110\nIf we had more pages it would tell us\nthis is page one of three or whatever,\n\n273\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.940\nand we could actually see that.\n\n274\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.014\nSo this report, very basic, but\ndoes really get the job done,\n\n275\n00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:19.356\njust tells us what we need.\n\n276\n00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:21.490\nYou'll notice also,\nwe can go through here.\n\n277\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.360\nWe can export out into\nmultiple data formats.\n\n278\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.340\nSo we can export out into XML.\n\n279\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.410\nWe can export out into comma-separated\nPDF, web archive, Excel, TIFF, and Word.\n\n280\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.250\nBy the way, for exams,\nlove to ask those kinds of questions.\n\n281\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.260\nHey, what are those seven or\neight export options we have for a report?\n\n282\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.810\nSo you can see all those different\noptions right here, right?\n\n283\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.370\nLeave them up on the screen for\na second so you can make note of them.\n\n284\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.580\nYou may wanna remember those, right?\n\n285\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.670\nThose may come in handy if you're\nplanning on taking the exam,\n\n286\n00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.100\ncuz they tend to ask those kind\nof questions every so often.\n\n287\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.370\nAnd it'd be good for you to know what\nthey are, and not have to drill through\n\n288\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.150\nloads of documentation trying to find\nthe answer to that question, right?\n\n289\n00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.470\nOr miss it, because you didn't know\nwhat it was, and you had to guess.\n\n290\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.090\nYou probably could guess some of the\nstandard ones, but you may miss some of\n\n291\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.780\nthose oddball ones that are sitting there,\nlike MHTML or something like that.\n\n292\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.720\nYou may not realize that.\n\n293\n00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.260\nSo we can export out into any of those,\nand then when we're done,\n\n294\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.390\nwe just close that out.\n\n295\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.860\nWe go back to what we're doing.\n\n296\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.540\nSo we have all the different capabilities\nthat we can interact with here.\n\n297\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.060\nWe're just gonna clean up our consoles\na little bit, get back to where we were.\n\n298\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.320\nSo inside here,\nin our resource pool membership,\n\n299\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.840\nwe have a very large number of\ncapabilities we can branch out and\n\n300\n00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.300\nstart interacting with, as we go through,\nand we'll take a look at various things.\n\n301\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.910\nSo that part hopefully makes a little bit\nmore sense to you, and makes it easier for\n\n302\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.410\nyou to find things.\n\n303\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.720\nWe've been talking about reporting.\n\n304\n00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.960\nLet's just look at the reporting\nworkspace here for a minute.\n\n305\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.530\nThis is where all of our\nreports are loaded up.\n\n306\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.630\nYou will see that we have folders for\nour various reports.\n\n307\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.340\nAnd if you start to work\nat the report folders, and\n\n308\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.910\nmap them back to management packs.\n\n309\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.180\nAnd I showed you where management packs\nare in the administration workspace in\n\n310\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.200\nthe last episode.\n\n311\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.290\nYou'll find that there is\na one-to-one correlation.\n\n312\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.340\nThese come in as part of management packs.\n\n313\n00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.220\nAnd when we import management packs, we\nimport all the management management pack\n\n314\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.990\nobjects, including reports\nthat are tied to them.\n\n315\n00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.970\nSo these reports are part of\nthe management pack infrastructure.\n\n316\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.000\nAnd we get them, and can interact with\nthem, based on them being available.\n\n317\n00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.810\nAnd then monitoring with management packs,\n\n318\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.540\ngenerating data that maps to\nthe fields in these these reports.\n\n319\n00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.780\nAnd that's how we use them.\n\n320\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.040\nTied up against the SSRS implementation.\n\n321\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.700\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n322\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.810\nBut we do have generic reports here.\n\n323\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.518\nWe do have specific ones\nto application monitoring,\n\n324\n00:14:22.518 --> 00:14:25.925\nclient monitoring,\nvarious things, SQL monitoring.\n\n325\n00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:29.715\nNetwork management reports, for\ninfrastructure we find on the network.\n\n326\n00:14:29.715 --> 00:14:31.605\nSystem Center core monitoring reports.\n\n327\n00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:35.145\nSo this shows us information\nabout System Center itself, and\n\n328\n00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:36.340\nthe monitoring that goes on.\n\n329\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.877\nAgent by health state, agent count dates,\n\n330\n00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:41.787\nthat report we just ran is one\nof the core monitoring ones.\n\n331\n00:14:41.787 --> 00:14:43.427\nSo, you know,\nif we look at agents by health state,\n\n332\n00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:46.497\nwe would see the report on\nthe three agents that are deployed,\n\n333\n00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:48.517\nor the two agents, rather,\nthat are actively deployed.\n\n334\n00:14:48.517 --> 00:14:49.957\nAnd we would see those.\n\n335\n00:14:49.957 --> 00:14:53.140\nAnd in some upcoming episodes,\nwe'll talk about web availability, or\n\n336\n00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.190\nweb application availability monitoring.\n\n337\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.780\nSo we'll talk about APM, and\nwe've got reports associated with that.\n\n338\n00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.590\nWe also have the ability to create\nour own reports, authored reports.\n\n339\n00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.500\nI said we can create our own, and\nput them in here, and load them up, so\n\n340\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.780\nwe do have that capability.\n\n341\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.660\nAnd we can mark certain\nreports as favorites.\n\n342\n00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.270\nOnes that we wanna have, and just have as,\nessentially, a standard view that we could\n\n343\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.570\nbring up out on the-\n&gt;&gt; Easy access.\n\n344\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.770\n&gt;&gt; Out of the box, so to speak.\n\n345\n00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.640\nYes, so it's very easy.\n\n346\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.090\nWe could also schedule reports to run.\n\n347\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.390\nSet up a task that runs them or executes\nthem, at a certain amount of interval, or\n\n348\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.500\nwhatever that would be.\n\n349\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.420\nSo we may have a, for instance,\nin the real world, we may have\n\n350\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.120\na senior-level decision maker, a more\nsenior manager, whatever the case may be.\n\n351\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.480\nMaybe a line of business owner,\nsomebody owns SQL or owns messaging or\n\n352\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.720\nwhatever the case is.\n\n353\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.855\nAnd they want metrics and data on health\nand status updates for meetings, or\n\n354\n00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:41.495\nwhatever they may need,\n\n355\n00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:43.705\nbased on their rhythm of how\nthey're managing with their team.\n\n356\n00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:47.475\nAnd they may come to you and say,\nhey, by the way, can you go ahead.\n\n357\n00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:49.825\nAnd can you give me this,\nor can I automate this,\n\n358\n00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:51.697\nor can I somehow get this data.\n\n359\n00:15:51.697 --> 00:15:52.217\nWell, absolutely.\n\n360\n00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:53.627\nWe could schedule these reports to run.\n\n361\n00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:56.490\nAnd we can even set them up as\na subscriber, and deliver those reports,\n\n362\n00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.695\nthen, via email if you want.\n\n363\n00:15:57.695 --> 00:15:59.861\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Super convenient.\n\n364\n00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:00.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It would be easy to do.\n\n365\n00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:01.337\nRelatively speaking.\n\n366\n00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:03.024\nSo we do have those kind of capabilities.\n\n367\n00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:04.351\nSo these reports are there\n\n368\n00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:05.500\n&gt;&gt; You've seen me run one or\n\n369\n00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.305\nmore of them and you have a sense\nof what would go on with them.\n\n370\n00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:09.818\nAuthoring is where we go in to\n\n371\n00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:12.786\nactually customize and\nbuild out our management pack.\n\n372\n00:16:12.786 --> 00:16:14.171\nSo we're gonna delve into this and\n\n373\n00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:16.668\ntake a look at this in just a moment,\nbut I'm gonna come back.\n\n374\n00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:18.433\nI wanna just jump to the monitoring piece,\n\n375\n00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:20.788\nshow you where the management\npacks actually operate and\n\n376\n00:16:20.788 --> 00:16:24.075\nthen we'll comeback and talk about the\nobjects and the components that allow us\n\n377\n00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:26.149\nto customize them and the trick them out.\nRemember,\n\n378\n00:16:26.149 --> 00:16:26.978\nwe talked about pimp my ride?\n\n379\n00:16:26.978 --> 00:16:27.667\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.116\n&gt;&gt; That whole idea, so we're gonna pimp\n\n381\n00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:31.589\nour management packs out a little bit.\nTricked them out and\n\n382\n00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:35.237\nshow you how to customize them, because\nthat is what we did or we talked about\n\n383\n00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:38.280\ntricking out one of our prior episodes.\nI was actually impressed that you had\n\n384\n00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.815\nseen that, you like remembered that.\nThat was kind of cool.\n\n385\n00:16:40.815 --> 00:16:42.687\nSo in the monitoring workspace, you can\n\n386\n00:16:42.687 --> 00:16:46.218\nsee up here, this is where we were going\nto see the output of the match packs.\n\n387\n00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:47.958\nWe have our standardized views and\n\n388\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:52.220\nthen we have management-specific or\nmanagement-pax specific views and object,\n\n389\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.872\nmonitors that can be used.\nSo we have an overall set of alerts,\n\n390\n00:16:55.872 --> 00:16:58.951\nactive alerts for the system.\nAny and all of the infrastructure\n\n391\n00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.954\nthat's being monitored.\nWe may see alerts here,\n\n392\n00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:04.272\nsee we've got some here for SQL Server.\nThere may be something going on with\n\n393\n00:17:04.272 --> 00:17:07.811\nthe database.\nThere's an OLE DB results error here for\n\n394\n00:17:07.811 --> 00:17:11.380\nour management server.\nThere was something that went on at some\n\n395\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.549\npoint.\nThere's a bunch of warnings here.\n\n396\n00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:15.568\nYou got four errors that are critical.\n\n397\n00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:17.333\nWe got a bunch of security warnings.\n\n398\n00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.199\nSo, there's just some different stuff that\n\n399\n00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:21.698\nwe may delve into.\nNow if we can go full screen here just for\n\n400\n00:17:21.698 --> 00:17:24.792\na minute, so you can see the detail.\nLet's just highlight one randomly.\n\n401\n00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:25.753\nIt doesn't matter what it is.\n\n402\n00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.397\nWhen we highlight an alert,\n\n403\n00:17:27.397 --> 00:17:30.711\nwe do down here as you can see.\nLet me bring this up just a little bit, so\n\n404\n00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.178\nyou can see that.\nWe do have alert details down here.\n\n405\n00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.169\nWe have the machine that it's coming from.\n\n406\n00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:37.921\nWe do have the full path name.\n\n407\n00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:39.826\nWe have the alert rule that generates\n\n408\n00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:41.731\nthe alert, so it tells us what it is,\n\n409\n00:17:41.731 --> 00:17:44.987\nwhere we get it from a little detail\nhere we can click through and\n\n410\n00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:48.200\nsee more of this if we need to.\nWe can view or edit the settings of this\n\n411\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.710\nrule, that's essentially what this alert\nrule link right here will let us do.\n\n412\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.030\nWe do have our standard tasks and actions.\n\n413\n00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.634\nWe do have the ability to subscribe and\n\n414\n00:17:56.634 --> 00:17:59.504\ncreate notifications around these alerts,\nwe talked about that.\n\n415\n00:17:59.504 --> 00:18:01.089\nIn fact, we can deliver those.\n\n416\n00:18:01.089 --> 00:18:03.563\nWe do have tasks associated with this and\n\n417\n00:18:03.563 --> 00:18:06.560\nyou can see there's a great\nnumber of them here.\n\n418\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.074\nThings like Computer Management, things\n\n419\n00:18:09.074 --> 00:18:13.661\nlike pinging, Remote Desktop Connectivity.\nSo if we wanted to go in, let's say,\n\n420\n00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:15.637\nto this machine.\nWe could click here,\n\n421\n00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:20.006\nComputer Management and you'll see that\nthat task, that health service task loads\n\n422\n00:18:20.006 --> 00:18:23.760\nup the Computer Manager, specifically for\nthe machine in question this\n\n423\n00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.550\nalert occurred on.\nAnd I'm able to go in in real-time and\n\n424\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.117\nsee the computer manager, and I can go in,\nand start to see, and interact with\n\n425\n00:18:30.117 --> 00:18:33.654\nservices, and data, and whatever I need.\nAnd if I have a remediation or\n\n426\n00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:38.101\nremitigation thought process, hey, I wanna\ngo check this see if this is working or\n\n427\n00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:40.590\nmaybe restart this service,\nwhatever it is.\n\n428\n00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.681\nI can do that right from here, so I can\n\n429\n00:18:42.681 --> 00:18:47.379\nactivate activity user engage and action.\nSo it'll allow me to actually remediate it\n\n430\n00:18:47.379 --> 00:18:50.717\nand fix this machine, if necessary.\nI can ping it right from here,\n\n431\n00:18:50.717 --> 00:18:53.881\nI can do all sorts of stuff.\nSo I have a very large number\n\n432\n00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:57.963\nof options available to me.\nI've got reports that are available here\n\n433\n00:18:57.963 --> 00:19:02.077\nas well, so I can run reports.\nAnd of course, I do as we saw have all my\n\n434\n00:19:02.077 --> 00:19:05.419\nviews and I can see those.\nI can also resolve the alerts,\n\n435\n00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:09.019\nlook at properties, so I could specify\nthat it wants to be closed out.\n\n436\n00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:11.128\nSet resolution state, remember I showed\n\n437\n00:19:11.128 --> 00:19:14.745\nyou we can customize those resolution\nstates in the admin workspace and\n\n438\n00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:17.583\nsettings to put in our own.\nSo we could resolve it here and\n\n439\n00:19:17.583 --> 00:19:21.218\nwe do have access to the health explorer\nas well, so we can drill through and\n\n440\n00:19:21.218 --> 00:19:25.128\nsee all of that from here.\nWe do have discovered inventory.\n\n441\n00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:25.759\nAs a view,\n\n442\n00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:30.682\nwe can see some information here around\nthe different items that are sitting here.\n\n443\n00:19:30.682 --> 00:19:33.767\nYou'll see our domain controller or\n\n444\n00:19:33.767 --> 00:19:39.449\nVMM and our system scan of assistant\ncenters of management server.\n\n445\n00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:40.659\nWe could see one of each and\n\n446\n00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:44.271\nwe could see these represented here.\nWe have the application monitoring.\n\n447\n00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:45.673\nWe do have many applications that\n\n448\n00:19:45.673 --> 00:19:48.355\nare monitored.\nWe'll be able to see them right here.\n\n449\n00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.751\nWe'll drill more into that in upcoming\n\n450\n00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:51.634\nepisodes.\nWe're not gonna worry too much about it\n\n451\n00:19:51.634 --> 00:19:54.495\nnow, but we could see our distributed\napps, so we could interact with them.\n\n452\n00:19:54.495 --> 00:19:55.632\nWe do have a task status.\n\n453\n00:19:55.632 --> 00:19:56.609\nYou remember I said,\n\n454\n00:19:56.609 --> 00:20:00.246\nif we closed out the task windows we were\ninstalling the agents, we could always\n\n455\n00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:03.398\nbring it back up go look at the task view.\nBe able to see it right from here and\n\n456\n00:20:03.398 --> 00:20:05.822\nto see what's going on with it.\nWe can bring it back up, and\n\n457\n00:20:05.822 --> 00:20:09.687\nsee the status of it, so we can do that.\nFor monitoring UNIX and Linux systems,\n\n458\n00:20:09.687 --> 00:20:12.777\nbe able to see those here.\nWindows computers, any of the ones we\n\n459\n00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:14.782\nwere monitoring, they will be here.\nWe'll\n\n460\n00:20:14.782 --> 00:20:17.810\nbe able to see health status on them.\nWe can see the name of the machines.\n\n461\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.501\nSo the instance right here,\n\n462\n00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:23.184\njust so we can see it.\nThe agent status, the agent is healthy.\n\n463\n00:20:23.184 --> 00:20:25.037\nThe management server, whether it's a good\n\n464\n00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:27.763\nfit or not, if we have a problem with it,\nif it's a status issue and\n\n465\n00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:30.101\nwhether we're monitoring.\nRight now, we don't have\n\n466\n00:20:30.101 --> 00:20:34.051\noperating system monitoring configured.\nI haven't turned it on, but you could see\n\n467\n00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:37.935\nthat the agent itself is reporting it as\nhealthy on the two machines that we had\n\n468\n00:20:37.935 --> 00:20:39.917\ndeployed it to in the prior episode.\nSo\n\n469\n00:20:39.917 --> 00:20:43.537\nwe do see that monitoring is happening in\nreal-time and interacting with it, but\n\n470\n00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:45.582\nwe would have to still go through and\nupdate and\n\n471\n00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:48.632\nconfigure operating system monitoring.\nI haven't turned that on or\n\n472\n00:20:48.632 --> 00:20:52.513\nspecified I want that occurring.\nSo it's showing up it's not monitored yet,\n\n473\n00:20:52.513 --> 00:20:55.444\nbut I could go in to anyone of\nthese highlight them as you\n\n474\n00:20:55.444 --> 00:20:59.657\ncan see there's the highlight here.\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of information here Adam\n\n475\n00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:04.279\nand I could see how this would be a useful\nindependent solution, but you like you've\n\n476\n00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:08.837\nmentioned previously, you could also pair\nthis with a full blown SNMP environment\n\n477\n00:21:08.837 --> 00:21:11.723\njust for extra information.\n&gt;&gt; If you were doing network monitoring,\n\n478\n00:21:11.723 --> 00:21:13.518\nyeah.\nYou may or may not want to monitor network\n\n479\n00:21:13.518 --> 00:21:16.391\ninfrastructure.\nBut if you did that specifically,\n\n480\n00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:21.017\nyou would get through SNMP monitoring\nprimarily, cuz you would really use\n\n481\n00:21:21.017 --> 00:21:25.057\nSNMP for network discovery for\nnontraditional operating system\n\n482\n00:21:25.057 --> 00:21:28.566\ninfrastructure like servers and devices.\nWe're thinking more\n\n483\n00:21:28.566 --> 00:21:29.703\nrouter switches-\n&gt;&gt; The hardware.\n\n484\n00:21:29.703 --> 00:21:30.364\n&gt;&gt; Your traditional network\n\n485\n00:21:30.364 --> 00:21:31.322\ninfrastructure, hardware.\nSo,\n\n486\n00:21:31.322 --> 00:21:34.374\nwe would get that information from there.\nSo, we definitely would add that in.\n\n487\n00:21:34.374 --> 00:21:36.299\nAnd if you remember in the prior episode,\n\n488\n00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:39.654\nwe did our discovery wizard to show\nyou different discovery options to do\n\n489\n00:21:39.654 --> 00:21:41.730\nthe agent deployment.\nOne of them was a network\n\n490\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.194\ndiscovery right at the bottom.\nWe would use SNMP to do that.\n\n491\n00:21:45.194 --> 00:21:46.721\nWe wouldn't traditionally use\n\n492\n00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:50.114\nSNMP discovery for Windows or Linux or\nLinux based operating systems,\n\n493\n00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:52.884\nbecause we can discover those\nbased on just the factors and\n\n494\n00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:55.370\nthe values of the operating\nsystem that's there and\n\n495\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.606\nthen we can install an agent as a result.\nIt's truly network infrastructure.\n\n496\n00:21:58.606 --> 00:22:00.345\nIt's what we would use that for.\n\n497\n00:22:00.345 --> 00:22:03.585\nSo you'll see here, we do have our\nalert view, diagram view, etc.\n\n498\n00:22:03.585 --> 00:22:06.143\nWe can launch our views right from here,\nas well.\n\n499\n00:22:06.143 --> 00:22:07.022\nSo, we have all of these.\n\n500\n00:22:07.022 --> 00:22:11.057\nNow if you look down here just open this,\nrather close this up.\n\n501\n00:22:11.057 --> 00:22:14.146\nAgain, these folders will line\nup to our management packs.\n\n502\n00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:16.171\nWe go back and\nstart looking in our reports,\n\n503\n00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:19.787\nbecause these are the actual outputs on\nthe objects that have been created from\n\n504\n00:22:19.787 --> 00:22:21.888\nmanagement packs and are represented here.\n\n505\n00:22:21.888 --> 00:22:24.974\nAnd our views and our activities,\nand our dashboards, and\n\n506\n00:22:24.974 --> 00:22:28.750\nall that kind of stuff are showing up\nhere based on our management packs.\n\n507\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.463\nAnd so as we open up operations manager,\nfor instance,\n\n508\n00:22:32.463 --> 00:22:36.816\nand we look at Management Group Health,\nwe bring up a dashboard.\n\n509\n00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:38.728\nWe can see information here.\n\n510\n00:22:38.728 --> 00:22:42.516\nThis is a dashboard view and\nwe can actually build this out, and\n\n511\n00:22:42.516 --> 00:22:46.952\nthis is gonna allow us to have different\nwidgets or functional panes, and\n\n512\n00:22:46.952 --> 00:22:50.331\nthen we can decide how many of\nthose we put on the screen.\n\n513\n00:22:50.331 --> 00:22:53.751\nIf we have a columnar view, we can have up\nto five columns per dashboard, I think.\n\n514\n00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:56.487\nStraight up and\ndown like this going vertically.\n\n515\n00:22:56.487 --> 00:22:59.378\nIf we have a dashboard view like this one,\nwe have widgets.\n\n516\n00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:03.577\nWe have up to nine widgets on a page in\neach one of those rectangular areas or\n\n517\n00:23:03.577 --> 00:23:06.288\nboxes represents a widget\nthat we program in and\n\n518\n00:23:06.288 --> 00:23:08.758\nit has functionality associated with it.\n\n519\n00:23:08.758 --> 00:23:12.341\nAnd so we can see we have group function,\ngroup infrastructure,\n\n520\n00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:13.915\nhealth monitoring alerts.\n\n521\n00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:18.100\nThis is what a sample dashboard may\nlook like when we look at trending, for\n\n522\n00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.192\ninstance, here.\n\n523\n00:23:19.192 --> 00:23:22.223\nIf we have any trend data,\nwe would see it represented here again.\n\n524\n00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:25.639\nWe haven't really been running that long,\nbut we get some basic trend data.\n\n525\n00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:28.715\nYou will see here,\nwe have again, using widgets.\n\n526\n00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:31.807\nWe have our ability to be able\nto look at our trending and\n\n527\n00:23:31.807 --> 00:23:34.440\nwe can see that we have\nour agent health state.\n\n528\n00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.551\nHow we can see we have a little key down\nhere that tells us what we're looking at\n\n529\n00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:41.348\nbased on color, so\nwe can see all that kind of stuff.\n\n530\n00:23:41.348 --> 00:23:42.747\nSo, these are dashboard views.\n\n531\n00:23:42.747 --> 00:23:45.096\nThese also come in as part\nof the management pack.\n\n532\n00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:48.231\nWe have all sorts of different\ncomponents for the management pack.\n\n533\n00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.049\nSo, lets go back.\n\n534\n00:23:49.049 --> 00:23:50.529\nLets take a look at management packs.\n\n535\n00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.791\nAnd once we see what these\nobjects look like, we said,\n\n536\n00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:56.300\nwe'd drill in on the authoring area after\nwe just showed you some examples of these.\n\n537\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.266\nSo, lets go back.\n\n538\n00:23:57.266 --> 00:24:01.693\nWe'll take a look and we'll start at the\nbottom here in the authoring area with our\n\n539\n00:24:01.693 --> 00:24:03.183\nmanagement pack objects.\n\n540\n00:24:03.183 --> 00:24:06.777\nWe can see them listed here and\nwe'll go through them in just a second.\n\n541\n00:24:06.777 --> 00:24:10.815\nWe also up here have our\nmanagement pack templates.\n\n542\n00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:14.076\nPre configure templates to bring\nthese objects together, and\n\n543\n00:24:14.076 --> 00:24:17.407\nthat we can then deploy an instance\nof to do something specific.\n\n544\n00:24:17.407 --> 00:24:21.230\nLike doing a .NET application monitor,\nwith APM, with advanced performance\n\n545\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.910\nmonitoring for an application,\napplication performance monitoring.\n\n546\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.665\nAnd we're gonna see how to do\nthat in some upcoming episodes.\n\n547\n00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:30.224\nSo that's actually gonna be\nkind of a additional add-on for\n\n548\n00:24:30.224 --> 00:24:32.260\nthe conversation we're having.\n\n549\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.785\nWe'll do some other stuff there.\n\n550\n00:24:33.785 --> 00:24:35.760\nBut let's look at our\nmanagement pack objects.\n\n551\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.930\nSo if we scroll down we'll see\nthat under management pack object,\n\n552\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.180\nlet's just highlight this.\n\n553\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.383\nWe could see the most are here,\n\n554\n00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:44.641\nit's a little bit easier to see them when\nwe're looking at them in the center pane.\n\n555\n00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:47.124\nWe could see attributes,\nwe could see monitors,\n\n556\n00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:51.205\nwe can see object discoveries, overrides,\nrules, service-level tracking,\n\n557\n00:24:51.205 --> 00:24:54.750\nthat weeds us back in to service manager\nwith our SLA, so we could create\n\n558\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.160\nour escalation pathways and manage our\nexpectations around service delivery.\n\n559\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.430\nWe have tasks and we have views.\n\n560\n00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.720\nYou have been seeing a lot of views.\n\n561\n00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.570\nYou've certainly seen tasks.\n\n562\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.739\nWe've shown you indirectly what rules are.\n\n563\n00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:07.710\nWe've shown you object discovery.\n\n564\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.600\nI've shown you the output in monitors.\n\n565\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.880\nAnd we've taken a look at\nattributes by using those things.\n\n566\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.770\nSo we actually have seen most, if not all,\nof these objects and these attributes.\n\n567\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.340\nExcuse me, these management pack objects,\nand the attributes associated with them,\n\n568\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.220\nin play, as we've been looking at\nsome of the dashboards and views.\n\n569\n00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.280\nBut lets just talk a little bit more\nabout what each one of these are.\n\n570\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.190\nWhen we do object discovery, and\n\n571\n00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.590\nwe use management packs to be able\nto monitor the objects we discover.\n\n572\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.790\nWe use three methods for discovery,\nwe use the registry so we can look at\n\n573\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.268\nthe registry of the system that's targeted\nprofile settings that are there so\n\n574\n00:25:38.268 --> 00:25:42.008\nlook for a key that says, the software is\ninstalled, that the setting is turned on,\n\n575\n00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:43.297\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n576\n00:25:43.297 --> 00:25:46.780\nThat's our prefered option, because\nthat is the least amount of CPU and\n\n577\n00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.945\nRAM requirements on terms of overhead and\nstress on the machine.\n\n578\n00:25:49.945 --> 00:25:53.545\nSo it's a very low impact way to\nunderstand and profile what's there for\n\n579\n00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:55.495\nthe management pack to do its job.\n\n580\n00:25:55.495 --> 00:25:59.100\nWe can also use WMI, so\nwhen is management instrumentation, WQL,\n\n581\n00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.276\nthe Windows management\ninstrumentation query language.\n\n582\n00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:06.765\nWe can use WQL to be able to send\nqueries to the box, run through them and\n\n583\n00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:08.925\nunderstand what's there.\n\n584\n00:26:08.925 --> 00:26:09.825\nSo we can do that.\n\n585\n00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:11.190\nOr we can use scripts.\n\n586\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.830\nSo these are the ways we\nactually do discovery.\n\n587\n00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.690\nWe can find information that the\nmanagement packs will then be able to use\n\n588\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.120\nin order to be able to monitor.\n\n589\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.410\nWe then need management pack rules,\nas in these things sitting right here,\n\n590\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.720\nare because these things are used\nto structure the outcomes.\n\n591\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.940\nThe rules are the set of operational\ninstructions that tell management packs\n\n592\n00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.580\nwhat to do, how to do it,\nand in what order and\n\n593\n00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.870\nwith what specificity they should\npull these other components in.\n\n594\n00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.290\nSo we have three types of rules.\n\n595\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.462\nWe have alert generating rules,\n\n596\n00:26:38.462 --> 00:26:42.272\nwe have collection rules and\nwe have timed command rules.\n\n597\n00:26:42.272 --> 00:26:45.013\nAlert generating rules,\nprobably guess what those do, right?\n\n598\n00:26:45.013 --> 00:26:46.770\n&gt;&gt; Sounds pretty straightforward.\n&gt;&gt; They are based on the current events,\n\n599\n00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.290\nso something happens, they generate\nan alert based on Cherokee's saying that\n\n600\n00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.929\nshe's gonna take a break and\ngo walk away from the console.\n\n601\n00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:56.162\nThat's her case, then if that's\nthe case rather generate an alert, or\n\n602\n00:26:56.162 --> 00:26:58.282\ninactivity for\na certain amount of minutes, or\n\n603\n00:26:58.282 --> 00:27:02.040\nyou reach a certain threshold with free\nspace, or whatever the case may be.\n\n604\n00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.600\nThat event will generate an alert.\n\n605\n00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.503\nCollection rules collect and\nstore data used for reports.\n\n606\n00:27:06.503 --> 00:27:08.264\nSo, they're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; How long,\n\n607\n00:27:08.264 --> 00:27:09.960\nwhere to store them kinda thing.\n\n608\n00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.812\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely all that kind of stuff.\n\n609\n00:27:10.812 --> 00:27:15.535\nThey'll performance base for things like\nSMP, WMI, one is performance counters for\n\n610\n00:27:15.535 --> 00:27:17.890\nperf mon, whatever the case may be.\n\n611\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.248\nThey are used to create among other\nthings capacity planning reports.\n\n612\n00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:24.730\nWe have a whole section of reports\nthat help us do capacity planning.\n\n613\n00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.478\nWe also have pro based so a performance\nbased and pro based collections.\n\n614\n00:27:28.478 --> 00:27:32.019\nPro based will let us collect\ndatabase on scripts or Unix shell or\n\n615\n00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:33.340\nLinux shell commands.\n\n616\n00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:38.060\nSo pro based are typically used on Linux\nprimarily Linux Unix, and the performance\n\n617\n00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.188\nbased on the ones used primarily on\nWindows when we do collection based.\n\n618\n00:27:42.188 --> 00:27:44.605\nAnd then time command\nare gonna run commands.\n\n619\n00:27:44.605 --> 00:27:46.049\nSay you run this batch file.\n\n620\n00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:48.143\nExecute the script,\nwhatever the case may be and\n\n621\n00:27:48.143 --> 00:27:50.250\ndo something based on\nthe rule specifying that.\n\n622\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:50.876\nSo we're gonna be able to do all that.\n\n623\n00:27:50.876 --> 00:27:55.360\nWe have our monitors,\nthey're sitting up there towards the top.\n\n624\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.712\nThe monitors are really the engine that\ndrives everything we do in the management\n\n625\n00:27:59.712 --> 00:28:00.228\npaacks.\n\n626\n00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:02.540\nThey show the health state of\nthe application or object, so\n\n627\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.511\nthey're gonna be programmed in,\njust highlight those so you can see them.\n\n628\n00:28:05.511 --> 00:28:07.360\nThey're programmed in.\n\n629\n00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.898\nSo that we can go in and\nwe can aggregate data with a monitor.\n\n630\n00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:14.670\nWe can go in and we can, depending on the\nhealth state we're monitoring, the type.\n\n631\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.190\nWe have two states or two types.\n\n632\n00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.933\nWe have a two state or\na three state health monitor.\n\n633\n00:28:18.933 --> 00:28:20.850\nTwo state is gonna be green or red.\n\n634\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.610\nThink about like stop at KPIs, right?\n\n635\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.030\nSo green, yellow, red, like sometimes\nalso called rag, red, amber, green.\n\n636\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.320\nSo if you hear rag shard, if you hear\nstop like KPIs, they refer to the same\n\n637\n00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.040\nthing depending on the methodology and\nthe monitoring software you're using.\n\n638\n00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.220\nBut we just talk about a two state versus\na three state health monitor and scam.\n\n639\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.602\nTwo state is red green, either it's\nhealthy or it's in alert state,\n\n640\n00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:43.876\nthere's no one between.\n\n641\n00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:46.480\nThird state of free state would be red,\nyellow, green, right?\n\n642\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.220\nAnd so three state, green,\nhealthy yellow, warning.\n\n643\n00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.204\nYou've seen that on some of the console\nviews we've shown you and red, critical.\n\n644\n00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:53.860\nSo we would have that either way.\n\n645\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.402\nThat's what the monitors are.\n\n646\n00:28:54.402 --> 00:28:58.886\nWe do collect both rules and monitors\ncollect data but we just use it and\n\n647\n00:28:58.886 --> 00:29:02.620\ninteract with it differently\nbased on what we're doing.\n\n648\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.240\nSo we have the monitors there.\n\n649\n00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.530\nThee types of monitors that\nwe use inside of SCOM.\n\n650\n00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.120\nLet's talk about what\nthose are real quick.\n\n651\n00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.640\nWe have our unit monitors.\n\n652\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.620\nAs a matter of fact,\nif we go back to the console,\n\n653\n00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.480\nI can probably just show\nyou this real quick.\n\n654\n00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.010\nWe have our create a monitor here and\n\n655\n00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.770\nyou'll see we have our\nthree monitor types.\n\n656\n00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:20.795\nWe'll just describe them\nwhile we're talking.\n\n657\n00:29:20.795 --> 00:29:23.890\nMaybe if we go full screen it may\nbe easier to see cuz I can see.\n\n658\n00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.880\nYou're squinting trying to\nsee them on the screen.\n\n659\n00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.664\nThey're kind of hard on\nthe white on white background.\n\n660\n00:29:27.664 --> 00:29:28.990\nIt's really hard to tell what they are.\n\n661\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.717\nBut I'll describe them to you,\nwe have unit monitor up at the top,\n\n662\n00:29:31.717 --> 00:29:34.690\nwe have dependency roll up monitor,\nwe have aggregate roll up monitor,\n\n663\n00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.222\nlet's talk about each one of these.\n\n664\n00:29:36.222 --> 00:29:39.758\nSo we have unit monitors,\nthese monitor specific counters,\n\n665\n00:29:39.758 --> 00:29:41.740\nevent script services, etc.\n\n666\n00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.750\nThese generate alerts, right, these\nare the ones we use to generate alerts.\n\n667\n00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.550\nWe have our, whats next up dependency.\n\n668\n00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.490\nWe have our dependency roll up monitors.\n\n669\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.410\nThey, like the name implies, they roll up\nthe health monitoring that's being done\n\n670\n00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.110\nfor objects that are linked\nby some sort of relationship.\n\n671\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.060\nSo if we have a dependency where\nwe have a primary system, and\n\n672\n00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.390\nthen a secondary system we could roll\nthat up and see the hierarchy and\n\n673\n00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.810\nthe health states associated with them.\n\n674\n00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:08.700\nAnd then aggregate roll up monitors,\nremember dependency rollup dependency\n\n675\n00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.840\nrollup rolls up dependencies and\nmonitors accordingly.\n\n676\n00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.914\nAggregate rollups shows the health excuse\nme shows the health state of objects or\n\n677\n00:30:16.914 --> 00:30:20.420\nother monitors that\nare targeted add-in object.\n\n678\n00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.540\nAnd we have four specific levels there.\n\n679\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.951\nWe have availability, we have\nconfiguration we have performance and\n\n680\n00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:26.887\nwe have security.\n\n681\n00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:31.510\nSo we have these different levels and\nways of monitoring within these monitors.\n\n682\n00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.850\nAnd we have the ability\nto program in one or\n\n683\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.730\nmore of these by clicking and\ncreating a specific one.\n\n684\n00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.134\nJust before Cherokee asked her question,\n\n685\n00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:42.357\ncuz I know she has something she\nwants to ask about or clarify for us.\n\n686\n00:30:42.357 --> 00:30:45.770\nJust before she does,I'm gonna\njust show you one quick thing.\n\n687\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.320\nSo when we talk about different discovery\ntypes with monitors, if we open up here,\n\n688\n00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.100\nyou'll see under Entity Health, I'm\ngonna just show you what they look like.\n\n689\n00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.913\nWe're not gonna create one but\njust so you can see.\n\n690\n00:30:55.913 --> 00:30:59.410\nYou'll see that we have\ndifferent kinds of monitors.\n\n691\n00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.598\nThese are aggregate rollups, and\nyou could see they're represented here.\n\n692\n00:31:02.598 --> 00:31:04.044\nAnd when we open one of these up,\n\n693\n00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:06.520\nyou'll see we may have\nsomething underneath nested.\n\n694\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.940\nWe have a dependency rollup.\n\n695\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.050\nFor instance in here under the aggregate.\n\n696\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.920\nAnd so we have different\ntypes that can be nested and\n\n697\n00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.380\nstacked inside of each other\nto generate the monitoring and\n\n698\n00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.700\nultimately the capabilities that we\nneed to then report out on data.\n\n699\n00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.310\nSo Cherokee I know you\nwanted to ask something.\n\n700\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.183\nI just wanted to show you that.\n\n701\n00:31:21.183 --> 00:31:22.176\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yeah, looking at that,\n\n702\n00:31:22.176 --> 00:31:23.399\nI think it makes a little\nbit more sense here.\n\n703\n00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:26.955\nBecause in my mind, my train of\nthought there was, what are we doing?\n\n704\n00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:28.645\nAre we just zooming out and\n\n705\n00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:33.615\ngetting more of an overview report than\njust looking at these individual items?\n\n706\n00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:36.405\nAnd that's kind of what you just\nshowed us there by drilling down and\n\n707\n00:31:36.405 --> 00:31:38.385\nshowing those dependencies, so.\n\n708\n00:31:38.385 --> 00:31:41.700\n&gt;&gt; So you could see that's a stack nature,\nso to speak, of how things interact.\n\n709\n00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.485\nAnd it is a little confusing sometimes,\n\n710\n00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:46.685\nunless you go in and actually take\na look and visually as you point it out,\n\n711\n00:31:46.685 --> 00:31:49.939\nit makes a lot more more sense when you\nsee it in the console than when we just\n\n712\n00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:53.350\ndescribe it as a group of disembodied\nthings that may or may not roll up, may or\n\n713\n00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.539\nmay not connect, and you don't\nreally know if they're even related.\n\n714\n00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:59.289\nBut as you start to put them all together,\nyou could see how they do.\n\n715\n00:31:59.289 --> 00:32:03.412\nNow, you know, the art and science of\nthis, is what goes into the building\n\n716\n00:32:03.412 --> 00:32:07.286\nmanagement packs, right and\nThis is the difficulty with using SCOM.\n\n717\n00:32:07.286 --> 00:32:09.844\nYou'll hear these urban myths and\nlegends about SCOM,\n\n718\n00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:12.760\nthat it's an incredibly\ndifficult product to deploy.\n\n719\n00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.440\nNot the case at all.\n\n720\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.050\nYou've seen it's really easy to deploy.\n\n721\n00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.370\nYou could stand up a SCOM\ninstall in under an hour.\n\n722\n00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.990\nI mean and then get it running,\nit's not a big deal at all.\n\n723\n00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.200\nAnd we've shown you how\nto do that in an episode.\n\n724\n00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.965\nRight, it didn't take very long if you\nwatched the episode, you could see it took\n\n725\n00:32:23.965 --> 00:32:26.370\na very very short amount of time to\nstand the thing up and get it working.\n\n726\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.650\nIt's not complicated.\n\n727\n00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.700\nYet people often maintain it is,\ncuz they just don't really understand it.\n\n728\n00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.840\nAnd they'll tell you,\nit's impossible to set this thing up and\n\n729\n00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.870\nget the management packs installed and\ntune them.\n\n730\n00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:36.520\nQuite the opposite.\n\n731\n00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.610\nInstalling management packs,\nvery very simple.\n\n732\n00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.100\nImporting them, five seconds, ten seconds,\na minute to go out and import them.\n\n733\n00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.310\nNot hard to do at all.\n\n734\n00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.850\nThe part that is accurate about them,\nin the sense that it is a little bit\n\n735\n00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.860\ndifficult, is doing the fine\ntuning on these management packs,\n\n736\n00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.130\nto set up these dependency relationships.\n\n737\n00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.230\nIf you're gonna build your own,\n\n738\n00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.450\nthe trick is if you use the off\nthe shelf management packs, right?\n\n739\n00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.370\nAnd you understand that most of\nwhat you wanna monitor, is probably\n\n740\n00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.490\nalready built in a management pack, either\nfrom Microsoft or a third party provider.\n\n741\n00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.040\nAnd you download those and\nstart with those.\n\n742\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.040\nAnd then, instead of building your own\nmanagement packs, you create overrides\n\n743\n00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.290\non the vendor management packs,\nto specifically tailor for\n\n744\n00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:18.420\nyour user needs or your specific needs,\nthe localization that you're looking for.\n\n745\n00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.700\nBoy, is that so\nmuch easier than starting from scratch and\n\n746\n00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.100\nhaving to build this whole thing out.\n\n747\n00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.440\nBecause it gives you 90% of what you need.\n\n748\n00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.330\nAnd then all you have to do is, go and\nthen override the settings that are unique\n\n749\n00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.770\nto your environment,\nthat you wanna tweak or modify.\n\n750\n00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.960\nAnd that really is where\npeople misrepresent or\n\n751\n00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.670\nmiss the boat,\nif we use that analogy, right.\n\n752\n00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.880\nOn the idea of SCOM and\nhow difficult it can be,\n\n753\n00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.600\nI've spent a lot of time with customers\nhelping them understand this and\n\n754\n00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.390\nsetting this up and\nit's not very difficult.\n\n755\n00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.600\nAnd they're surprised how easy it winds\nup being, when I walk them through it and\n\n756\n00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.220\nthey understand the logic\nas you were saying,\n\n757\n00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.160\nof how all these things inter-relate.\n\n758\n00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.215\nTo that end, we're wrapping up\n\n759\n00:33:52.215 --> 00:33:53.700\ncuz I know you're about to tell me-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n760\n00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.040\n&gt;&gt; That we are close to finishing up.\n\n761\n00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.866\nWe're actually already over time for\nthis episode.\n\n762\n00:33:56.866 --> 00:33:59.550\nBut I, just on the steam,\nwanna show you one thing if we could.\n\n763\n00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.290\nJust go back here.\n\n764\n00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.070\nI've already shown you this interactivity.\n\n765\n00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.960\nWhat I didn't show you, and I wanna\nshow you right now, is the following.\n\n766\n00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.438\nIf I can find.\n\n767\n00:34:08.438 --> 00:34:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Can you read them?\n\n768\n00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I can find the one that we want.\n\n769\n00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:14.170\nWe already did preparing,\nImplementing User Roles.\n\n770\n00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.580\nUsing, we'll come back,\ntake a look at that.\n\n771\n00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.670\nThat's the one I want right there.\n\n772\n00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.340\nWe'll go back and take a look at some\nof those other ones in another episode,\n\n773\n00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.120\nwe'll show you those things.\n\n774\n00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.840\nBut lot of times I get asked,\n\n775\n00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.298\nhey is there an authoritative list\nof management packs our there?\n\n776\n00:34:24.298 --> 00:34:27.250\nI've been saying, well just go get them,\nand that's half the battle right there.\n\n777\n00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.650\nJust download the ones that are there,\nabsolutely.\n\n778\n00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.870\nMicrosoft maintains an authoritative\nlist on TechNet, you could see it there,\n\n779\n00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.660\nthis URL is in the show notes for you.\n\n780\n00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.970\nOf all the management packs that Microsoft\nputs out, that are currently available,\n\n781\n00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.010\nthis lists gets updated\non a regular basis.\n\n782\n00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.564\nYou can go to it and\nsee the current build versions.\n\n783\n00:34:42.564 --> 00:34:45.690\nThird-party management packs,\nnot gonna find them here, but\n\n784\n00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.030\nwe do have another list for you.\n\n785\n00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.640\nAnd we'll put that in the show notes as\nwell, so you can actually find those.\n\n786\n00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.120\nPretty good site out there that does\nmaintain an overview of the majority of\n\n787\n00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.080\nthe third party management packs,\nso this is where you would go.\n\n788\n00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.820\nYou can download any of them and\nwhen you do download them, you'll find,\n\n789\n00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.440\njust click here,\nit goes to the Microsoft download site.\n\n790\n00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.070\nYou download the appropriate file.\n\n791\n00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.060\nIt's usually an MSI that\nyou will just extract.\n\n792\n00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.903\nYou'll install.\n\n793\n00:35:07.903 --> 00:35:11.250\nWhen you open it up, there are gonna\nbe either one or more .mp files,\n\n794\n00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.585\nwhich are the text files essentially, that\nmake up the management pack configuration,\n\n795\n00:35:15.585 --> 00:35:16.960\nif they're sealed.\n\n796\n00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:22.510\nOr a .mpb, a management pack bundle file,\nwhich bundles other software and\n\n797\n00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.600\nnecessary supporting dependencies\nwith the management pack.\n\n798\n00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.103\nYou will then, when you go into the\nconsole, to actually do your importation,\n\n799\n00:35:29.103 --> 00:35:32.473\nyou will go here, you'll go to\nManagement Packs, under Administration.\n\n800\n00:35:32.473 --> 00:35:37.690\nSo let's come back over here,\nand we'll go right up here.\n\n801\n00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.190\nGo to Management Packs.\n\n802\n00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:41.960\nWe'll right click, and\nwe'll import Management Packs,\n\n803\n00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.800\nhaving downloaded one or more.\n\n804\n00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.720\nAnd we can add them either from the\ncatalog, this option lets you go out and\n\n805\n00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.970\ndirectly surf that catalog essentially,\nand\n\n806\n00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.830\ndownload them directly from online,\nif you have an internet connection.\n\n807\n00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.010\nIf not, if you've downloaded them,\nblow them out, install them and\n\n808\n00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.360\nhave them sitting in a folder.\n\n809\n00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.580\nJust do it from disk,\ngrab those files, import them, and\n\n810\n00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.450\nyou add them into the catalog,\nand then they are in there.\n\n811\n00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.160\nAnd that takes literally\na couple of minutes,\n\n812\n00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.870\ndepending on how big\nthe management packs are.\n\n813\n00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.700\nAnd once you've done that,\n\n814\n00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.350\nyou have them all available to you then\nas we've been talking about, you go and\n\n815\n00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:10.890\nyou work with them.\n\n816\n00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.050\nBut importing them is\nnothing more than that.\n\n817\n00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.480\nWhen people tell you it's more\ncomplicated, they're lying to you.\n\n818\n00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.960\nAnd now you know differently,\n\n819\n00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.270\ncuz you've seen that it doesn't\nreally take that long at all.\n\n820\n00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.160\nThe trick, and as I said the magic,\n\n821\n00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.410\nis understanding the structure of\nthe management packs you're downloading.\n\n822\n00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.440\nRead that documentation\nthat comes with it.\n\n823\n00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.880\nKnow what those monitors are,\nunderstand how to deploy them.\n\n824\n00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.810\nAnd then start thinking about\nhow you're gonna override them,\n\n825\n00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.200\nto create the specificity, the uniqueness\nthat Cherokee was talking about,\n\n826\n00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.380\nthat is important in your environment.\n\n827\n00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.620\nCuz that's really what you need to do.\n\n828\n00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.700\nAnd that's how you fine-tune SCOM.\n\n829\n00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.450\nAnd that's really,\n\n830\n00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.280\nat the end of the day, what makes\nthis a powerful product for you.\n\n831\n00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.378\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam, well,\nthat was the end of, what?\n\n832\n00:36:46.378 --> 00:36:49.540\nWe were at part three, so I think we\nhave a part four headed your way.\n\n833\n00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.690\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n834\n00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.840\nBut for this show, we are out of time,\nso we'll go ahead and wrap things up.\n\n835\n00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.340\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n836\n00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.475\n&gt;&gt; I'm not Cherokee Boose,\nbut I am Adam Gordon.\n\n837\n00:36:58.475 --> 00:37:00.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] See you next\ntime here at ITProTV.\n\n838\n00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:01.082\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n839\n00:37:01.082 --> 00:37:09.883\n[MUSIC]\n\n840\n00:37:09.883 --> 00:37:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.518\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:13.565\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen,\n\n5\n00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:16.335\nto your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.585\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:22.385\nIn this episode, we will continue to look\nat monitoring cloud based applications.\n\n8\n00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:25.568\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.362\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we're gonna keep going.\n\n11\n00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:31.405\nI am a man of few words,\n\n12\n00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.575\nexcept when I'm talking about SCOM,\nin which case, you can't shut me up.\n\n13\n00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:34.595\nSo that's just how it works.\n\n14\n00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:36.345\nSo we're gonna continue\ntalking about SCOM.\n\n15\n00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:37.670\nWe are on part four.\n\n16\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.360\nAnd part four means well, we've done three\nparts and we have more to talk about, so\n\n17\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.950\nthat's why we're gonna do part four.\n\n18\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.370\nSo we have up until now been\ntalking about the architecture.\n\n19\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.980\nWe've talked about how to deploy agents,\nhow to set up monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.005\nWe've taken a look at all\nthe different workspacec in SCOM.\n\n21\n00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.965\nExamine some of the in-depth features\nin areas that are of value to us.\n\n22\n00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.035\nTook a look at all\nthe administration settings.\n\n23\n00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:01.455\nShowed you how to toggle\non manual agent deployment\n\n24\n00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:04.075\nactivities that we could accept\nmanual agent deployments.\n\n25\n00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:06.775\nShowed you how to deploy an agent\nfrom a console push into discovery.\n\n26\n00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.993\nWe're gonna revisit discovery,\n\n27\n00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:11.125\ntalk about network discovery a little\nbit more in depth here in a few minutes.\n\n28\n00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.015\nWe've talked about run as account types,\nand roles, and\n\n29\n00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.390\ntasks and out of all the discussion\non monitoring and management packs.\n\n30\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.630\nAnd in our last episode\nwhere all the objects are,\n\n31\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.220\nthat make them up, how you import them,\nwhere to find them on the web.\n\n32\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.525\nWe've covered quite a bit of ground\nwith you on this product but\n\n33\n00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:26.625\nwe still have a lot left to do.\n\n34\n00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:30.375\nAnd so what I want to do is stack up some\nof that information on the web that we try\n\n35\n00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.500\nto show you.\n\n36\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070\nAnd go through, show you some of\nthose webpage will be valuable to you\n\n37\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.380\nto get you up to speed on\nall things we've covered.\n\n38\n00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.730\nAnd then I wanna jump back in,\n\n39\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.920\nI wanna show you a little bit on Run S\naccounts and how we set them up.\n\n40\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.000\nUse them for\nnetwork discovery among other things.\n\n41\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.630\nAnd we'll talk about some\nother cool that Areas.\n\n42\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.770\nSo we could go back in, we'll take a look.\n\n43\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.050\nGot some webpages that I\nwanted to show you here.\n\n44\n00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.200\nWe talked about prepping the environment\nfor the SCOM 2012 R2 install.\n\n45\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.710\nBut there's actually guidance on all\nthe things that we've talked about,\n\n46\n00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.385\nand how you make those choices.\n\n47\n00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.655\nDo we need a gateway server?\n\n48\n00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:01.485\nIf so, in what conditions?\n\n49\n00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:03.655\nHow do I know where my\nagents are gonna be?\n\n50\n00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.225\nAnd how I'm gonna manage them?\n\n51\n00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.275\nHow many management servers do I need?\n\n52\n00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.910\nDo I have the right scalability and\nthe right amount of resources\n\n53\n00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.730\nit was a lot of information you\ngotta think about and plan for.\n\n54\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.090\nAnd to that end, not only plan for\nthe stuff that's on here.\n\n55\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590\nBut there is a planning spreadsheet that\nyou can use to actually do scalability.\n\n56\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.930\nAnd actually lay out,\nwith your specificity, say, hey,\n\n57\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.280\nI've got this many servers.\n\n58\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.970\nI need this much data, I'm gonna have this\nkinda stuff, I'm monitoring this amount.\n\n59\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.840\nWhat does my architecture look like?\n\n60\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.140\nAnd it will spit out a result\n\n61\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.940\nTell you I need these management\nservers configured this way.\n\n62\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.450\nSo we'll talk about how to get that or\n\n63\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.250\nwhere you can find that it's a little\nmisleading sometimes cuz the link on\n\n64\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.480\nthe page here unfortunately doesn't take\nyou to download the spreadsheet anymore.\n\n65\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.610\nIt used to but\nMicrosoft moves it around every so\n\n66\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.640\noften and it's sometimes hard to find.\n\n67\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.930\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll actually\nmake sure we provide a copy of that\n\n68\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920\nspreadsheet to you in the show notes so\nthat you can actually grab it if you want.\n\n69\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.220\nWe also have it attached to our 10964,\nSCOM and\n\n70\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.120\ndata center monitoring of private cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.900\nShows that we've done, we actually\nhave that as part of one of the show\n\n72\n00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.890\nartifacts that we created for you, so\nyou can get it from there as well.\n\n73\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.400\nBut you'll wanna take\na look at that spreadsheet,\n\n74\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.980\njust to make sure that you understand\nhow to do scalability planning.\n\n75\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.400\nSo this website will help you, getting\nall the things up that you need to know.\n\n76\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.620\nWhat are the prereqs here?\n\n77\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.090\nSo how do we scale this up?\n\n78\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.770\nWhat kind of OS's do we need?\n\n79\n00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.840\nService packs, background related stuff,\n.NET framework, whatever the case may be.\n\n80\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.710\nSo we go through all that,\n\n81\n00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.790\nand you can see here as you scroll down\nthe nav bar what's virtualization,\n\n82\n00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.780\ncan we, not what is virtualization,\nI know you know what virtualization is.\n\n83\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.020\nBut can we visualize this product install?\n\n84\n00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.150\nAbsolutely, resolution requirements,\nminimum hardware,\n\n85\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.830\nOS, what backend SQL servers do we need?\n\n86\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.780\nWhat are requirements for features?\n\n87\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.330\nWhat do we install with what.\n\n88\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.150\nHow do we install things in what order or\nthings like that.\n\n89\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.960\nWe can go through and\nsee all the stuff here.\n\n90\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.580\nSo this website is gonna be very\nhelpful to you to setup and\n\n91\n00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.660\nconfigure everything that you need and\nall the requirement.\n\n92\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.860\nSo for instance, one thing that I show and\nI often talk about, there is a tremendous\n\n93\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.320\namount of firewall related\ncommunication that has been managed.\n\n94\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.360\nBetween System Center Ops Management\nServers and things like the databases,\n\n95\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.756\nthe console, the gateway, and\nall the component moving parts.\n\n96\n00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:16.520\nAnd if you go back and\nlook at our architecture diagram,\n\n97\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.370\nyou can imaging sitting here behind\nthe firewall with the management servers.\n\n98\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.370\nWe have to worry not so\nmuch about the database\n\n99\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.600\ncapabilities of the communication, because\nthat is all going to take place internal.\n\n100\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.050\nMost likely without a firewall,\n\n101\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.670\nbut some organizations will put\nfirewalls in between various areas of\n\n102\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.510\ntheir organization internally on their\ninternal ends for security purposes.\n\n103\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.970\nSo you may need to be aware of that.\n\n104\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.690\nThis console, web console particular,\nmaybe used from outside the organization.\n\n105\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.040\nAnd you maybe come in over the wire right\nfrom outside to remotely administer.\n\n106\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.190\nSame thing with the ops console.\n\n107\n00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.240\nMaybe loading that up on your laptop and\n\n108\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.390\nrunning that from outside\nthe organization.\n\n109\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.930\nSo you may have a need to\nunderstand how to do that.\n\n110\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.030\nOur gateway communication comes in\nfrom outside the firewall typically,\n\n111\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.040\nfrom beyond the DMZ.\n\n112\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.600\nSo there's got to be reasons to\nbe aware of this kind of stuff,\n\n113\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.790\nbecause you're gonna have to plan for\nthis.\n\n114\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.700\nNow, one of the things Microsoft has done\nvery incredibly well, as a matter of fact,\n\n115\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.845\nnot just very well, but very,\nvery well, or we could say incredibly.\n\n116\n00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:12.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Of course, very squared well.\n\n117\n00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:13.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That they've got, and\n\n118\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.060\nI have talked about this on other shows.\n\n119\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.130\nYou have the documentation on\nthe whole system center suite.\n\n120\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.930\nBut SCOM in particular, cause it is a bit\nof a product that you really got to drill\n\n121\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.670\nin, and understand, and have that depth\nof knowledge to manage correctly,\n\n122\n00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.970\nas CVMM falls in this category as well.\n\n123\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.110\nAs the service manager.\n\n124\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.640\nCuz these are complicated products.\n\n125\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.360\nAnd the interactions\nbetween them are complex.\n\n126\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.770\nMicrosoft has done an excellent job of\ncreating documentation that really gives\n\n127\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.610\nus, as administrators, the understanding\nof how to do this effectively.\n\n128\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.480\nWhat you'll find here, not just hey, this\nserver and these ports, but you'll see,\n\n129\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.580\nif we go full screen,\nyou can appreciate this.\n\n130\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.690\nYou'll see here, firewall scenarios for\n12 R2 Ops manager, operations manager.\n\n131\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.570\nFeature A to feature B, port number and\ndirection, configurable and node, right?\n\n132\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.390\nSo Management server to ops database.\n\n133\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.180\nWhat ports, you'll see here,\nand what protocols.\n\n134\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.460\nThat's often really tough to figure out.\n\n135\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.140\nI've got a port, but\nI don't know if it's TCP or UDP or both.\n\n136\n00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.480\nI'm not sure.\n\n137\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.950\nThey document everything here for you.\n\n138\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.090\nGive you the direction of flow Hence\nthe arrows going from [INAUDIBLE]\n\n139\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.400\nsever to the right to the ops database.\n\n140\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.980\nIs it configurable during setup?\n\n141\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.600\nabsolutely, you could see it there.\n\n142\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.250\nWhat ports can be closed\nafter the initial install?\n\n143\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.230\nThat's another big one.\n\n144\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.000\nDo I need all these ports open\non my firewall, all the time?\n\n145\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.120\nabsolutely not but\nduring the initial install.\n\n146\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.940\nWe gotta be able to have\nthat communication.\n\n147\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.960\nIt says after that,\nyou can close almost all of them, so\n\n148\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.580\nthey've done a great job of going through.\n\n149\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.600\nAnd actually helping us as you can\nsee to understand this flow and\n\n150\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.990\nnot just in one direction.\n\n151\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.230\nNot just with one feature, but you can see\nthis is a pretty long table here, right?\n\n152\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.350\nThere's quite a bit of\nstuff that's set up.\n\n153\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.070\nUnix Linux you need to figure that\nout right t here at the bottom.\n\n154\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.210\nYou could see the ports\nassociated with that.\n\n155\n00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.200\nSo we have quite a bit of information.\n\n156\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.930\nOn this webpage.\n\n157\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.650\nThis is one you're gonna wanna bookmark.\n\n158\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.310\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna\n\n159\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.490\ndefinitely wanna go out and\ntake a look at.\n\n160\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.260\nIt's gonna be very valuable.\n\n161\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Start Internet,\n\n162\n00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.390\nI'm still trying to guessing, if I can\neven speak, those particular ports.\n\n163\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.160\nYou got it right there.\n\n164\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.930\nThat is,\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n165\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.013\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a tool to save.\n\n166\n00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:06.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, that's authoritative,\n\n167\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.350\nit tells you what it is.\n\n168\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.050\nNow, the other thing we often talk\nabout with these webpages and\n\n169\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.850\nwe try to give you as many of them that we\nthink will be valuable for you as we can.\n\n170\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.540\nKeeping in mind that when we put this\nepisode together we shoot it for\n\n171\n00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.070\nyou they're obviously checked out of time,\nwe know they're valid.\n\n172\n00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.290\nYou're watching them live.\n\n173\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.040\nYou see they're there.\n\n174\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.870\nBut that doesn't mean that\nit's six months, a year,\n\n175\n00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.360\nwhenever you may view this episode in\nthe library at a later date that those.\n\n176\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.620\nArchived URLs are necessarily\nall gonna represent and\n\n177\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.540\nbe valid to a page at that moment in time.\n\n178\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.750\nWe always encourage you to take them,\ngo out and check them.\n\n179\n00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.080\nMajority of them will probably still work,\n\n180\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.060\nI'm sure the majority of\nthem are not gonna change.\n\n181\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.240\nBut in case one or\ntwo of them move around, and you know,\n\n182\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.340\nit's been known to happen every so\noften, right?\n\n183\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.010\nYou're at least in the ballpark.\n\n184\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.990\nYou're in TechNet.\n\n185\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.850\nYou're in the system center 12 R2,\nTechNet library.\n\n186\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.392\nYou're in the documentation stack.\n\n187\n00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:52.301\nYou're in the right place to hunt around\na little bit and probably find that link.\n\n188\n00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.906\nIt's just a matter of perhaps going in on\nyour own and doing a little detective work\n\n189\n00:07:55.906 --> 00:07:58.427\nTo come up with it, but\nat least you are in the right area.\n\n190\n00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:00.110\nWe talked about implementing user roles.\n\n191\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.750\nI talked to you about what these are.\n\n192\n00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.660\nGot a webpage here that'll\nhelp you understand\n\n193\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.720\nhow to do that a little bit more.\n\n194\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.960\nWe're going to go back in and\n\n195\n00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.200\ntake a look at run-as accounts and\nshow you the different types here and\n\n196\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.520\nlink them back to this idea of\nuser roles in just a moment.\n\n197\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.180\nSo I encourage you to take a look at that.\n\n198\n00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.450\nWe talked about, you heard me talk about\none of the first episodes in this series,\n\n199\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.840\ntalking about active directory\ndomain services, and\n\n200\n00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.030\nhow we can integrate into AD,\nso that management group\n\n201\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.150\nauto assignment can be done for\nthe Microsoft monitoring agent.\n\n202\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.350\nWe could tell it,\nhey go to this management group, and\n\n203\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.660\nthat's where you're assigned.\n\n204\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.130\nAnd Cherokee mentioned that there may\nbe certain versions of the directory or\n\n205\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.660\nthe domain that we have to be at.\n\n206\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.990\nAnd I said absolutely there\nare some pre reqs there.\n\n207\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.350\nSo you can see we could be at 2000 native,\n\n208\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.390\nminimally, well you'd have\nto scroll down to see it.\n\n209\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.510\nBut you could read through there and\nyou'll understand it.\n\n210\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.270\nAnd 2003 mixed in order\nto be able to do this.\n\n211\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.710\nSo you'll want to know about these things,\nand drilling in,\n\n212\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.090\na lot of people do want to know how to\nsetup Active Directory integration.\n\n213\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.380\nAnd this is gonna give you\nthe information associated with that.\n\n214\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.630\nIt's not too difficult here.\n\n215\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.020\nYou'll see functional level of AD is\n2003 native, or, excuse me, 2008.\n\n216\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.870\nI think I said 2000.\n\n217\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.060\n2008 native or\nhigher is what I meant to say.\n\n218\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.770\nYou'll see it right there.\n\n219\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.380\nSo we just need to make sure we have that\navailable, and that we're ready to go.\n\n220\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.310\nSo it's easy to do.\n\n221\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.730\nAnd once we've done that, we're then able\nto just follow the other instructions.\n\n222\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.680\nIt's not very difficult,\nwe just set that up.\n\n223\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.850\nAnd then once we have all that available,\nwe're able to then have,\n\n224\n00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.820\nthrough our two-way trusted domains,\nthe ability to assign\n\n225\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.240\nthose management groups onto that tab\nin the management agent automatically.\n\n226\n00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.960\nSo we do have that,\nwe do have monitors and\n\n227\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.730\nrules we went through in the last episode.\n\n228\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.720\nShowed you the breakout on all\nthe different management pack components,\n\n229\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.890\ntalked extensively.\n\n230\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.540\nAbout monitors and rules, thought this\nwould just be good for you to see here.\n\n231\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.570\nWe talk about all the monitors and\nthe different types.\n\n232\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.450\nWe talked about the health states and\nthe types of monitors unit dependency and\n\n233\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.280\naggregate monitors.\n\n234\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.480\nWe showed you those and\nhow those come together so\n\n235\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.030\nthey explained a little\nbit about those here.\n\n236\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.370\nGive you some samples on\nwhat this would look like.\n\n237\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.330\nThis is actually the health explorer.\n\n238\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.400\nWe didn't look at this per se in the\nepisode cuz there was really nothing we\n\n239\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.530\nwould see cuz we had just\ninstalled the agents.\n\n240\n00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.120\nBut this is what it would\nlook like if you go in.\n\n241\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.590\nAnd I mentioned the health explorer would\nshow you that we actually see the state\n\n242\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.860\nchanges, and what those state changes were\non the timing associated with them, and\n\n243\n00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.470\nwhy they happen.\n\n244\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.012\nAnd that's what you would see,\nif you go through and take a look here.\n\n245\n00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:16.540\nI talked about the different rule types,\nalerting, collection, and command rules.\n\n246\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.850\nI explained what each one is used for\nand how they're used.\n\n247\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.290\nYou'll see them described here as well.\n\n248\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.560\nShould we create rules or monitors, we\nkind of talked about the scenario again,\n\n249\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.090\nMicrosoft does a great job.\n\n250\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.030\nHey which one do I need,\nwhich one's gonna be beneficial for me?\n\n251\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.690\nUse the monitor if you wanna\nbe able to do certain things,\n\n252\n00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.660\nyou'll see their monitoring, health\nstate or status affect of an object.\n\n253\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.340\nSomething affects it, how do we know?\n\n254\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.940\nMonitors are good for that.\n\n255\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.730\nYou have some sort of condition that is\ncomplex multi-part, a rule that may be\n\n256\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.310\ndifficult to manage with, then setting up\na monitor would probably be easier to use.\n\n257\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.260\nWhat's good for rule and\nhow do we set rules up?\n\n258\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.360\nAnd they walk through and\ntalk about all this with us.\n\n259\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.820\nThey also go through and\ntalk about all the component parts here.\n\n260\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.740\nSo they give us details on data sources,\nexpressions, alerts,\n\n261\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.350\nperformance monitor rules, script monitor\nrules, dependency monitors, agra monitors.\n\n262\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.600\nThere's a page for each of these, and\n\n263\n00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.070\nyou can drill through and\nyou can see them on the left here.\n\n264\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.740\nThen we can find information\nabout all of this.\n\n265\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.090\nSo just following up on all of\nthe resources we provided to you,\n\n266\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.460\nmaking sure you see all these.\n\n267\n00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.430\nThese are all gonna be important.\n\n268\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely take advantage of that for\nsure.\n\n269\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Do wanna take advantage of that.\n\n270\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.620\nIt's gonna be very helpful.\n\n271\n00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.720\nSelected a target, what are we\ngonna target that monitoring and\n\n272\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.970\nthat management pack at?\n\n273\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.570\nSo what are we gonna aim it at,\nessentially, and\n\n274\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.720\nthen start monitoring with.\n\n275\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.740\nSo that's what we call selecting a target.\n\n276\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.780\nVery straightforward, but\nyou can read up on that here, as well.\n\n277\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.070\nHow do we create overrides?\n\n278\n00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.180\nI talked about overrides and\napplying changes.\n\n279\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had that episode\nthat specifically covered that.\n\n280\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.990\n&gt;&gt; We do, actually, we do,\n\n281\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.900\nnot here, per se, right now during the\nepisodes we're doing and linking to this.\n\n282\n00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.310\nBut we've done a show,\nor an episode, rather.\n\n283\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.820\nAn episode, right?\n\n284\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.800\nWe've done an episode on\nhow to do overrides, and\n\n285\n00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.840\nthat would be one to look for.\n\n286\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.230\nIt's in the SCOM 10964, Data Center\nMonitoring the Private Cloud Class.\n\n287\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.040\nWe do a whole thing on it there.\n\n288\n00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.930\nBut we do reference here,\nyou're heard me talk about overrides.\n\n289\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.340\nThis is the idea of taking that sealed\nmanagement pack that comes down,\n\n290\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.340\nall ready pre-configured with\nall the objects that you saw.\n\n291\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.360\nThe monitors, the rules, the tasks, etc.\n\n292\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.070\nAnd we create an override or\n\n293\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.870\nset of overrides that would allow us\nto combine with the management packs.\n\n294\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.830\nSo we take our management pack,\nsealed, we take our overrides,\n\n295\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.960\nstore then in an unsealed management.\n\n296\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.180\nCombine the two together, and then\nthe outcome, the effect of that delivered,\n\n297\n00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.980\nis the modified management\npack specific to our needs,\n\n298\n00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.900\nas you were talking about in the last\nepisode, that allows us to get the actual\n\n299\n00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.490\nmonitoring of the specific outcomes we're\nlooking for unique to our environment.\n\n300\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.798\nYou know, I tell customers,\nI tell students all the time,\n\n301\n00:12:32.798 --> 00:12:36.200\nSCOM is about one-size-fits-one,\nit's not about one-size-fits-all.\n\n302\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.280\nYou want to get the value\nout of this tool,\n\n303\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.460\nyou've gotta download\nthese management packs,\n\n304\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.210\nintegrate them by importing them, and\nthen customize them to your needs.\n\n305\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.980\nJust because Microsoft says, hey, this is\nwhat Windows monitoring normally looks\n\n306\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.550\nlike and 95% of the time\nthat may be enough for you.\n\n307\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.990\nBut there's that 5% window\nwhere it looks like that,\n\n308\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.190\nbut there's certain specific\nthings you wanna achieve.\n\n309\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.370\nDon't be afraid to go in and\ncreate overrides.\n\n310\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.340\nPeople get scared about that.\n\n311\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.340\nThey say I don't want to mess\nwith that management pack.\n\n312\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.610\nIt's good enough,\nit gives me most of what I want.\n\n313\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.500\nOkay, but did you spend all\nthat money to be good enough?\n\n314\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.430\nOr did you spend all that money, because\nthis is not a cheap product, I mean we're\n\n315\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.590\ntalking about tens of thousands of dollars\nto license System Center overall, and\n\n316\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.320\nthen to implement and\nmaintain this infrastructure.\n\n317\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.160\nThis is a very expensive solution for you.\n\n318\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.000\nContinuous monitoring is not cheap.\n\n319\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.850\nAnd if you're not gonna get the full\nvalue out of that investment,\n\n320\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.500\nyou're just not spending money wisely.\n\n321\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.700\nSo we really have to think about what\nwe're gonna do and how we're gonna do it.\n\n322\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.790\nOverriding, rules or monitors is\nthe secret to success with SCOM.\n\n323\n00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.280\nYou really have to be able to, and\n\n324\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.730\nbe comfortable with,\nthinking through the logic of doing this.\n\n325\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.570\nAnd you can see how to override, it's very\nstraightforward in the authoring area.\n\n326\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.520\nYou go into the Management Pack Object,\nyou go to Monitors, and we're in there and\n\n327\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.710\nyou saw that, and\nwe simply select the monitor we want and\n\n328\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.400\nthen we go and we override,\nif there's a task of to the right.\n\n329\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.440\nAnd then when we have a wizard we follow,\nwe program in the overrides.\n\n330\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.810\nBut it's not very difficult to do.\n\n331\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.610\nSo you're gonna wanna go in and\ntake look at this,\n\n332\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.280\nmake sure you're comfortable with this.\n\n333\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.300\nWe've talked about tasks, you saw tasks as\nobjects in the management pack as well.\n\n334\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.520\nAnd so creating those tasks, and just\na little bit of information about that\n\n335\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.200\nwas here as well,\nthought we'd give that to you.\n\n336\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.850\nMonitoring networks by using Ops Manager\nis what I wanna go back and show you.\n\n337\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.730\nHow to do network discovery and\njust talk about the different Run-as\n\n338\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.010\naccounts that we can create\nto support discovery.\n\n339\n00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.890\nSo I'm gonna show you these right now.\n\n340\n00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.180\nBut there's a whole section here and\nwe talked about doing that with Discovery,\n\n341\n00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.410\nwith SNMP, bringing that infrastructure.\n\n342\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.950\nAnd we can do monitoring with SCOM\nof our network infrastructure,\n\n343\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.600\nnetwork device monitoring capabilities and\nscope.\n\n344\n00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.070\nConnection health,\nVLAN health, you can see.\n\n345\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.320\nHot standby router protocol group health.\n\n346\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.710\nSo we can use the Cisco proprietary HSRP,\nor hot standby router protocol, and\n\n347\n00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.540\nthen we can then actually\nget additional information.\n\n348\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.600\nAlso we can see the health state and\n\n349\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.960\nspecific information about\nend point it's there.\n\n350\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.400\nPorting interface is up or\n\n351\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.270\ndown operationally, percent\nutilization I mentioned CPU and RAM.\n\n352\n00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.670\nThese were all things we get from doing\nthe monitoring on the network side.\n\n353\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.710\nPercent of processor usage, memory usage,\nall that kind of stuff's available to us.\n\n354\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.840\nSo we do need some required management\npacks to be able to set this up.\n\n355\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.180\nYou'll see we have Windows server 2003,\nServer 2008, Windows 7, and\n\n356\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.330\nWindows Vista client operating systems.\n\n357\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.940\nSo we just wanna make sure we're aware\nof the fact we can monitor across\n\n358\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.260\nthese different areas.\n\n359\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.350\nBut you'll see here,\n\n360\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.980\nwe do need the Microsoft Windows\nServer Network Discovery.\n\n361\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.510\nMicrosoft Windows Client\nNetwork Discovery.\n\n362\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.300\nThese management packs are gonna be there,\ntypically by default,\n\n363\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.930\nas part of our normal install to do this.\n\n364\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.460\nBut it's a very simple solution\nonce we get it set up.\n\n365\n00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.550\nWe'll go through and take a look, but we\nhave explicit versus explicit discovery.\n\n366\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.130\nGo through and discover the specific items\nthat we have outlined in the wizard.\n\n367\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.260\nI want these five machines.\n\n368\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.110\nWhatever it is.\n\n369\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.623\nRecursive, go through and find those,\nbut find anything connected to those.\n\n370\n00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:52.220\nSo recurse through that one, and\nkind of look downstream, and\n\n371\n00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.573\nsee what else may be connected,\nand bring those back in.\n\n372\n00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:58.089\nSo we can get a hierarchy\nof dependency and.\n\n373\n00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.376\nUltimately, relate that\nback to the console and\n\n374\n00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.940\nshow that through discovery\nif we do recursive.\n\n375\n00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.670\nSo let's go back in, and\nlet's take a look at what this looks like.\n\n376\n00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.579\nLet me just reset our lab\ntimer here real quick.\n\n377\n00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:12.232\nWe'll go into our console,\nso I'm in the accounts area,\n\n378\n00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:15.535\nwhat I wanted to do is show you\nthe different Run as accounts will create,\n\n379\n00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:17.500\nyou wanna to drive these discovery types.\n\n380\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.066\nSo we're gonna right click, we're gonna\ngo in create a Run as account, and\n\n381\n00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:23.420\nyou'll see that we have\ndifferent options here.\n\n382\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.970\nWe have our welcome screen kind of\noverview We'll click Next past that.\n\n383\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.890\nRun as account types, now, we have a list.\n\n384\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.610\nCould we go full screen just so\nyou can see just a little bit easier.\n\n385\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.790\nIt'll be easier for you to see.\n\n386\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.120\nWe've got a list there of\neight different account types.\n\n387\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.000\nLet me just quickly run through\nwhat they are with you.\n\n388\n00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.400\nWe have the Windows account.\n\n389\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.698\nThat would be just a standard Windows\ncredential, username and password for\n\n390\n00:16:42.698 --> 00:16:43.672\na domain joined user.\n\n391\n00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:49.474\nCommunity String, that's gonna be SNMP,\nbut SNMP version two of the protocol.\n\n392\n00:16:49.474 --> 00:16:50.650\nThat's what we're gonna use there.\n\n393\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.570\nSo Community String would be\nsomething like public or private, or\n\n394\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.670\nwhatever you would use.\n\n395\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.880\nThose are our default ones,\nyou may choose your own.\n\n396\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.133\nOr think of it as a password\nessentially like-\n\n397\n00:16:58.133 --> 00:16:59.111\n&gt;&gt; Okay community name\n\n398\n00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:00.379\nwhen you're using SNMP.\n\n399\n00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:03.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that's exactly what it is,\nit's community string name, but\n\n400\n00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:06.260\nit's essentially the association\nthat you're using there.\n\n401\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.650\nBut community string is for\nthe SNMP version two protocol.\n\n402\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.786\nYou'll see at the bottom we have\nan SNMP version three account, so\n\n403\n00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:16.594\nthat's gonna be used for discovery and\nmonitoring of SNMP version three systems\n\n404\n00:17:16.594 --> 00:17:18.894\nas opposed to community string for\nversion two.\n\n405\n00:17:18.894 --> 00:17:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n406\n00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.730\n&gt;&gt; Basic simple digest authentication.\n\n407\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.630\nThese are all gonna be just\na standard authentication mechanism\n\n408\n00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.610\nwe're familiar with.\n\n409\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.030\nFor web based authentication.\n\n410\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.326\nSimple authentication,\ngeneric username and password,\n\n411\n00:17:32.326 --> 00:17:36.257\nstandard basic web, or standard digest\nweb authentication as specified.\n\n412\n00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:39.410\nBinary authentication user\ndefined authentication.\n\n413\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.390\nUsers defining that, and specifying\nwhatever credentials they may provide.\n\n414\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.310\nMaybe a smart card or\nsomething like that, or who knows what.\n\n415\n00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.130\nAnd then action account this\ncredential that could be assigned only\n\n416\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.400\nto the action account profile\nif we do action accounts.\n\n417\n00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.240\nSo we'll use our different ones,\n\n418\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.890\nwe'll then provide our credentials\nhere based on what we specify.\n\n419\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.610\nCreate our run as account, and\nonce we have our run as account created,\n\n420\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.526\nwe're then able to go in, and let me\njust show you how to do this real quick.\n\n421\n00:18:03.526 --> 00:18:08.872\nJust give me one second, but as we create\nour run as account, we'll then be able to\n\n422\n00:18:08.872 --> 00:18:14.320\ngo in and assign that and we'll be able to\nuse that to drive all sorts of activities.\n\n423\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.840\nSo if we created one, and\nI didn't create one, but if we did,\n\n424\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.260\nlet's just go through quickly here and\nlet's just do that.\n\n425\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.592\nI didn't mean to get out of the wizard.\n\n426\n00:18:20.592 --> 00:18:23.044\nLet me just go back here real quick,\nI hit the wrong button.\n\n427\n00:18:23.044 --> 00:18:29.393\nSo let's choose Windows,\nwe'll call this ITProTV.\n\n428\n00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:33.890\nRun as admin or\nwhatever you're gonna call it.\n\n429\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.260\nWe'll do Windows.\n\n430\n00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.740\nAnd then there we go.\n\n431\n00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.700\nAnd then we'll provide our username and\nour password here right.\n\n432\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.659\nSo we'll provide our credential.\n\n433\n00:18:41.659 --> 00:18:43.680\nSo practice labs.\n\n434\n00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.938\nWe'll put in our domain.\n\n435\n00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:47.980\nWe'll do administrator.\n\n436\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.820\nRemember we could use our guest accounts,\nas we've seen me do on other ones but\n\n437\n00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.550\nwe don't wanna do that.\n\n438\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.184\nThat's really not a good best practice.\n\n439\n00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:55.520\nWe'll do password there.\n\n440\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.970\nRight we've got our domain there as\nyou can see right so provide that.\n\n441\n00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.210\nThen what I wanted to show you is less and\nmore secure.\n\n442\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.058\nThis is how we distributed these\naccounts out to the management servers.\n\n443\n00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:11.089\nIf we do less secure, it says that I\nwant the credential to be distributed\n\n444\n00:19:11.089 --> 00:19:13.041\nautomatically to all\nthe managed computers.\n\n445\n00:19:13.041 --> 00:19:16.455\nMeaning, all of the management service\nwill get this credential automatically.\n\n446\n00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:20.179\nIf I do more secure, I have to manually\nspecify which service I want to\n\n447\n00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.760\ndistribute this credential\nto after the fact.\n\n448\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.192\nSo we have an option for\nauto deployment of the credential, or\n\n449\n00:19:26.192 --> 00:19:27.582\nwe can manually decide.\n\n450\n00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:30.555\nBecause we may not want this account\navailable on every management server,\n\n451\n00:19:30.555 --> 00:19:32.645\nmaybe it's only gonna go\nto a certain resource pool,\n\n452\n00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:34.830\nand certain management\nservers in the pool.\n\n453\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.390\nWe can decide that on our own,\nwith more or less secure,\n\n454\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.009\nnotice by the way that more\nsecure is our default option.\n\n455\n00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:43.080\nSo it's up to us to decide\nwe'll just do less secure.\n\n456\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.545\nNotice it says hey caution administrators\nof all recipient computers will be able to\n\n457\n00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.764\naccess the run s account credentials,\nmeaning they'll be able to see them and\n\n458\n00:19:49.764 --> 00:19:51.752\ninteract with them, so\nit's just warning us.\n\n459\n00:19:51.752 --> 00:19:54.140\nRight, but we'll go ahead we'll\ndo that we'll click Create.\n\n460\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.730\nIt's gonna go ahead, and\nit's gonna tell us, hey,\n\n461\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.550\nassociate that with a profile,\nright, so that we can then use that.\n\n462\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.240\nSo, we've done that.\n\n463\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.190\nRemember, we talked about profiles.\n\n464\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.000\nWe would come in here, and\nwe could create a run as profile, or\n\n465\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.740\nuse one of the ones that's there.\n\n466\n00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.311\nWe do our run as profile.\n\n467\n00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:17.440\nLet me just auto hide the task bar down\nhere so we can see that bottom item.\n\n468\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.817\nWhen we do this click OK\nclick Next we'll give\n\n469\n00:20:21.817 --> 00:20:26.662\na profile name here so\nwe'll do ITProTV Adam pro.\n\n470\n00:20:26.662 --> 00:20:30.724\nAnd then we have to select our management\npack because remember the management pack\n\n471\n00:20:30.724 --> 00:20:34.726\nprovides all the objects that we're gonna\nuse in the profile is gonna provide them\n\n472\n00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:38.381\nto us from the management pack and\nmake them available to run as account, so\n\n473\n00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:39.446\nwe can execute them.\n\n474\n00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:42.290\nSo we can either create a new one,\nor we'll choose our own.\n\n475\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.930\nI could do the default management pack,\nbut if we had our own management pack,\n\n476\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.690\nwe could bring in our custom one, here.\n\n477\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.793\nWe just haven't created one.\n\n478\n00:20:48.793 --> 00:20:52.525\nAnd then what we do, so we go ahead and\nwe chose to add our Run As account.\n\n479\n00:20:52.525 --> 00:20:56.376\nAnd this is where we go in and we specify\nwhat our run as account would be.\n\n480\n00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:59.307\nAnd you'll see we have our\nlist of run as accounts, but\n\n481\n00:20:59.307 --> 00:21:02.705\nnotice I have my custom one right\nthe one that we created right.\n\n482\n00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:03.505\nThe one that we wanna use.\n\n483\n00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:07.045\nSo we'll just grab that one or create\na new one right from here either way.\n\n484\n00:21:07.045 --> 00:21:10.768\nDo I wanna give this run as account access\nto all the objects, all the targeted\n\n485\n00:21:10.768 --> 00:21:14.682\nobjects in the management pack that\nwe're importing default management pack.\n\n486\n00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:18.610\nIn other words give it rights to\neverything, or do I wanna go ahead and\n\n487\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.843\ndo a subset of those?\n\n488\n00:21:22.132 --> 00:21:24.080\nSelect Class, Object, or Group.\n\n489\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.480\nAnd then I can go in and I can search, and\n\n490\n00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.950\nit'll take a moment just to\nload all the objects here.\n\n491\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:37.307\nBut then I can say you know what, I just\nwant this run as account to have rights\n\n492\n00:21:37.307 --> 00:21:42.349\nto nothing but the database right here,\nthe data warehouse database.\n\n493\n00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:46.300\nAnd I just wanna give this account rights\nto only use objects associated with\n\n494\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.004\nthe data warehouse database and\nonly manage, interact with monitor,\n\n495\n00:21:50.004 --> 00:21:54.100\ncreate reports on whatever the case may\nbe, all the functions in that capa-.\n\n496\n00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.380\n&gt;&gt; A pretty granular selection there.\n\n497\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Very granular there, and\nI can do this in any of those categories.\n\n498\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.804\nSo I can be incredibly specific\nclick Add to bring that in, right?\n\n499\n00:22:02.804 --> 00:22:06.500\nAnd then click OK and\nthen it's scoped just for that.\n\n500\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.370\nOr I can say you know what,\njust give me broad access to everything,\n\n501\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.400\nessentially the entire management pack,\nand all objects that make it up or\n\n502\n00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.440\nare associated with it.\n\n503\n00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.580\nSo I can do that, click OK.\n\n504\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.760\nThen, when I go ahead and I click Create,\ngive it just a second there.\n\n505\n00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.410\nWhen it's done,\nI'll see my profile is set up.\n\n506\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.331\nIt'll be listed alphabetically,\nit'll be in there.\n\n507\n00:22:27.331 --> 00:22:32.680\nAnd then we'll be able to use that to then\nbe able to actually drive interaction.\n\n508\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.480\nAnd allow us to then be\nable to go through and to,\n\n509\n00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.310\nyou'll not only engage in activities, and\nthat will come up in just a second, but\n\n510\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.510\nto actually go through and in this case,\nwe scoped it really narrowly,\n\n511\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.670\nconstrain ourselves to only using the,\nwhat was it?\n\n512\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.000\nThe database,\nthe data warehouse database, right?\n\n513\n00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.611\nThat's the one we use, so\nwe'd be scoping it just for that.\n\n514\n00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:54.380\nSo, we'll let that finish up.\n\n515\n00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.390\nWhat we're gonna do Is I want to show you,\nthere we go.\n\n516\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.390\nWe're just gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Close so\n\n517\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.000\nthat was completed successfully.\n\n518\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.587\nOur profile is sitting right down there so\nyou can see it right there.\n\n519\n00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:08.617\nWhat I wanted to do was show you\nhow we would do the discovery for\n\n520\n00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:12.293\nthe network types and just show you\nthe different network device types that\n\n521\n00:23:12.293 --> 00:23:15.930\nwe can discover so just gonna go in\nreal quick and run through that as well.\n\n522\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.064\nWe're gonna come up here.\n\n523\n00:23:17.064 --> 00:23:19.030\nAnd go to our discover rules.\n\n524\n00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.650\nRemember we did a Windows discovery and\n\n525\n00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.420\ndid a client agent push from\nthe console one of our prior episodes.\n\n526\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.620\nWe actually deployed two agents our,\nright?\n\n527\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.764\nSo we're gonna show you the other\ntype discovery we can take place or\n\n528\n00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:31.711\none of them anyway.\n\n529\n00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:36.387\nUnder network discovery you'll see we\nchange our discussion items here what we\n\n530\n00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:39.120\nhave to profile and\nprovide information for.\n\n531\n00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.660\nJust move that over so you can see that.\n\n532\n00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.463\nAnd then we would come in here,\nclick Next, and we would specify a name.\n\n533\n00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.112\nSomething like that.\n\n534\n00:23:51.112 --> 00:23:56.499\nWe would then specify available servers\nSo, we'll put in our management server.\n\n535\n00:23:56.499 --> 00:24:00.688\nWe would select a resource pool, if we\nhave a resource pool, or we create one,\n\n536\n00:24:00.688 --> 00:24:01.670\neither way.\n\n537\n00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.730\nWe can go in and create one real quick,\n\n538\n00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:10.370\ncall this NetDiscoveryRP,\nfor resource pool.\n\n539\n00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:17.480\nClick Next, what our pool membership is,\nwe will add in our available servers.\n\n540\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.350\nSearch, there we go.\n\n541\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.730\nWe'll add in our available servers,\nour management group servers.\n\n542\n00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.480\nYou can see we have one there,\nso we'll add that one in.\n\n543\n00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.240\nClick Add, click OK, so\nwe'll put our management server in.\n\n544\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.730\nClick Next,\njust let that finish real quick.\n\n545\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.930\nAnd click Create here.\n\n546\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.260\nSo now we're creating a resource pool that\nwe can use to drive the discovery, so\n\n547\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.170\nwe have that.\n\n548\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.010\nSo we'll use our available resource pool,\nthe one we just created.\n\n549\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.700\nWe'll then go ahead, and\nwe'll specify our discovery method.\n\n550\n00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.210\nRemember, we talked about\nexplicit versus recursive.\n\n551\n00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.525\nI showed you what it was.\n\n552\n00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:50.740\nOpsManager will discover only those\ndevices we specify, if we do explicit.\n\n553\n00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.300\nRecursive, we discover\nthe devices we specify, but\n\n554\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.320\nthen all devices connected to them.\n\n555\n00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.850\nSo we might not know about\na device downstream.\n\n556\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.110\n&gt;&gt; Searching down those tentacles.\n\n557\n00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.780\n&gt;&gt; I will search down those, yes,\ndown those tentacles, exactly.\n\n558\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.105\nThe calamari search method.\n\n559\n00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:02.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're\n\n560\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.500\ngonna call that going forward.\n\n561\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.210\nSo we'll do explicit, and\nthen we can specify the run as account.\n\n562\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.640\nRemember we just did a run as account?\n\n563\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.540\nThis is one of the reasons we bring it in.\n\n564\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.250\nCuz we need that run as account\nto generate the credentials, and\n\n565\n00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.880\nthen use it here, so\nwe can drive that activity.\n\n566\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.370\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do this.\n\n567\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:23.720\nWe can either come in and\nuse a run as accounting.\n\n568\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.140\nYou'll see run as account type,\ncommunity stream.\n\n569\n00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.380\nWe didn't do, it said on the screen there.\n\n570\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.050\nWe didn't have have an SNMP-\n&gt;&gt; To create that password, or?\n\n571\n00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.385\n&gt;&gt; Or a new-\n&gt;&gt; Well, we didn't create an account.\n\n572\n00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:34.755\nRemember, we did Run as Account Type,\nWindows.\n\n573\n00:25:34.755 --> 00:25:35.885\nI didn't do one for SNMP,\nfor community string.\n\n574\n00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:36.601\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; Had we had,\n\n575\n00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.614\nthere it would have been in the list,\nthe pick list.\n\n576\n00:25:38.614 --> 00:25:41.557\nWe would have just been able to say,\nthere's Cherokee SNMP or\n\n577\n00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:43.157\nwhatever our account name was.\n\n578\n00:25:43.157 --> 00:25:46.127\nBut because I didn't create a type\nof that, I'm now being prompted, and\n\n579\n00:25:46.127 --> 00:25:47.387\nI have to provide it here.\n\n580\n00:25:47.387 --> 00:25:50.587\nBut yeah, we'll provide,\nas you could see, our account type.\n\n581\n00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:52.387\nWe'll provide our display name, right?\n\n582\n00:25:52.387 --> 00:25:56.957\nSo we'll do whatever we put there,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n583\n00:25:56.957 --> 00:25:58.477\nAnd then we'll provide\nthe community string.\n\n584\n00:25:58.477 --> 00:26:01.057\nThis is where we provide the community\nstring, like you were suggesting.\n\n585\n00:26:01.057 --> 00:26:02.997\nSo is it public or private?\n\n586\n00:26:02.997 --> 00:26:05.520\nOr whatever it may be, We'll specify that.\n\n587\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.380\nAgain, we'll just add it in and\nwe'll stack those up.\n\n588\n00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.140\nHad we created run as account types for\nSNMP, we would see them there and\n\n589\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.350\nhave an option of selecting them already,\nis what I was suggesting to you.\n\n590\n00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.910\nWe'll do that.\n\n591\n00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.160\nWe'll click Next.\n\n592\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.730\nWe'll then specify the devices.\n\n593\n00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.700\nRemember, we're doing\nan explicit either-way,\n\n594\n00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.870\nin the sense we must define devices.\n\n595\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.160\nBut then if it's recursive,\n\n596\n00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.773\nwe're going down the tentacles,\nas Cherokee said, right?\n\n597\n00:26:26.773 --> 00:26:28.700\nDownstream, looking for connected devices.\n\n598\n00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.320\nSo we would add them in here, and we would\nspecify name or IP of the device, right?\n\n599\n00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.970\nWhat are we looking for?\n\n600\n00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.815\nAccess mode.\n\n601\n00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:41.030\nICMP and SNMP, ICMP only, SNMP only.\n\n602\n00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.600\nPort number, 161 by default for\nthat, traditionally.\n\n603\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.815\nWhat version of SNMP?\n\n604\n00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:48.710\nOne, two or three, right,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n605\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.670\nUse the selected run as account, right?\n\n606\n00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:55.760\nAs you can see, so I can use the run\nas.account that I specified.\n\n607\n00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.550\nSo I would have to provide\na device name here, right?\n\n608\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.833\nSo if I did Flabsys0,\n\n609\n00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:07.300\nam I on 02 or 01?\n\n610\n00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.190\nJust half a second, I forgot which machine\n[LAUGH] I'm actually on right now.\n\n611\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.880\nLet me just check real quick,\njust so I put in the right one.\n\n612\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.700\nJust do a host name here.\n\n613\n00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.760\nAnd I'm on 01.\nOkay, so I'm just gonna target 02.\n\n614\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.900\nI just didn't remember\nwhat machine I was on.\n\n615\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:29.419\nSo pleb02.practicelabs.com.\n\n616\n00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:34.190\nAll right, so we put in our name,\nthere, of our machine.\n\n617\n00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.870\npleb02.practicelabs.com.\n\n618\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.060\nGot all that, we click OK.\n\n619\n00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.450\nRight, specify that.\n\n620\n00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.160\nThen schedule our discovery.\n\n621\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.200\nHey, when's it gonna run?\n\n622\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.930\nHow often?\n\n623\n00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.165\nSo you know, we're just gonna go through,\ndo it immediately, right?\n\n624\n00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.490\nAnd/or, or rather manually, and\nthen trigger it ourselves, or\n\n625\n00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.175\ndo it on a predetermined timeline,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n626\n00:27:52.175 --> 00:27:54.350\nThen we'll just have a summary.\n\n627\n00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.460\nJust go ahead and we'll click Create.\n\n628\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.570\nNow it says, hey, the following accounts\nseem to be distributed out to the health\n\n629\n00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.850\nservice, would you like us\nto distribute the account?\n\n630\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.090\nThe run as account we just created.\n\n631\n00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.450\nRemember, when we did the Windows account,\nI talked to you about less secure,\n\n632\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.580\nmore secure, and\ndistribution of those accounts.\n\n633\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.440\nEvery time we do this with\na new run as account,\n\n634\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.230\nwe have to distribute those run\nas accounts to make them work.\n\n635\n00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.660\nSo it's prompting us here and saying,\nwould you like us to do it for\n\n636\n00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.440\nyou, as part of the creation?\n\n637\n00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.880\nOr do you want to do it manually,\nseparately?\n\n638\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.960\nYou could do it either way.\n\n639\n00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.710\nWe'll just click Yes.\n\n640\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.920\nWe'll just let that do its thing.\n\n641\n00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.650\nGive that a moment to kinda run through.\n\n642\n00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.100\nBut by doing that,\n\n643\n00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.910\nwe've been able to essentially\nset up a network discovery type.\n\n644\n00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.460\nSee?\nSuccessful there, no big deal.\n\n645\n00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.410\nDo we wanna run the discovery?\n\n646\n00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.890\nSo we can run it manually right now if\nwe want to, outside the time window.\n\n647\n00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.200\nOr do we just want to wait,\nlet it run when it's scheduled?\n\n648\n00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.350\nSunday or Saturday at two or whatever.\n\n649\n00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.510\nWe could do that either way.\n\n650\n00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.300\nWe're not gonna run it, because\nwe're not gonna actually go out and\n\n651\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.940\ndiscover anything as\npart of the demo here.\n\n652\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.220\nBut I just wanted you to see how we could\nset that up, and now that's there, right?\n\n653\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.920\nWe can go out and run Discover Network\nDevices and run this anytime we want to.\n\n654\n00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.055\nSo this is how we would manually\ntrigger that if we needed to.\n\n655\n00:28:57.055 --> 00:29:00.890\nWnd we're able to then go out and\nuse that, to be able to find these network\n\n656\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.440\ndevices, bring them in, and\nthen add some depth to our monitoring.\n\n657\n00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.220\nThis gives us the ability to tie in\nour run as accounts, our profiles and\n\n658\n00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.500\nour discovery types and\nbring them all together.\n\n659\n00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.460\nWhich is one of the things\nwe had talked about, but\n\n660\n00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.080\nwe hadn't actually directly\nshown you how to do.\n\n661\n00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.200\nSo I wanted to make sure you could\nsee that piece of this as well.\n\n662\n00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.050\nI know that we do have some additional\nthings we wanna talk about.\n\n663\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.680\nBut I also know,\ncuz I am being ever-vigilant,\n\n664\n00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.290\nthat we are so\nclose to the end of time for this episode.\n\n665\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.350\nBut there's no way,\nunless we invented time travel,\n\n666\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.890\nthat we could actually fit them all in and\nextend this episode.\n\n667\n00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.510\nSo, instead of doing that, we're gonna\ngive you ability to take a break, invite\n\n668\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.310\nyou to come on back and join us for part-\n&gt;&gt; Five, you got it.\n\n669\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Part five.\nAnd, in part five,\n\n670\n00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.640\nwe're gonna talk about SCVMM, and how we\nhook up a virtual machine manager for\n\n671\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.800\nfabric monitoring, a little bit.\n\n672\n00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.990\nSo we're going to take a look\nat some cool stuff there.\n\n673\n00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.770\nAnd I think, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n674\n00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.030\nwe're also going to talk about some\nother odds and ends in the console.\n\n675\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:56.320\nSpecifically, we talked about the in,\nthe authoring area,\n\n676\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.460\nthe management pack objects\nin the last episode.\n\n677\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.820\nWe're going to talk about the managment\npack templates that we hinted at up top,\n\n678\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.250\nbut we have not taken a look at yet.\n\n679\n00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.230\nWe're going to explain those, and show\nyou what those are, and how they work.\n\n680\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.310\nAnd that'll tie in nicely for\nepisodes coming up later, where we do APM,\n\n681\n00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.448\nthe application for\nperformance monitoring, and\n\n682\n00:30:11.448 --> 00:30:14.163\ntalk about how to monitor\napplications using those templates.\n\n683\n00:30:14.163 --> 00:30:15.370\nWe're gonna take a look at some-\n&gt;&gt; Also the labs,\n\n684\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.480\nthey can use all that information that\nyou've covered to help them through, and\n\n685\n00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.490\nwalk through all those other labs.\n\n686\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.210\nWe've got a lot.\n&gt;&gt; They can,\n\n687\n00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.030\ncuz we do have full\nhands-on demonstration.\n\n688\n00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.640\nSeparate episodes, broken out,\nabout how to do and\n\n689\n00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.650\nconfigure many of the things that\nwe're taking a look at here quickly,\n\n690\n00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.080\nwith a little more depth and\nspecificity associated with them.\n\n691\n00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.850\nSo you can take a look at those also.\n\n692\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:32.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's it.\n\n693\n00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.810\nYou heard it yourself.\n\n694\n00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.370\nWe have more information to cover,\nso stay tuned.\n\n695\n00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.070\nBut for this show, we are out of time.\n\n696\n00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.190\nSo we'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n697\n00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.550\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n698\n00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.183\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n699\n00:30:41.183 --> 00:30:44.574\nSee you next time here at

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.391\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:12.048\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:15.329\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.220\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.096\nThis is a continuation of a conversation\nwe were having about monitoring our cloud\n\n9\n00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:23.450\nbased applications.\n\n10\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.996\nIf I can say that right, we'll go\nahead and get started here, with Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:27.590\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.826\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:29.764\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n14\n00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:31.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking in my mind,\n\n15\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.290\nthat's blooper reel material right there.\n\n16\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.400\n&gt;&gt; It is blooper reel material.\n\n17\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.294\n&gt;&gt; All right\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:37.048\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue talking.\n\n19\n00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:39.770\nWe're gonna move in to part\nfive of our conversation,\n\n20\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.860\nbecause four just wasn't good enough,\nand we're gonna do part five.\n\n21\n00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.570\nWhat we are gonna do is continue talking,\nand I mentioned in the last episode in\n\n22\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.450\nparticular, that all the stuff we're doing\nin SCOM is great, but you know what?\n\n23\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.640\nWe gotta reach out, and we gotta\nconnect SCOM into these other products,\n\n24\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.546\nto be able to really, truly get the value\nout of all the monitoring we're doing.\n\n25\n00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:00.250\nIn particular, we've gotta be\nable to connect to our Fabric,\n\n26\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.040\nand be able to understand how to\nuse SCOM to monitor the VMM side.\n\n27\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.450\nSo we're gonna start off by showing\nyou how to integrate SCOM and\n\n28\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.160\nVMM in the VMM Console, a walkthrough.\n\n29\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.230\nThat's got a couple of pre-reqs\nwe just wanna go through,\n\n30\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.450\nas we're getting ready to talk about that.\n\n31\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.840\nBefore we integrate VMM and OpsManager,\nWe have to have some operational\n\n32\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.560\nthought processes in our head kicking off,\nwe got a checklist so to speak.\n\n33\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.230\nOne of the main things is, we need some\nmanagement packs imported in to SCOM.\n\n34\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.580\nWe've shown you how to do that and\nwhat that would like.\n\n35\n00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.920\nBut there's a list of them,\nall of them are in,\n\n36\n00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.730\nI'm not gonna run through all of them.\n\n37\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.940\nBut all of them are in the show notes,\n\n38\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.060\nI put them in there along with\nthe version numbers that are necessary.\n\n39\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.110\nThe main things are the SQL Server\ncore library management pack,\n\n40\n00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.250\nalong with operating system library,\nthe core operating system functionality.\n\n41\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.710\nWe need IIS support, so\n\n42\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.320\nwe need some of the IIS management\npacks of version 6, version 7, etc.\n\n43\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.530\nSo just take a look at that list,\nthey're all in the show notes for you.\n\n44\n00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710\nIn addition, we have to have\nthe OpsManager console installed\n\n45\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.890\non the VMM server before we can\nactually do the integration.\n\n46\n00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.570\nSo we wanna make sure that is setup and\navailable for us.\n\n47\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.070\nWe should also,\nbest practice recommendation,\n\n48\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.980\nyou saw me do this in an earlier episode\nwhere we did the console push for\n\n49\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.250\nthe SCOM agent,\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n50\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.270\nI pushed it out to the VMM server.\n\n51\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.910\nAnd I did that,\n\n52\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.235\nspecifically, because I knew we were gonna\nshow you how to do the integrations.\n\n53\n00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:18.370\nSee, I'm thinking.\n\n54\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.270\nThat's important.\n\n55\n00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.620\nI'm planning to be successful, as we say.\n\n56\n00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.380\nSo we should also install the Microsoft\nMonitoring agent on the VMM server.\n\n57\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.315\nSo that way, we can actually monitor the\nserver itself, along with integrating and\n\n58\n00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:33.705\nmonitoring through into the fabric,\nand all the things that we would need.\n\n59\n00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.600\nSo that's going to be important for us.\n\n60\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.925\nWe'll then go ahead, and\nwe'll use the wizard in the VMM console\n\n61\n00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.775\nto be able to add\nthe Operations Manager information.\n\n62\n00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.360\nI'm going to show you how\nto do that right now.\n\n63\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.400\nLet's go in, we'll take a look.\n\n64\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.160\nWe're on our SCVMM server.\n\n65\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160\nYou may remember this from\nsome earlier episodes.\n\n66\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.500\nWe spent some fun times,\nas they say, right?\n\n67\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.240\nFun times in here.\n\n68\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.275\n&gt;&gt; Good times.\n&gt;&gt; Good times, good times.\n\n69\n00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it was, good times.\n\n70\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.940\nWe spent some good times in here,\ngoing through some of the Fabric settings,\n\n71\n00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.640\nand things like that.\n\n72\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.800\nSo we're back here.\n\n73\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.310\nAnd I'm just gonna show\nyou really quickly,\n\n74\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.030\nlet's just minimize here for a second.\n\n75\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.230\nWe do have our Ops console\nsitting installed on the box.\n\n76\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.890\nYou can see that pre-req has been met.\n\n77\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.490\nAnd if we go in,\ngo to our Control Panel here.\n\n78\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.510\nGo over to Large Icons.\n\n79\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.940\nOur Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n80\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.950\nAnd you saw me push this in a prior\nepisode, is they're set up,\n\n81\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.170\nready to go as well.\n\n82\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.320\nYou should take my word for it, but\n\n83\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.460\nall the management packs we need\nare already installed on the SCOM side.\n\n84\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.690\nSo we've imported those,\nor had them available.\n\n85\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.810\nWhich, in a little secret,\nthey've all been there since we started,\n\n86\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.820\ncuz we already had them in there.\n\n87\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.460\nBut you would have to\nmake sure they're there.\n\n88\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.810\nIf you don't have them, you obviously\njust need to check that list and\n\n89\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.920\nmake sure you know what they are.\n\n90\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.030\nBut we've kinda cheated a little bit, and\nput them in, and front-loaded them for us.\n\n91\n00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.090\nSo we're going to go\nback in to the console.\n\n92\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.480\nNotice, I am in the Settings workspace.\n\n93\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.330\nNotice I am in System Center Settings,\nand I am on the OpsManager server object.\n\n94\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.880\nI'm going to right-click here,\ngo to Properties.\n\n95\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.950\nAnd this is the Ad Operations Manager\nwizard that we will use.\n\n96\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.800\nWe'll just scroll this out so\nwe can see that a little more clearly.\n\n97\n00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.680\nIt starts out by telling us what all\nthe required management packs are.\n\n98\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.420\nSo if you don't remember what they are,\nyou can look in the show notes.\n\n99\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.788\nYou didn't make a note when I was talking,\n\n100\n00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:10.000\nthey are sitting right there on the screen\nfor you, you could see them right there.\n\n101\n00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.280\nOnce we have done that,\nwe have to specify the server name.\n\n102\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.970\nThis is the server that the OpsManager\nis on that we are targeting,\n\n103\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.360\nnot the VM server which we are already on.\n\n104\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.960\nSo we wanna make sure we put the right\nname of the right instance in here.\n\n105\n00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.967\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n106\n00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:30.820\nplabsis01, practicelabs.com,\nfully-qualified domain name.\n\n107\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.360\nJust make sure we have done that.\n\n108\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.360\nWe then use either our VMM service\naccount and/or a run as account,\n\n109\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.990\nwe talked about run as accounts\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n110\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.650\nYou know about those now, and how to set\nthose up, so we could do either one.\n\n111\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.820\nNow we'll just point out to you here.\n\n112\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.814\nAnd we talked about this with VMM earlier,\nand talked about how,\n\n113\n00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:54.170\nin several earlier episodes, how we could\nenable and set up certain activities.\n\n114\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.390\nPro is something we've talked about or\nmentioned some of our earlier episodes.\n\n115\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.930\nYou'll hear it come up again later,\nin some of the following episodes.\n\n116\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.960\nTowards the end of our time together,\n\n117\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.450\nwe'll be talking about how to integrate\nand set up and use Pro, and use Pro tips,\n\n118\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.050\nand what those are, and\nwhy they're important.\n\n119\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.370\nPro is gonna be performance, and,\nperformance and resource optimization.\n\n120\n00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.360\nIt is very similar to the DRS\nfunctionality in VMware if you're familiar\n\n121\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.260\nwith DRS, or\nshipping to resource scheduling.\n\n122\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.150\nPro-active monitoring of our host\nclusters, and then load balancing of\n\n123\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.230\nthem by moving virtual machines around\nto take full advantage of that.\n\n124\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.900\nPro operates a very similar way.\n\n125\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.670\nDynamic optimization is part\nof that technology as well.\n\n126\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.240\nSo that's what that does.\n\n127\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.356\nAnd then enabling maintenance\nmode integration with OpsManager,\n\n128\n00:05:41.356 --> 00:05:43.960\nnotice both of these are selected\nwith them out of the box.\n\n129\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.830\nMeaning, if I leave these both selected, I\nwill fully integrate my capabilities here\n\n130\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.430\nwith VMM and Orchestrator, excuse me,\nOrchestrator, I said Orchestrator.\n\n131\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.040\nI meant Operations Manager.\n\n132\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.610\nAnd as a result, what we will do is\ntake full advantage of our ability.\n\n133\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.150\nAnd we showed you this in one\nof the other console runs,\n\n134\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.930\nthrough on the OpsManager side.\n\n135\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.960\nWhere we can use maintenance mode\nto be able to take action, and\n\n136\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.770\nto take a system, and put it into\na state where we can work with it.\n\n137\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.730\nAnd evacuate all our virtual\nmachines that may be running,\n\n138\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.900\nor stop using that system,\ndepending on what it's being used for.\n\n139\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.555\nAnd so, we can integrate that here.\n\n140\n00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:18.835\nAnd so\nwe're gonna leave those checked off.\n\n141\n00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:21.765\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n142\n00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:26.565\nWe're gonna put in our user credential\ndomain user name and password.\n\n143\n00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:30.285\nThat will what the credential\nOpsManager should use\n\n144\n00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:32.215\nto connect back into the VMM server.\n\n145\n00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:35.535\nIt says here, this is gonna be assigned\nadmin rights on the VMM server.\n\n146\n00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:40.095\nSo, we gotta have an account that will\nbe able to do that, and specify that.\n\n147\n00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:44.120\nSo we'll put in our Domain name,\nwe'll put in our account.\n\n148\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.280\nWe use our administrator account for this.\n\n149\n00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.430\nWe'll do our password.\n\n150\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.160\nLet me just make sure I typed\nthat correctly, cuz I got\n\n151\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.330\na feeling that I have hit a key that was\nnot gonna be registered properly there.\n\n152\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.880\nWe'll give that just a minute to go off,\ncheck, do its thing.\n\n153\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.270\nOnce that is done,\nwe'll then get our summary.\n\n154\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.890\nAnd we'll be able to essentially go and\nget this started.\n\n155\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.490\nYou'll see there, we got our summary.\n\n156\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.160\nI was showing you the PowerShell\nscripts that take place for\n\n157\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.750\na lot of this in prior episodes.\n\n158\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.930\nRemember, you can always go under\nthe hood and take a look at that as well.\n\n159\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.110\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Finish.\n\n160\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.810\nThis is now going to\nbring up our job monitor.\n\n161\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.160\nAnd you could see that it has started.\n\n162\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.860\nNow, this is gonna take a while.\n\n163\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.870\nI've done this exact demo in other\nepisodes for the 10964 class.\n\n164\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.980\nYou hear us refer to that sometimes.\n\n165\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.280\nAnd that set of shows,\nthat episode in particular does this.\n\n166\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.950\nWe're not going to wait for this,\nit's going to take about 15 minutes.\n\n167\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.790\nSo I just kick this off.\n\n168\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.500\nWe're going to let this\ncook in the background.\n\n169\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.790\nI'm gonna go off, do some other stuff.\n\n170\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.690\nWe'll poke our heads back in\ntowards the end of the episode, and\n\n171\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.460\njust see that it's done.\n\n172\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.730\nBut we're not going to wait on this.\n\n173\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.920\nBecause it's going to hang.\n\n174\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.995\nAnd just so you know, in the real world,\nit's gonna hang at 10% for, I don't know,\n\n175\n00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:47.685\nprobably a good five to ten minutes.\n\n176\n00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:49.254\nAnd then all of the sudden,\nit's gonna jump to about 40 or 50.\n\n177\n00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:51.004\nThen it's gonna hang for a bit.\n\n178\n00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:51.675\nIt's gonna jump again.\n\n179\n00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:54.322\nSo, it is one of those things where\nit seems like it's doing nothing for\n\n180\n00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:56.583\na while Then all of a sudden it's\ndone a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n181\n00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:59.332\nThen it does some more thinking and\ndoes some more stuff.\n\n182\n00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:00.550\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n183\n00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.440\nWe'll leave that up, we'll kinda let\nthat do its thing, and then as I said,\n\n184\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.810\nwe'll poke our nose back in and\ntake a look when we're done.\n\n185\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.440\nBut once we have done that, and\n\n186\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.910\nwe've actually set up\nthe integration with SCOM and VMM.\n\n187\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.070\nAll this is the backend work and\n\n188\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.250\nthe prerequisite to actually being\nable to do the fabric monitoring.\n\n189\n00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.860\nWe haven't started fabric monitoring.\n\n190\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.150\nAll we've done is lay down\nthe foundational elements and\n\n191\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.730\nthe connectivity required\nto enable us to do that.\n\n192\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.750\nAt that point, once we've installed and\n\n193\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.540\nconfigured the connectivity\nbetween VMM and SCOM.\n\n194\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.180\nImported all the prereq management\npacks on the SCOM side to allow\n\n195\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.750\nthis process to work.\n\n196\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.020\nWe've installed the ops\nconsole on the VMM system.\n\n197\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.886\nPut a Microsoft monitoring\nagent onto the VMM box.\n\n198\n00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:43.780\nThen, we can import the VMM fabric\ndashboard 2012 R2 management pack\n\n199\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.430\nspecific to monitoring the VMM fabric.\n\n200\n00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.040\nThat's a separate management pack.\n\n201\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.480\nWe would download it, install or import.\n\n202\n00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.010\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe'll get our cloud health view.\n\n203\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.230\nThese are the views we get.\n\n204\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.690\nWe get our fabric health dashboard and\nour fabric monitoring diagram.\n\n205\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.390\nWe get the ability to interact with and\nstart working with the fabric.\n\n206\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.290\nAnd so that's gonna be brought in.\n\n207\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.670\nAnd that's going to be imported after\nwe get done with this whole process and\n\n208\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.630\nthis set up.\n\n209\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.860\nI showed you in the last episode where\nwe could go to get a list of all\n\n210\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.640\nthe management packs from\nMicrosoft on the TechNet site,\n\n211\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.530\nyou would actually be able to download the\nfabric dashboard or the fabric monitoring\n\n212\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.630\npack directly from there,\nimport it in the SCOM and then set it up.\n\n213\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.710\nRemember you got to do all\nthe backend work we're doing first.\n\n214\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.560\nYou don't import that management\npack before all this other\n\n215\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.520\nstuff is done because it will not\nset up and instantiate correctly.\n\n216\n00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.610\nYou'll get an error because\nall the prereqs are not met,\n\n217\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.340\nand the management pack will not set up.\n\n218\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.660\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n219\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.650\nWe also can integrate of\nthe SCOM management and\n\n220\n00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.390\nsystem center management thought\nprocess with Windows Azure.\n\n221\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.570\nWe've been talking about cloud,\ncloud fabric, cloud monitoring.\n\n222\n00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.220\nIt's not just the VMM fabric,\nit may be the Azure fabric we're using for\n\n223\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.560\nhosting at Microsoft\nin their data centers.\n\n224\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.340\nAnd we have a management pack for\nthat as we say.\n\n225\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.540\nInstead of an app for that we now can say\nwe have a management pack for that, so-\n\n226\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.496\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty nifty.\n\n227\n00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:00.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is SCOM-like as we would say.\n\n228\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.030\nSo we do have a management pack that\nwill let us do the Azure integration or\n\n229\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.170\nAzure fabric.\n\n230\n00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.640\nThe System Center Management Pack for\nWindows Azure is what it's called.\n\n231\n00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.190\nAgain, go to that website we\nshowed you in the last episode.\n\n232\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.410\nDownload that, you would find it there.\n\n233\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.160\nYou do need some prereqs for that.\n\n234\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.490\nOps Manager must be\nrunning at least 2012 SP1,\n\n235\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.850\nso one prior version back from\n12R2 that we're talking about.\n\n236\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.120\nThat would have to be there.\n\n237\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.380\nCertainly 12R2 would support that as well.\n\n238\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.680\nWe need the internet connectivity, so\n\n239\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.420\nat least one of the management servers in\nthe resource pool has to be able to go out\n\n240\n00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.480\nto the internet to get\nthe management pack, and\n\n241\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.700\nthen the Azure diagnostics capability\nhave to be enabled on the Azure side,\n\n242\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.660\nmeaning your Azure fabric\nsubscription has to include and\n\n243\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.710\nhave turned on the Azure diagnostics\ncapability, the log analytics and\n\n244\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.670\nthe deep Insight capabilities\non the Azure fabric.\n\n245\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.160\nThat is separate, meaning you would have\nto have your Azure subscription setup,\n\n246\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.920\nyou'd have to be creating an account on\nMicrosoft, paying your monthly as you go.\n\n247\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.080\nYou can create free accounts\nto try this out, by the way.\n\n248\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.170\nWe'll take you to the landing page and\n\n249\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.040\nshow you to do that if you\nhaven't done that yet.\n\n250\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.710\nBut, you do wanna know that if you're\nactually gonna do this for real,\n\n251\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.900\nyou're gonna have that account set up,\nyou're paying your subscription,\n\n252\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.580\nyou will have to follow the instructions\nto enable the Azure diagnostics, and\n\n253\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.160\nuse the log analytics and the insight\ncapabilities there, have that all set up.\n\n254\n00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.020\nOnce we do that, and we set up and\nimport the system center management pack,\n\n255\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.290\nwe have to configure it to go out and\nfind the Azure resources.\n\n256\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.640\nSo we have to put our subscription\ninformation in, tell it how to connect.\n\n257\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.000\nWe have to validate our account,\nmake sure we can get in,\n\n258\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.200\nwe have an authorized tenant, or\nan authorized instance we can work with.\n\n259\n00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.990\nSo then once we do that, we'll then be\nable to go through a configure monitoring\n\n260\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.620\nin the management pack of\nthe discovered resources.\n\n261\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.520\nBecause we do not automatically start\nmonitoring with this management pack,\n\n262\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.510\nunlike many others.\n\n263\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.262\nMany others you put in, once you start\ndeploying them and setting them up those,\n\n264\n00:11:47.262 --> 00:11:48.830\nthose management packs\ngo live immediately.\n\n265\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.700\nThis one has to be configured because\nof the tie back to the Microsoft\n\n266\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.670\ncloud fabric, and\nthe fact that by default out of the box,\n\n267\n00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.050\nwe're not gonna know what\nthose credentials are.\n\n268\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.256\nWe have no way of understanding whether or\n\n269\n00:11:58.256 --> 00:12:01.666\nnot you have an authorized instance\nthat you can monitor again.\n\n270\n00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:05.280\nSo this management pack requires\nconfiguration after importation.\n\n271\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.990\nMany others do not.\n\n272\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.560\nThey will startup automatically.\n\n273\n00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.980\nYou have to have your X509 D3\n\n274\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.230\ndigital certificates set up\nto be able to authenticate.\n\n275\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.940\nSo there is some work you're\ngonna have to do here.\n\n276\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.375\nAnd once you have done that,\n\n277\n00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:21.335\ngone through and run\nthe Add Windows Azure Subscription Wizard,\n\n278\n00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:23.745\nI'm just looking at my notes so\nI can remember the name of the wizard.\n\n279\n00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:26.585\nOnce you've done all that,\nyou'll provide your credentials and\n\n280\n00:12:26.585 --> 00:12:28.747\neverything will link up to Azure,\nwill validate you.\n\n281\n00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.847\nAnd then once we have that all set up,\nyou'll actually then be able to\n\n282\n00:12:31.847 --> 00:12:35.687\nfind a Windows Azure node in\nthe admin pane in the ops console.\n\n283\n00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:38.777\nAnd you'll have all that, you'll be\nable to go in and work with that, and\n\n284\n00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:39.427\nthat will all be there.\n\n285\n00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:40.777\nAs a matter of fact,\ngive me half a second.\n\n286\n00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:45.077\nI'm not gonna show you what it looks like,\nbut I'll just show you where it would be.\n\n287\n00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:47.860\nSo if we go back in,\njust give me a second,\n\n288\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.811\nI'm just scrolling down to get here,\nand where are my management packs?\n\n289\n00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:55.196\nThere they are right up there.\n\n290\n00:12:55.196 --> 00:13:01.295\nSo let me just click here and\nget that to come up.\n\n291\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.350\nWe'll wait just a second-\n&gt;&gt; Clickity, click, click.\n\n292\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think my console\njust disconnected.\n\n293\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.370\nGive me just a second to\nspawn the console up again.\n\n294\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.700\nI think it just froze and\nit's not running.\n\n295\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.450\nSo I'm just going to reconnect back in and\nit'll take just a second.\n\n296\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.200\nWe have them up and running,\n\n297\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.520\nI'll just have to open a new console back\ninto the system in order to get there so\n\n298\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.920\nI'll just spawn that back up.\n\n299\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.890\nIt just freezes every so often so\nsometimes we just have to reconnect to it.\n\n300\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.450\nWe'll just go full screen here just so\nwe can get that back.\n\n301\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.090\nAll right, there we go.\n\n302\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.250\nSee it's connecting back out and\nit'll come back up with no trouble.\n\n303\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.390\nAll right, so let me just click\nin to our management pack area.\n\n304\n00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.950\nAnd no, actually, you know what?\n\n305\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.916\nIt is frozen I think.\n\n306\n00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:40.704\nI think our console actually froze.\n\n307\n00:13:40.704 --> 00:13:42.428\n&gt;&gt; Are we going to start singing,\nlet it go?\n\n308\n00:13:42.428 --> 00:13:45.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to close and yeah exactly.\n\n309\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.220\nI'm gonna open it back up.\n\n310\n00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.540\nIt may have just frozen,\nthe console itself may have locked up so\n\n311\n00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.430\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\nget that to open back up for us.\n\n312\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.730\nSo let me just spawn this while\nwe're talking really quickly.\n\n313\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.060\nHighlight that, one second.\n\n314\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.980\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n315\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.020\n&gt;&gt; And there we go,\njust gonna load it back up real quick.\n\n316\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.140\nIt does that every so often, so sometimes\nwhen it sits idle for a little bit,\n\n317\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.265\nit doesn't always remember that we're\nthere and we're actually relying on it.\n\n318\n00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:07.201\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Decides to take\n\n319\n00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:09.190\na coffee break [CROSSTALK]\nif that's the case, so\n\n320\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.383\nwe're just gonna give it\na second to connect back in.\n\n321\n00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:16.800\nAnd then we should be able to bring\nit up and be able to take a look.\n\n322\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.450\nI was just gonna show you just\nwhile waiting on it to load.\n\n323\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.660\nI was just gonna show you that we were\njust gonna see the management pack error.\n\n324\n00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.190\nI was gonna show you that we would see\nthe management packs listed there.\n\n325\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.420\nBut it's not important right now.\n\n326\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.850\nWe'll bring it back up in a few minutes.\n\n327\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.960\nIt may also be running slow because of\nthe fact we're trying to tie VMM in,\n\n328\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.940\nso it's hitting that server box right now,\ntrying to work with it.\n\n329\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.690\nAnd so sometimes, when that's happening,\n\n330\n00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.360\nwe may actually have an issue where the\nconsole will freeze for periods of time.\n\n331\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.890\nAnd that may just be what's going on,\n\n332\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.960\nbecause as I looked at the VMM\nintegration, that wizard was still sitting\n\n333\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.550\nI think roughly at, yeah, it's sitting at\nabout 10% still, so it hasn't moved yet.\n\n334\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.890\nSo it's hammering away at that,\ntrying to get all that done, and\n\n335\n00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.310\nthat may be why we're seeing that.\n\n336\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.040\nAll right, so\n\n337\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.180\none other thing I want to take a look\nat just while we're waiting on that.\n\n338\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.160\nIf we bring back up my machine\nI just want to show you.\n\n339\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.980\nWe're talking about the Azure fabric.\n\n340\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.850\nTalking about the analytics and\nthe inside capabilities.\n\n341\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.588\nOps manager suite,\nessentially ops manager in the sky, or\n\n342\n00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:07.996\nops manager in the sky with diamonds.\n\n343\n00:15:07.996 --> 00:15:08.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like Lucy in the sky\n\n344\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.480\nwith diamonds, but\nwe have a cloud capability now.\n\n345\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.560\nWe can run the ops manager suite.\n\n346\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.020\nAs a service we can grab it\nessentially from Microsoft.\n\n347\n00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.941\nAs part of the Azure fabric\nwe can actually use this.\n\n348\n00:15:18.941 --> 00:15:22.466\nYou'll see here this is Microsoft's\nCloud Based IT Management Solution,\n\n349\n00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:25.910\nmonitoring and protecting your on pram and\ncloud infrastructure.\n\n350\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.540\nThis does both.\n\n351\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.870\nIt will monitor down from the cloud\ninto your on prem data center.\n\n352\n00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.000\nIt will let you monitor from\non prem up into the cloud or\n\n353\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.400\nlet you monitor through the cloud.\n\n354\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.940\nSo this is gonna give\nus full capabilities.\n\n355\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.850\nImplement it as a cloud based service,\nyou have it up and running quickly so\n\n356\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.830\nwe're not worried about setting up\nall of the back end infrastructure\n\n357\n00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.410\nlike some of the stuff\nthat we're doing here.\n\n358\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.100\nWe deliver features automatically,\nyou know all the bells and whistles and\n\n359\n00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.470\nall the reasons why this\nwould be valuable to you.\n\n360\n00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.162\nMicrosoft maintains it,\nbuilds it, updates it.\n\n361\n00:15:51.162 --> 00:15:54.667\nAll you do is pay your money and consume,\nwhich is a good thing ultimately.\n\n362\n00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:58.475\nSo they do walk us through here, Some of\nthe different options I was mentioning,\n\n363\n00:15:58.475 --> 00:15:59.203\nthe insight and\n\n364\n00:15:59.203 --> 00:16:02.683\nanalytics capabilities that we would\nbe leveraging with Windows Azure.\n\n365\n00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:06.737\nFabric management packs, so the log\ninsights, log analytic capabilities\n\n366\n00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:10.845\nwhat we're talking about specifically,\nso we'll take a look at that.\n\n367\n00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:14.425\nWe do have capabilities for automation and\ncontrol with our Runbooks and so\n\n368\n00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:17.575\nthink, Orchestrator and\ncreated Runbooks to automate things.\n\n369\n00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:21.635\nWe do have that, but we also have the\nPowerShell capability there so we can use\n\n370\n00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:26.432\nPowerShell to be able to create create and\nto actually go in and manage automation.\n\n371\n00:16:26.432 --> 00:16:29.651\nWe have protection and\ndisaster recovery with Azure back up and\n\n372\n00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:31.162\nAzure site recovery.\n\n373\n00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:33.232\nSo this is our BCDR solution in the cloud.\n\n374\n00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:37.670\nWhere our Microsoft does the back-ups and\nmaintain's and archives them for us.\n\n375\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.860\nSafely and securely holds onto them so\nthat if we need them we can simply\n\n376\n00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.390\ngo in through a web interface and\nmanagement console, and set back up and\n\n377\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.000\nthen ultimately restore our\ninfrastructuring very quick time.\n\n378\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.420\nSo this is a very big-\n&gt;&gt; Pretty awesome.\n\n379\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:50.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n380\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.608\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n381\n00:16:51.608 --> 00:16:53.088\nWe do have a fully audited and\n\n382\n00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:56.468\nsecure solution according to the most\nrecent standards that we are aligning\n\n383\n00:16:56.468 --> 00:16:58.208\nwith.\nAnd so, we can learn more about any and\n\n384\n00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:01.018\nall these, we're interested in\nlogin analytics, in particular.\n\n385\n00:17:01.018 --> 00:17:02.550\nSo we'll just go through, drill in there.\n\n386\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.650\nYou could see there is some information\non the log analytics learn about it.\n\n387\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.231\nAnd so we can go in, we get started.\n\n388\n00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:09.260\nWe can take a look at that.\n\n389\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.860\nBut as you go here,\nyou'll see we talked a little about this,\n\n390\n00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.570\nit's part of the service\nin the OMS solution.\n\n391\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.200\nWe do have a nice little area here.\n\n392\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.260\nAnd what you'll see if you take a look.\n\n393\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.080\nCan we go full screen just\nto see this real quick?\n\n394\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.865\nSince I can't make the diagram bigger but\nyou can at least just see it.\n\n395\n00:17:23.865 --> 00:17:27.870\nBut you'll see that we have over here,\nyou know our data sources, our solutions,\n\n396\n00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.340\nour connected sources.\n\n397\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.520\nAnd we have all of our information\nstreaming in to our OMS repository or\n\n398\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.760\noperations manager.\n\n399\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.230\nService repository here for\nthe suite, think database, right?\n\n400\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.000\nEssentially.\n\n401\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.800\nAnd then we have the ability\nto be able to do all of our\n\n402\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.370\ndeep introspection and searching.\n\n403\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:48.470\nSo think SEM, think aggregated logs, and\ndoing the searching and the indexing.\n\n404\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.540\nAnd then we have our alerts,\nour dashboards, our Power BI,\n\n405\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.480\nand our export capabilities.\n\n406\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.610\nSo we're running a full suite of\nanalytics against that common repository\n\n407\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.500\nas we're pulling in all of our\nconnected items that we wanna monitor.\n\n408\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.610\nSo this is gonna be\nthe traditional definition,\n\n409\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.980\nright, of what that cloud solution\nlooks like and what we wanna see.\n\n410\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.740\nSo it's a very valuable\nthought process for us.\n\n411\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.030\nIt's got some really interesting and\npretty cool dashboards and capabilities if\n\n412\n00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.775\nyou haven't been in and seen the product,\nthis is what it actually looks like.\n\n413\n00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:18.120\nThis is just the standard\noverview dashboard that we see.\n\n414\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.985\nBut, we've got these little work space or\ncard like tiles that we click on and\n\n415\n00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:23.945\ninteract with.\n\n416\n00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:27.225\nAnd then obviously based on what\nwe wanna see we can drill down and\n\n417\n00:18:27.225 --> 00:18:29.119\ntake a look at any of\nthose areas in more depth.\n\n418\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.310\nDo have detailed reporting as\nyou can see so we drill in,\n\n419\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:38.050\nwe get some very detailed diagnostic\nreporting and data slicing capabilities so\n\n420\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.310\nwe can get a nice quick overview.\n\n421\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.490\nWe can see a dashboard like\nconcept with overview monitoring.\n\n422\n00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.380\nThis looks similar to\nthe dashboard view I showed you-\n\n423\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Earlier, with the widgets.\n\n424\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, with the widgets.\n\n425\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.750\nJust, this has obviously got a little more\ndata in it, and some more widgets, or\n\n426\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.660\nsome more areas set up.\n\n427\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.352\nBut we've got nine of them here.\n\n428\n00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:58.731\nRemember, I told you the maximum\nnumber on the page view for\n\n429\n00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:00.070\ndashboard with widgets is 90.\n\n430\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.280\nYou can see each one of them is just\nbroken out and set up individually.\n\n431\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.110\nSo we have all of that which is nice.\n\n432\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.680\nAnd we just have different\nsolution views and\n\n433\n00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.530\ncapabilities based on what we're seeing.\n\n434\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.290\nBut as you go through you can learn\na little bit more about this, and\n\n435\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.360\nwhat it looks like,\nthe architecture discussion is here.\n\n436\n00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.190\nSo you can see what this looks like and\nhow this is set up.\n\n437\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.840\nYou've got a VM here with\nan agent that we're monitoring.\n\n438\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.530\nOutside.\n\n439\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.770\nWe've got SCOM agent here on\na SCOM management service.\n\n440\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.850\nThat should look familiar to us.\n\n441\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.450\nThat's what we're looking at.\n\n442\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.700\nWe've got some other items here\nthat our local in our area.\n\n443\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.400\nAnd then,\nwe've got our Azure fabric over here.\n\n444\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.010\nAnd we're linking this into\nthe cloud as you can see.\n\n445\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.760\nAll this data from all these sources\noutside are flowing back in to the OMS\n\n446\n00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.320\nrepository, and being analyzed with real\ntime analytics in the OMS work space.\n\n447\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.290\nThat's our dashboard that we're opening up\nand we're using that we have set up and\n\n448\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.320\nwe are subscribing to through Azure.\n\n449\n00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.430\nAnd we are using that,\non the back end we have our storage,\n\n450\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.350\nwe have our resource capabilities and\nwe may have VMs that are running\n\n451\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.760\nin the Azure Fabric that\nare also being monitored, right?\n\n452\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we could have Cloud base resources,\n\n453\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.150\nlocal resources,\nessentially On-Prem if you will, and\n\n454\n00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.990\nwe're combining the two,\nwe have a hardware solution.\n\n455\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.870\nSo we do have the ability to go in and see\nall of this here, so they've give us some\n\n456\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.800\ninformation, you got a free account\nif you want to sign up for one here\n\n457\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.490\nthis is the same link, by the way, just\ngo back up to the top of the page here.\n\n458\n00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.850\nYou can go in and set up a free account.\n\n459\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.450\nThat's I was saying, if you haven't\ndone this yet you may want to go in and\n\n460\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.270\ntake a look.\n\n461\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.610\nYou can go in and get a free account and\n\n462\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.740\nplay around with it a little bit,\nwhich is nice.\n\n463\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.944\nAnd just get it stood up.\n\n464\n00:20:29.944 --> 00:20:31.402\nYou could see whether or\nnot it makes sense for you.\n\n465\n00:20:31.402 --> 00:20:35.160\nYou'll see here,\nyou get a $200 free hosting credit.\n\n466\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.320\nSo, you'll like all the major services,\n\n467\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.400\nyou are paying with a certain\namount of money for\n\n468\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.080\nservices every billable minute, every\nbillable hour, or percentage thereof.\n\n469\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.760\nAnd so\nyou work down that credit fairly quickly,\n\n470\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.780\ndepending on how many\nservices you turn on.\n\n471\n00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.220\nBut if you wanna go in and try it,\nit's good for that amount of time, and\n\n472\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.780\nthen obviously you can add\nadditional information or\n\n473\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.860\nrather add additional\ncapabilities by paying as you go.\n\n474\n00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.870\nBut you can go in and you do all this and\n\n475\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.810\nif you don't wanna do anything after that\nit's essentially free, you just walk away.\n\n476\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.970\nIf you wanna convert that account you\ncan convert it, put a credit card in and\n\n477\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.400\nactually use the account to start up\na subscription and use it for real.\n\n478\n00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.130\nSo it's a great way to get familiar\nwith and get acquainted with\n\n479\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.180\nwithout actually having to go in and\ninvest the money time and effort to\n\n480\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.390\nset up the infrastructure only to find\nout that it may not actually be working.\n\n481\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.420\nIt may not work for you or\nmay not be something you wanna use.\n\n482\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.200\nSo it's a nice way to get your\ntoes in the water, so to speak.\n\n483\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.910\nSo you may wanna go in and\ntake a look at that real quick.\n\n484\n00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.565\nSet up an account, and\nthen link it to your on prem solution and\n\n485\n00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:32.685\nstart monitoring to see\nwhat it looks like.\n\n486\n00:21:32.685 --> 00:21:34.815\nNo cost to do that in other words right?\n\n487\n00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:35.855\nJust something to consider.\n\n488\n00:21:35.855 --> 00:21:37.805\nAll right let's just go\ncheck real quick and\n\n489\n00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:40.665\nsee what's going on with\nour other machines.\n\n490\n00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:42.540\nGive me just a second here.\n\n491\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.090\nAnd where are we?\n\n492\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.800\nThere we are right there,\n\n493\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.520\nalright so we do have let's just see\nif we can get our view, move in here.\n\n494\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:59.710\nOpps that's the wrong machine,\nthat's the one I want.\n\n495\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.650\nSo let's see.\n\n496\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.020\nJust wait for active alerts to come up\nthere, populate for just one second.\n\n497\n00:22:07.728 --> 00:22:10.980\nAll right, so you can see we finally\ngot the console working again.\n\n498\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.670\nYou try hard enough,\n\n499\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.030\njust goes to show you can actually get-\n&gt;&gt; Perseverance, Adam.\n\n500\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.920\n&gt;&gt; You get to make some headway.\n\n501\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.140\nPerseverance is important in\nthis business, absolutely.\n\n502\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.650\nSo we kinda bullied the console\ninto submission here offline and\n\n503\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.880\ngot it working for us.\n\n504\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.870\nSo now what we're gonna\ndo is just go back in and\n\n505\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.110\nshow you what we were gonna talk about.\n\n506\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.350\nWe had mentioned, I had mentioned we\nwanted to take a look at after we were\n\n507\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.100\ndoing the integration with VMM and\nhave the two already setup running.\n\n508\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.200\nWe had our management packs installed,\nwe had all that done.\n\n509\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.050\nWhat we're gonna do now is just take\na look quickly at the management pack\n\n510\n00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.830\ntemplates.\n\n511\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.092\nYou see we're in the authoring area.\n\n512\n00:22:41.092 --> 00:22:43.812\nWe're up at the top if you remember one of\nthe prior episodes we had spent some time\n\n513\n00:22:43.812 --> 00:22:45.138\nto scroll down so you could see it here.\n\n514\n00:22:45.138 --> 00:22:48.840\nWe spent some time looking at management\npack objects down at the bottom.\n\n515\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.460\nHow were management packs made?\n\n516\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.220\nWhat goes into them?\n\n517\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.990\nThe monitors.\n\n518\n00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.320\nThe rules, the task, the over rides.\n\n519\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.970\nAll that stuff.\n\n520\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.234\nSo we've been through all that but\nalso, when we think about\n\n521\n00:22:58.234 --> 00:23:01.818\ndoing our monitoring cloud based\napplications, we have to use and\n\n522\n00:23:01.818 --> 00:23:05.986\nthink about using our templates at\nleast understand what's there for them.\n\n523\n00:23:05.986 --> 00:23:07.529\nSo I want to spend\na couple minutes with you,\n\n524\n00:23:07.529 --> 00:23:09.805\ngoing through the templates here\nwe can kind of see them listed.\n\n525\n00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:13.635\nWhat the components parts are and\nexplain why they are important to us.\n\n526\n00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:17.102\nSo we're gonna do a deeper dive in .NET\napplication performance monitoring.\n\n527\n00:23:17.102 --> 00:23:20.795\nAnd web application availability\nmonitoring in some up coming episodes.\n\n528\n00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:22.953\nSo we're not really gonna go in and\ndemo those per say, but\n\n529\n00:23:22.953 --> 00:23:25.335\nwe'll talk about what they area and\nwhat they do.\n\n530\n00:23:25.335 --> 00:23:29.679\nWhen we set up any of these templates what\nwe are doing is taking a pre made form\n\n531\n00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:34.150\nthat's got some settings associated with\nit, tweaking and customizing as needed and\n\n532\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.950\nthen we're able to once we do that,\nuse the ad monitoring wizard.\n\n533\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.638\nWe're gonna walk through and just least\ntake a look at what that may look like\n\n534\n00:23:40.638 --> 00:23:41.907\nto test various aspects of things.\n\n535\n00:23:41.907 --> 00:23:45.614\nIn the case of the OLE DB data source\nwe're checking the connectivity and\n\n536\n00:23:45.614 --> 00:23:49.468\nthe interactivity of our data source and\nlooking at database monitoring.\n\n537\n00:23:49.468 --> 00:23:52.922\nSo that's gonna look at performance and\navailability of a database for us.\n\n538\n00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:55.981\nWhen we look at process monitoring,\nas you can see here,\n\n539\n00:23:55.981 --> 00:24:00.061\nlooking at processes that we want to\nmonitor and check or grill down on them so\n\n540\n00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:03.950\nwe can look at things that are running\non agent managed computers.\n\n541\n00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.980\nSo for instance, if we go in here,\ntake a look what to add monitoring wizard\n\n542\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.050\nwe will run through just\nsee what one may look like.\n\n543\n00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.970\nIf we can go full screen let me just hide\nthe task bar what we are doing is just at\n\n544\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.220\nthe bottom of the monitor just a second.\n\n545\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.250\nSo do that, so when we do this,\n\n546\n00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.340\nwhen we go in, we'll see that\nwe get our ad monitoring wizard.\n\n547\n00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.430\nAnd we have again the ability to\nchoose the appropriate template so\n\n548\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.890\nlet's make sure we choose the one\nthat we're working on there.\n\n549\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.600\nAnd notice this when I choose, I'm getting\na good four options off to the left.\n\n550\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.510\nIf I choose, make sure that is file\nmonitoring, it's gonna be different,\n\n551\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.200\nif I choose web application,\n\n552\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.450\nability monitoring it'll be different so\nit's complex, I'll choose whatever.\n\n553\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.810\nRather will program in and\nprovide information for\n\n554\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.370\nwhatever template we have chosen.\n\n555\n00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.940\nSo we'll do process monitoring,\nwe'll click next.\n\n556\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.060\nWe have to give the monitor a name here or\nthe template instance a name, so\n\n557\n00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.568\nwe'll call this ITProTV procmon notepad,\n\n558\n00:24:57.568 --> 00:25:01.495\nright or whatever we're going to monitor.\n\n559\n00:25:01.495 --> 00:25:05.115\nWe'll go ahead and select our management\npack that we're going to bind this to.\n\n560\n00:25:05.115 --> 00:25:08.025\nRemember, we're selecting\nthe management pack\n\n561\n00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:10.552\nthat we want to bind this monitor too.\n\n562\n00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:13.432\nYou just want to take the objects from the\nmanagement pack that we've been talking\n\n563\n00:25:13.432 --> 00:25:14.482\nabout and use them.\n\n564\n00:25:14.482 --> 00:25:18.462\nAnd one of the most important objects\nin the movement pack was the monitors.\n\n565\n00:25:18.462 --> 00:25:19.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We talked about those, right.\n\n566\n00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:20.952\nSo we're going to leverage those and\n\n567\n00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:23.842\nthat’s why we're putting in our\nmanagement pack association.\n\n568\n00:25:23.842 --> 00:25:25.492\nWe can create a new one\nhere if we don't have one.\n\n569\n00:25:25.492 --> 00:25:28.042\nIf we want to create a new\none specifically for\n\n570\n00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:31.500\nthis, we'll just go in quickly and\ncreate one it’s no big deal.\n\n571\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.240\nLet's call this prop man notepad or\n\n572\n00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.090\nwhatever we would call it and\nwe'll just go ahead and hit create,\n\n573\n00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.340\nthat is just going to create a brand\nnew management shelf pack and the pack\n\n574\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.500\nitself is really just a container,\nit's an empty shell it's modular.\n\n575\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.000\nIt is then going to let us plug in all\nthese objects that we've been talking\n\n576\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.480\nabout and that management pack shell is\nnow sitting in our adminstration works.\n\n577\n00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.770\nSpace here up under\nthe management pack area.\n\n578\n00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.420\nWe've just instantiated it,\nnow we can go ahead and just use that and\n\n579\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.660\ncontain our monitor and that management\npack instead of necessarily having\n\n580\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.960\nto associate it with one of\nthe ones that's already there.\n\n581\n00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.040\nIt's up to us to decide how we wanna\ndo this because we're gonna specify\n\n582\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.410\nthe process to monitor, what running\nprocesses, performance stats we want.\n\n583\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.480\nSo we can do this either way.\n\n584\n00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.650\nIt'll be up to us to decide.\n\n585\n00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.510\nIf we wanna leave it there,\nwe can leave it there, we'll go ahead and\n\n586\n00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.210\nmonitor whether and\nhow a process is running.\n\n587\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:26.210\nIn other words do I wanna see that that\nprocess is running, I want to verify it\n\n588\n00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.620\nis, or I wanna go ahead and monitor\nonly whether the process is running.\n\n589\n00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.695\nIn other words if I don't\nwant a process running.\n\n590\n00:26:31.695 --> 00:26:34.985\nI wanna say hey,\nnotepad.exe should not be running.\n\n591\n00:26:34.985 --> 00:26:38.050\nMonitor will tell me if it is\nversus it should be running,\n\n592\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.635\nMonitor will tell me that it is, right?\n\n593\n00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:43.725\nSo I have an option here as to\nhow I want this be positive or\n\n594\n00:26:43.725 --> 00:26:45.375\nthe negative based on what I go through.\n\n595\n00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.845\nI have to specify the process name.\n\n596\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:57.042\nSo I can go in and\ndo something like see Windows system32.\n\n597\n00:26:57.042 --> 00:27:00.390\nAnd what am I gonna do?\n\n598\n00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.720\n.exe or whatever the case may be.\n\n599\n00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.850\nAnd then we could target\na group to narrow the scope for\n\n600\n00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.310\nmonitoring of this process if I\nchoose to so I can go through.\n\n601\n00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.720\nI can search and pull in other groups.\n\n602\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.150\nIn other words I can say I just\nwanted to be assistance took a group\n\n603\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:21.980\nof objects from this manna from pack or\nI can just leave it broadly scope and\n\n604\n00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.910\nnot to actually specify that it's going\nto be targeted and at any one thing.\n\n605\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.580\nBut I'm going to go in, because you see,\nI have to create something here.\n\n606\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.640\nSo I'm going to go in and I'm going\nto search from all management packs.\n\n607\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.616\nAnd I'm going to target it to, let's see.\n\n608\n00:27:39.752 --> 00:27:40.565\nThe.\n\n609\n00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.384\n&gt;&gt; Which one are we looking for?\n\n610\n00:27:45.384 --> 00:27:47.834\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna do one of\nthe Windows computers down here,\n\n611\n00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.782\nI'm just looking to see\nthe Windows server.\n\n612\n00:27:49.782 --> 00:27:50.282\n&gt;&gt; Which boxes they have.\n\n613\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Windows,\nI see the client computer groups, and\n\n614\n00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.700\nwe can do all Windows client computers,\nfor instance.\n\n615\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.413\nYou have to specify that that's\nthe one it will choose or\n\n616\n00:27:58.413 --> 00:28:00.795\nthe Windows Server Group, I was just\ngoing down to find the Windows listing.\n\n617\n00:28:00.795 --> 00:28:01.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n618\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.115\n&gt;&gt; Cuz their listed at the bottom,\nalphabetically on the Windows.\n\n619\n00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I just gotta scroll all\n\n620\n00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.880\nthe way down to find them.\n\n621\n00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.720\nAll right, so\nwe're just gonna grab that one, right?\n\n622\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.340\nSo we'll do that.\n\n623\n00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.830\nRunning process,\nspecify allowable rate in this for\n\n624\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.025\nthe process instance in th running time.\n\n625\n00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:18.860\nSo, minimum number of processes or maximum\nnumber, how many times is it running.\n\n626\n00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.280\nWanna know that, for how long,\nyou know that kind of thing.\n\n627\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.140\nSo we go ahead and\nprogram in our parameters here.\n\n628\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.130\nSo minimum number may be 1, maximum number\nlet's say would be you know 2 or 3.\n\n629\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.220\nSo I wanna see at least one instance\nrunning but I could you know allow it for\n\n630\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.080\nup to 2 or\nwhatever the case maybe as a monitoring.\n\n631\n00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.630\nHow long is it running for\nduration so I'll specify all that.\n\n632\n00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.340\nThen performance counters I'll take\na look at and say okay based on CPU and\n\n633\n00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.300\nmemory usage what my alert thresholds\nmight be so generated an alert thresholds\n\n634\n00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.710\nmight be If you exceed a certain specified\nvalue threshold there's a percentage.\n\n635\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.660\nSo I can go in and check that.\n\n636\n00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.095\nYou know no patch should be\nchewing up 40% of the CPU's\n\n637\n00:28:56.095 --> 00:28:57.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Something's wrong.\n\n638\n00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.780\n&gt;&gt; I don't think that's\ngoing to be a problem,\n\n639\n00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.080\nbut if it does get out of hand and.\n\n640\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.290\nWe're using not Notepad but\nlike some sort of crazy program.\n\n641\n00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.730\nThen we may wanna monitor it for\nthat, right,\n\n642\n00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.300\ncuz that could actually get out of\nhand and we do wanna know that.\n\n643\n00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.880\nAnd also on the memory side generate for\n\n644\n00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.340\npercentage of memory\nusage in megabytes there.\n\n645\n00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.860\nHow much memory is it using, more likely\nto get closer to the memory one than\n\n646\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.910\nthe percentage on the CPU\nbased on Notepad.\n\n647\n00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.520\nIt's not gonna take that much,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n648\n00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.110\nHow many samples do I want and\nfor how often.\n\n649\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.340\nDo I wanna be sampling, so how often\ndo I read the data from the system,\n\n650\n00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.820\nand use that.\n\n651\n00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.420\nThe default here, 5 minutes, but you can\nsee here there are seconds, hours days, so\n\n652\n00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.460\nI could decide what to do.\n\n653\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.320\nSo I would just choose\nthe numbers here that I want.\n\n654\n00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.450\nFinish that up, click Create, give this\njust a minute, it'll go through and\n\n655\n00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.410\ninstantiate itself,\nonce it does that it'll take a moment.\n\n656\n00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.560\nWe'll see it pop in there, remember we\nmay have to refresh but it will show up.\n\n657\n00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:56.180\nAnd then once it's shown up and\nwe will just refresh.\n\n658\n00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.020\nThere it is right there,\nwe don't need to refresh.\n\n659\n00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.560\nOnce it is there you can\nsee our monitor is there.\n\n660\n00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.760\nWe now have the ability\nto be able to go in, and\n\n661\n00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.080\nwe can look at the properties if we\nneed to change it for some reason.\n\n662\n00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.220\nWe can look at the management pack\nobjects associated with this.\n\n663\n00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:16.340\nAnd so we can now have this and start to\nmonitor using this with our management\n\n664\n00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.680\npack that we've created and actually start\nto track let's say the use of Notepad or\n\n665\n00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.330\nwhatever it is we may be doing since we're\nusing the template for process monitoring.\n\n666\n00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.470\nWe have TCP port.\n\n667\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.290\nThat's gonna manage or\nallow us to understand and look at and\n\n668\n00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.450\nmonitor Open ports and\nport usage for applications.\n\n669\n00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.570\nSo we'll be able to go in and\ncheck the availability of a port.\n\n670\n00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.460\nHey is that port open on that machine?\n\n671\n00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.910\nThat indicates typically that an\napplication or a service is bound to it.\n\n672\n00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.940\nSo we can look for that.\n\n673\n00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.760\nWe do Unix Lennox file logging.\n\n674\n00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.960\nAnd also Unix Linux Process Monitoring.\n\n675\n00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.520\nSo you see we can go in and we can file,\nfile logging, file monitoring is what I\n\n676\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.340\nmeant to say, log file monitoring\nis what I meant to say.\n\n677\n00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.800\nBut we can track the existence\nof log files, and or\n\n678\n00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.710\nprocesses on the UNIX Linux box.\n\n679\n00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.980\nWe actually can do a string match so\nwe can look for items in the file itself.\n\n680\n00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.950\nAnd so, I wanna look for this string or\n\n681\n00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.620\nthis particular string in the log\nfile when we use this template.\n\n682\n00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.671\nAnd say error code 5 or\nwhatever it would be.\n\n683\n00:31:08.671 --> 00:31:09.840\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like Grub?\n\n684\n00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much we can go in and\njust parse for a specific string or\n\n685\n00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.070\nsome sort of an indicator for\ncertain activities.\n\n686\n00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.230\nSo we can look for that.\n\n687\n00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.800\nWe can do process monitoring.\n\n688\n00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.670\nWe have web application\navailability monitoring here.\n\n689\n00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.030\nWe checked the availability of one or\n\n690\n00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:28.650\nmore applications based on the URL\nthat we're using to serve them up.\n\n691\n00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.730\nAnd so we can go in, and we can actually\nsay, hey, I want to check this website.\n\n692\n00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.720\nI want to see if it's available,\nand I want to monitor for it, and\n\n693\n00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.680\nI can look at that.\n\n694\n00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.158\nAnd we can look at web application\ntransaction monitoring.\n\n695\n00:31:38.158 --> 00:31:43.525\nThis lets us look at what the system is\nbehaving as from the user's perspective.\n\n696\n00:31:43.525 --> 00:31:44.672\nWe can actually go in.\n\n697\n00:31:44.672 --> 00:31:46.780\nOne of the things we have\nis the ability to record.\n\n698\n00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.638\nIt actually is like a macro like recorder.\n\n699\n00:31:48.638 --> 00:31:52.145\nTo look at the interaction that a user\nwould have against a web app from\n\n700\n00:31:52.145 --> 00:31:54.697\nthe outside in, and\nwe can see what it looks like.\n\n701\n00:31:54.697 --> 00:31:56.603\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like impersonating\ntheir sessions?\n\n702\n00:31:56.603 --> 00:31:57.920\n&gt;&gt; Something similar to that and\n\n703\n00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.555\nwe can actually see what that performance\nlooks like and we can do stress testing at\n\n704\n00:32:01.555 --> 00:32:05.590\nvarious intervals to see how it's behaving\nover time, which is really kind of nice.\n\n705\n00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.020\nAnd that leads us into another\noption that we have here as well,\n\n706\n00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.450\nsomething called\nGlobal Service Monitoring or GSM,\n\n707\n00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.560\nit's often referred to as\ninside-out monitoring.\n\n708\n00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.130\nWe'll talk more about that in\njust a second on how that works.\n\n709\n00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.340\nAnd then we have the Windows service.\n\n710\n00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.990\nSo we actually can go in here and\n\n711\n00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.565\nwe can, as you could see setup\nstandalone monitor or monitor for\n\n712\n00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:26.930\nstandalone Windows service, so we can\ngo in add a monitoring wizard to this.\n\n713\n00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.010\nWe also have distributed applications,\nwe can go in to monitor\n\n714\n00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.350\nour distributed applications and\nlook at how they're gonna behave as well.\n\n715\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:38.440\nSo we got some very specific capabilities\nhere with all these templates that can be\n\n716\n00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.280\nused and are adding monitor wizards,\nit's usually using instantiated instance\n\n717\n00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.830\nof that template customizing it as you\ncan see, linking it to a management pack,\n\n718\n00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.060\nand then allowing us to be\nable to drive through that.\n\n719\n00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.602\nOnce we have that created,\nwhatever our management packs will be,\n\n720\n00:32:54.602 --> 00:32:58.118\nwe'll see here, all right,\nour management pack.\n\n721\n00:32:58.118 --> 00:33:02.913\nLet's just do a sealed no, and we can see\nthat our Procmon Notepad management pack\n\n722\n00:33:02.913 --> 00:33:06.458\nsitting right there that I created,\nthat has the monitor and\n\n723\n00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:08.427\neverything associated with it.\n\n724\n00:33:08.427 --> 00:33:11.106\nYou could see it right here and\nit's all set up ready to go.\n\n725\n00:33:11.106 --> 00:33:14.799\nOur Global Service Monitoring Piece that\nwe were talking about just a minute ago,\n\n726\n00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:16.370\nyou could see on the web here.\n\n727\n00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.630\nGlobal Service Monitoring is actually very\ninteresting, it's one of the competitive\n\n728\n00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:24.570\ncapabilities that Microsoft has brought to\nthe SCOM stack in particular in the last\n\n729\n00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.610\nrevision or two of the product that allows\nus to be able to do the same kind of\n\n730\n00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.160\nmonitoring that all the other platforms\nout there are doing as well, so\n\n731\n00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.290\nthe SolarWinds, Orion product, OpenView,\nTivoli, whatever the case maybe,\n\n732\n00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.690\nall these programs have this\ncapability to use what we would call,\n\n733\n00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:44.040\nwhat we call these external monitors,\nright?\n\n734\n00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.910\nThat are gonna be able to sit outside and\nare used to then look inbound and\n\n735\n00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.120\nsee the traffic and\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n736\n00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.450\nAnd so these are maintained in the Azure\nFabric, these are part of the Azure Cloud.\n\n737\n00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.390\nAnd we can use them, and they are global,\nso we have access to them.\n\n738\n00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:03.160\nAnd then what we can do, our Global\nService Monitors, let's go down here so\n\n739\n00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.590\nyou could see this.\n\n740\n00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.576\nWe have, where's our list,\nthere's our list right there.\n\n741\n00:34:08.576 --> 00:34:12.156\nOur GSM monitors currently, and this\nlist does change and update over time,\n\n742\n00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:15.189\nbut we're maintaining them\nregionally around the world through\n\n743\n00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:18.130\nthe Microsoft Global Cloud Fabric\nin their data centers.\n\n744\n00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.180\nAnd so we got regionally-based\nmonitors that we can tack on to.\n\n745\n00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.210\nAnd then once we implement the solution,\nwe can use these external reference\n\n746\n00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.869\nmonitors to start monitoring inbound,\nlooking at the traffic flow,\n\n747\n00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:33.900\nrecording traffic, and then accessing\nthat traffic and understanding it,\n\n748\n00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.992\nso we actually have a picture from outside\nof what our customers are seeing from\n\n749\n00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:40.439\na response perspective\nagainst our web apps.\n\n750\n00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:42.826\nSo this is actually really neat, right?\n\n751\n00:34:42.826 --> 00:34:46.188\nAnd you see we have them in Australia,\nin Brazil, in Europe,\n\n752\n00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:50.391\nin Latin America, down in my backyard\nthere in Miami that's actually coming\n\n753\n00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:54.466\nout from sitting down there in the data\ncenter in San Antonio and Virginia,\n\n754\n00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:57.100\netc., it's all over the place, right?\n\n755\n00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.246\nSo we can go in and\nwe can leverage the system and\n\n756\n00:35:00.246 --> 00:35:05.168\nit becomes very effective for us,\nwe do need to have a GSM subscription,\n\n757\n00:35:05.168 --> 00:35:09.122\nwe can have a number of them set up and\nuse per-tenant, and\n\n758\n00:35:09.122 --> 00:35:13.915\nyou'll see here I don't have pricing,\nI don't believe on the page.\n\n759\n00:35:13.915 --> 00:35:18.648\nThis is just our general, yeah, I don't\nhave the general I just have the overview.\n\n760\n00:35:18.648 --> 00:35:23.021\nBut we do have the capability to be\nable to go out to the Azure Fabric page,\n\n761\n00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.819\nwe showed you this earlier in the episode,\nand\n\n762\n00:35:25.819 --> 00:35:28.350\nyou can find information about pricing.\n\n763\n00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.335\nPricing does change and\n\n764\n00:35:29.335 --> 00:35:32.626\nyou obviously, depending on what\nyou're getting, it will vary here.\n\n765\n00:35:32.626 --> 00:35:35.901\nThe trick with this is,\nyou must set up and\n\n766\n00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:41.290\nlicense system center with your EA, so\nyou have your Enterprise Agreement,\n\n767\n00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.440\nand you will have\nSoftware Assurance assignment.\n\n768\n00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.180\nThat, typically, most licensing is\ndone with Software Assurance today,\n\n769\n00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.855\nbut not all, it depends on how you buy.\n\n770\n00:35:47.855 --> 00:35:50.885\nBut if you do\nSoftware Assurance with your EA\n\n771\n00:35:50.885 --> 00:35:52.635\nthen you get the right to\nbe able to leverage this.\n\n772\n00:35:52.635 --> 00:35:54.948\nYou just have to have an Azure\naccount to be able to set it up, but\n\n773\n00:35:54.948 --> 00:35:56.664\nyou have the right to be\nable to leverage this.\n\n774\n00:35:56.664 --> 00:36:01.183\nAnd so depending on how you purchase and\nhow you have license system center, which\n\n775\n00:36:01.183 --> 00:36:06.049\nvaries by region, varies by geography,\nvaries, of course, pricing varies as well.\n\n776\n00:36:06.049 --> 00:36:09.235\nBut the idea would be that you would\nthen be able to access the service, so\n\n777\n00:36:09.235 --> 00:36:12.475\nyou may need to do a little digging\noutside to figure out what that's gonna\n\n778\n00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:14.910\ncost you based on how\nyou've already licensed.\n\n779\n00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.300\nBut assuming you've got that setup you can\nthen hook up global service monitoring and\n\n780\n00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.380\ndo this outside in look through.\n\n781\n00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.520\nAnd then access real-time performance\ndata for your web app stack\n\n782\n00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.630\nfrom around key choke points in\nthe geography anywhere in the world, and\n\n783\n00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.960\nthen use that performance data to better\nunderstand what's actually happening.\n\n784\n00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.869\nSo, this is actually a pretty neat\nsolution if you think about it.\n\n785\n00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:38.844\nIn addition to setting up\nour Global Service Monitor,\n\n786\n00:36:38.844 --> 00:36:41.422\nwe do have some general information here.\n\n787\n00:36:41.422 --> 00:36:45.669\nAnd you could sign up, their actually is,\nif we go down here, I believe if I'm not\n\n788\n00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:49.981\nmistaken, let me just double check for\nyou, just give you the basic information,\n\n789\n00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:54.228\nyeah, getting started, signing up in this\nset up right here, you can go in here,\n\n790\n00:36:54.228 --> 00:36:57.798\nthis link at the bottom of the page\nsets this up and just tells us more or\n\n791\n00:36:57.798 --> 00:36:59.065\nless what we need to do.\n\n792\n00:36:59.065 --> 00:37:02.352\nYou can go, you need the Windows Identity\nFoundation, some download requirements\n\n793\n00:37:02.352 --> 00:37:05.530\nyou'll go through, we'll take a look,\nyou restart the Health Service.\n\n794\n00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.897\nThen you go sign up and import\nthe Global Monitor Management Packs,\n\n795\n00:37:08.897 --> 00:37:12.735\nyou download those here, and then you\ngo in and you start your subscription,\n\n796\n00:37:12.735 --> 00:37:15.474\nyou have to have a valid\nMicrosoft account like I said.\n\n797\n00:37:15.474 --> 00:37:18.600\nAnd then once you do all that, you link\nit up, it's fairly straightforward.\n\n798\n00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.300\nSo, no additional cost in the sense, you\ngotta go out and spend a $100 a month or\n\n799\n00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.500\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n800\n00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.489\nSeparately, you just have to have\nthe right licensing in place to be able\n\n801\n00:37:26.489 --> 00:37:27.210\nto use this.\n\n802\n00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.723\nIt's made available, in other words,\nas part of the Licensing for\n\n803\n00:37:29.723 --> 00:37:32.072\nSystem Center, as long you've\ndone it the right way as I said.\n\n804\n00:37:32.072 --> 00:37:35.000\nThe EA with system, or\nrather with Software Assurance,\n\n805\n00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.960\nwill give you the ability to use this.\n\n806\n00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.630\nAnd you have to have your\nMicrosoft account to set it up.\n\n807\n00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.710\nSo, we're not talking about a huge bump or\n\n808\n00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.800\ncost, but I don't know currently what\nSystem Center's going for with EA and\n\n809\n00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.140\nSoftware Assurance off the shelf,\nout the door.\n\n810\n00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.920\nI just don't know what\nthe pricing is today.\n\n811\n00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.690\nOr as a result, you're just gonna have\nto go check that when you go to buy it.\n\n812\n00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.140\nBut as long as you have that set up,\n\n813\n00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.240\nyou'll be able to use this\nproduct with no trouble.\n\n814\n00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.889\nLast little item I just wanted to take a\nlook at, I really just talked to you about\n\n815\n00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:01.512\nquickly this idea of real-time\ndashboards with Visio.\n\n816\n00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:05.295\nThis is also an interesting piece,\nyou may have seen this with SharePoint and\n\n817\n00:38:05.295 --> 00:38:08.436\nmay have seen the Visio Services\nwith SharePoint in the add in for\n\n818\n00:38:08.436 --> 00:38:10.763\nSharePoint where you can\nrun Visio diagrams and\n\n819\n00:38:10.763 --> 00:38:14.197\nenable them with workflow in a SharePoint\nsite and actually use them on\n\n820\n00:38:14.197 --> 00:38:17.520\na SharePoint dashboard to be able\nto update status in real-time.\n\n821\n00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.924\nAnd that's more or\nless the idea that we're getting here.\n\n822\n00:38:19.924 --> 00:38:23.620\nWe can use this capability to do our\nreal-time monitoring of applications.\n\n823\n00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.990\nWe display up-to-date\nenvironment views with Visio.\n\n824\n00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.401\nFor our flow, now, I've shown you,\n\n825\n00:38:28.401 --> 00:38:30.580\nI'm sure you kinda have looked\nat this in other episodes.\n\n826\n00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.813\nRemember those network\ndiagrams you love so\n\n827\n00:38:31.813 --> 00:38:32.355\nmuch-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n828\n00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:33.783\n&gt;&gt; That we talked about it,\nand we said, it,\n\n829\n00:38:33.783 --> 00:38:35.190\nwould look very similar to that, right?\n\n830\n00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:39.872\nWe talked a little about the idea that it\nbasically looks just like a Visio diagram.\n\n831\n00:38:39.872 --> 00:38:42.527\nBut we're gonna be using\nthe Visio 2010 add-in, so\n\n832\n00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:46.342\ndon't let the versioning fool you, that's\njust the version that we have based on\n\n833\n00:38:46.342 --> 00:38:48.960\nthe fact that that's just been working for\na long time.\n\n834\n00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.013\nThey haven't updated it, but\nVisio 2010 had add-in for\n\n835\n00:38:52.013 --> 00:38:55.664\nSystem Center 2012 creates the Visio\ndiagrams, lets you link them.\n\n836\n00:38:55.664 --> 00:39:00.127\nJust a couple of things to be aware\nof here, you need the SharePoint 2010\n\n837\n00:39:00.127 --> 00:39:03.840\nVisio Services Data Provider\navailable with this as well.\n\n838\n00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.865\nWe publish these dashboards out that\nare created in Visio to represent our\n\n839\n00:39:06.865 --> 00:39:09.112\ndistributed applications and\nour architecture, and\n\n840\n00:39:09.112 --> 00:39:12.850\nthen we put them into SharePoint websites,\nmake them available, wouldn't it be great?\n\n841\n00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.667\nI mean, imagine the logic\nof this in the real world,\n\n842\n00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:19.831\nwouldn't it be great from a business\nperspective if you could stand up SCOM,\n\n843\n00:39:19.831 --> 00:39:22.157\nstand up SCVMM, get all that stuff going?\n\n844\n00:39:22.157 --> 00:39:26.452\nStand up a SharePoint site, put all of\nyour interactive dashboards together and\n\n845\n00:39:26.452 --> 00:39:28.280\npublish them to SharePoint.\n\n846\n00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.480\nLet your line of business owners and\ncustomers internally\n\n847\n00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.400\nmonitor their own information by using\nSharePoint to see the real-time analytics.\n\n848\n00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.325\nAnd that's what we could do\nusing this technology, right?\n\n849\n00:39:38.325 --> 00:39:41.479\n&gt;&gt; But then everyone would know that\nI'm like sitting there sucking up all\n\n850\n00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:44.912\nof the bandwidth, watching Netflix all\nday, and not getting any work done.\n\n851\n00:39:44.912 --> 00:39:47.022\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They would, they would,\n\n852\n00:39:47.022 --> 00:39:48.824\nbut at least then we know who to blame.\n\n853\n00:39:48.824 --> 00:39:49.496\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n854\n00:39:49.496 --> 00:39:51.297\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When we couldn't run our dashboard and\n\n855\n00:39:51.297 --> 00:39:54.525\nour console because it locked up because,\nwell, Cherokee was actually using all\n\n856\n00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:57.340\nthe bandwidth, that's why\nthe console locked up apparently.\n\n857\n00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.753\nSo shame on your for\ndoing that while we were presenting.\n\n858\n00:39:59.753 --> 00:40:02.540\nAll right, but, and she wasn't doing it\nby the way, we're only kidding, right?\n\n859\n00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.600\nShe waits till after we get done and\ndoes that in-between takes so\n\n860\n00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.118\nwe'd mess up other people's shows.\n\n861\n00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:08.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we will go in and we will do that.\n\n862\n00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.785\nAnd just keep in mind, right,\nthat this is yet another option for us,\n\n863\n00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:13.891\nanother way to broaden\nthis out if we choose to.\n\n864\n00:40:13.891 --> 00:40:16.470\nNow, there are some prerequisite\nassociated with setting this up.\n\n865\n00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:19.322\nWe did put some information in the show\nnotes for you, you may just wanna go\n\n866\n00:40:19.322 --> 00:40:21.806\nthrough just a couple of paragraphs\nof some things you gotta do,\n\n867\n00:40:21.806 --> 00:40:24.765\njust take a look at this, so you wanna\nstand this up and get it up and running.\n\n868\n00:40:24.765 --> 00:40:28.594\nThe main thing is really just configuring\nthe SharePoint back end with the data\n\n869\n00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:32.770\nprovider, loading the web part into the\nSharePoint farm, putting it under the GAC,\n\n870\n00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.320\nso it's approved and\nauthorized to be used.\n\n871\n00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.500\nAnd then having a little\nPowerShell Cmdlet,\n\n872\n00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.500\nwe gotta run to specify how\nthings are gonna get set up.\n\n873\n00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.315\nThe Ops Manager, datamodule.wsp is\nthe name of the module you'll load, so\n\n874\n00:40:44.315 --> 00:40:48.013\nthere's just some how-to stuff,\nyou could take a look in there to see it,\n\n875\n00:40:48.013 --> 00:40:51.130\nbut setting it up and\ngetting it running is actually nice.\n\n876\n00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.224\nAnd then, as I said, this extends\nthe capability of monitoring for\n\n877\n00:40:54.224 --> 00:40:57.701\nus out just beyond the SCOM consoles\nthemselves into the SharePoint stack,\n\n878\n00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:00.796\nwhich honestly is a lot more\napproachable from most average users,\n\n879\n00:41:00.796 --> 00:41:03.130\nthat it is really looking for\ndata and for output and\n\n880\n00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.690\nmonitoring, as suppose to getting in\non the hood and messing around with it.\n\n881\n00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.375\nSo, maybe a lot easier for you to give\nthem that information sitting out there in\n\n882\n00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:14.005\nSharePoint than it is to, expect the user\nto log on to the web consoles we showed\n\n883\n00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:16.810\nyou and go on and look for\na monitor that's already premade,\n\n884\n00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.570\nit just may not make a lot of sense for\nthem in the dashboard.\n\n885\n00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.490\nSo, it may just be another option for\nyou to consider.\n\n886\n00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, you've given us a ton\nof information and some of you ladies and\n\n887\n00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.710\ngentlemen may not have been\nable to absorb all of it.\n\n888\n00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.420\nBut that's okay,\nyou can go back, rewatch, and\n\n889\n00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.900\nplease, use all those additional tools\nthat Adam did provide via the links.\n\n890\n00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.630\nAnd just get ready to go ahead and\npartake in some hands-on activities,\n\n891\n00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.360\nwe have some labs headed your way.\n\n892\n00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.530\nBut for this show we're out of time,\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n893\n00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.770\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n894\n00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.445\n&gt;&gt; I'm, who am I?\n\n895\n00:41:46.445 --> 00:41:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Who are you?\n&gt;&gt; Been so long I don't remember.\n\n896\n00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.991\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon, that's who I am.\n\n897\n00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:54.920\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n898\n00:41:54.920 -->

00:00:06.363\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.435\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.189\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.477\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:19.959\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are continuing our\n\n9\n00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:22.347\nseries on monitoring and\noperating a private cloud.\n\n10\n00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:25.356\nAnd of course joining us, back in\nthe studio again our good friend Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:27.810\nAdam Gordon, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going, man?\n\n12\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.025\n&gt;&gt; Nanu nanu.\n&gt;&gt; Nanu nanu.\n\n13\n00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.204\n&gt;&gt; Nanu nanu.\n\n14\n00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:31.866\nIt is going well, it is going well.\n\n15\n00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.554\nHopefully well for you as well,\notherwise it would not be well, and\n\n16\n00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.118\nthat would of course be bad.\n\n17\n00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:38.085\n&gt;&gt; You could fall down a well.\n\n18\n00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.099\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:40.363\n&gt;&gt; That would not be well.\n\n20\n00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.860\n&gt;&gt; You would not be well if you fell\ndown a well, that would not be good.\n\n21\n00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.702\nSo we're gonna,\npromised in our last three episodes,\n\n22\n00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:49.100\nwe would do some hands on demonstrations\nand show how to do things.\n\n23\n00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.357\nWe're gonna pick up on that thread and\ndo that right now.\n\n24\n00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:55.074\nWe are going to show you how to deploy\na SCOM agent through the console,\n\n25\n00:00:55.074 --> 00:00:57.720\nleverage accident due\na networking discovery and\n\n26\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.140\nbring this two things together,\ndoing agent configuration and discovery.\n\n27\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.673\nAll in one, as we say.\n\n28\n00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:06.018\nSo we are going to jump in and begin.\n\n29\n00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:09.253\nWe have our SCOM ops manager console\nopen and we're gonna go ahead,\n\n30\n00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:11.538\nwe're gonna take a look\nat how to kick this off.\n\n31\n00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.914\nSo we're on the admin or in the admin\nwork space, and you've seen me doing\n\n32\n00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:18.197\nelements of this during our discussions\nin some of our prior episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:22.519\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndo a discovery of a Windows computer,\n\n34\n00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.288\nthen deploy the agent to\nthat Windows computer so\n\n35\n00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:27.937\nwe can then actually use\nit to do other things.\n\n36\n00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:30.614\nSo we're gonna do this\na couple of different ways,\n\n37\n00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:34.101\nwe can either go to the landing page\non the Admin Overview here, and\n\n38\n00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:38.545\nclick on Required configure computers and\ndevices to manage, we have that option.\n\n39\n00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:42.933\nWe could simply, as you've seen me do,\ncome down here to Device Management,\n\n40\n00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.260\nwe'll just click here to get\nthat to move for us real quick.\n\n41\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.327\nAnd when we do that we could right-click,\ndo Discovery Wizard,\n\n42\n00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:51.577\nit would essentially take\nus to the same place.\n\n43\n00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:54.777\nDoesn't really matter how we do this,\nso either way we'll just go ahead and\n\n44\n00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:55.878\nwe'll click Discovery.\n\n45\n00:01:55.878 --> 00:01:59.979\nWindows computer, or Windows computers\nI should say, I'll just move this\n\n46\n00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.220\nover a little bit so you guys can see that\nwhile I'm sitting and talking to you.\n\n47\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.828\nAnd Windows computers we're gonna go\nahead and do that Discovery method,\n\n48\n00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:10.068\nhighlight that our default one,\nclick Next.\n\n49\n00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:13.656\nWe can do either an automated\ndiscovery as you can see,\n\n50\n00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:18.102\nand or we could do an advanced discovery,\nautomatic or automated,\n\n51\n00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:23.574\nscans our domain for any and all Windows\ncomputers, returns back a complete list.\n\n52\n00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:28.332\nAdvanced Discovery lets us specify, hey do\nyou wanna do server and client Discovery?\n\n53\n00:02:28.332 --> 00:02:30.088\nWhat kind of device and class?\n\n54\n00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:31.797\nServer only, client only?\n\n55\n00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.144\nAnd what management server are we\ngonna use if there's more than one in\n\n56\n00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:36.289\nthe management group?\n\n57\n00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.064\nAnd we can reach into\nthe resource pool and\n\n58\n00:02:38.064 --> 00:02:39.999\nchoose which one we\nwanna use specifically.\n\n59\n00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.595\nSo that will be something we can decide\nto do, we're just gonna go ahead and\n\n60\n00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.178\nwe're gonna do automatic\ncomputer Discovery here.\n\n61\n00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:47.688\nJust get all the information back.\n\n62\n00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:53.769\nNotice by the way, settings over here,\nMenu options change, excuse me.\n\n63\n00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.680\nAs I'll click here you'll notice we\nthen have some different choices.\n\n64\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.326\nSo we'll do automatic.\n\n65\n00:02:58.326 --> 00:03:02.656\nAnd then when we click Next, we have\nto specify the account we're gonna use.\n\n66\n00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.184\nAnd we're gonna use a service account.\n\n67\n00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.709\nIf so, what is that management\nservice account that we're gonna use?\n\n68\n00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.670\nUse selected management service account or\naction account, that's one we have already\n\n69\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.438\nbeen using, we can specify\na different account if we want to.\n\n70\n00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:18.081\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do this,\nand then we're gonna click Discover.\n\n71\n00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:23.483\nAnd that will take, now we're gonna go\nto our progress bar going through there,\n\n72\n00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:25.002\nwon't take too long.\n\n73\n00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:28.406\nAnd then once we get that coming up,\nwe'll get a list of all the items or\n\n74\n00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:31.368\nmachines that we'll be able\nto potentially interact with.\n\n75\n00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:34.785\nSo we'll wait for this to come back and\nshow us what's there.\n\n76\n00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:38.323\nWe're gonna choose the VMM machine,\nVirtual Machine Manager machine.\n\n77\n00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:40.297\nIn the last episode before this one,\n\n78\n00:03:40.297 --> 00:03:44.564\nwe were actually talking about the fact\nthat due to the fabric integration, and\n\n79\n00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:48.399\nwe wanna tie VMM and the Ops Manager\ntogether for monitoring purposes.\n\n80\n00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.208\nThat one of the key steps\nin that process would be\n\n81\n00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:55.354\nthat once we get the Ops manager\nconsole installed on the VMM machine,\n\n82\n00:03:55.354 --> 00:04:00.080\nwe get all the management packs we need\ninstalled and interacting on SCOM side.\n\n83\n00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.869\nThat the next big thing we would do on\nour way to getting set up would be to put\n\n84\n00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.581\nthe agent onto the VMM machine and\n\n85\n00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.599\nultimately all the VMs that\nare gonna be monitored there.\n\n86\n00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.685\nSo we're gonna be able to do that this or\n\n87\n00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:13.803\ndo this piece of it as we should\nsay by way of doing our demo.\n\n88\n00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:15.548\nSo we're gonna find our VMM machine.\n\n89\n00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:17.361\nIt's sitting right there, FlabVMM01.\n\n90\n00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:21.701\nThat's just to show you what worlds are we\ngonna wind up doing, we're gonna go ahead,\n\n91\n00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:25.220\nwe're gonna put that Microsoft\nmonitoring agent out there, right?\n\n92\n00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.859\nAnd remember we've talked\nabout the monitoring agent.\n\n93\n00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:30.823\nMonitoring agent is found in the console,\nor excuse me,\n\n94\n00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:34.528\nin the control panel, and it's gonna\nbe a piece of software that allows\n\n95\n00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:37.899\nus to control monitoring pull that\noff the system and upload it.\n\n96\n00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:38.968\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n97\n00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:41.082\nWe should always take a look\nat what we're doing and\n\n98\n00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:43.352\nmake sure we have a sense\nof what's already deployed.\n\n99\n00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:46.788\nWe're gonna go to control panel real quick\non the machine that we're using here.\n\n100\n00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:50.761\nJust do this,\nwe could see Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n101\n00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:52.390\nLet's move this over so you can see it.\n\n102\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.280\nIt's all ready deployed here on\nthe server that we're using.\n\n103\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.891\nSo this is what we're gonna wind up\nputting out into the VMM machine.\n\n104\n00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:02.446\nThis is what we're gonna do a console\npush in order to be able to deploy.\n\n105\n00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:06.037\nSo, just showing you that real quick,\nwe've highlighted our VMM machine,\n\n106\n00:05:06.037 --> 00:05:07.460\nlet's click Next there.\n\n107\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.369\nWe then have our agent installation\ndirectory where we're gonna install\n\n108\n00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:13.713\ndefault is percent program files percent.\n\n109\n00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.443\nSo it's gonna substitute in the variable\npath of the Program Files install on\n\n110\n00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.709\nthe machine, c:\\Program Files.\n\n111\n00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.539\nMicrosoft Monitoring Agent on\nthe machine we're gonna target, so\n\n112\n00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:24.539\nwe're gonna go there.\n\n113\n00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.633\nAnd then you'll we specify the local\nsystem account, and or another account,\n\n114\n00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:33.050\nwe'll choose the local system account that\nwe'll install under the guides of that.\n\n115\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.942\nWe'll then go ahead and\nwe'll click Finish,\n\n116\n00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:40.837\ngive that a moment we get our task status\ncoming up, doesn't take very long for\n\n117\n00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:43.530\nthis to run so we'll get that started out.\n\n118\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.146\nAnd remember we did talk about\nthe fact when we were doing this and\n\n119\n00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:48.918\nI'll just explode this out full-size so\nyou could see it running.\n\n120\n00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:52.243\nWe talked about the fact that we could\nclose this, go to the task status view,\n\n121\n00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:55.414\nremember up in the monitoring area, and\nwe can always pull this back up and\n\n122\n00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:57.528\nsee it if we wanted to see\nit while it was running.\n\n123\n00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:00.601\nWe could leave it running here,\nwouldn't be a big deal either way.\n\n124\n00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:04.095\nwe'll just wait for this to come up,\nsee the task has started there so\n\n125\n00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:05.368\nwe could see the status.\n\n126\n00:06:05.368 --> 00:06:08.207\nIt will take a few minutes for\nthis to actually go through, so\n\n127\n00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:10.057\nwe will go ahead and just let this cook.\n\n128\n00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:11.863\nWe'll come right on back, and\n\n129\n00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:16.312\nas soon as this is done we'ill actually\nshow you the results and keep going.\n\n130\n00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:19.173\nI was ready and then you said,\nwhenever you're ready.\n\n131\n00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:21.981\nI'm done, my whole mental focus is gone-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:22.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm out of the head space.\n\n133\n00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.326\nI've no idea what-\n&gt;&gt; I can't work like this.\n\n134\n00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:26.539\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I cannot do this anymore.\n\n135\n00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.632\nAll right, are you good Megan?\n\n136\n00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:28.378\nCan I go?\nYep?\n\n137\n00:06:28.378 --> 00:06:30.097\nOkay.\n\n138\n00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:32.729\nAll right, so you could see we\nactually have finished our install.\n\n139\n00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.958\nSuccess is always a good thing,\nwe like to see that and so\n\n140\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.759\nwe'll close out our monitor here and\nthen we'll be able to go in.\n\n141\n00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.985\nAnd now let's just go over the VMM machine\nreal quick, we'll see the monitoring\n\n142\n00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.888\nagents there but we'll now be able to\nuse that if we need to for anything.\n\n143\n00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:47.627\nWe're gonna park that for the moment and\n\n144\n00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:49.887\ncome back to it in a little\nwhile in an upcoming demo.\n\n145\n00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:52.260\nBut let's come over here\nto our VMM console,\n\n146\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.578\nlet's just lower this one down real quick.\n\n147\n00:06:54.578 --> 00:06:58.343\nWe'll go into the Control Panel, and we'll\njust take a look and see that we actually\n\n148\n00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:01.011\ndo have our monitoring agent,\nit's sitting right there.\n\n149\n00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.453\nJust move that over so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n150\n00:07:03.453 --> 00:07:06.438\nAnd you'll see it's sitting right there,\nit's been installed and\n\n151\n00:07:06.438 --> 00:07:07.579\nwe can just bring that up.\n\n152\n00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.615\nAnd what we have right there,\n\n153\n00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:13.780\nwe can actually just center that\na little bit better for you.\n\n154\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.970\nWhat we have is our\nMicrosoft monitoring agent.\n\n155\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.958\nRemember the SCOM agent has been\nrebranded, renamed in 12 R2.\n\n156\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.810\nSo we do see our management\ngroup is designated there.\n\n157\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.433\nWe could see that we do\nhave our management server,\n\n158\n00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:26.780\nwhere we installed from.\n\n159\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.660\nOr rather where we're told to connect to,\n\n160\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.660\nwe're actually off plab sys02\nrunning the ops console.\n\n161\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.443\nBut s01 is actually the server where\nthe ops server is installed, so\n\n162\n00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:39.378\nthat's where we're pointing to.\n\n163\n00:07:39.378 --> 00:07:42.418\nOur port 5723, we've been talking\nabout different ports and\n\n164\n00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:45.903\nthe firewalls configuration, we went\nthrough all that in a prior episode.\n\n165\n00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:50.981\n5723 is used to drive the configuration\ncommunication, we see assignment manual\n\n166\n00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:55.847\nand we see assignment action, rather agent\naction is local system, we do just have\n\n167\n00:07:55.847 --> 00:08:00.577\nsome basic properties here [INAUDIBLE] to\nbuild of the management agent install,\n\n168\n00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:05.541\nnothing more We also get automatic update\nmanagement group assignments from ADDS.\n\n169\n00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:10.279\nSo if we have the AD immigration, with all\nthe things we need, you essentially get\n\n170\n00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:14.760\nautomatic management group updates,\nand get that information there.\n\n171\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.210\nWe haven't talk about\nmulti-homing in agent yet.\n\n172\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.450\nWe'll have more to say about this in\nupcoming episodes, but if we need\n\n173\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.860\na multi-homing agent, we actually can do\nthat by adding in here, management groups,\n\n174\n00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.450\nso we could specify additional management\ngroups, that this agent will report into.\n\n175\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.590\nWhen we talk about our, actually we\ndidn't mentioned it in prior OPS's and\n\n176\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.215\nour discussion an updater migration,\n\n177\n00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.545\nI did mention briefly the idea to\nbe able to multi-home an agent.\n\n178\n00:08:38.545 --> 00:08:41.875\nWe have some more to say about,\nbut the idea generically is.\n\n179\n00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.895\nThat we could actually have this agent,\n\n180\n00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:45.835\nreporting in different\nmanagement groups if needed.\n\n181\n00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:48.960\nAnd this is where we actually\ngotta do that on the tab here.\n\n182\n00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.060\nJust add the appropriate\nmanagement groups in.\n\n183\n00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.000\nAdd our report into up to four\nof them at the same time.\n\n184\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.835\nSo we have a-.\n\n185\n00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Ability to do that here if we need to.\n\n186\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.710\nSo we have that so\nwe could see the fruit of our labors and\n\n187\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.325\nwe could see that we have been\nsuccessful at installing.\n\n188\n00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.955\nWe're gonna go back over\nto our console here, for\n\n189\n00:09:05.955 --> 00:09:10.875\nthe ops console and continue marching\nthrough our discussion here and our demo.\n\n190\n00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:12.675\nWe're gonna take what we just did and\n\n191\n00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:15.052\nnow parley that into\na slightly different approach.\n\n192\n00:09:15.052 --> 00:09:18.642\nWe're now gonna do the network\ndiscovery piece that I talked about and\n\n193\n00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:20.442\nwe hinted at in the prior episode.\n\n194\n00:09:20.442 --> 00:09:22.752\nWe actually did a little bit of the demo,\ndidn't walk all the way through it,\n\n195\n00:09:22.752 --> 00:09:26.092\nbut we're gonna go do a network discovery\nand show you how to find network devices.\n\n196\n00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:27.642\nSo we're gonna do another\nkind of discovery now,\n\n197\n00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:30.212\nin other words now that we've\npushed the console agent out.\n\n198\n00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:34.342\nSo we'll come back here, we'll right-click\nagain, do discovery wizard one more time.\n\n199\n00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:36.410\nThis time we're gonna\ndo network discovery.\n\n200\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.030\nCome down here, I'm gonna just move\nthis over while we're talking so\n\n201\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.020\nyou guys could get a better\na better sense of that on screen.\n\n202\n00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.110\nWe'll click next,\n\n203\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.110\nwe're gonna give this a name,\nspecify what we're gonna do with this.\n\n204\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:51.070\nSo, it's a good idea, we've talked about\nthis before just while I'm typing to name\n\n205\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.770\nthis thing something that make sense to\nyou contextually whatever that means.\n\n206\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.750\nI'm just gonna call mine, Discover Network\nDevice but you obviously can call this\n\n207\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.420\nwhatever you would like,\nsome discovered numbered devices.\n\n208\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.870\nObviously, if you have a description you\nwanna add in there, so much the better.\n\n209\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.180\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna choose my available server.\n\n210\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.310\nSo I'm gonna pull down choose my\nmanagement server right from there.\n\n211\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.360\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna create a resource pool.\n\n212\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.290\nSo I'm gonna click here.\n\n213\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.520\nAnd I'm gonna create a resource pool\ncuz I don't have one already created,\n\n214\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.420\nwhich just reminds you of\nthe importance of resource pools here.\n\n215\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.130\nSo we can see that we do have our\nresource pool on our diagram for\n\n216\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.660\nour management servers.\n\n217\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.200\nThis is gonna be how we group them\ntogether for management and for\n\n218\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.240\nmonitoring and all of the different things\nwe do from a demonstration standpoint.\n\n219\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.020\nWe may have have different resource pools,\nmatter of fact we do have several out of\n\n220\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.270\nthe box, there's one for AD integration\nand various different sets of things.\n\n221\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.680\nExcuse me that we will have going on here,\nso we're going to create one of these.\n\n222\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.650\nWe're going to essentially\ncreate a resource pool and\n\n223\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.670\ngroup some servers together.\n\n224\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.990\nSo we're gonna give this a name.\n\n225\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.720\nWe're gonna go ahead, and what do\nyou think we should call this, Dan?\n\n226\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.600\nYou got any good naming ideas here for me?\n\n227\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.470\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with resource pool one.\n\n228\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.190\nResource pool one.\n\n229\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.710\nAll right, I was gonna call device\ndiscovery but we'll do resource pool one.\n\n230\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.400\nI think that's spelled correctly,\n\n231\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.370\nmy machine is doing that whole\ndark in the screen thing again.\n\n232\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.640\nSo I'm not quite sure if I spelled that.\n\n233\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.530\nI could've written something like, go\ndark, so I'm not sure what close enough.\n\n234\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.210\nWhatever it is.\n\n235\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.810\nWell, we'll just call whatever it is.\n\n236\n00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.460\nBut we're gonna call resource pool one.\n\n237\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.760\nWe're going to add some members here,\nobviously, creating a pool was good, but\n\n238\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.340\nif we don't put any machines in it,\nit really won't do us a lot of good.\n\n239\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.470\nSo, we're going to go ahead and\nadd in here the management server or\n\n240\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.750\nservers we want in the pool.\n\n241\n00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.340\nAnd this is how we do that right here.\n\n242\n00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.190\nWe'll click add.\n\n243\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.440\nWe're just going to go ahead and\ndo a search here, and\n\n244\n00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.640\nyou'll see that we only have one machine\nthat we're using for demo purposes, but\n\n245\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.740\nin the real world we would add in multiple\nmanagement servers to extend the pool out.\n\n246\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.840\nAnd they could fall taller.\n\n247\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.710\nSo if we have a problem,\nit's gonna be highly available and\n\n248\n00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.280\nwe'll have more than one system there.\n\n249\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.510\nI talked about this in one of the pilot\nepisodes where we're not actually done\n\n250\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.350\nhere, right?\n\n251\n00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.710\nBecause we've selected and\nmoves over against.\n\n252\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.470\nYou could see the soft side, right.\n\n253\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.170\nIf we don't hit the ad here,\nit would bring this selection down.\n\n254\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.760\nWe don't get the OK button.\n\n255\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.250\nCuz we're not actually done\nwe're like halfway done here.\n\n256\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.870\nWe found what we need but\nwe haven't said yeah want it, so\n\n257\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.740\nwe gotta highlight it, we gotta click Add,\nwe're gonna do that right here.\n\n258\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.990\n&gt;&gt; It's really kind of misleading here\nwhen you only have the one server because\n\n259\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.100\nit looks like yeah that's the one I want\nthanks it's highlighted you're good to go.\n\n260\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.050\nBut if you have multiple servers in that\nlist, you will select one, click add,\n\n261\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.870\nselect another one click add and\nso on and so forth so\n\n262\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.340\nthat would make a little bore sense so\nyear.\n\n263\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.220\n&gt;&gt; It'll make no more sense cuz\nit's just bad UI design but-\n\n264\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.240\n&gt;&gt; It is what it is.\n\n265\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.100\n&gt;&gt; It's that whole thing\nI go off about kids just\n\n266\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.030\nclose the window when we're done.\n\n267\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.000\n&gt;&gt; Why can't they just do that?\n\n268\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, if I've only one\nselected doesn't it just makes sense\n\n269\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.650\n&gt;&gt; I though it was interesting with\n\n270\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.500\nthe sealed versus unsealed.\n\n271\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.020\nIt said yes if it was sealed and\nnothing if it was no.\n\n272\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n273\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.240\nWhy not just put it check\nmark if it's sealed and\n\n274\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.440\nlike the fact that there's yes and\nI thought that there would be a no.\n\n275\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:49.980\nBut there wasn't.\n\n276\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.370\nWeird design and a random aside for\nthis episode I guess.\n\n277\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.320\n&gt;&gt; This why the This is and\nI can tell you why it happens, right?\n\n278\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.770\nBecause and I don't mean to be\noffensive to anybody when I say this,\n\n279\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.560\nall kidding aside.\n\n280\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I'm just pointing out that\n\n281\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.220\noftentimes the people that\ndesign those interfaces, right?\n\n282\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.980\nVery talented developers,\nvery talented UI people.\n\n283\n00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.040\nThey don't necessarily have a vision\nof how the product will be used,\n\n284\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.020\nthe same way that we may, as IT\nadministrators and users of the product.\n\n285\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.520\nAnd to them it may make perfectly\ngood sense to say yes if it is and\n\n286\n00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.540\nthe inverse is of course no,\nwe would think okay, put a no up.\n\n287\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.840\nClearly they didn't do that, just left\nit blank thinking well if it's not yes,\n\n288\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.930\nit must be no.\n\n289\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.240\nI guess in some world or\n\n290\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.770\nsomewhere, somewhere somehow\nthat logic plays in make sense.\n\n291\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.470\nIt just doesn't work as you're\npointing out for instance,\n\n292\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.270\nfor give the average person who\nwould look at that differently and\n\n293\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.930\nsay well, tell me the state, yes or no,\nthen I know there's no guess work there.\n\n294\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:48.560\nSo it is the disconnect between developing\nUI design and actual in the field use that\n\n295\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.120\noften leads to some of these little quirky\nthings we're talking about so, all right.\n\n296\n00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.890\nSo we're gonna go back and now that\nwe set the world right we're gonna go\n\n297\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.920\nahead get off our cell boxes and\nwe're gonna get back to work here.\n\n298\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.950\nSo we're gonna click okay we've gone\nahead and created our selection or\n\n299\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.230\nindicator of our selection.\n\n300\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.330\nWe got our resource pool machine there.\n\n301\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.300\nWe're gonna click next.\n\n302\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.120\nJust finish up on summary item here.\n\n303\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.980\nClick create.\n\n304\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.990\nLet that go real quick.\n\n305\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.070\nYou can see we are successful.\n\n306\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.550\nAnd then we're back to where we were.\n\n307\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.380\nWe do not have our resource\npool available down below.\n\n308\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.190\nSo we populated that by doing this.\n\n309\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.740\nWe now going to go ahead.\n\n310\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.490\nAnd we're going to click next here.\n\n311\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.230\nWe're now gonna get our discovery method.\n\n312\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.680\nWe talked about Explicit\nversus Recursive Discovery\n\n313\n00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.960\nin the run-through that I did, the quick\ndemo I did, last time in the episode.\n\n314\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.360\nExplicit goes out, as you can see only\ndiscovers devices we specify versus\n\n315\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.040\nrecursive discovery will walk through and\nwill allow us to go out and\n\n316\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.760\nsee specify and\ndiscover other devices we specify and\n\n317\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.700\nall devices that are connected\nto devices that we specify.\n\n318\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.720\nSo if we have something connected through\nthat device, we'll get a iterative or\n\n319\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.930\nrecursive shot at that.\n\n320\n00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.930\nAnd we'll actually\nultimately get to see that.\n\n321\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.220\nWe're gonna do explicit discovery here,\nso we're gonna click Next.\n\n322\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.060\nWe're then gonna go ahead and specify\nthe Run As account for the discovery.\n\n323\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.670\nDo we have an account we're gonna use?\n\n324\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.980\nDo we need to create one?\n\n325\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.460\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate this account.\n\n326\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.230\nJust let me make sure that I Take a look\nat what we need for our credential.\n\n327\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.610\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate our account here.\n\n328\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.480\nClick Next.\n\n329\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.150\nThere we go.\n\n330\n00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.100\nThen we click next on our wizard.\n\n331\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.030\nAnd then we're gonna\ngive it a display name.\n\n332\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.590\nAgain we'll just keep it simple.\n\n333\n00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.540\nWe'll do Device Discovery here In the real\nworlds you may give that a little bit more\n\n334\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.950\nfrom the beginning for me.\n\n335\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.190\nThat will be up to you.\n\n336\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.290\nBut we're gonna do the credentials here.\n\n337\n00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.220\nThis is an SNMP discovery account.\n\n338\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.430\nSo this is our, either community\nstring account or SNMPV3 account.\n\n339\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.180\nRemember we talked about\nthese different types.\n\n340\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.831\nThis is the community string, is you\nwill think it as like password for SNMP.\n\n341\n00:15:46.831 --> 00:15:49.025\nIt's the challenge that\nwe need to provide or\n\n342\n00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:52.896\nthe response that we need to provide when\nwe connect the machine to authenticate\n\n343\n00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:55.977\nit's the shared secret essentially,\nit's like a password.\n\n344\n00:15:55.977 --> 00:15:59.419\nIt's what we have to know in order to\nbe able to connect and get information.\n\n345\n00:15:59.419 --> 00:16:03.541\nSo we're gonna provide that, we're\ngonna use our standard password here.\n\n346\n00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:06.590\nSo we'll just type that in,\nwe're then gonna go ahead.\n\n347\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.030\nWe're gonna click create,\n\n348\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.990\nwe'll then have our device discovery\naccount there as you can see.\n\n349\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.870\nAnd we'll see it checked off and selected.\n\n350\n00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.030\nSo we've got that,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll click next.\n\n351\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.440\nWe then are going to have the option\nto either add specific devices,\n\n352\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.530\ncuz remember we did say\nexplicit discovery here.\n\n353\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.170\nAnd we can do this either by\nadding it in specifically or\n\n354\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.640\nnotice we can do an import here.\n\n355\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.710\nAnd we can import, and\nwe'll just show you here.\n\n356\n00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.720\nWe can import a file that has\nour devices listed, right?\n\n357\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.305\nSo we can do a file that's got the listed,\nthe comma separated value.\n\n358\n00:16:39.305 --> 00:16:42.320\nAnd/or we could do an add here or\nalign the limit,\n\n359\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.580\nyou could actually do\na text file one at a time.\n\n360\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.430\nWe have to name our IP address here,\nwe'll do our name plabsys01.\n\n361\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.840\nNotice we have our access mode,\neither ICMP and SMP or either/or.\n\n362\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.090\nWe do have our port number for Discovery,\nSNMP version one or two or three.\n\n363\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:08.300\nAnd then if we're doing version one or\ntwo, we specify the run as account and\n\n364\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.980\nwe can add another run as\naccount in there if we need one.\n\n365\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.520\nSo we've already put in,\nremember our access account.\n\n366\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.200\nSo I have ICNP and SNMP selected.\n\n367\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.920\nWe've got port 161, we got v1 or v2 and\n\n368\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.860\nwe're gonna choose use\nselect the default account.\n\n369\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.150\nSo we do have that one and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n370\n00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.530\nwe are going to just make sure,\nyeah, let's do that.\n\n371\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.900\nWhat you've got, okay, great.\n\n372\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.480\nAnd then we'll click OK.\n\n373\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.420\nSo we got all that and\nthen we'll gonna click next.\n\n374\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.140\nWe got our scheduled discovery.\n\n375\n00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.309\nI'll run this into whatever we want.\n\n376\n00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:44.053\nYou'll see here run it based\non a certain day and time,\n\n377\n00:17:44.053 --> 00:17:46.410\nor we could run this discovery manually.\n\n378\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.800\nIt's totally up to us to\ndecide how we do this.\n\n379\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.270\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll do run the discovery rule manually.\n\n380\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.420\nThat way we can kick it off when\nwe're ready to actually run it.\n\n381\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.950\nSo click Next there.\n\n382\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.370\nWe then get our summary,\nwe'll click create.\n\n383\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.510\nNow, we do get, The little warning here.\n\n384\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.120\nLet's go full screen just we\ncould see this for a minute.\n\n385\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.180\nLet me just explain this.\n\n386\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.400\nYou'll see it says,\nwe're just waiting on this.\n\n387\n00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.886\nIt's waiting on us to finish\nup in the background.\n\n388\n00:18:09.886 --> 00:18:14.024\nIt says, following accounts need to be\nevenly distributed to the health service,\n\n389\n00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:16.919\nand on the machine,\nthe plabsy1 practice labs machine,\n\n390\n00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:19.180\nthe management server in other words.\n\n391\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.920\nAnd the members of the management\npool resource pool in order for\n\n392\n00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.560\ndiscover to work for device discovery.\n\n393\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.990\nWould you like us to\ndistribute those accounts?\n\n394\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.980\nRemember we talked about this\nwith the run as accounts.\n\n395\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.600\nSo we have to distribute them, and\neither have the system do it for us or\n\n396\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.350\nwe actually had to do it ourselves, right?\n\n397\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.430\nSo we're gonna hit yes here, because we\nwanted to do the distribution for us.\n\n398\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.620\nSo we hit Yes, and\nwe'll go ahead and create it.\n\n399\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.770\nNo, we'll have to go ahead and\ndo it on our own.\n\n400\n00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.330\nSo we're gonna hit Yes.\n\n401\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.420\nLet that go out, we can watch this, right.\n\n402\n00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.010\nPlease wait while we're doing this.\n\n403\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.510\nIt'll actually then be able to go out,\ndistribute this you could see it\n\n404\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.180\nfinishes up, and then we have there\nrun the network discovery rule\n\n405\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.560\nwizard after we close because I run\nthe rule outside after the rule.\n\n406\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.580\nRun the rule outside the wizard\nafter it has closed,\n\n407\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.590\nis what I'm trying to say, remember we\nspecified we wanna run it manually and so\n\n408\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.300\nas a result we get that option.\n\n409\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.820\nSo we're gonna uncheck that, we're not\ngonna bother to run that right now, but\n\n410\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.830\nyou could see that we could do that.\n\n411\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.460\nAnd then once we have that, we're gonna\ngo in and we're gonna take a look.\n\n412\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.220\nLet's go and find our rule.\n\n413\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.610\nSo let's come down here\nto discovery rules.\n\n414\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.410\nAnd we could see that our\ndiscovery rule is sitting there.\n\n415\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.240\nAnd we could now of course\nlaunch that if we choose to.\n\n416\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.460\nAnd we can run it.\n\n417\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.760\nSo we can just run it\nourselves whenever we want.\n\n418\n00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.540\nWe can right click and run.\n\n419\n00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.730\nRun from the tasks area.\n\n420\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.710\nIt doesn't really matter, just go in and\ndo a run there, and we'll get that set up.\n\n421\n00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.950\nIt is, as you can see, running, right?\n\n422\n00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.620\nSo we have that, and then, once that runs,\n\n423\n00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.020\ndoesn't take too long to get that going,\nright?\n\n424\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.180\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will do the following.\n\n425\n00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.200\nI'm gonna go ahead and I am going to just\ntake a look and see if we find anything.\n\n426\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.718\nRight, from our discovery rules,\nlet me just come down here real quick.\n\n427\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.050\nAnd we may have to wait because\nit is running behind the scenes.\n\n428\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.860\nWe don't know how long it will\nactually take to discover anything,\n\n429\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.180\nwe may not get anything right away.\n\n430\n00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.800\nBut eventually, what we will get is,\n\n431\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.340\nwe will get a network\ndevice that comes in here.\n\n432\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.810\nAnd we'll then ask for your devices,\nif there's more than one,\n\n433\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.310\nthat will come in and actually be\navailable after discovery runs.\n\n434\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.240\nAnd remember,\nyou gotta be patient with this.\n\n435\n00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.710\nIt does take a little while for\nthat to run.\n\n436\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.320\nYou can see status is idle.\n\n437\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.200\nLet me run this again, because I had this\nhappen the last time where I ran this and\n\n438\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.400\nit didn't take the first time\nwhen I was just setting this up.\n\n439\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.780\nAnd then it took and\nthen it finally started running, okay.\n\n440\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.770\nSo because status there should actually\nchange, and we should actually\n\n441\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.780\nget that to go to start it if we catch\nit quickly enough, before it runs.\n\n442\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.320\nSo it may take a couple of minutes for\nit to show up.\n\n443\n00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.181\nWe're not gonna wait for\nit to actually get a device.\n\n444\n00:20:54.181 --> 00:20:55.540\nBut you get the general idea.\n\n445\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.946\nEventually, we would have\na device show up in there.\n\n446\n00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:00.510\nAnd if anyone would discover,\n\n447\n00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.330\nwe would then be able to get the plabsy01\nmachine, the machine that we specified.\n\n448\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.190\nIt eventually would show up and\nbe available to us.\n\n449\n00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.050\nSo remember, we could target this\nto do routers, to do switches.\n\n450\n00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.570\nDo anything with SNMP and that's what we\nwould actually see ultimately as we do run\n\n451\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.620\nthrough this and\nthen from there of course,\n\n452\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.800\nwe're able to then go in and we're\nactually able to manage those devices.\n\n453\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.280\nReport on them as we saw and do all\nthe things we need to associate them.\n\n454\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff Adam.\n\n455\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.800\nWe appreciate you walking us through\nthis 'cuz it can be a little argues for\n\n456\n00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.300\nthe uninitiated such as myself,\nI've never use SCRUM in this way.\n\n457\n00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.950\nSo very cool, to see those steps.\n\n458\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.190\nAnd now I get a little more context on how\nit's suppose to look what I should expect,\n\n459\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.530\nand hopefully at the end of the day\nI get all my stuff squared away.\n\n460\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.320\nVery cool stuff.\n\n461\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.950\nAdam we appreciate you joining us and\ndoing it for us.\n\n462\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.070\nWe do appreciate you good folks for\nwatching, but\n\n463\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.060\nthat is our demonstration for today.\n\n464\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.390\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it and\nlearned a little bit of something, but\n\n465\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.060\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n466\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.490\nFor ITPProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n467\n00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n468\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.585\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:13.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.996\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:18.591\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:23.010\nin today's episode we are back with more\ndatacenter monitoring with Microsoft SCOM.\n\n8\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.550\nAnd of course joining us in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.320\nthe man, the myth, the legend,\nyou know him as Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.570\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nand how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.162\n&gt;&gt; Very, very good, hopefully better\nafter we're done with this demonstration.\n\n12\n00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.909\nGonna show you something that we've talked\nabout and actually done almost verbatim in\n\n13\n00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.279\na prior episode, but\nwe didn't really finish it out.\n\n14\n00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:42.047\nWanted to take the opportunity as we're\ndoing things here to show you end to end\n\n15\n00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:43.656\nhow to import a management pack.\n\n16\n00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:47.652\nWe're gonna download one from a website,\nopen up the MSI, grab the files,\n\n17\n00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.440\nimport the management pack,\njust quickly walk you through that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.118\nSo let's take a look if we could,\nwe're gonna go out here.\n\n19\n00:00:54.118 --> 00:00:56.812\nWe've got our website set\nup with our tools and\n\n20\n00:00:56.812 --> 00:01:00.208\nresources here,\nthank you to the folks at practice labs.\n\n21\n00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.489\nWe always use the best and\n\n22\n00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.418\nlatest technology to bring\nyou these demonstrations and\n\n23\n00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:08.760\ntheir stuff is, as you hopefully know cuz\nyou're using it, really, really good.\n\n24\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660\nWe've got our System Center\nManagement Pack sitting here, so\n\n25\n00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.780\nwe're gonna download that MSI,\nwe're gonna grab it.\n\n26\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.850\nYou saw me do this in one of\nthe prior demonstrations I\n\n27\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.453\nintegrated into the episode\nwe were talking about it.\n\n28\n00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:22.935\nI went out to the actual\nMicrosoft website,\n\n29\n00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:27.555\nwe grabbed one of the latest\nmanagement packs for Server 16 for\n\n30\n00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:31.790\nHyper-V, exploded it out on the desktop,\ntook a look at the different files.\n\n31\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.356\nI'm just gonna wait until it\nstops flashing yellow and\n\n32\n00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:36.431\ngoes bright nuclear red, before I import.\n\n33\n00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:38.278\n&gt;&gt; You will pay attention to me!\n\n34\n00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:39.051\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH].\n\n35\n00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:43.712\nAnd then we talked about the .mp file, the\n.mpb files to explain what they were, and\n\n36\n00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:47.790\nwe did the whole demonstration but\nwe didn't actually do the import.\n\n37\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.410\nSo I'm gonna actually show it to you and\nshow you how to pick up that thread and\n\n38\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.110\ngo from here.\n\n39\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.009\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nrun this, instead of saving it and\n\n40\n00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.890\nthen running it we'll\njust run it directly.\n\n41\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.442\nAnd we've got our EULA,\n\n42\n00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:01.010\nour end user license agreement here,\nscroll that over so you could see it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.930\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll click I Accept, we'll hit Next.\n\n44\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.400\nWe'll accept our default\ninstallation directory,\n\n45\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.960\nwe've got that sitting right here just so\nyou guys can see what that is.\n\n46\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.150\nCopy that real quick just so\nthat we have a record of it,\n\n47\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.596\nwe'll then go ahead and just make\nsure it's available for everybody.\n\n48\n00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:24.130\nClick Next, then I'll click Install,\nthat'll be real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.190\nPut that in there and you could see it\nopens up, just minimize that website,\n\n50\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.940\nopens up and you can see that we have our\n\n51\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.960\nvarious management packs,\nour MP files are there.\n\n52\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.600\nThis was\nthe Windows Server Management Pack,\n\n53\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.840\nso we have the Windows Server Library\nsitting right there, we can see that.\n\n54\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.590\nNow what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead,\n\n55\n00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.510\nwe're gonna grab that from the console and\nwe're gonna import that.\n\n56\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.655\nSo we're gonna minimize here,\n\n57\n00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:53.170\ngonna come over here to our administration\nworkspace &gt; Management packs.\n\n58\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.510\nWe're gonna right click, we're gonna do\nimport management pack right from there.\n\n59\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.560\nThen we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Add &gt; Add from disk, and\n\n60\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.625\nwe're gonna get our online\ncatalogue connection.\n\n61\n00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.390\nHey, they're not all available there,\ndo you wanna go out and look for\n\n62\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.320\ndependencies?\n\n63\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.730\nNot right now, but\nwe would in the real world.\n\n64\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.100\nGo ahead and do our import,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.160\nwe're gonna paste in our path there so\nwe can find it.\n\n66\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.890\nSo we have our ability to go out and\n\n67\n00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.470\ngrab the management pack that we need,\nwe can see it right there.\n\n68\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and grab the\nMicrosoft Server Library Management Pack,\n\n69\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.110\nwe've got it sitting right there.\n\n70\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.465\nLet's go ahead and\ndouble-click on that, bring that in,\n\n71\n00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:37.320\njust move this over a little bit so\nyou can see that.\n\n72\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.350\nAnd you'll see it loads up,\n\n73\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.870\nwe can stack up those management packs,\nas many of them as we need.\n\n74\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.740\nWe're just gonna right click and\nhide the task bar here real quick so\n\n75\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.800\nwe actually can see\nthe bottom button there.\n\n76\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.080\nBecause as you know, sometimes those\nwizards come up and it's hard to see that\n\n77\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.440\nscreen just because of the screen size,\nor see that bottom tier of the screen.\n\n78\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.980\nSo we're gonna click Install here and\nwe're then gonna watch this.\n\n79\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.340\nImport doesn't take very long,\n\n80\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.260\nit's a small management pack,\ntakes just a moment to bring it in.\n\n81\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.855\nYou'll see as soon as that green light,\nor the green bar finishes,\n\n82\n00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:10.330\nyou can see it's actually already\nimported, that we are done.\n\n83\n00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.660\nWe're now gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Close.\n\n84\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.145\nAnd we will give that a moment,\nit has to update.\n\n85\n00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:20.810\nBut if we come down here, we'll just\nwait for the console to update so\n\n86\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.370\nwe can actually scroll, but when we go\ndown at the bottom we will then be able to\n\n87\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.270\nsee that we can find the Windows\nClient Operating System Library and\n\n88\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.410\nwe'll know that it's been imported.\n\n89\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.240\nSo let's just scroll\ndown here alphabetically,\n\n90\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.500\ngo down towards the bottom,\nall the way down here.\n\n91\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.290\nJust one second, oops, there we go.\n\n92\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.510\nAnd Windows, Windows, Windows,\nWindows, Windows, Windows,\n\n93\n00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.150\nWindows Client Operating System Library\nright there.\n\n94\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.070\nAnd we can see that that one was the one\nthat we just went ahead and we imported,\n\n95\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.490\nand so now we have that\nmanagement pack available.\n\n96\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.360\nAnd of course now all\nthe associated monitors, reports,\n\n97\n00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.390\nviews, anything associated with\nthat would have been loaded in.\n\n98\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.481\nAnd so if we have any additional\ninformation we could go in, for instance\n\n99\n00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:09.973\ngo to our monitoring area, and if we did\nload anything up as an additional item,\n\n100\n00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:12.855\nas a result of that we'd be\nable to come down here and\n\n101\n00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:15.634\nwe will be able to see\nMicrosoft Windows Client.\n\n102\n00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:17.510\nAnd we will be then able to go in and\n\n103\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.010\nsee all the different items that are\navailable as part of the management pack.\n\n104\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.120\nWe have a logical disk state view,\n\n105\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.690\nwe have a network adapter state view,\nthose obviously may be important.\n\n106\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.410\nOperating system performance,\nwe'd have to target this out,\n\n107\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.710\nobviously it would be monitoring\ntask status, Windows Client status.\n\n108\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.320\nWe've got some health monitoring going\non here with Windows Client OS Health.\n\n109\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.882\nYou can see things here like disk\nhealth on our dashboard, right,\n\n110\n00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:45.340\nwe've also got operating system events.\n\n111\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.640\nThis is a pretty detailed\nmanagement pack that we bring in.\n\n112\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.310\nYou'll see here we've\ngot some stuff there,\n\n113\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.760\nand we've got performance here as well,\nClient OS performance.\n\n114\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.159\nDrill down,\nwe've got additional dashboards here and\n\n115\n00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.389\nmonitoring capabilities.\n\n116\n00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.635\nSo we brought all that in as\npart of our implementation and\n\n117\n00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:06.042\nintegration of the management pack through\nthe import that we saw end to end.\n\n118\n00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:09.962\nYou saw us go out and get it, you saw me\nactually finish up by using the add from\n\n119\n00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:12.487\ndisk option,\nthen import the management pack.\n\n120\n00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:16.127\nAnd of course you see in the console we're\nable to leverage the management pack to do\n\n121\n00:06:16.127 --> 00:06:17.064\na variety of things.\n\n122\n00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:20.835\n&gt;&gt; Well Adam, thanks so much, it's a short\nlittle demo but a very important one.\n\n123\n00:06:20.835 --> 00:06:24.995\nWanted make sure that you guys had the\nsoup to nuts kind of thing with importing\n\n124\n00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:29.283\na management pack into the Operations\nManager, and therefore being able to use\n\n125\n00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:33.060\nall of the features thereof that we\nmight download from the catalog.\n\n126\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.920\nWe do thank you for that, Adam,\nwe thank you good folks for watching.\n\n127\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.870\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n128\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.040\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n129\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n130\n00:06:41.860 -->

greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:16.181\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:20.983\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're talking all about data\n\n6\n00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:25.855\ncenter monitoring with Microsoft SCOM, and\nthe six gun slinger standing next to me\n\n7\n00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.500\nis our good friend joining us again today,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.300\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.520\nHow's it going, man?\n\n10\n00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.969\n&gt;&gt; I'm shot.\n\n11\n00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.929\nHelp me.\n\n12\n00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, it's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.750\nHey, you got to have a little\nfun when you're doing this,\n\n14\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.810\notherwise, well, it's just not fun.\n\n15\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.220\nSo that's why you got to\nplay around a little bit.\n\n16\n00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.990\nBut we do bring you serious information.\n\n17\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.430\nAnd good tidings from the land of SCOM.\n\n18\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.870\nWe are gonna continue our\ndemonstrations for you.\n\n19\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.260\nWe thought we would take a look at how to\nintegrate VMM, Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n20\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.290\nHow to take that,\nintegrate that with SCOM.\n\n21\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.506\nWe've talked a little bit about\nthat in one of our prior episodes.\n\n22\n00:00:57.506 --> 00:00:59.025\nI wanna show you how that happens.\n\n23\n00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.125\nGonna go in,\ntake a look at the VMM settings.\n\n24\n00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.375\nGo in, configure the OPS Manager\ninformation in there.\n\n25\n00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.465\nAnd we wanna also bring up pro and\n\n26\n00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:10.350\nperformance resource\noptimization monitoring.\n\n27\n00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.500\nWe're going to take a look at that.\n\n28\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.540\nThat would be essentially the idea in\nVMware's competitive stack of DRS,\n\n29\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540\ndistributed resource schedule, and\nthat automated load balancing and\n\n30\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.440\nautomation and monitoring, and\nall that kind of stuff that goes on.\n\n31\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.960\nWe're going to take a look at some of\nthat, how all that comes together.\n\n32\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.360\nSo we're going to jump in over here,\ntake a look.\n\n33\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.370\nThere we are, right up there.\n\n34\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.956\nAnd we're going to- I've already\nopened up the VMM console so\n\n35\n00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:36.135\nwe just on our server where our\nCVMM instance is installed.\n\n36\n00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:40.401\nI've opened up the console and I've just\ngone into the settings workspace right\n\n37\n00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.979\ndown here, and in the settings workspace\nI've highlighted system center settings,\n\n38\n00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.439\nand we have our ops\nmanager server item there.\n\n39\n00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.914\nI'm gonna right-click on that,\njust bring up properties, and\n\n40\n00:01:50.914 --> 00:01:54.515\nwe're gonna get our add operations\nmanager, just move this over so\n\n41\n00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.535\nyou could see it,\nadd operations manager wizard.\n\n42\n00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.280\nWe're gonna go through here,\nfrom the introductory screen.\n\n43\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.400\nHow we're gonna specify the ops\nmanager we're gonna connect to, and\n\n44\n00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.590\nconfigure this out.\n\n45\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.745\nWe'll provide credentials,\nwe'll specify that we have- or\n\n46\n00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.605\nit gives us a listing of all\nthe management packs we need.\n\n47\n00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.245\nMake sure those are already installed.\n\n48\n00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:15.751\nI'll walk through in my discussion and hit\nthe high level, and most of the management\n\n49\n00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.792\npacks I've said, we needed to bunch\na router, two or three of them off.\n\n50\n00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:22.472\nAll of them, including the versions,\nare in the show notes for you by the way.\n\n51\n00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:25.622\nSo you will be able to see them and\nknow exactly what those versions are.\n\n52\n00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.982\nIn case you're squinting right\nnow at the screen trying to say,\n\n53\n00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:30.452\nlet me get that real quick,\nsee what that version is.\n\n54\n00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:32.622\nWe do tell you everything you need right\nthere when you go to integrate this.\n\n55\n00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.292\nSo no worries about that at all.\n\n56\n00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:37.712\nSo we're gonna assume we have all\nthe information necessary to proceed.\n\n57\n00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:40.990\nWe're gonna click Next,\nwe're gonna specify our server name.\n\n58\n00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.084\nSo we're gonna ahead and type this in.\n\n59\n00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:51.850\nPlabSys01.practicelabs.com to\nour fully qualified domain name.\n\n60\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.960\nWe then, you'll see here, have our\nuse the VMM service account setting.\n\n61\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.400\nWe can go ahead and use either\nthe VMM server service account or\n\n62\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.380\nuse a Run As account.\n\n63\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.470\nWe'll leave the default\nservice account for VMM.\n\n64\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.410\nWe're gonna enable performance and\n\n65\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.820\nresource optimization,\ndown at the bottom here enable pro.\n\n66\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.460\nThis is gonna allow us to then\ndo some proactive monitoring and\n\n67\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.710\nspecify how things are working and\nwhether or not they're optimized, and\n\n68\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.490\nif not take some steps to\nhopefully make sure that happens.\n\n69\n00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.320\nEnable maintenance mode\nintegration with Ops Manager.\n\n70\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.450\nWhen hosts are put into maintenance mode,\nmake sure that if we do them in VMM,\n\n71\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.740\nwe alert Ops Manager.\n\n72\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.220\nSo that way Ops Manager doesn't\ngo crazy trying to tell us, hey,\n\n73\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.560\nby the way, that server you keep\nwanting to monitor, it's not there.\n\n74\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.270\nAnd here's all these crazy alerts\nabout the effects offline.\n\n75\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.320\nWell yeah, we know that, right?\n\n76\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.590\nBut we may not know that, in the sense\nthat if VMM is going to be able to put\n\n77\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.760\na host in the maintenance mode to do some\npatching or manipulation of the VMs or\n\n78\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.610\nwhatever we need to do,\nthen if we don't tell SCOM that,\n\n79\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.380\nSCOM's gonna think it's offline for\nreal, and indeed it is.\n\n80\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.100\nBut it may not know why, and\nwe're going to get crazy alerts and\n\n81\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.200\nall sorts of stuff happening,\nwhereas if we alert and\n\n82\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.920\ntell it that we're doing this,\nit's going to be a lot better for us.\n\n83\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.089\nSo want to make sure we\ncheck these things off and\n\n84\n00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.573\nobviously benefit from as much automation\nand communication as possible.\n\n85\n00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:11.090\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n86\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.666\nWe're going to click next here,\nleave all those settings there.\n\n87\n00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:18.726\nWe have to specify our username that's\ngoing to be able to drive all this\n\n88\n00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:20.496\nmunificence and magic for us.\n\n89\n00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:22.384\nThere's a word for you,\nlook that one up and\n\n90\n00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:24.440\ntell me what the old English\nuse of that one was.\n\n91\n00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.351\nAlright, so we are to do practice\nlabs here for our domain.\n\n92\n00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:33.230\nSo we're going to make sure we spell\nthat correctly, and I'm thinking we did.\n\n93\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.190\nThat could just be a smudge on my screen.\n\n94\n00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.100\nThere we go.\nPracticelabs, all right, good.\n\n95\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.030\nAnd we're to do administrator and\nwe're gonna put our password in.\n\n96\n00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.230\nAs we got all of that, and\nthen, we're gonna click next.\n\n97\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.520\nGive that just a second.\n\n98\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.225\nNow, I like this right here, we're just\ngonna take a look at this real quick.\n\n99\n00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:54.530\nSo, you've talked a lot about the value\nof PowerShell in different places,\n\n100\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.450\ntalked about the value of\nautomation in scripting.\n\n101\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.780\nOne of the nice things Microsoft has been\ndoing for a while now in the console\n\n102\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.630\nis integrating PowerShell where we can,\nand you obviously have tie-ins to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.820\nWe've talked about some of them,\n\n104\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.910\nwe'll continue to in other episodes\ngoing forward throughout all the shows.\n\n105\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.040\nBut we get to peek under the hood every so\noften.\n\n106\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.260\nWe get to view the script that's gonna\nactually get generated to do this.\n\n107\n00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.350\nAnd so just do a little word wrap here so\nwe can see it.\n\n108\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.880\nSo it will be easier for you to see.\n\n109\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.530\nIt's not a very big one.\n\n110\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.970\nI will make the font a little big,\ncuz I know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n111\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.210\nJust give me just a second.\n\n112\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.200\nWe'll do that and make that easier for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n113\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.440\nAnd we can see there that we've got\na PowerShell script that's gonna be run\n\n114\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.540\nto be able to do\na declared credential VMM,\n\n115\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.550\ncredential declared variable\nrather I should say.\n\n116\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.155\nSet that equal to Get-Credential.\n\n117\n00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:45.549\nThen we've got new SCOM,\nor New-SCOpsMgrConnection.\n\n118\n00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:49.305\nEnablePRO, so we've got the parameter for\nEnablePRO set to true.\n\n119\n00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:52.285\nEnableMaintenanceModeIntegration set\nto true, we did that.\n\n120\n00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:55.475\nOps Manager,\nspecify the name of the Ops Manager.\n\n121\n00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:57.835\nRunAsynchronously, use our credential.\n\n122\n00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:00.155\nThe credential we'll use\nVMM Service Account.\n\n123\n00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:02.370\nAnd so we've got that script\nrunning behind the scenes.\n\n124\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.980\nSo all this stuff, we think,\nwe're gonna be smart.\n\n125\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.120\nNext, next, next,\nconfigure, configure, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.570\nWhat really happens behind the scenes is\nthat PowerShell kicks off in the shell,\n\n127\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.250\nthe ops shell,\n\n128\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.250\nor the VMM shell, and it says I'm gonna\ngo ahead and it's gonna run this for us.\n\n129\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.800\nSo one of the reasons we\nkeep stressing to you\n\n130\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.260\nthat it's important to start learning\nabout PowerShell and knowing what it does\n\n131\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.800\nis that it's really being used to\ndrive almost everything we do.\n\n132\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.810\nWe just have a nice pretty graphical\noverlay for most of it on the console,\n\n133\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.230\nbut reality is it's there\nwhether we like it or not.\n\n134\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.740\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of funny, we're clicking\nthings and checking boxes and stuff,\n\n135\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.520\nand the whole time,\nthe system is basically building\n\n136\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.540\na PowerShell script out in the background,\nand then when you're done, it goes yeah,\n\n137\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.540\nyou think you did something with a GUI,\nreally?\n\n138\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.890\nAll you did was tell us what we\nshould put in the PowerShell script.\n\n139\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.020\nAnd now we're running that.\n\n140\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.650\nSo like Adam said,\nit can be really helpful for\n\n141\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.300\nyou to understand what that looks like and\nhow that works on the back end.\n\n142\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I made a boo boo.\n\n143\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.360\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n\n144\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.842\n&gt;&gt; It does happen on occasion, cuz I could\nnot see, cuz my screen went half dim-\n\n145\n00:06:57.842 --> 00:06:58.509\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.110\n&gt;&gt; And so when we take a look,\n\n147\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.040\nI just took the opportunity while Danny\nwas chatting with you to hit Run so\n\n148\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.220\nwe just get this thing started,\nand immediately we get the error,\n\n149\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.920\nwhich is actually not a bad thing,\ncuz you wanna see when things go wrong,\n\n150\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.400\nso you know how to fix them.\n\n151\n00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.727\nSo, if we get an error here, and\nwe could see the error up there,\n\n152\n00:07:11.727 --> 00:07:14.057\ncan we go full-screen just so\nI could show you what the error is,\n\n153\n00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:15.722\nwe'll rerun this to fix it for\nyou right now.\n\n154\n00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:18.810\nI think I'm gonna have Daniel type and\nsee if he can see better than I get.\n\n155\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.300\nSo the problem and when you look I\nknow maybe I can see even now but\n\n156\n00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.430\nI left out the a,\ninstead of plab I did plb, so\n\n157\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.000\nwe have a typo that-\n&gt;&gt; There's no such computer.\n\n158\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.494\n&gt;&gt; There's no such name out there.\n\n159\n00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:33.231\nSo this does show you by\nthe way DNS is working and\n\n160\n00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:37.130\nwe do actually check those machines\nto make sure they are real.\n\n161\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.310\nSo what we're gonna do is simply go\nback and rerun this, no big deal.\n\n162\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.820\nI will do this and fix it up right now.\n\n163\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.760\nSo, let's just quickly\nzip back through this.\n\n164\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.540\nWe'll spell it correctly this time,\nof course, and we'll get it right.\n\n165\n00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.432\nplaabsys01.\n\n166\n00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:53.158\nCould have sworn that I\nput the aa in there for\n\n167\n00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:56.990\nthe first time, practicelabs.com.\n\n168\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.000\nMake sure we got that in there,\ngot all that stuff.\n\n169\n00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.321\nGonna go ahead, click Next,\nput in our user name,\n\n170\n00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:10.456\npracticelabsmndministrator.\n\n171\n00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:13.052\nAt least it fails like\nthe second you start something.\n\n172\n00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:16.790\nYou know, one of those like let me go get\nall the prep work done, half way through,\n\n173\n00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.150\nwait 10 minutes then I'm gonna\nfail right before I connect.\n\n174\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.005\nThat would have just\nobviously not been very good,\n\n175\n00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:23.300\ncuz we would have wasted all\nthat time waiting on it, so,\n\n176\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.100\nat least it did fail right out of\nthe gate, that's the good thing, right?\n\n177\n00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.340\nAll right, so\nwe got practice labs, we got that.\n\n178\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.540\nLet's just click Next there,\nlet's get that set up,\n\n179\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.670\nlet's hit Finish, let's get that running.\n\n180\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.140\nThis time,\nyou could see it right up there,\n\n181\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.600\nit is running,\nit is out of the gate and successful.\n\n182\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.240\nIt's gonna take a couple\nof minutes to cook,\n\n183\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.710\nit's gotta wait on this to finish up,\nwe're gonna come on back,\n\n184\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.030\nshow you what happens after we get\ndone and play with pro a little bit.\n\n185\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.065\nAll right, so we can see that our task\nhas successfully completed, hurrah,\n\n186\n00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:56.680\nor haza or just yay, whatever you prefer,\nbut you could see we were successful.\n\n187\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.200\nI do know in the real world this will take\nyou I guess probably 10 to 15 minutes,\n\n188\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.950\nright, so don't be surprised about that.\n\n189\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.450\nBut we could see it did complete,\nran successfully.\n\n190\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.160\nWe didn't really go into the detail\nwhat goes on in the job area here.\n\n191\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.840\nBut you can see the summary area\ntells us kind of what's happening.\n\n192\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.230\nYou go down here, look at details,\nisn't much more to know than that,\n\n193\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.000\ncuz we only did one thing, but\nwe could see that that's there.\n\n194\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.320\nDo a little change tracking in\ncase we did multiple iterations.\n\n195\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.760\nWe could see what was going on.\n\n196\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.000\nWe'll close this out.\n\n197\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.760\nYou can, just so you know, close out that\nwindow during install at anytime and\n\n198\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.680\njust go back and\nlook at it whenever you want.\n\n199\n00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.900\nGot a little jobs area right up here.\n\n200\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.650\nWe just click on that,\nbrings the window right back up for us.\n\n201\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.170\nShows us what's happening.\n\n202\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.590\nSo we could do that as needed.\n\n203\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.230\nNow what we're gonna do is make\nsure that everything is set up.\n\n204\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.160\nNow we did enable Pro as part of\nthe install and configuration, so\n\n205\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.800\nlet's go in and show you the properties,\nlet's show you it's already turned on.\n\n206\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.175\nBut If we didn't we will go in, and\n\n207\n00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:55.765\ncheck off the box in the properties\nsetting here and Pro would be enabled.\n\n208\n00:09:55.765 --> 00:09:56.533\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n209\n00:09:56.533 --> 00:10:00.245\nWell, also could we go in and\nconfigure SQL server analysis services and\n\n210\n00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:01.285\nmake sure we enable that.\n\n211\n00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:04.065\nWe're gonna take a look at that and\nshow you how to do that as well here.\n\n212\n00:10:04.065 --> 00:10:08.335\nSo we're gonna right click on OPS\nmanager server and properties.\n\n213\n00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:10.625\nWe'll see that we do\nhave connection status.\n\n214\n00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:12.115\nGreen circle white check, okay.\n\n215\n00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.717\nThat's what we expect to see.\n\n216\n00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:14.630\nAll is well.\n\n217\n00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.120\nWe do have our hard coded\ninformation here now.\n\n218\n00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.130\nConnection settings, enable the connection\nto ops manager that's running, of course.\n\n219\n00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.260\nEnable Pro,\nyou can see it is turned on by default.\n\n220\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.940\nIf we had it turned on,\nwe'd come in here and check that off.\n\n221\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.480\nWe do have the maintenance\nmode integration.\n\n222\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.140\nWe've talked about those\nthings on the setup\n\n223\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.470\nas we were doing\nthe configuration initially.\n\n224\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.930\nJust move this over so you could\nsee that a little bit more clearly.\n\n225\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.390\nSo we talked about this.\n\n226\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.270\nCan also take a look at and tell that our\nmanagement packs have been installed and\n\n227\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.660\nconfigured successfully.\n\n228\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.540\nWe'll see them here.\n\n229\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.720\nSo we do have a list of the ones\nthat are part of this configuration.\n\n230\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.700\nThis is actually what's taking the longest\nhere, is that making sure all these\n\n231\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.400\nmanagement packs get instantiated and\nset up the right way.\n\n232\n00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.500\nAnd then I mentioned\nSQL Server Analysis Services said we would\n\n233\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.740\nshow you how to do this.\n\n234\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:02.020\nWe can enable the SAS functionality here,\ncheck off the box as you can see in\n\n235\n00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:08.050\norder for VMM to be able to use SAS or\nthe SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\n236\n00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.310\nThis is the, essentially the data cube and\nthe data warehouse and\n\n237\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.106\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n238\n00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:12.980\nTo be able to do this,\n\n239\n00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.150\nto do forecasting analysis,\nwe have to enable this integration.\n\n240\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.460\nSo we're gonna set this up.\n\n241\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.160\nWe'll give it a SAS server name.\n\n242\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.118\nWe're gonna use our\ndefault SQL install here.\n\n243\n00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.500\nSAS or plaabsys01.\n\n244\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.665\nWe'll give it our instance name,\n\n245\n00:11:28.665 --> 00:11:33.890\nmssqlserver or default name that\nwe've been using for everything else.\n\n246\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.600\nWe'll put in our port here, 2383.\n\n247\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.800\nThat is our standard port\nthat we are going to use.\n\n248\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.380\nAnd then we'll specify our\ncredentials right down here.\n\n249\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.227\nWe'll do our enter username and password.\n\n250\n00:11:50.227 --> 00:11:53.062\nDo our username, which will be our domain,\n\n251\n00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:57.840\npracticelabsadministrator, we'll\nput that in.\n\n252\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.820\nAnd then we will put in our password,\nwhoops,\n\n253\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.330\nput in our password,\nget that in there as well.\n\n254\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.360\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click OK.\n\n255\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.270\nWe could do the View Script at\nthe bottom there on the left,\n\n256\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.400\nI showed you that before,\njust to point that out.\n\n257\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.330\nWe can do that as well.\n\n258\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.650\nWe'll give that just\na moment to do its thing.\n\n259\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.540\nWhat did I do there?\n\n260\n00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.290\nPlease provide a valid computer or\ninstance name.\n\n261\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.040\nAll right, so\nI may have had a little typo there.\n\n262\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.310\nLet's make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n263\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.210\n&gt;&gt; PLB machine has come back to haunt us?\n\n264\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:25.910\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps.\n\n265\n00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.110\nIt could be.\nLet's just make sure I didn't\n\n266\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.300\nmake a mistake there.\n\n267\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.470\nI may have put in O instead of zero\non the item there, I'm not sure.\n\n268\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.850\nI thought I hit zero.\n\n269\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.940\nBut plaabsys, again,\nthat screen keeps going up and down.\n\n270\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.810\nThere we go, plaabsys01,\nmssqlserver ,we got that.\n\n271\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.245\nGot the right number s's in there,\nmssqlserver.\n\n272\n00:12:47.245 --> 00:12:49.093\nGot our port number 2383.\n\n273\n00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:49.885\nThat all looks good.\n\n274\n00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:53.070\nCould be our password or username.\n\n275\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.710\nLet's just go ahead and\nlet's take a look and\n\n276\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.070\nmake sure that we're good there,\nall right.\n\n277\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.086\nSo I'm just gonna go in,\nwe'll just double check that real quick.\n\n278\n00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:09.984\nAnd let me see, so\nwe've got practicelabsadministrator,\n\n279\n00:13:09.984 --> 00:13:15.466\njust make sure the password is right\nthat could have be the problem.\n\n280\n00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:18.305\nMake sure that's good,\n2383, mssql, plaabsys01.\n\n281\n00:13:18.305 --> 00:13:21.512\nThat should all be good let's\njust take a look and see,\n\n282\n00:13:21.512 --> 00:13:23.760\nperhaps I just did not pay attention.\n\n283\n00:13:30.807 --> 00:13:32.530\n&gt;&gt; It's trying.\n\n284\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.440\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n285\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.180\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n286\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.200\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nWoo hoo.\n\n287\n00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.540\n&gt;&gt; That had us holding our breath for\nfive seconds, right?\n\n288\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.411\n&gt;&gt; We didn't get that on camera.\n\n289\n00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:38.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n290\n00:13:38.995 --> 00:13:41.240\n&gt;&gt; More like, I'm gonna do like,\nit's gonna be like a moving one.\n\n291\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.370\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, all right.\n\n292\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.730\nAll right, so we got that.\n\n293\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.330\nSo it's probably just me not\ntyping in the right stuff.\n\n294\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.170\nCuz I can't see half\nthe time on the screen.\n\n295\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.710\nSo we could see that once we get that\nsetup, it's now configured as well.\n\n296\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.100\nAnd now if we go back,\nwe take a look at properties.\n\n297\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.130\nWe could actually see that it is up and\nrunning.\n\n298\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.320\nAnd we'll be able to go in and\njust configure, rather ensure that.\n\n299\n00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.910\nSo we can go and take a look real quick.\n\n300\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.780\nAnd just see, we go to properties here.\n\n301\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.140\nCome over here, we can actually see\nit is now set up and configured.\n\n302\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.420\nSee it looks a little different.\n\n303\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.300\nWe do have our instance there,\ngot our port.\n\n304\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.370\nAll that information is available to us.\n\n305\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.480\nThis is how we do\nthe backend integration and\n\n306\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.110\nmake sure that we go through configure\nSCOM, VMM integration, enable and\n\n307\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.150\nuse Pro or enable and set up Pro,\nenable and use or set up SSAS integration.\n\n308\n00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.910\nAnd by handing out and\ngiving out all these credentials,\n\n309\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.560\ngetting everything organized,\nconfigured up and set up correctly,\n\n310\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.360\nwe now have the ability to link the VMM\nproduct into the SCOM solution,\n\n311\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.020\nbring fabric monitoring of\nthe Cloud into SCOM and\n\n312\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.720\nallow us to be more proactive in how\nwe manage and maintain the fabric.\n\n313\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.780\nAnd that's gonna be an upcoming\nsource of conversation for\n\n314\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.120\nus in terms of how we're gonna\ndo application monitoring and\n\n315\n00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.540\ndealing with some of\nthose kinds of issues.\n\n316\n00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.710\nWe have a whole separate conversations\nthat goes, and not just the conversation,\n\n317\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.830\nbut entire show.\n\n318\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.620\nWhole episodes on how to actually\nconfigure and do monitoring with VMM and\n\n319\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.510\nintegration and all that in the 7246 and\n7247 series, the MCSE Private Cloud,\n\n320\n00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.115\nwhere we go deeper and wider into not\njust SCOM, but really do a deep dive into\n\n321\n00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:15.660\nVMM specifically, and look at how we\nset that fabric up and maintain that.\n\n322\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.000\nSo always think about that.\n\n323\n00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.270\nI encourage you to come back,\ntake a look at those shows, join us and\n\n324\n00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.370\nfind out more about how we extend\nthis product and do more with it.\n\n325\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.660\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\ngoing through the rest of our episodes and\n\n326\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.720\nshow material here around SCOM and\nSCOM monitoring, and\n\n327\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.720\nhow we do that for\nthe data center in the cloud.\n\n328\n00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.975\nAnd Daniel, you are, if I'm not mistaken,\ngoing to use your powers of maleficence.\n\n329\n00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Malevolent powers,\n\n330\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.960\nmaleficent powers-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n331\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.950\n&gt;&gt; You are maleficent.\n\n332\n00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.230\nNo you are not, I'm only kidding.\n\n333\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.000\nDaniel's gonna take us out,\nbut we are done with our demo.\n\n334\n00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.270\nAlways have, and keep in mind just\nas we're wrapping up, always have\n\n335\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.250\nin your mind the thought process about\nnot just documenting what we did,\n\n336\n00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:53.990\nyou saw what we did?\n\n337\n00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.510\nAnd I was just gonna go and practice that.\n\n338\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.860\nBut I always stress the importance\nof using those screens that we saw.\n\n339\n00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.000\nThe summary screens and the script screen,\nto grab that documentation and make sure\n\n340\n00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.920\nthat we have a record of it, so that you\nknow what you did in the real world, so\n\n341\n00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.680\nyou can track that back a year from now,\ntwo years from now,\n\n342\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.720\nwhenever it is you gotta\nmanage that infrastructure.\n\n343\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.960\nIn case something goes wrong,\nwe're to talk about disaster recovery and\n\n344\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.380\nbusiness continuity in some of the very\nlast episodes we put together for you.\n\n345\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.140\nWanna make sure you take a look at those\nand understand how to deal with it.\n\n346\n00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.090\nBut, if anything does go wrong,\nyou got a record of what we did here.\n\n347\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.360\nSo, don't underestimate the value\nof taking some screen captures,\n\n348\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.120\ntaking a look at what you did and\ncapturing it as you're doing it, so\n\n349\n00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.780\nyou can refer back to it\nlater if you need to.\n\n350\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.060\nSo it's going to be very important.\n\n351\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Wise words from our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n352\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.720\nWe do thank you for\nthe cool demonstrations today, and\n\n353\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.960\nwe do thank our good folks for watching,\nbut Adam is absolutely correct.\n\n354\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.570\nIt is time for us to sign off.\n\n355\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.330\nFor ITProTV, thanks for watching.\n\n356\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.080\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n357\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.840\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n358\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.040\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n359\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:54.766\n[MUSIC]\n\n360\n00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:57.136\nThank you for

watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.100\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose In\nthis episode we'll be looking at APM.\n\n6\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240\nApplication performance monitoring and\nwith us today we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.350\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n8\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.780\n&gt;&gt; APM,\napplication performance monitoring.\n\n9\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.430\nWhoo hoo.\n\n10\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.605\nI'm excited.\n\n11\n00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:35.205\nPart one of a really cool topic but\nactually, believe it or not, it's almost\n\n12\n00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:39.545\nlike a part six of our last series of\nepisodes on going through and monitoring\n\n13\n00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:43.655\ncloud based applications cuz it is a\nsubset of what we're talking about there.\n\n14\n00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.165\nWe got into the edge of it\nreally through our last episode.\n\n15\n00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:48.335\nIf you haven't seen it,\nyou may want to go back and take a look,\n\n16\n00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:53.525\npart five of that series of episodes we\ndid around monitoring cloud applications,\n\n17\n00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.720\nwhere we took a look at the management\npack templates that are built\n\n18\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.400\nin the authoring area in\nthe work space in SCOM.\n\n19\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.940\nAnd we drove through and\nkind of looked at each one.\n\n20\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520\nWe did a quick glance out.\n\n21\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.840\nWe have to click a little flyby demo on\nsetting up the process monitor, and so\n\n22\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.540\nwe did that.\n\n23\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.430\nBut we're gonna go delve\na little deeper in.\n\n24\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.810\nWe're gonna take a look at the .net\nmonitoring application template,\n\n25\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.350\nand utilize that to monitor Windows.net\ncentric app and show you what that\n\n26\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.530\nlooks like and how to set it up and\nall things we can do with that.\n\n27\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.650\nIt's actually kind of interesting because\nin the last iteration of SCOM as we go\n\n28\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.518\ninto 12 R2 we've developed Alpeon\njust .NET centric Windows centric.\n\n29\n00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:36.770\nWindows communication framework-centric\nmonitoring with this thought process.\n\n30\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.140\nThat's where we've been.\n\n31\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.310\nWe could do ASP.net Windows communication\nframework monitoring on Windows service,\n\n32\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.460\nour Windows centric apps that\nare developed on the .net framework.\n\n33\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.150\nHosted either NIS seven or eight so\n\n34\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.290\nwe have that flexibility going back\na couple of generations there.\n\n35\n00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.250\nWindows services written the dot\nnet framework can be monitored\n\n36\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.380\nthere as well but\nwe've added support for Java.\n\n37\n00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.990\nI mentioned this way back in one of our\nearly episodes as we were getting started\n\n38\n00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.500\ntalking about all of the different\nthough processes and\n\n39\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.020\nI mentioned that we built out\nenterprise Java monitoring support and\n\n40\n00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340\nso we got the ability to do Tomcat for\nWindows and Linux.\n\n41\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.910\nJava JDK, and generic servlets,\nStruts, AXIS,\n\n42\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.530\nthings like that,\nare all going to be possible now.\n\n43\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.910\nAnd so we can fairly detailed\nmonitoring with APM, which is nice.\n\n44\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.750\nWe install the OPS Manager Agent first,\nof course.\n\n45\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.190\nWhen we do that, we get an APM agent\nthat is up and running, as part fo that.\n\n46\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.810\nSo, APM is bundled directly with\nMicrosoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n47\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.350\nThe APM engine runs as a service\ncalled system center management APM so\n\n48\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.970\nyou can go look for\nthat in the services stack.\n\n49\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.550\nBut it is disabled when you\ninstall it until you need it.\n\n50\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.080\nSo once we configure APM we deploy the APM\ntemplate that's gonna be created through\n\n51\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.315\nthe agent onto the box or onto the target\nsystems, then, that service gets spun up.\n\n52\n00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.730\nSo, there's a little step-by-step thought\nprocess we've got to go through here and\n\n53\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.870\nfigure that out, but\nonce we get that up and\n\n54\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.000\nrunning, then,\nwe will be able to start leveraging APM.\n\n55\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.988\nWe do have some background packs\nthat have to be installed in\n\n56\n00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:07.480\nSCOM We've got some information.\n\n57\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.120\nWe'll take a look at it and\nshow you on the web here.\n\n58\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.840\nBut Server 2008, IS version 7,\nSystemCenter.Apm.web,\n\n59\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.740\nIS7, same thing for Server 12, so we need\nServer 12 IIS which is version 8 for\n\n60\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.030\nIS and the SystemCenter.Apm.web IIS\n8 management packs.\n\n61\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.120\nAll four of those have to\nbe brought in and set up.\n\n62\n00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.920\nWe have those already up and running.\n\n63\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.700\nAnd then, once we have that,\nwe're then gonna be able to go through,\n\n64\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.820\nI've already got a template already\nspecked out, set up and monitoring.\n\n65\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.790\nI'm gonna show you what that looks like,\nshow you the outcome, in other words.\n\n66\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.280\nWe'll also then go back through and\n\n67\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.290\nwe'll take a look at how\nto set it up real quick.\n\n68\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.810\nWe do actually the go through a deep dive,\nhands on, specified lab.\n\n69\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.540\nWhere we go through a separate episode,\n\n70\n00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.510\nactually walk through the logistics\nof this and set this up also, so.\n\n71\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.690\nYou'll be able to take a look at\nthat quickly, if you're interested.\n\n72\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.120\nAll right, so IF we jump in here,\nand just start with the web.\n\n73\n00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.590\nThought we'd just show you just some of\nthe background information that would be\n\n74\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.950\nhelpful to you, make sure you know how\nto do this, then we'll go and we'll\n\n75\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.160\ntake a look in the console real quick,\nand we'll see what's going on there.\n\n76\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.900\nBefore beginning our .NET monitoring\napplication experience, hands and\n\n77\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.910\nfeet inside the car at all times,\nladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.\n\n78\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.520\nNever stand up if the ride stops.\n\n79\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.280\nIf it does, rest assured,\nwe will come and take care of you.\n\n80\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.110\nRest calmly and wait for\nus to start the ride over again.\n\n81\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.250\nSounds like Disney World.\n\n82\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.690\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So we just want to know somethings\n\n83\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.720\nabout monitoring here obviously\nthere's some do's and don't and\n\n84\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.270\nsome things that we have to be aware of.\n\n85\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.415\nWe have to make sure we have the opts\nmanager web consul installed before\n\n86\n00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:29.265\nwe actually start doing this monitoring.\n\n87\n00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:31.765\nWe talked about the web\nconsole in other episodes.\n\n88\n00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:34.005\nI did the walk through on how to\nset all this up and install it.\n\n89\n00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:36.975\nI actually showed you what the web\nconsole looks like, we logged in and\n\n90\n00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:37.675\ntook a look there.\n\n91\n00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.625\nSo you wanna make sure you have that,\nbecause what we need is not so\n\n92\n00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:44.520\nmuch the web console but\nwhat we need with the console.\n\n93\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.150\nIs the fact that we get\nthe App Advisor and\n\n94\n00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.140\nApp Diagnostics consoles which also\nare part of the Web Console experience.\n\n95\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.040\nAnd they're all run through the web.\n\n96\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.620\nI'm going to show you what\nthose would look like.\n\n97\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.950\nAnd make sure you understand\nhow to use those.\n\n98\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.000\nBecause we're going to be able to go in\nand use those if we have a problem or\n\n99\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.780\nan error associated\nwith the monitoring and\n\n100\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.100\nwe'll just take a look under the hood and\nsee what those look like.\n\n101\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.670\nSo you're gonna wanna go through here,\njust take a look.\n\n102\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.820\nWe're gonna go in and\nset up our .NET monitor,\n\n103\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.920\nit's gonna look very similar to\nthis once we get it up and running.\n\n104\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.800\nI'm gonna show you this but actually show\nit to you it for real in the console, but\n\n105\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.400\nwe'll see that we're gonna have our\nmonitoring capabilities set up.\n\n106\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.650\nAnd then once we have done that we'll\ngo ahead and we'll configure it and\n\n107\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.200\nwe'll take a look at what\nit actually looks like.\n\n108\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.360\nSo just some prereqs .NET Application\nPerformance Monitoring Template itself.\n\n109\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.530\nWhat's in the template, how does it work?\n\n110\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.950\nVery detailed guidance here\nabout how to use the template.\n\n111\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.360\nWe're gonna go through and\nset this up, but you can see here,\n\n112\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.060\nwhat are the scenarios?\n\n113\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.260\nHow to let you do the monitoring?\n\n114\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.310\nWhat are the options in the wizard?\n\n115\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.060\nWhat are the server\nside configs we can do?\n\n116\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.620\nWhat are the advanced settings?\n\n117\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.370\nWhere the server side customization's,\nall the different pieces that we need.\n\n118\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.780\nSo if you're gonna get serious\nabout doing .NET monitoring,\n\n119\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.910\nyou're gonna want to take a look at this\ninformation and scroll through here,\n\n120\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.390\nyou can see all the links,\nall the different information, but\n\n121\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.290\nI'm gonna show you how to use or\nthey're gonna be important to use.\n\n122\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.220\nSo take a look at that.\n\n123\n00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.640\nHow to set and configure monitoring for\nthe .NET application.\n\n124\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.120\nWe are just going to walk through,\ndo this in a walk-through right now.\n\n125\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.240\nAnd you will a separate hands-on\nepisode specific to this.\n\n126\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.750\nSo, you can read up on how to do this.\n\n127\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.340\nAlso working with the application\ndiagnostics console.\n\n128\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.280\nI'm going to show you haw to do that or\n\n129\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.940\nat least show you what that looks\nlike if you haven't seen it before.\n\n130\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.220\nWe have it already up and running.\n\n131\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.250\nI'm going to bring it up for\nyou and just show you it.\n\n132\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.270\nYou do need Silverlight installed for\nthe web consoles,\n\n133\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.370\nI think I told you that one of the other\nepisodes, just be aware of that.\n\n134\n00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.600\nBut you can see that we can go through,\nwe can group events by area of interest.\n\n135\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.530\nThis is what the console looks\nlike when we do a little grouping.\n\n136\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.080\nSo let me just scroll down\na little bit more, so\n\n137\n00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.430\nyou can see that right above\nthe window there, right there!\n\n138\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.120\nAnd you could see that the console\nis a searchable interface so\n\n139\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.740\nwe can bring up errors and\nwe can start working with them.\n\n140\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.457\nOur consoles are empty right now\nbecause our apps are perfect,\n\n141\n00:06:44.457 --> 00:06:47.760\nare no errors, so as a result\nyou're not going to see anything.\n\n142\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.190\nBut if we do generate any errors and\n\n143\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.030\nthe monitor already set up will certainly\nshow up and we'll refresh the consul but\n\n144\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.000\nwhen I went to last look everything was\nrunning and everything was healthy.\n\n145\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.520\nDarn it.\nBut\n\n146\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.640\nit is running well but as a result we have\nno errors to show you right now but I\n\n147\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.560\nthought at least I'd show you what it does\nlook like in case you haven't seen this.\n\n148\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.160\nSo it's going to\n\n149\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.860\nload up the errors her because that's\nwhat this console really is about.\n\n150\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.240\nHey, something went wrong.\n\n151\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.060\nLet's go in and\nlook at what's going on there.\n\n152\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.160\nLet's group those errors\ntogether by exception, class, and\n\n153\n00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.440\nlet's start delving into them.\n\n154\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.200\nThis is what the app dev\nteam would wanna see.\n\n155\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.800\nThey'd wanna start going in,\nlooking at this information.\n\n156\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.180\nStarting to get a better picture of\nperformance of what may be going wrong so\n\n157\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.930\nthey interact with it.\n\n158\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.270\nSo it looks like this.\n\n159\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.960\nIf we want group these application\nerrors by failed function\n\n160\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.260\nwe can do that as well\nas you can see here.\n\n161\n00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.380\nSo we can do different things.\n\n162\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.600\nWe can also group performance\nevents by heaviest resource usage.\n\n163\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.940\nSo we can take a look and\ngroup in different ways.\n\n164\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.290\nScroll down there a little more for\nyou in the console so you can see that.\n\n165\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.650\nSo it is an interesting thing\nthat we can be doing there.\n\n166\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.740\nWe also have the ability to be able\nto use the diagnostics console.\n\n167\n00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.016\nSo we'll be taking a look at this, the\ndiagnostic console rather the application\n\n168\n00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:53.685\nadvisor console, is what I meant to say.\n\n169\n00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:55.590\nWe have both and\nwe'll be taking a look at both.\n\n170\n00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.756\nSo some of the background work and\nresources for\n\n171\n00:07:57.756 --> 00:07:59.931\nyou that you're gonna\nwanna just take note of.\n\n172\n00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:03.797\nLet's go ahead,\nlet's go into our lab environment.\n\n173\n00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:05.994\nLet me just rest our timer there.\n\n174\n00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:09.870\nLet me bring up our console so\nwe have it all up and running for us.\n\n175\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.090\nAnd what we already have set up,\nas I said,\n\n176\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.740\nis I've used the dot .NET application\nperformance monitoring framework here so\n\n177\n00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.180\nI've gonna and used the template.\n\n178\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.910\nI've created an app that is\njust gonna be our sample app,\n\n179\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.650\ntied it to the default management pack.\n\n180\n00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.550\nWe're gonna take a look at this I'll\nshow you what I did after I show you\n\n181\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.730\nthe output of this.\n\n182\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.231\nBut I went ahead and\nI've created this and so\n\n183\n00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:32.909\nnow that I've set this up what actually\nhappens is you go over here to monitoring.\n\n184\n00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.243\nAnd up under at the top of\nour monitoring workspace,\n\n185\n00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:41.391\nup under our application\nmonitoring right here.\n\n186\n00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:45.629\nUnderneath we get our .NET monitoring\nfolder that's already set up there\n\n187\n00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:46.174\nas well.\n\n188\n00:08:46.174 --> 00:08:50.745\nAnd then below our .NET monitoring,\nwe now have a folder instantiated\n\n189\n00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:54.800\nspecific to the monitor I just\ncreated using the template.\n\n190\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.136\nI called mine ITProTV app test.\n\n191\n00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:58.476\nSo that's what we see there.\n\n192\n00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:03.251\nAnd then underneath that folder I've\ngot information, and views, and\n\n193\n00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.286\ndashboards, and alerts, and\n\n194\n00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:10.309\nall this stuff specific to this\nparticular monitor that I've configured.\n\n195\n00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:13.111\nSo all the stuff I set up\nbound to my management pack,\n\n196\n00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.138\ndefault management pack is what I used\nare now gonna be instantiated here.\n\n197\n00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:20.481\nAnd every time I create one, I'm gonna\nget another folder that's set up that\n\n198\n00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:23.500\nI could do monitoring specific\nto this instantiated instance.\n\n199\n00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.874\nThe specific named instance of\nthe app that I wanna pull in.\n\n200\n00:09:25.874 --> 00:09:28.426\nAnd so you can see here,\nI've got my active alerts,\n\n201\n00:09:28.426 --> 00:09:30.224\nthere are no active alerts here yet.\n\n202\n00:09:30.224 --> 00:09:34.560\nI've got my app test information,\nyou could see its state view here.\n\n203\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.990\nSo we could see it as monitored,\nit is healthy.\n\n204\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.030\nThe web communication when is\ncommunication framework web service\n\n205\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.102\ncomponent is healthy.\n\n206\n00:09:41.102 --> 00:09:44.171\nAnd so I'm monitoring that and\neverything looks good.\n\n207\n00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:48.020\nAnd I obviously have my ability over\nhere as we've seen off to the right.\n\n208\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.580\nWe went through this in\nother episodes to go in and\n\n209\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.500\nlook at all my different views and\nsee different things.\n\n210\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.420\nIf I chose to do my network vicinity\ndashboard, I would be able to go in.\n\n211\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.419\nI'd take a look at my application,\nas you can see here.\n\n212\n00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:03.972\nAnd I can just refresh, it's not healthy.\n\n213\n00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:06.110\nAll right, I can move it around,\ninteract with it.\n\n214\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.930\nBut you'll see everything is good and\n\n215\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.160\nyou can see that, it's just showing me\nthis, it's running on this local machine.\n\n216\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.590\nSo I'm not gonna spend on it some more.\n\n217\n00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.700\nBut if I had a large scale infrastructure,\nI would be able to see that.\n\n218\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.207\nI could go to my Diagram view,\nsame thing we were talking about before.\n\n219\n00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:23.151\nI could see the Diagram view is\nbuilt out a little bit more,\n\n220\n00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:24.057\nit's just-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And\n\n221\n00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:25.871\nif we had multiple tiers,\nyou would be able to see that.\n\n222\n00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:27.151\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Multiple tiers, exactly,\n\n223\n00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:28.829\nthis is the Diagram view Cherokee loves,\nright?\n\n224\n00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:29.870\nSo we could see this.\n\n225\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.600\nSo we could see the app itself right as\nbeing monitored from the template and\n\n226\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.860\nwe can see it here.\n\n227\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.800\nWe can open this up,\nlet's just drill down.\n\n228\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.650\nThis is one of those interactive\ndiagrams that Cherokee actually\n\n229\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.480\nlikes it has multiple layers.\n\n230\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.420\nAnd I can go down you see\nI'm drilling down as I go.\n\n231\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.489\nAnd you could see that I get\ndown to my actual orchestrator.\n\n232\n00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:50.306\nI'm using the orchestrator product and\nthe web console from, and\n\n233\n00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:54.120\nI'm actually monitoring that as a .NET\napp, and so that's what I'm seeing here.\n\n234\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.430\nAnd I can drill all the way down\nthrough all the different layers.\n\n235\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.930\nAnd I could see there's a checkmark for\nevery one, everything is healthy.\n\n236\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.810\nAnd so I'm able to see in realtime, right,\nthat this application is being monitored,\n\n237\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.370\nand that this state is healthy.\n\n238\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.650\nAnd this is what the value of\nthe .NET performance monitoring is,\n\n239\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.130\nor the .NET template rather, for\n\n240\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.900\napplication performance monitoring\nthat allows me to see this.\n\n241\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.490\nSo I'm able to see in realtime\nthat this application is healthy.\n\n242\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.800\nSo I'm able to see that I can\ninteract with it, I can open up and\n\n243\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.130\nlook at different views if I need to.\n\n244\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.330\nWe've talked about this.\n\n245\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.442\nI could look at properties and\nI could interact, right?\n\n246\n00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:27.464\nSo I have all of these different views\navailable to me, so you could see\n\n247\n00:11:27.464 --> 00:11:31.380\nthat I could drill through here and I can\nlook at different information directly.\n\n248\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.215\nI could then go in overall and I can\nlook at the component health here and\n\n249\n00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:38.923\nI could see the component health of\nthe individual areas of the app.\n\n250\n00:11:38.923 --> 00:11:41.940\nIf there are active alerts,\nI can drill down obviously and see those.\n\n251\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.830\nWe've talked about those.\n\n252\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.080\nI could go in, I could see just\na little bit more data down here\n\n253\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.965\nabout general performance information.\n\n254\n00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:50.610\nCould we go full screen?\n\n255\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.570\nYou may be able to see just a little\nbit better on that bottom area.\n\n256\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.232\nNot by much cuz it is still kinda tiny,\nbut I could see some detailed information\n\n257\n00:11:57.232 --> 00:12:00.460\non data that's being gathered\nas I do performance monitoring.\n\n258\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.400\nPercent of performance events per\nsecond interval, percent threshold,\n\n259\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.130\nthese are all of the setting that have\nbeen programmed, that I am using.\n\n260\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.210\nAnd I'll show you where these are as\nwe go and set up the monitor.\n\n261\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.300\nSo we have all of this,\nand we can see this, and\n\n262\n00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.220\nso this has all been set up as\npart of what I just created.\n\n263\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.780\nSo now I wanna walk back and\nI wanna show you how this is done.\n\n264\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.070\nBut before we do that, let's go in and\nlet's take a look at those other two\n\n265\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.170\nconsoles that we talked about, the app\ndiagnostics and app advisor consoles.\n\n266\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.606\nSo I have them loaded up here.\n\n267\n00:12:29.606 --> 00:12:33.181\nWhat I did, because there are no alerts\nright now that I can click on and\n\n268\n00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:35.302\nthen actually launch the consoles from,\n\n269\n00:12:35.302 --> 00:12:38.231\nI just went directly to them\nby using the named instance.\n\n270\n00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:40.424\nSo we could do that, it's not a big deal.\n\n271\n00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:45.446\nAll we do is put in the name of\nthe machine that this is running on,\n\n272\n00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:47.402\nso mine is plabsis01.\n\n273\n00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:50.922\nAnd then for the app diagnostics\nconsole type in app diagnostics, for\n\n274\n00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:55.010\napp advisor app advisor, and I can\nactually load the web console directly.\n\n275\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.960\nBut normally, what's done is when you're\ngoing in and you're looking at work\n\n276\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.930\nwith these errors, so we have alerts,\nyou'll have an alert generator.\n\n277\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.110\nYou'll click on the alert.\n\n278\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.210\nThere's a link in the alert to let you\nlaunch these consoles directly and\n\n279\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.850\njust open them up.\n\n280\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.700\nSo you don't even have to know\nthe path and/or the URL for it.\n\n281\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.650\nBut if you wanna open them the way I\ndid because there are no alerts, but\n\n282\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.930\nyou just wanna see them,\n\n283\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.130\nthen you could put in the machine\nname forward slash name of console.\n\n284\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.840\nAnd then you'll be able to\nbring these two consoles up.\n\n285\n00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.010\nSo, I've done that for you.\n\n286\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.530\nRemember, you just have to\nhave that Silverlight set up.\n\n287\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.630\nInstall that, configure it.\n\n288\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.440\nIf you do it the first time and\nyou don't have it, it prompts you.\n\n289\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.235\nAnd I've shown you that\nin a prior episode.\n\n290\n00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:29.575\nRun the setup file, refresh the page,\nthey come up with no trouble.\n\n291\n00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:33.625\nSo this is the one I was showing you some\nscreen captures of off the web page.\n\n292\n00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.205\nThe app diagnostics console.\n\n293\n00:13:35.205 --> 00:13:36.525\nWe have no errors in here right now.\n\n294\n00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:37.270\nThere's nothing to show you.\n\n295\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.869\nBut if we did, we could start grouping\nthose alerts and those errors so\n\n296\n00:13:40.869 --> 00:13:43.251\nwe can then start\ninteracting with that data.\n\n297\n00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:46.218\nIn the app advisor area,\nI'd be able to go in, and\n\n298\n00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:48.491\nyou could see the different kinds of.\n\n299\n00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:51.070\nCan we just go full screen, just so\nyou can see our options there.\n\n300\n00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.500\nYou could see application\nfailure analysis,\n\n301\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.920\nperformance analysis,\nthese are different reports that exist.\n\n302\n00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.922\nApp status, problem distribution analysis,\nsummary analysis.\n\n303\n00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:05.737\nYou will be able to start pulling data in\nonce we've generated enough monitor time.\n\n304\n00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:08.233\nAnd if we have any errors,\nalerts as well, and\n\n305\n00:14:08.233 --> 00:14:12.209\nthen we would be able to start pulling\nthe data on these and do the reports.\n\n306\n00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:14.111\nSo we'd then actually get this.\n\n307\n00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:16.578\nIt would look something similar\nto what these pages look like,\n\n308\n00:14:16.578 --> 00:14:18.495\nthose little screen\ncaptures of those reports.\n\n309\n00:14:18.495 --> 00:14:21.257\nBut it would be with your data and\nit would have your distribution for\n\n310\n00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:22.041\nyour app in there.\n\n311\n00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:25.620\nAnd you'd be able to pull one or more\nof these up and see what it looks like.\n\n312\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.780\nSo if you're curious about one of them,\nyou click through there.\n\n313\n00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.520\nIt's gonna load, so just give it a second.\n\n314\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.750\nAnd it will go through, and\nwe're not gonna get anything, right?\n\n315\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.220\nIf we had real data there,\nit would actually bring the report up.\n\n316\n00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.290\nBut it would generate that framework and\nthat page and then actually populate.\n\n317\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.840\nI don't have any data in here.\n\n318\n00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.920\nSo I'm not gonna be able to actually\ngenerate anything of any interest,\n\n319\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.610\nbut you'll see I can go in,\nand these categories here.\n\n320\n00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.420\nI can go in under client side monitoring,\nand I can look at use analysis,\n\n321\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.690\nthings like this.\n\n322\n00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.740\nI can go in and I can, just one second.\n\n323\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.690\nI can go in, pull that report and\nsay, hey, can you go ahead and for\n\n324\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.450\nthis timeframe, can I go ahead,\nand can I get that?\n\n325\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.290\nAnd if I had any information,\nit would generate for me.\n\n326\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.606\nYou could see I've got probably 40 or\nso different options in here for\n\n327\n00:15:16.606 --> 00:15:20.491\ndifferent reports that could be used from\nthe app advisor side to give me guidance.\n\n328\n00:15:20.491 --> 00:15:24.544\nAnd help me to better understand\nwhat the root of problems are,\n\n329\n00:15:24.544 --> 00:15:26.232\nthe root of concerns are.\n\n330\n00:15:26.232 --> 00:15:27.530\nAnd then we can start drilling in.\n\n331\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.830\nAnd again, the app dev teams would\nprobably wanna be seeing this data,\n\n332\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.195\nas well as the IT admin teams\nthat are monitoring and\n\n333\n00:15:33.195 --> 00:15:36.605\nmaintaining this infrastructure,\nto allow them to benefit from this and\n\n334\n00:15:36.605 --> 00:15:38.095\nactually see what's going on.\n\n335\n00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:43.250\nSo, these are the consoles that we're\ntalking about as we begin to monitor and\n\n336\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.839\nactually start to go in and set this up.\n\n337\n00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.302\n&gt;&gt; Now if we had some sort of\ndata retention policy, and\n\n338\n00:15:49.302 --> 00:15:53.948\nwe wanted to maintain this information\nlonger than just a few months,\n\n339\n00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:59.089\nI think you had mentioned earlier when\nwe were looking at the network design.\n\n340\n00:15:59.089 --> 00:16:02.690\nAnd you said that there could\nbe in a separate agent for\n\n341\n00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.020\nthat historical data or the logs.\n\n342\n00:16:06.343 --> 00:16:07.063\nNo?\n\n343\n00:16:07.063 --> 00:16:09.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n344\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.110\n&gt;&gt; Adam's looking at me like, what?\n\n345\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.980\nThe 400 days.\n\n346\n00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.675\n&gt;&gt; That was data retention rate,\nnot a separate agent.\n\n347\n00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:18.280\nSo I wasn't sure what you were talking\nabout, cuz we're not using this,\n\n348\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.700\nit's not an agent thing.\n\n349\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.010\nYeah, so\nwe do have separate retention policies,\n\n350\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.180\nin terms of the amount of time we\nkeep data in the different databases.\n\n351\n00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.658\nThat's, I assume-\n&gt;&gt; In the database center, okay.\n\n352\n00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:28.593\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I think what\nyou're trying to talk about.\n\n353\n00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:29.950\nSo that's what it is, right.\n\n354\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.320\nSo just to be clear, so we all understand\nwhat Cherokee is asking about.\n\n355\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.040\nSo absolutely, she's absolutely right.\n\n356\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.470\nWe do have to have different\nretention periods.\n\n357\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.370\nWe do have, by default it's 400 days\non the data warehouse database.\n\n358\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.550\nSo 13 months, give or take.\n\n359\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.100\nAnd we do have, as you saw,\n\n360\n00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.040\nI think I showed you,\nas we did the initial walk-through.\n\n361\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.790\nI think I want to say episode one,\nand hey, let's look at SCOM and\n\n362\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.520\nreally go in deep and wide there.\n\n363\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.885\nWe looked at all the settings, remember,\nin the administration workspace\n\n364\n00:16:54.885 --> 00:16:59.285\nwent into the settings area, and at the\nbottom there, we saw database retention.\n\n365\n00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:02.375\nWe went and we took a look, and\nthere were retention periods for that.\n\n366\n00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:05.555\nAnd then those were like seven days\nby default, for the most part.\n\n367\n00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.285\nThat was on the ops manager database.\n\n368\n00:17:07.285 --> 00:17:08.945\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Not the data warehouse database,\n\n369\n00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:09.765\ntwo different databases.\n\n370\n00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:11.645\nSo we could modify those settings.\n\n371\n00:17:11.645 --> 00:17:12.445\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly, if that's what\n\n372\n00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:15.855\nyou're asking, and keep data for a longer\nperiod of time just by going in and\n\n373\n00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:18.890\nediting either in the graphical\ninterface or through PowerShell.\n\n374\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:19.780\nWe could do it either way.\n\n375\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.420\nSo absolutely, if that's what you were\nasking about, we could definitely do that.\n\n376\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; No doubt about it.\n\n377\n00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.330\nAll right, so, let's go back in.\n\n378\n00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.140\nLet us take a look at how to actually\ncreate one of these really cool and\n\n379\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.860\nawesome monitors using our .NET\napplication performance monitor template.\n\n380\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.990\nSo, what we're gonna do is just\nclick here, gonna right click.\n\n381\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.890\nGonna do add monitor wizard.\n\n382\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.830\nNot very difficult to do.\n\n383\n00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.170\nWe're gonna choose our\nframework template there.\n\n384\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:43.840\nCould we go full screen?\n\n385\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.340\nYou're gonna want to see this, and\nif I have to slide all the way over,\n\n386\n00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.880\nyou're not going to be\nable to see everything.\n\n387\n00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.690\nSo let's just go through,\nwe'll run through this real quick,\n\n388\n00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:50.990\ntalk about what's in here.\n\n389\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.400\nLet's give it a name,\nlet's call this one ITProTV.\n\n390\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.270\nWe'll call it Cherokee app.\n\n391\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.640\nOne, two three, okay.\n\n392\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.140\nSo that way we can keep track of that.\n\n393\n00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.210\nWe have to choose our management pack, now\nagain remember when we create a new one\n\n394\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.210\nyou saw me do that in the last\nepisode walkthroughs.\n\n395\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.730\nWe can also use our\ndefault management pack or\n\n396\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.110\nany of the management packs that are\nunsealed, so we'll just choose this one.\n\n397\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.015\nWe'll just bind it to the default\nmanagement pack no big deal.\n\n398\n00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.520\nWe'' then go ahead click next.\n\n399\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.652\nNow this is where it gets interesting,\n\n400\n00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:25.700\nthis is where we have to add in the\napplication components that we wanna use.\n\n401\n00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.580\nSo we're gonna go ahead gonna add that.\n\n402\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.020\nNow we're looking for,\nas you could see web apps and\n\n403\n00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.470\nservices here, I could also look for\nWindows services.\n\n404\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.660\nSo I could do a search here.\n\n405\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.420\nNow it says when I look for\nWindow services, before I select one I\n\n406\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.300\nhave to add monitoring for the service\nby using the Windows services template.\n\n407\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.650\nThat would be down here,\nyou see down here I have Windows service.\n\n408\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.590\nI have to have\nthe Windows Service template.\n\n409\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.810\nI have to have created a Windows Service\nalready specced out with the template, and\n\n410\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.190\ndeclare that, for\nme to then pull it in here.\n\n411\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.150\nI haven't done that.\n\n412\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.380\nI'm not gonna do that now.\n\n413\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.160\nIt's a whole separate conversation.\n\n414\n00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.300\nBut we did talk about on the setup here,\nthat this kind of monitoring, the .NET\n\n415\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.900\napplication performance monitoring, the\nAPM, allows us to do not just .NET Web,\n\n416\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.390\nbut also Windows Service monitoring of\nWindows service applications on the stack.\n\n417\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.860\nSo if we choose to do that,\nwe can definitely bring those in.\n\n418\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.710\nBut we're gonna have to go declare\na Windows service down there on the left.\n\n419\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.030\nActually create the template service there\nand then bring it in and capture it so.\n\n420\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.160\nWe're not setup to do that.\n\n421\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.270\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n422\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.580\nJust wanted to show you that\nwe do have that option.\n\n423\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.200\nWe're going to choose web apps and\nservices, we'll do a search.\n\n424\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.560\nNow the only one I have is\nthe one I'm already monitoring,\n\n425\n00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.210\nthe Orchestrator web service,\nand that's fine.\n\n426\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.330\nIn the real world you would see\nall the web services you have and\n\n427\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.425\nthe web apps here.\n\n428\n00:19:38.425 --> 00:19:40.245\nYou would be running\nwebsites most likely and\n\n429\n00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:44.005\nyou would be wanting to load up that\nwebsite and pull in that application.\n\n430\n00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:48.705\nWe're just gonna use this as a proxy for\nnow, just to walk you through the process.\n\n431\n00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:51.645\nNow, I've talked about this in some\nother episodes, this little gotcha.\n\n432\n00:19:51.645 --> 00:19:53.125\nNotice, no OK button here.\n\n433\n00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.055\nIt's grayed out.\n\n434\n00:19:54.055 --> 00:19:56.555\nPeople do this and\nthey're like what's wrong?\n\n435\n00:19:56.555 --> 00:19:57.775\nI'm not getting an OK.\n\n436\n00:19:57.775 --> 00:20:01.760\nWell, you've selected, but you haven't\nadded the selection down into the lower\n\n437\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.020\nthird here where you actually have to go\nfrom Available items to Selected items.\n\n438\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.260\nSo we're gonna do that, click OK.\n\n439\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.130\nHooray for UI, user interface design.\n\n440\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.050\nWe do wanna spec out an environmental\ntag here monitoring the scope.\n\n441\n00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.690\nThis is gonna allow us to be able to\nthen become part of the display name.\n\n442\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.720\nThis is really just metadata.\n\n443\n00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.970\nThis could be anything we want it to be,\n\n444\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.620\nyou can see we can create a new\ntag there if we choose to.\n\n445\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.490\nThis is really just, hey am I monitoring\nthis for production, for staging,\n\n446\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.000\nfor tests?\n\n447\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.170\nWe could make up our own, this is\nnothing more than a descriptive item.\n\n448\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.100\nSo if you leave it blank, no big deal.\n\n449\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.110\nI think I put my other one into staging or\nsomething, so\n\n450\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.580\nwe'll put this one into development.\n\n451\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.760\nMaybe we're setting this up, this is gonna\nbe an app we want to start monitoring for\n\n452\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.090\ndevelopment purposes but we're not gonna\nuse until we actually deploy it later.\n\n453\n00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.380\nWhatever the case is you figure that out.\n\n454\n00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.570\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click next.\n\n455\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.100\nNow this is where it gets interesting,\n\n456\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.640\nbecause this is where we start to zero\nin if we really wanted some advanced\n\n457\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.270\nmonitoring on all of\nthe advanced settings.\n\n458\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.700\nSo this is just basic stuff.\n\n459\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.360\nTurn on alerts, Turn on exception\nevent alerts, threshold is by the way,\n\n460\n00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.570\nnote in milliseconds.\n\n461\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.290\nA little hard to see.\n\n462\n00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.395\nSo that means we're looking at\nevents every 15 seconds right now.\n\n463\n00:21:13.395 --> 00:21:14.610\n15,000.\n\n464\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.680\nYou gotta note that because people\nlook at that and go, that's crazy.\n\n465\n00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.300\nBut then it's in milliseconds, it's not,\nit's actually 15-second increments.\n\n466\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.990\nFour times a minute,\nthat's the standard monitor.\n\n467\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.730\nSo we want to make sure we go in,\nwe take a look.\n\n468\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.110\nAnd under the hood here\nwith advanced settings,\n\n469\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.030\nwe could set name spaces methods,\nexception tracking, critical exceptions,\n\n470\n00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.840\nspecify what we want to monitor.\n\n471\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.060\nAnd what the monitors are and\nthe thresholds for\n\n472\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.960\nthem down here at the bottom.\n\n473\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.770\nIn percentage, in minutes,\nwhatever the intervals are.\n\n474\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.220\nAnd we can add these in and\nwe can scroll down a little more there.\n\n475\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.340\nWe can go ahead and we can also specify\nwhat monitored servers are members of\n\n476\n00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.070\nthe group that we want\nto actually focus in on.\n\n477\n00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.940\nSo there's some very detailed capabilities\nwe can start to program in here.\n\n478\n00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.400\nSo we can go in and if we go to exception\ntracking we can say we're tracking,\n\n479\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.605\nwe're adding in, based on the exception\ntracking class or name space what it is.\n\n480\n00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:10.400\nException parameters are only collected\nfrom known name spaces and classes.\n\n481\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.000\nWe can add them in, and specify I\njust want it from this name space or\n\n482\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.590\nthis class.\n\n483\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.615\nMaybe Win32_operating system or\n\n484\n00:22:17.615 --> 00:22:21.220\nWin32_physical disk, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n485\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.160\nAnd we can then zero in on just that\nparticular class instead of objects and\n\n486\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.590\nmonitor just them.\n\n487\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.370\nThis gets a little technical because this\ngets into the object class model and\n\n488\n00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.530\nthe declared classes from\nMicrosoft either the CIM or WMI.\n\n489\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.020\nAnd a little bit beyond the conversation\nof what we are doing here, but\n\n490\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.360\nthe idea would be the same, we can\nuse those namespaces if we chose to.\n\n491\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.260\nSo we can add them in.\n\n492\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.370\nWe could also go in and\n\n493\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.130\nspecify critical exceptions notice\nhere exception handler list.\n\n494\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:53.190\nWe can add in an exception handler, and we\ncould specify the name of the APM service,\n\n495\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.470\nand it will list a,\nnot the name of the service rather,\n\n496\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.380\nthe name of this exception handler\nthat's listed by the MPM service.\n\n497\n00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.160\nSo actually can go out and\nsay I want that exception service.\n\n498\n00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.720\nI don't want that handler specifically,\nthat instance.\n\n499\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.250\nI want that brought in,\nand I wanna monitor that.\n\n500\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.100\nIf we do our own custom development,\nremember,\n\n501\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.820\nwe're talking about web apps here.\n\n502\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.550\nMost likely we've developed,\n\n503\n00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.730\nmeaning internally our app dev team\nhas probably developed a web app.\n\n504\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.950\nThat's what we're monitoring most likely.\n\n505\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.410\nThey've probably done all that custom\nwork including, they've created their own\n\n506\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.460\nexception handlers and\ntheir own class definitions and all that.\n\n507\n00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.110\nWe could leverage all that to be able\nto do more in-depth monitoring here.\n\n508\n00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.270\nSo we wanna be aware of that.\n\n509\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:33.280\nWe could set namespaces, set methods,\nall of that can be done.\n\n510\n00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.766\nOnce we're done there,\nwe can enable additional criteria for\n\n511\n00:23:37.766 --> 00:23:39.440\nserver-side and client-side monitoring.\n\n512\n00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.220\nLet's just check that off and\nwe'll quickly walk you through and\n\n513\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.260\nshow you this.\n\n514\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.166\nWe can go in under customized\nmonitoring for individual components.\n\n515\n00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:50.539\nCustomize, and again, we can go through,\nset that up not just for\n\n516\n00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:53.320\nthe one side we were looking at,\nbut set it up for each.\n\n517\n00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.911\nSpecific or specified methods\nin monitoring of thresholds for\n\n518\n00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:59.903\nthe server side as well as\nthe client side on the app.\n\n519\n00:23:59.903 --> 00:24:01.598\nRemember two parts of an app.\n\n520\n00:24:01.598 --> 00:24:04.071\nIt's running on the server,\nwe're connecting to it from a client.\n\n521\n00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:07.290\nWe can look at both sides,\nlet's set both sides up here.\n\n522\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.320\nSo we have some very in\ndepth capabilities here.\n\n523\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.639\nAnd then once we're done\nwith configuring that,\n\n524\n00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:15.351\nsetting up the client-side monitoring,\nas you can see.\n\n525\n00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:18.440\nWe do have our IP addresses here,\nthese are a loop back adapters for\n\n526\n00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.554\nour local connection.\n\n527\n00:24:19.554 --> 00:24:23.808\nWe would add in additional ones if\nnecessary cause we may not want to monitor\n\n528\n00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:25.080\njust on this box.\n\n529\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.840\nMaybe monitoring other traffic and\nthen once we've done all this,\n\n530\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.850\nenable client side.\n\n531\n00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.289\nWe would then have to make sure\nwe set it up and enable it.\n\n532\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.980\nWe use JavaScript to automatically\nmonitor the segment.\n\n533\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.966\nSo we would turn those on and enable those\nhere, specify all this, and hit next, and\n\n534\n00:24:39.966 --> 00:24:40.877\nthen we're done.\n\n535\n00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:42.470\nThis thing will instantiate.\n\n536\n00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.660\nI'm not going to bother to build it,\nbecause we've seen one built.\n\n537\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.480\nIt takes a couple minutes, so\nit does take a few minutes to do.\n\n538\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.940\nBut once we do this, set it up,\n\n539\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.170\nif we have one called Cherokee app or\nwhatever we were doing there.\n\n540\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.410\nAs I told you, we would go into the\nmonitoring area, and we would actually see\n\n541\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.910\nour folder set up here will look just\nlike this under .NET monitoring.\n\n542\n00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.550\nAnd then we would be able\nto run this monitor and\n\n543\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.370\ninteract with it right from here.\n\n544\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.010\nAnd so once we've set all this up and\nwe are actually then able to go in and use\n\n545\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.140\nthis, we're able to start pulling data in,\ntracking it over time, reporting on it,\n\n546\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.870\ndoing all sorts of stuff using the app,\ndiagnostic app, advisor consoles.\n\n547\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.550\nWe also can use something\ncalled intellitrace.\n\n548\n00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:26.130\nWe collect trace debug logs from\napplications linking them back to\n\n549\n00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.650\nteam foundation server.\n\n550\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.860\nSo we can view in-depth monitoring here.\n\n551\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.490\nUse that monitoring, throw that back over\nto TFS, if you're familiar with TFS,\n\n552\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.120\nthat's our workflow and code\nmanagement product with Visual Studio.\n\n553\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.570\nAnd our app dev team can\nactually have work items and\n\n554\n00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.340\ntickets actually opened up directly\nfrom the monitoring taking place here.\n\n555\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.540\nSo if we have a problem in the stack,\n\n556\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.610\nwe can actually throw it over\nthe wall back over to TFS.\n\n557\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.760\nHave TFS automatically setup\nthe tickets and the incidents for us.\n\n558\n00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.476\nAnd then they can actually\nstart working on these items.\n\n559\n00:25:57.476 --> 00:25:59.768\nBecause we've detected\nthem in real time and\n\n560\n00:25:59.768 --> 00:26:03.230\nthey're able to then go in proactively and\nstart to work on this.\n\n561\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:08.320\nSo we have that workflow that's being set\nup, that allows for monitoring here and\n\n562\n00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.250\nthen remediation through another product\nlater on somewhere else in the stack.\n\n563\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.347\nSo we can set this up, we can actually\nhave log shipped out as part of this and\n\n564\n00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:20.525\nattached to the intellitrace information\ncan be shipped and attached TFS.\n\n565\n00:26:20.525 --> 00:26:23.732\nSo the app dev team can actually\nsee these logs in real time,\n\n566\n00:26:23.732 --> 00:26:25.860\nif they want to and interact with them.\n\n567\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.670\nI'll show you quickly what a website is\nthat gives us some information on this\n\n568\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.610\napp to .NET or\non the Microsoft tech net site.\n\n569\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.160\nSo we actually have how do we set up and\ndo this historical profiling and\n\n570\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.980\ncollecting.\n\n571\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.490\nSort of some guidance here on how\nto do what I was talking about.\n\n572\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.910\nWe could debug our code\nusing IntelliTrace.\n\n573\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.010\nSo we can actually go in and set this up.\n\n574\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.710\nStart the IntelliTrace collection,\nonce we configure it.\n\n575\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.820\nThen it will actually throw\nall that around for us, and\n\n576\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.785\nbring that back up, you never know\nwhat's gonna happen here, on IT Pro TV.\n\n577\n00:26:55.785 --> 00:26:56.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n578\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.780\nso we can go through take\na look at all that, obviously.\n\n579\n00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.690\nAnd also, we can integrate ops\nmanager with the development process.\n\n580\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.620\nAnd as I talked about, have it set up.\n\n581\n00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.840\nThis is just some of\nthe back end information.\n\n582\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.920\nWe would need to configure integration\nwith TFS back in the system center so\n\n583\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.720\nconnects, plumbing, and\npiping kind of work that we need.\n\n584\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.600\nThere's synchronization of alerts and\n\n585\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.280\nconfiguring the file attachments\nto send them over to TFS.\n\n586\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.050\nSo it sounds like we could just do\nthat no big deal, there is a bit of\n\n587\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.450\nplumbing under the hood that has to be\ndone to set all this up, but it's not hard\n\n588\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:29.320\nif you've got all the details on how to\nget all of this done sitting right here.\n\n589\n00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.660\nYou could go through and read up on this.\n\n590\n00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.870\nIf this is of interest to you,\nif you're running SCOM but\n\n591\n00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.470\nhave an active AB DEV environment where\nyou've got a team that is doing this.\n\n592\n00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.571\nYou want to be able to give them up to\ndate and real time feeds coming off\n\n593\n00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:42.790\nthe monitor and let them work against\nthis is the perfect way to do that.\n\n594\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.000\n&gt;&gt; Is that it?\nDo you have any other final thoughts?\n\n595\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.950\n&gt;&gt; All right so one more thing,\n\n596\n00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.610\nthere is actually something\nI want to cover real quick.\n\n597\n00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.410\nSo I mentioned this whole idea of okay,\nhey, let's do the template,\n\n598\n00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.370\nlet's create it, let's set it up.\n\n599\n00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.510\nWhat I didn't mention and\n\n600\n00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.130\nit is in the show notes, I want to make\nsure you just understand the logic of it\n\n601\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.390\nI have a cool little chart I want\nto show you to help us with this.\n\n602\n00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.880\nThe idea that once we create the template,\nit then gets pushed out\n\n603\n00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.470\nto all the agents that are going\nto be managing the monitoring for\n\n604\n00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.450\nus on these machines that we've targeted,\nright?\n\n605\n00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.773\nSo here we're going to take that template\nand we're going to push it out and\n\n606\n00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:12.740\ndistribute it.\n\n607\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.790\nAnd how do we know that happened?\n\n608\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.990\nHow do we successfully or\n\n609\n00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.240\nhow do we measure the successful\ndeployment of the APM template?\n\n610\n00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.020\nSo put together this little chart here for\n\n611\n00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.550\nyou, because you're going to\nget asked about this a lot.\n\n612\n00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.350\nHey, what are those\nevent source ID codes or\n\n613\n00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.680\nwhat do they actually mean I'm looking for\nevidence in the log?\n\n614\n00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.460\nThis happened, I don't know where it is.\n\n615\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.620\nCan't tell for sure, you know I'm waiting.\n\n616\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.580\nIt doesn't look like it's working,\nhow do I know, right?\n\n617\n00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.210\nSo I wanna just put together\na little chart here for you.\n\n618\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.070\nYou could see the event source,\nthe health service,\n\n619\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.780\nthe APM agent, .NET app monitoring.\n\n620\n00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.940\nYou can see as I scroll down a PM agent.\n\n621\n00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.070\nYou could see the event ID so\neach one is listed here,\n\n622\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.140\nand you can see this little\ndescription of what they are.\n\n623\n00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.500\nNew management pack with whatever the\nmanagement pack version name was received.\n\n624\n00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.670\nNew config became active, APM agent stop\nstarted, config processing has started.\n\n625\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.540\nWalks through the steps involved with\ngetting this deployed all the way out, and\n\n626\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.450\ntell you essentially how everything\nis working, so these eight or\n\n627\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.500\nnine steps as you track them through the\nevent IDs will tell you start to finish.\n\n628\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.040\nAnd once you've essentially gone ahead and\nsaid okay good,\n\n629\n00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.360\nI'm done, create boom, I'm finished.\n\n630\n00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.330\nAnd that agent deployment kicks\noff to push this template off,\n\n631\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.950\nto start monitoring of all\nthe machines you targeted.\n\n632\n00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.040\nThat is then actually\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n633\n00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.400\nAnd this is the step by step for that.\n\n634\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.760\nSo we've included this document for\nyou in the show notes.\n\n635\n00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Yay, presents.\n\n636\n00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.680\n&gt;&gt; So you can get a copy of it.\n\n637\n00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.350\nYay, presents.\n\n638\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.720\nSo you have it as a template\nyou can download and use.\n\n639\n00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.000\nEncourage you just to have it\nas a handy reference for you.\n\n640\n00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.170\nBut this will hopefully prove to be\nvaluable for you just in terms of letting\n\n641\n00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.140\nyou track this and\nunderstand the underlying mechanics.\n\n642\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.360\nThe architecture of how things\nare happening and when.\n\n643\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.290\n&gt;&gt; All right and sounds great.\n\n644\n00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.450\nSo, thank you so much Adam and thank you\nladies and gentlemen for tuning in but\n\n645\n00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.970\nstay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n646\n00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.547\nFor this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n647\n00:29:50.547 --> 00:29:52.645\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n648\n00:29:52.645 --> 00:29:53.365\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n649\n00:29:53.365 -->

00:00:08.208\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.876\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:15.135\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.255\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:20.935\nIn this episode, we will be demonstrating\nhow to configure notification accounts for\n\n8\n00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:24.605\nalerts and with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:26.714\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:27.390\n&gt;&gt; Hola.\n\n11\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.664\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little Spanish flair\n\n12\n00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:30.740\ncoming on today.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.062\nPerhaps it's my bright attire,\nI don't know.\n\n14\n00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.930\nI've been told it's lovely,\nbut I'm not sure if it is.\n\n15\n00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.388\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's called flamenco pink.\n\n16\n00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:39.300\n&gt;&gt; It could be, although,\nI don't know how to do the flamenco.\n\n17\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.366\nSo if that's the case, we're out of luck,\ncuz this is all you're gonna get.\n\n18\n00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.159\nWe are gonna talk about configuring\nnotification accounts for\n\n19\n00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.630\nsubscribing to alerts now.\n\n20\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.690\nWe've actually talked about this in other\nepisodes in our series and we've actually\n\n21\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.170\ndone a demonstration of how to set up\nsubscriptions and notification accounts.\n\n22\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.980\nWe're gonna run you back through it here\nas well in the context of how we do and\n\n23\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.040\nenable and set up application performance\nmonitoring cuz it is important to be able\n\n24\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.750\nto take the output of that monitoring.\n\n25\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.640\nAs we've been talking about some\nof our prior conversations and\n\n26\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.760\nbe able to create\nactionable items with it.\n\n27\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.480\nAnd be able to take those alerts and be\nmade aware of them, subscribe to them and\n\n28\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.520\nthen be notified that we\nmay need to do something.\n\n29\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.840\nIt's gonna be one of the ways in\nwhich we've consume that data.\n\n30\n00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.940\nSo, we're gonna start by taking a look at,\n\n31\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.480\nin the console our\nAdministration Workspace.\n\n32\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.006\nWe are down about half way to\nthree-quarters towards the bottom here,\n\n33\n00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.722\nwe're in the Run As configuration\narea as you can see.\n\n34\n00:01:30.722 --> 00:01:34.970\nWe're going to right click here, we're\ngoing to choose Create Run As Account.\n\n35\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.130\nBefore we do this just a quick\nword to remind you of this,\n\n36\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.710\nor tell you first time if you haven't\nseen any of the other conversations or\n\n37\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.070\nthe other episodes about this.\n\n38\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.515\nWe have a two step process, we're going\nto create Run As Accounts first, and\n\n39\n00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:49.174\nthen we're going to go back,\nlink that to a Run As profile.\n\n40\n00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:52.156\nSo that way those two things\ntogether can then be used and\n\n41\n00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:56.480\ndistributed to the Management Servers,\nthat we can then consume information.\n\n42\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.990\nSo, we're going to go through and\nsee how that takes place.\n\n43\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.120\nLet's start by creating\nour Run As Account.\n\n44\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.682\nGo ahead and we'll click here.\n\n45\n00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:06.130\nWe've got our wWizard,\ncreate our Run As Account, welcome screen.\n\n46\n00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.233\nAnd we'll just move this\nover just a little bit, so\n\n47\n00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.623\nyou guys can see how that happens here.\n\n48\n00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:15.947\nAnd we are able to stay away\nfrom our floating blue box, and\n\n49\n00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:18.690\nour box in box and boxes everywhere.\n\n50\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.796\nJust boxes, boxes, boxes.\n\n51\n00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:22.530\nSo, we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click next.\n\n52\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.530\nWe're gonna then choose what kind of\nRun As Account type we wanna use.\n\n53\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.210\nNow, we have different\nRun As Account types\n\n54\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.640\nare a whole bunch of them\nthere as you can see.\n\n55\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.450\nWe have Windows, we have Community String.\n\n56\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.650\nCommunity String is the equivalent of\n\n57\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.616\nSNMPv2 Simple Network Management Protocol\nv2.\n\n58\n00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:43.191\nThe Community String would be the shared\nsecret or password that is used to be\n\n59\n00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:47.670\nable to access the configuration\nof the devices through SNMP.\n\n60\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.520\nWe have basic authentication,\nsimple authentication,\n\n61\n00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.030\ndigest authentication, different options\nyou hopefully are familiar with.\n\n62\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.193\nWe have binary authentication, user choice\nin other words binary authentication means\n\n63\n00:02:58.193 --> 00:03:01.644\nuser subscribes and defines what\nthe authentication mechanism will be.\n\n64\n00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:04.296\nWe have the action account,\nwe've talked about accounts and\n\n65\n00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:06.803\naction accounts throughout\nmany of our episodes to date.\n\n66\n00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:09.902\nThese are the accounts that are setup and\nused as we configure\n\n67\n00:03:09.902 --> 00:03:13.225\nSystem Center Ops Manager,\nto be able to do a variety of things.\n\n68\n00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:17.461\nWe'd use one of those and or\nSNMP v3, our version three account,\n\n69\n00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:21.031\noffer SNMP is just a newer\nversion of the SNMP protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:22.813\nAnd we would use a different approach or\n\n71\n00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:25.035\nmechanism to authenticate\nif that was the case.\n\n72\n00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.915\nSo, we're gonna choose Windows\nhere because we are using\n\n73\n00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:30.265\nWindows infrastructure,\nwe've got to give this a name.\n\n74\n00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:36.065\nWe'll go ahead, we'll name our account,\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna call it\n\n75\n00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:44.022\na Testapp ITProTV User,\n\n76\n00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:49.560\nthink I got that right, close enough for\ngovernment work anyway.\n\n77\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.336\nSo Testapp ITProTv User,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll click Next there.\n\n78\n00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:59.340\nWe have to specify our actual username and\nour password, so\n\n79\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.561\nwe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll use the Test User Account.\n\n80\n00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:10.050\nNow in the real world, you would just,\nwhile I'm typing in the password.\n\n81\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.040\nYou would provide an actual user account\nthat exists in the domain here, right?\n\n82\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.500\nWe're just using a sample account.\n\n83\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.690\nWe're not using necessarily\nan actual account that would exist.\n\n84\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.020\nIn your domain, we are just making it\nclear that you would have to substitute in\n\n85\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.330\nan actual account value\nhere that makes sense.\n\n86\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.250\nThe account that you\nare going to be decide,\n\n87\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.840\nis going to be assigned to\nthis monitoring function.\n\n88\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.678\nWe've got our domain here,\npracticelabs.com, we'll click Next.\n\n89\n00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:40.502\nWe then have to specify how we're going to\nselect our distribution security option.\n\n90\n00:04:40.502 --> 00:04:43.031\nIf we do less secure,\nwhich is not the default choice, but\n\n91\n00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:45.314\nthe one that is above\nthe default choice right here.\n\n92\n00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:48.889\nWe will then have this credential\nautomatically distributed to all\n\n93\n00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.023\nmanaged computers.\n\n94\n00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:54.257\nIn other words, System Center Ops Manager\nwill distribute for us, this credential,\n\n95\n00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:58.143\nset it up on all the systems that we want\nto do the monitoring on, so we don't have\n\n96\n00:04:58.143 --> 00:05:02.490\nto worry about doing that, which is more\nsecure, default choice at the bottom.\n\n97\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.614\nWe have to manually decide in\nthe next process step as we go and\n\n98\n00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:09.130\nconfigure the Run As Profile, and\nlink the account to the profile.\n\n99\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.580\nWe will then have to decide which\nmachines on the tab that we get will\n\n100\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.189\nactually be specified, we'll have\nto go and manually click that and\n\n101\n00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.625\nput in the servers that we actually then\nwant to have this account setup for.\n\n102\n00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.925\nSo, we have an option here,\nit's up to us to decide.\n\n103\n00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:29.495\nMore secure involves us\ninteracting with the process and\n\n104\n00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:35.130\nspecifying a pick list of targeted\nsystems, less secure distributed to all\n\n105\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.820\nof the monitor managed computers\nthat are currently in and\n\n106\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.000\nare set up as part of our\nmanagement infrastructure.\n\n107\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.330\nSo we're gonna decide how to do that,\nI'm gonna choose more secure just so\n\n108\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.850\nyou can see what that looks like\nwhen we have to go back and\n\n109\n00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.220\nprogram in that list but we could\nchange it at any point while we go so\n\n110\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.750\nwe'll leave it at more secure,\nwe'll click Create.\n\n111\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.330\nIt says hey, by the way,\nyou went ahead and\n\n112\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.490\ndid this, you now have to set up\nthe Run As Account with the profile.\n\n113\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.110\nWarning, you're gonna\nhave to configure it.\n\n114\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.820\nThat's not the screen I was talking about.\n\n115\n00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.820\nWe're gonna see another screen at the end\nof the Run As Profile Wizard here\n\n116\n00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.920\nin just a minute, and that's\nthe screen where we make the choice.\n\n117\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.450\nSo, just telling you what this looks like\nand making sure you're familiar with this.\n\n118\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.700\nSo let's do this, we'll then go in here,\nwe'll go to our profiles area, and\n\n119\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.380\nwe could see before we do this.\n\n120\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.330\nWe have our accounts here and\nwe have our Testapp ITPROTV User Account.\n\n121\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.650\nYou could see it right down there.\n\n122\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.190\nSo, we've just created that account.\n\n123\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.340\nThat is our Run As Account.\n\n124\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.430\nThat's the one that we have set up.\n\n125\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.112\nAnd now what we're gonna do, is were gonna\nassociate it with our Run As Profile.\n\n126\n00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:39.120\nWe're gonna go in create\na profile in step two here, and\n\n127\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.640\nwe're going to then\nassociate this account.\n\n128\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.820\nSo we're going to go into Run As,\nrather we are going to go into our\n\n129\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.710\nRun As area, and\nwe're going to create our Run As profile.\n\n130\n00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.860\nI'm thinking about what we're doing and\n\n131\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.270\nsounds good in my head until I start\nsaying it then it comes out all backwards.\n\n132\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.951\nAll right, so, Run As Configuration,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:01.088\ncreate our Run As Profile.\n\n134\n00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:04.438\nLet's go ahead and do that real quick,\nso let's grab this.\n\n135\n00:07:04.438 --> 00:07:09.390\nLet me just hide the taskbar here, because\nthis is one of those wizards that comes up\n\n136\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.180\nyou can't actually see the bottom\nlower little bit of the screen there.\n\n137\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.380\nUnless we do that we'll just\nbump that up just a bit\n\n138\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.694\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling?\n\n139\n00:07:17.694 --> 00:07:20.028\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling, yes.\n\n140\n00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:22.668\nI did not realize that you\nspoke Yiddish there, Cherokee.\n\n141\n00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:26.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just full of surprises.\n\n142\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.450\nI would continue talking in Yiddish, but\n\n143\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.510\nI'm feeling that's probably\nas far as we're going to get.\n\n144\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n145\n00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:32.128\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking we'll just give you credit\n\n146\n00:07:32.128 --> 00:07:35.420\nfor that one, say that was a good job\n&gt;&gt; And then- Leave it at that.\n\n147\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.442\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move on.\n\n148\n00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:39.058\nAll right, so, let's do the following.\n\n149\n00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.530\nNow actually, before I do this,\nlet me show you one quick thing here.\n\n150\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.100\nI meant to show you this and I did forget.\n\n151\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.870\nSo, we'll do the profile\nhere in just a sec.\n\n152\n00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.710\nLet me show you something.\n\n153\n00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.380\nSo, with the account, if I go over here\nto the account, I can right click.\n\n154\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.070\nLet me just go in and\nshow you what I was talking about here.\n\n155\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.790\nWe can go, once we do have the account,\nactually it was good right there,\n\n156\n00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.160\nonce we do have the account set up,\nwhen we go to the Distribution tab.\n\n157\n00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.450\nAnd as I said, we could change this\nsetting that we were talking about now,\n\n158\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.430\nright, by doing Add and\nthen adding in the servers.\n\n159\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.762\nOr we could do it as I said,\nI'll just show you.\n\n160\n00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:12.506\nDo it as the Run As Profile Wizard\nwhen we're done.\n\n161\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:15.476\nThat link on the Run As Profile page\nwill take us right back here and\n\n162\n00:08:15.476 --> 00:08:17.920\nwe'll change it,\nit's a matter of how we get there.\n\n163\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.126\nBut we could do it right from here, if we\nwanted to add through the distribution\n\n164\n00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:26.074\narea and we want to search by computer,\nwe actually can go in and do this and\n\n165\n00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:28.202\nwe'd be able to put this in right here.\n\n166\n00:08:28.202 --> 00:08:31.341\nWe would just search by computer,\ndo a search,\n\n167\n00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:36.190\nwe would get our Management Server and\nwe can put that in if we want to.\n\n168\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.962\nI'll show you how to do\nthat off the other screen.\n\n169\n00:08:37.962 --> 00:08:40.720\nBut we're gonna wind up in the same place,\nokay?\n\n170\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.256\nSo we're to go ahead,\nwe're to create our profile.\n\n171\n00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:46.270\nLet's go up to Run As Configuration,\nright-click.\n\n172\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.978\nRun As Profile back to where we were\njust a minute ago and click Next, here.\n\n173\n00:08:49.978 --> 00:08:52.130\nWe have to go ahead and\ngive the profile a name.\n\n174\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.870\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do this.\n\n175\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.260\nLet me, what are we going to call this?\n\n176\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.315\nWe're going to go ahead and we are going\nto call this, just one second.\n\n177\n00:09:02.315 --> 00:09:04.260\nI have it written down, I promise I did.\n\n178\n00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.988\nI just forgot to go down to the area\nwhere I see it so I can see.\n\n179\n00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:10.290\nNow we're going to call it\nTest Notification Account, okay, so.\n\n180\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.883\nAll right, let's do Test Notifi-,\nI run about this in some episodes but\n\n181\n00:09:14.883 --> 00:09:18.675\nthe screen I'm using you guys\ncan't see what I'm working.\n\n182\n00:09:18.675 --> 00:09:20.568\n[LAUGH] It just looks normal to you,\n\n183\n00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:24.700\nbut the screen dims likes by 50% if\nyou don't keep using it constantly.\n\n184\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.444\nAnd then it will run and\nbe brighten backed up again.\n\n185\n00:09:26.444 --> 00:09:29.390\nSo half the time I'm typing,\nyou see me doing this squinting,\n\n186\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.840\nbecause the screen is so\ndark I can't see what I'm actually doing.\n\n187\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.966\n[LAUGH] All right, so Notification.\n\n188\n00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:37.802\nAccounts, so it's Test Notification.\n\n189\n00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:41.840\nThen we will select, our Management Pack\nthat we are going to be using.\n\n190\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.138\nI will put this in here, and we'll put\nthis on to our Default Management Pack.\n\n191\n00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:50.080\nRemember it is important, I've talked\nabout the Run As Profile will be do that.\n\n192\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.119\nBut, it is important to\nbe able to link this\n\n193\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.540\nto our Management Pack because\nremember the Run As Profile and\n\n194\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.350\nthe Run As Account link together are gonna\nbe leveraging information that we need.\n\n195\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.880\nAnd also objects from\nthe Management Pack and so\n\n196\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.030\nwe have to make sure that we are linking\nthem so that they can do that.\n\n197\n00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.742\nWe're gonna be using our Management Packs,\nthe Default Management Packs, as we did\n\n198\n00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:17.062\nwith our APM monitor when we set it up,\nwe did our .NET application template,\n\n199\n00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:20.960\nwe link it to Management Pack, so\nwe're gonna do our Run As Account.\n\n200\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.750\nSo, we're bringing\nthe Run As Account here.\n\n201\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.480\nGonna go ahead, we're gonna click here.\n\n202\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.010\nNow, remember we already\nhave our Run As Account\n\n203\n00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.580\ncreated down at the bottom\nof the list here,\n\n204\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.580\nwe would choose, you would choose when you\ndo this, whatever account you've created.\n\n205\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.253\nI'm choosing my\nTestapp IT Pro TV User Account, but\n\n206\n00:10:35.253 --> 00:10:39.344\nnotice I could create a brand new account\nhere if I wanted to as well, on the fly.\n\n207\n00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:44.070\nDo we wanna then allow the account to be\nable to manage all objects wherever they\n\n208\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.366\nmay be or do we want to use a certain\nselected class or subset of objects,\n\n209\n00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:49.790\nup to us to decide.\n\n210\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.498\nBy default all objects makes sense,\nbecause on the account and the profile can\n\n211\n00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:56.940\nbe used to manage and interact with\nany object and alerts from anywhere.\n\n212\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.322\nBut you may want to trim or\nsomehow modify that through a filter and\n\n213\n00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:04.760\nscope it to a more narrowly\ndefined set of objects.\n\n214\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.130\nThat will be up to you.\n\n215\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.297\nIf you choose to do that,\nyou would select here, you would go in,\n\n216\n00:11:09.297 --> 00:11:12.364\nyou would choose Class, Object or\nGroup, whatever it may be.\n\n217\n00:11:12.364 --> 00:11:16.242\nAnd then based on that,\nyou have a search window that opens up.\n\n218\n00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:20.151\nYou can then, from this pick list,\nonce it's populated, choose any object.\n\n219\n00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:21.847\nYou could see there's\na list of them there.\n\n220\n00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:25.612\nAnd then depending on what we chose,\nwe would then be able to say,\n\n221\n00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:29.370\nyou know I just want to put this\non to my Ops Manager Database.\n\n222\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.245\nI know that doesn't say Ops Manager it\nsays Temp DB, but you get the idea.\n\n223\n00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:35.643\nCuz I would have to find the Ops\nManager Database alphabetically, but\n\n224\n00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:38.535\nthe idea would be that it's in the list,\nI could choose it.\n\n225\n00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:41.830\nAnd then this would only be able to\ninteract with the Office Manager Database\n\n226\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.126\nas opposed to anything else.\n\n227\n00:11:43.126 --> 00:11:46.730\nSo, we have to decide what we wanna do and\nhow we wanna do that.\n\n228\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.725\nWe'll leave it at all target it objects,\n\n229\n00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:52.595\nmeaning anything within\nthe Default Management Pack, click OK.\n\n230\n00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:53.285\nWe now have that there.\n\n231\n00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:55.810\nWe'll click Create,\ngive that just a second.\n\n232\n00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.547\nThen we're going to see that\nscreen I was talking about,\n\n233\n00:11:58.547 --> 00:12:02.269\nwhere we have to go back and specify\nthe distribution for the Run As Accounts.\n\n234\n00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:05.002\nSo we can actually link to this\nto the appropriate servers and\n\n235\n00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:06.175\nhave them be monitored.\n\n236\n00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:07.655\nWe're going to see what\nI was talking about.\n\n237\n00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:11.872\nWe'll click on the link here, go back to\nthat Distribution Tab that I showed you.\n\n238\n00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:15.192\nAnd we'll either be able to program\nin the least in the more secure or\n\n239\n00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:18.816\nswitch to less secure just having\ndistributed for, is up to us to decide.\n\n240\n00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:21.630\nBut you'll see here there's a link,\nwe can click here.\n\n241\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.730\nWhen we do this that should\nlook familiar to you now.\n\n242\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.550\nYou could see we're actually going to be\non the same tab that I showed you by right\n\n243\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.290\nclicking on the Account and\nthen choosing Properties and\n\n244\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.830\ngoing in editing it directly.\n\n245\n00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.670\nSo, you can do it either way,\nit's up to you.\n\n246\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.800\nWe're gonna go ahead we're gonna click\nAdd like we did just a minute ago when I\n\n247\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.052\nshowed you this, we'll click Add twice cuz\nclicking once does not seem to be enough.\n\n248\n00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then we will go ahead,\n\n249\n00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:47.543\nwe'll select our servers I showed you,\nremember you always have to click Add\n\n250\n00:12:47.543 --> 00:12:51.120\nthere to make our selections that we\ncan drop it down get a OK button.\n\n251\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.523\nWe'll do that,\nit's now gonna show up there.\n\n252\n00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.135\nWe'll click OK here.\n\n253\n00:12:55.135 --> 00:12:57.567\nYou'll notice that that\nwarning sign has now gone,\n\n254\n00:12:57.567 --> 00:13:00.233\nwe no longer has the precaution flag and\nwe're in check.\n\n255\n00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:03.445\nSo now once we're done with that\njust move over so you can see.\n\n256\n00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:06.945\nWe'll click our Close\nbutton right there and\n\n257\n00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:11.340\nthen we will have our profile,\njust go in here so we can see that.\n\n258\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.826\nTakes just a second.\n\n259\n00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.050\nAnd then we'll have our profile here.\n\n260\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:23.740\nAnd we will sort, so we get that\nalphabetically, and we can go down.\n\n261\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.491\nAnd it will take a minute\ntypically to pop in.\n\n262\n00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:29.830\nSo you just have to wait for it.\n\n263\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.730\nWe've seen this happen in\nsome of the other demos,\n\n264\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.610\nwhere the console doesn't update or\nrefresh right away.\n\n265\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.680\nIt usually takes about a minute and if it\ndoesn't show up you can always refresh and\n\n266\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.390\nyou will see it there.\n\n267\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.810\nBut can set that up and\nonce we've got that all up and running,\n\n268\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.440\nand we do have that now.\n\n269\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.560\nWhat we then could do, if we wanted\nto would be then actually create\n\n270\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.970\na subscription that would allow us\nto be able to then consume them.\n\n271\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.420\nI just wanna show that to you that\npart of it, I just wanna show you,\n\n272\n00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.380\nwhat we would do there really quickly.\n\n273\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.662\nBut I'm getting the sense.\n\n274\n00:13:56.662 --> 00:14:01.519\nI'm using my extra special, lovely shirt,\nbright from flamenco color Spidey sense\n\n275\n00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:04.900\nthat the woman standing next to\nme may wanna ask a question.\n\n276\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.327\nCuz she's been jumping up and down, trying\nto get my attention for like five minutes.\n\n277\n00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:09.860\nSo, what?\nWhat did you wanna say, Cherokee?\n\n278\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.060\n&gt;&gt; I really didn't have a question,\nAdam but is it really, that's it?\n\n279\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.310\nI mean in order to obtain\nthose notifications,\n\n280\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.200\ndo we have any additional steps\nthat we need to run through?\n\n281\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.581\n&gt;&gt; Well, so,we are gonna take a look at\njust what we do with a subscription here,\n\n282\n00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:21.820\nso once we have our profile.\n\n283\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.090\nJust trying to refresh to see if we\nare going to get that to pop in.\n\n284\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.205\nAnd sometimes you have to actually\nwait for it and/or as I said,\n\n285\n00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:30.350\nyou may want to actually\nclose the console.\n\n286\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.450\nYou've seen me do that once or\ntwice as well and bring that back in.\n\n287\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.660\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll do that real quick.\n\n288\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.300\nSometimes the console does-\n&gt;&gt; Bring it back in.\n\n289\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you go ahead and you- oops.\n\n290\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.950\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n291\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.110\nCould have sworn I hit open\nthe console there, all right.\n\n292\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.424\nSo, it's random mouse\nday here at ITPro.TV.\n\n293\n00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:52.720\nSo yeah, sometimes closing and reopening\nthe console just allows us to get those\n\n294\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.200\nkind of things to show back up quickly.\n\n295\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.580\nWhen we are waiting on them they just\ndon't seem to behave the right way.\n\n296\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.560\nSo let's go back in there, and\nthen we should get our profile.\n\n297\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.933\nWhat did I call our profile?\n\n298\n00:15:05.933 --> 00:15:09.460\n[INAUDIBLE] Hold on through there.\n\n299\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.180\nIt is right there.\n\n300\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.700\nKey Test Notification, right?\n\n301\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.125\nCuz I couldn't spell it correctly cuz so\nI said.\n\n302\n00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I have to see what was\n\n303\n00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.770\ngoing on in there.\n\n304\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.580\nBut you could see now,\nit has popped in there,\n\n305\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.160\nyou could see it right down there and\nthat we see the profile is there.\n\n306\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.230\nSo, to Cherokees' question, hey, okay,\nso great, what do we do with that?\n\n307\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.960\nWe come up here in Notifications\nnow in the Workspace.\n\n308\n00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.600\nSo we're gonna go up just a little\nbit above where we were with Run As,\n\n309\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.430\nmove this down so you can see it\nover here on the left a little bit.\n\n310\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.112\nAnd then what we're going to do is\nwe're going to be able to come in here.\n\n311\n00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:43.140\nNow we have channels, we have\nsubscriptions and we have subscribers.\n\n312\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.820\nAnd what we do at that point is we\ncan go ahead and we've been through,\n\n313\n00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.940\nin other episodes, the entire thought\nprocess about channels, notifications or\n\n314\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.850\nexcuse me, under notifications,\nchannel subscribers add subscription.\n\n315\n00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.320\nI'm not gonna reproduce that entire\nthought process and all the demo steps.\n\n316\n00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.327\nAgain, it actually takes about another 15\nminutes to work through all the logic of\n\n317\n00:16:04.327 --> 00:16:06.142\neverything, bring it all together.\n\n318\n00:16:06.142 --> 00:16:10.369\nBut the short version of it is, we then\ncan go ahead and we can come in here and\n\n319\n00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.330\nyou'll see we have new channels.\n\n320\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.420\nAnd we can do this via e-mail,\nthrough SMTP,\n\n321\n00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.360\nwe could do this by Instant Messaging, IM.\n\n322\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.670\nWe can do text messaging,\nping ponging through SMS.\n\n323\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.000\nWe can do a command.\n\n324\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.494\nAnd so our ability to be able\nto subscribe through a channel,\n\n325\n00:16:26.494 --> 00:16:28.990\nis then going to be configured here.\n\n326\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.300\nThis is the format we will then be able\nto send and receive information across.\n\n327\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.850\nWe're then able to use subscribers,\nusers essentially, they're specified\n\n328\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.800\naccounts that will be used to get data,\nand then subscriptions setting up at\n\n329\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.720\nessentially saying hey, I wanna dedicate\na channel and I wanna receive information.\n\n330\n00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.250\nI wanna be notified about things,\nwhen alerts happen or changes are made,\n\n331\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.390\nwhatever, by using all the notification\narea information items here\n\n332\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.190\nlinking to the account of\nthe profile we're using.\n\n333\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.010\nWe can then actually get information and\n\n334\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.460\ntake that down and\nInteract with in a variety of ways.\n\n335\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.470\nWe did this other part in one\nof the other discussions and\n\n336\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.370\ndemos in other episodes and you could\nsee all of that brought together there.\n\n337\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.870\nThis part was really just as I'm\ngonna show you the Run As Account or\n\n338\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.370\nRun As Profiles, specifically.\n\n339\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:12.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you have it.\n\n340\n00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.380\nThat's how you go ahead and\nconfigure those notifications for alerts.\n\n341\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.860\nSo thank you so much,\nAdam, for joining us today.\n\n342\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.450\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\nfor joining as well, but stay tuned.\n\n343\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.380\nWe have more information headed your way.\n\n344\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.200\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n345\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.597\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n346\n00:17:26.597 --> 00:17:28.048\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n347\n00:17:28.048 -->

00:00:08.651\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:11.627\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.627 --> 00:00:15.385\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:17.375\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Booze.\n\n7\n00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:18.090\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.605\nwe'll be doing a demonstration to see how\nto use synthetic transaction monitoring.\n\n9\n00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.435\nAnd with us today, we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:26.825\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:32.050\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like the mime episode but\nnot quite, right?\n\n12\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.382\nHow do, hopefully everybody's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:35.626\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to jump in and\n\n14\n00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:37.480\ncontinue our hands on demonstrations.\n\n15\n00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.124\nWe're to take a look at,\nas Cherokee was just saying,\n\n16\n00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:43.470\nsynthetic transaction monitoring with or\nfor, against a website.\n\n17\n00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.411\nWe're gonna run through, use another\none of our monitoring pack templates,\n\n18\n00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:51.185\nto setup if you haven't seen the prior\nops that we did with .NET template.\n\n19\n00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.176\nThe .NET template for APM for\napplication performance monitoring,\n\n20\n00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:56.270\nencourage you to go and\ntake a look at that.\n\n21\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.980\nWe're gonna use that\nsame thought process but\n\n22\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.505\nuse the web application\navailability monitoring template.\n\n23\n00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:05.120\nRespin that up and we'll take a look\nat the difference between the local and\n\n24\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.360\npotentially outside-in\ntransaction monitoring or\n\n25\n00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.830\navailability of transaction monitoring.\n\n26\n00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.420\nSomething called global\nservice monitoring.\n\n27\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.720\nIt's kind of an interesting concept.\n\n28\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.892\nWe'll take a look at that as we go.\n\n29\n00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:18.710\nSo, if we can jump in here,\nwe'll do a quick little show and tell.\n\n30\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.550\nMore show than tell, hopefully.\n\n31\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.160\nBut I think that we'll probably\nhave a mixture of both.\n\n32\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.650\nSo we're gonna highlight our web\napplication availability monitoring\n\n33\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.230\ntemplate.\n\n34\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.004\nHere you can see it's selected, right\nclick what we've done, add monitoring\n\n35\n00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.980\nwizard, we're gonna go ahead and do that,\ngive us just a second to spin up.\n\n36\n00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.688\nWe'll make sure that we choose Web\nApplication Availability Monitoring here.\n\n37\n00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:43.172\nAnd you could see, we tailor our selection\nand of course then our script changes, and\n\n38\n00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:46.720\nwe have the appropriate areas on\nthe left that we're gonna fill in,\n\n39\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.110\nscreen by screen as we go.\n\n40\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.841\nWe'll click Next, we're then gonna\ngo ahead and give this a name,\n\n41\n00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:57.408\nwe'll call it WebApp Monitor,\ncall it anything you would like.\n\n42\n00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.760\nWe'll then go ahead,\nwe'll put in our management pack.\n\n43\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.148\nWe've talked about the importance for\n\n44\n00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:05.320\nassociated management\npack with our monitors.\n\n45\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.710\nSo we get all the objects.\n\n46\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.402\nWe have access to all the resources\nthe management pack provides.\n\n47\n00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:12.559\nWe're gonna name our website or\nURLs websites portal,\n\n48\n00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.724\nif there's more than one that\nwe would like to monitor.\n\n49\n00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:20.560\nYou'll see we just add\nthem in here in a list.\n\n50\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.840\nSo we'll just do, MSN.com.\n\n51\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.676\nLet's say that we also wanna do,\nwhoops, ITProTV.\n\n52\n00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:33.607\nSo, we'll put in http://www.itpro.tv,\n\n53\n00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:37.455\nand you would put in the list of URLs for\n\n54\n00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:43.440\nall the websites that you would\nlike to be able to monitor.\n\n55\n00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.105\nThis would be of course in the real world,\n\n56\n00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:49.780\nthe question of you figuring out what\nwebsites you wanna pay attention to and\n\n57\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.030\nwanna be able to draw the data down from,\nin order to understand the health and\n\n58\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.540\nthe performance of them which\nare the key things we're focusing on.\n\n59\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.560\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n60\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.010\nAnd by the way, I'd forgot to tell you.\n\n61\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.190\nI should just point out but you could do\nHTTP and or HTTPS, right just so you know.\n\n62\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.190\nEven though it doesn't say cuz\nit's an empty text screen,\n\n63\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.100\nwe're just filling it in.\n\n64\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.670\nBut you do actually have the ability\nto do HTTP or HTTPS monitoring.\n\n65\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.170\nSo I just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n66\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.822\nHere, under select the location from\nwhere you want URLs to be monitored.\n\n67\n00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:22.460\nSo, do you ever play the game,\nWhere in the World is Waldo?\n\n68\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.250\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know it was a game,\nbut I thought it was a book.\n\n69\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.708\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a book, it's a game.\n\n70\n00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess it is a game if\nyou're trying to race someone.\n\n71\n00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:30.314\n&gt;&gt; You have young ones?\n\n72\n00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:30.922\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:32.938\n&gt;&gt; You probably read the book,\nI'm assuming,\n\n74\n00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:36.640\nwith them, and/or perhaps occasionally,\nthere's old TV cartoon thing.\n\n75\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.068\nSo, the idea with Where's Waldo, right is,\nWaldo goes around like Dora the Explorer,\n\n76\n00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:42.619\nor I forget what her monkey is.\n\n77\n00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.531\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam?\n\n78\n00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:44.451\nCan we spot you in that shirt?\n\n79\n00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.779\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam?\n\n80\n00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:46.628\nYou could do that as well.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:47.590\n&gt;&gt; You could track me using this shirt.\n\n82\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.260\nIt would not be hard to find me\nif I was wearing this shirt.\n\n83\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260\nBut, you can think about the concept\nof Where's Waldo when we think about\n\n84\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.030\nlocation based URL tracking here,\nright, because we have two options.\n\n85\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.880\nWe can track and/or monitor\nthe website from an internal monitor,\n\n86\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.760\na monitoring agent that is\nsitting inside of our network.\n\n87\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.593\nIf this website is sitting in a DMZ,\nhosted in one of our web servers.\n\n88\n00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.474\nIn the DMZ, in our data center,\n\n89\n00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:19.148\nwe may wanna monitor it from inside the\nnetwork to look at aspects of performance\n\n90\n00:04:19.148 --> 00:04:23.335\nthat are specific to the communication\npathway inside of the network,\n\n91\n00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:27.820\nright behind the firewall or firewalls,\ndepending how where they are.\n\n92\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.840\nBut essentially in the LAN,\nright, for most part.\n\n93\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.313\nWe could also potentially,\nmonitor from the outside-in,\n\n94\n00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:38.010\nusing what is referred to,\non the screen probably see it.\n\n95\n00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.982\nBut it's little bit hard to see,\nit's small.\n\n96\n00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:43.255\nBut, a global service\nmonitor we call it GSM.\n\n97\n00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:46.813\nAnd a GSM is outside-in.\n\n98\n00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:51.160\nWe have what are called watcher nodes that\nare pre-positioned around the globe in\n\n99\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.350\nMicrosoft's Azure fabric,\nin their data centers.\n\n100\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.007\nAnd we can leverage those to\nactually then create monitoring or\n\n101\n00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:01.940\nwe can decide that we're gonna\nhave our own watcher nodes, right?\n\n102\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.880\nSo we may have a global enterprise\nwith infrastructure around the world.\n\n103\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.360\nAnd we may then wanna be able to\nutilize or specify, hey, these machines\n\n104\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.230\nsitting out there in Spain, this in\nLondon, this in Germany or wherever.\n\n105\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.982\nWe wanna use them to\nactually do the monitoring.\n\n106\n00:05:19.982 --> 00:05:23.868\nAnd so global service monitoring\nis outside-in monitoring,\n\n107\n00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:28.776\nthat allows us to monitor from outside of\nthe network and look at traffic flow and\n\n108\n00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:32.240\nlook at performance and\ninformation from the outside.\n\n109\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.970\nThis will be the perspective of the user\nconnecting into the web server.\n\n110\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.860\nAs oppose to inside, the server connecting\nwith the rest of our infrastructure.\n\n111\n00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.208\nWe most likely wanna be able to use and\ndo both.\n\n112\n00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.820\nBecause it's gonna be important for\n\n113\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.250\nus to have those perspectives,\nif regards to how we monitor, right?\n\n114\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.633\n&gt;&gt; So, those external entities,\nare they able to monitor our internal or\n\n115\n00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.028\nour private website?\n\n116\n00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:57.726\nSo we have to give them access or\nare they only monitoring public websites?\n\n117\n00:05:57.726 --> 00:05:59.022\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwell they're gonna monitor our website.\n\n118\n00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:02.557\nSo, remember if they are watcher nodes\nthat we control, they have monitoring\n\n119\n00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:06.370\nagents on them, they are part of our\nfabric, part of our infrastructure.\n\n120\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.440\nIf we are hooked up to Microsoft and\nusing Azure.\n\n121\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.870\nWe are using Azure\nfabric to do monitoring.\n\n122\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.900\nWe are using Microsoft's infrastructure.\n\n123\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.530\nBut again,\nwe are giving it the ability to be\n\n124\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.780\npart of our own infrastructure by\nextending and connecting to it.\n\n125\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.041\nSo, you're absolutely right to call\nthat out, because essentially yeah,\n\n126\n00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:26.366\nwe do need to have the system somehow\nidentified and integrated in our fabric.\n\n127\n00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:28.992\nWe didn't want monitoring\ndone by strangers like-\n\n128\n00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:29.712\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH]\n\n129\n00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:30.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, that wouldn't be good.\n\n130\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.330\nSo mommy always said stranger danger.\n\n131\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.164\nMake sure you pay attention to that,\nright.\n\n132\n00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.984\nSo if a strange monitoring\nservice comes up, and says,\n\n133\n00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:38.840\nhey we wanna offer you a deal.\n\n134\n00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.673\nRun away quickly, right.\n\n135\n00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:40.512\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't pay attention to them.\n\n136\n00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:42.284\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna do here, right,\n\n137\n00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:44.663\nwe're just gonna use our Add button,\nas you could see right here.\n\n138\n00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna click.\n\n139\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.650\nAnd we then have to decide what\nthe locations will be that we monitor\n\n140\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.500\nfrom the list that's available to us.\n\n141\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.310\nRight now, it's install or\nrather internal location, agent based.\n\n142\n00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.000\nWe're gonna, for purposes of the demo,\nuse internal agents.\n\n143\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.460\nBut we talked about the fact we could\nbroaden this out if we did go out and\n\n144\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.120\nclick on the link for\nGlobal Service Monitoring.\n\n145\n00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.350\nWe would actually be able to go find some\ninformation out here just really quickly\n\n146\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.080\nout on the Microsoft website\nabout the data center,\n\n147\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.410\nyour fabric, use or fabric and\neverything in the Cloud platform area.\n\n148\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:24.238\nYou could go out and do a little\nbit of search on global service.\n\n149\n00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:30.900\nOf course, you would have to spell\ncorrectly which is one of my biggest\n\n150\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.900\nproblems monitoring, right?\n\n151\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.980\nBut you can go out and do a search here,\nand you would then be able to get\n\n152\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.830\ninformation about\nthe Global Service Monitor from Technet.\n\n153\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.680\nI usually will show you this kind of\ninformation and we'll put it up and\n\n154\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.692\nyou can go in, Click here.\n\n155\n00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:53.124\nJust get a little information about the\nidea of this outside-in monitoring with\n\n156\n00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:54.761\nthe Global Service Monitor.\n\n157\n00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:55.929\nAnd you can read up on and\n\n158\n00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:59.567\nthen understand that different kinds\nof monitoring That are available.\n\n159\n00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:03.506\nWe are gonna be able to do two monitor\ntypes to talk about web application\n\n160\n00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:06.470\navailability monitoring\nagainst single URLs.\n\n161\n00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.490\nWe talked about Visual Studio,\nweb test monitoring, running multi-step\n\n162\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.830\nauthentication and monitoring against\nthe site to check performance.\n\n163\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.950\nSo, we have different options,\nwe do talk about test maximums and\n\n164\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.520\nlocations a little bit here,\nwhich is nice.\n\n165\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.850\nSo, we go through and gives us some\ninformation about how all this is set up.\n\n166\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.890\nWe talk about test parameters here, your\nmaximum number of requests per web test,\n\n167\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.480\n100.\n\n168\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.600\nMaximum web test file size,\nthe subscriptions per tenant.\n\n169\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.070\nYou have this with your Azure subscription\nif you're gonna do GSM monitoring,\n\n170\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.677\nit's part of the user fabric,\nyou'll be able to get that.\n\n171\n00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:39.374\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n172\n00:08:39.374 --> 00:08:43.209\n&gt;&gt; And hook that up as part as we were\ntalking about and you could see we have\n\n173\n00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:47.980\n16 different curly anyway, 16 locations\nthat are setup in Microsoft maintains.\n\n174\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.430\nThis list does update overtime.\n\n175\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.142\nSo, obviously you would have to make sure\nyou get the most recent information but\n\n176\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:58.388\nyou'll see here, they have data\ncenter monitors in most geographies.\n\n177\n00:08:58.388 --> 00:09:01.140\nSo they got them in Europe,\nthey have them in Asia,\n\n178\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.556\nthey have them all over the world, Latin\nAmerica, you got one sitting in Brazil,\n\n179\n00:09:05.556 --> 00:09:08.180\nin the US there is actually one in Miami,\nright?\n\n180\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.170\nNot too far from me.\n\n181\n00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.090\n&gt;&gt; Are you looking at extra cost\nwhenever you utilize these services?\n\n182\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Well this will be part\nof your Azure Fabric.\n\n183\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.371\n&gt;&gt; It is? Okay. &gt;&gt; Subscription so\nyou are not looking at extra cost but\n\n184\n00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:19.330\nyou are looking at the outlay initially\nto set up and connect to Azure.\n\n185\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.970\nSo, whatever those monthly fees are,\ndepending on how you set up and\n\n186\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.030\nlicense Azure.\n\n187\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.340\nAnd there is a sliding scale,\nwhich is kind of how you are buying in and\n\n188\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.170\nwhat you're opting in, within what level.\n\n189\n00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.610\nHow you are subscribing,\nhow many services you're using.\n\n190\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.640\nAnd same thing with Amazon.\n\n191\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.170\nIt's kind of an ala carte thought process.\n\n192\n00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; The more you consume,\n\n193\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.530\nthe more you pay for.\n\n194\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.720\nSo, there are definitely would be costs\nassociated with this, but not directly.\n\n195\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.980\nIt's the broader thought process\nof opting into Azure and\n\n196\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.140\nthen using this as part of\nthe subscription model.\n\n197\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.370\nSo you would go through, you can look\nall this up and find out about all these\n\n198\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.120\nthrough the website, and\nit would then give you a little bit more\n\n199\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.625\ninsight into what we do for that piece,\nif we want to come in from the outside.\n\n200\n00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.925\nWe're just gonna set this up from\nthe assumption monitoring from the inside\n\n201\n00:09:58.925 --> 00:10:01.115\ncuz we're not subscribing to Azure and\n\n202\n00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:04.605\nsetting up the Fabric subscription\nto be able to do the demonstration.\n\n203\n00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.522\nWe are just simply gonna show\nyou the thought process about\n\n204\n00:10:07.522 --> 00:10:09.172\nhow you would do that if we were going to.\n\n205\n00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:12.522\nSo, I'm gonna search here for\nmy internal solution.\n\n206\n00:10:12.522 --> 00:10:16.952\nI do have my monitoring capability or\nmy watcher note so\n\n207\n00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:19.612\nto speak with my internal\nmanagement group server.\n\n208\n00:10:19.612 --> 00:10:21.786\nSo, my S01 server right here,-\n&gt;&gt; Kinda creepy name.\n\n209\n00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:23.456\n&gt;&gt; Click Add.\n\n210\n00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.336\n&gt;&gt; The watcher node?\n\n211\n00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:25.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n212\n00:10:25.046 --> 00:10:27.206\n&gt;&gt; It could be a movie title.\n\n213\n00:10:27.206 --> 00:10:28.366\n&gt;&gt; It could be, the Watchmen.\n\n214\n00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.986\nThat was you know,\nit's a Marvel I think, right?\n\n215\n00:10:30.986 --> 00:10:32.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you could have those, so\n\n216\n00:10:32.816 --> 00:10:33.856\nkinda be like that.\n\n217\n00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:37.956\nAll right, so we have our agent pool\nset up here, we'll click next and\n\n218\n00:10:37.956 --> 00:10:42.685\nthen we have our view and\nour validate test.\n\n219\n00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:46.850\nAnd, we can go in and\nwe can unless we have two URL's there.\n\n220\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.440\nAnd excuse me what we are gonna\ndo is we can go in, and\n\n221\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.020\nwe can specify that we would be\nable to buy URL, we have each one.\n\n222\n00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.840\nWe can run a test, and\nsee whether we can connect out.\n\n223\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.350\nAnd, monitor and if we can actually\nthen we would get the results back on.\n\n224\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.920\nHow long did it take us to connect,\nand what was the performance on it?\n\n225\n00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.770\nWe begin to see the sample data\nwe'll ultimately get as we monitor.\n\n226\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.770\nNow, we're doing this\nfrom an internal monitor.\n\n227\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.060\nWe're not going out to the web to actually\nconnect and hit these sites for real, so\n\n228\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.670\nwe're not gonna run the test here.\n\n229\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.240\nWell because if we do that and\n\n230\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.120\nyou can't even see that on test\nbox because I'm talking to you.\n\n231\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.480\nThe box is covering, when we move it over,\nso you could see it.\n\n232\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.980\nIf we were to click the run test now,\n\n233\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.600\nwe would get a failure because\nwe're not actually connecting out.\n\n234\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.250\nBut, I'm just showing you\nthat that's what we would do.\n\n235\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.100\nWe could, you'll see here, change our\nconfiguration, we just click here.\n\n236\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.260\nLet's just talk about what we do have\nunderneath the hook for testing for\n\n237\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.970\na minute though,\ncuz this part will be of interest to you.\n\n238\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.175\nSo we have test frequency and\nperformance data collection,\n\n239\n00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:49.250\nif Cherokee was asking, hey where will\nwe monitor from, how do we set it up?\n\n240\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.350\nBut she also could have asked,\nhey what are we gonna monitor,\n\n241\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.650\nwhen are we gonna get back and what kind\nof data might would be interested in?\n\n242\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.340\nThat would also be part of\nwhat we would see here.\n\n243\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.770\nAnd you could see we\nhave our test frequency.\n\n244\n00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.300\nWe have the ability to specify our\ntime out values, things like that.\n\n245\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.374\nWe will then look at our alerts,\nso for this one by default,\n\n246\n00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:09.504\nwe have a request status code.\n\n247\n00:12:09.504 --> 00:12:14.190\nGenerate a, or rather greater than, or\nequal to anything that's 400, or above.\n\n248\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.270\nMeaning, error codes to come\nback in the HTTP language stack.\n\n249\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.090\nYou've got different numbers,\nlike a 404 error, in a page not found but\n\n250\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.770\nit's usually familiar with that, 200,\n300, 400, so all these different codes.\n\n251\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.780\nWe can search for,\nin the monitoring stream, and\n\n252\n00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.650\nthen pull back data specific to\nerror codes or status codes,\n\n253\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.320\nproper way of referring to them\ncuz not all of them imply errors.\n\n254\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.930\nIn fact, most of them do not, but\n\n255\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.320\na subset of the status codes\nhappen to deal with errors.\n\n256\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.585\nSo badge me for talking about it that way.\n\n257\n00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:45.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I should actually be referring to it as\n\n258\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.210\na status code.\n\n259\n00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.648\nSo the status codes can be queried as\npart of our monitoring, and we can go in\n\n260\n00:12:50.648 --> 00:12:55.508\nhere and through just a simple string and\na boolean fall process say greater than or\n\n261\n00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:59.401\nequal to, equal to, not equal to,\netc, specify a number here.\n\n262\n00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:03.434\nIf we do have our own generic status\ncodes, you know not generic rather,\n\n263\n00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:06.891\nour own custom codes that we have\nincluded in our web servers.\n\n264\n00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:08.283\nA lot of developers will do that.\n\n265\n00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:08.787\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n266\n00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:12.048\n&gt;&gt; We just have to know what they\nare in terms of the number sequence and\n\n267\n00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:14.667\nthen specify the monitor to\nbe at that level or above,\n\n268\n00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:18.750\nto return them if we wanna be able to\nsee evidence of them in the data stream.\n\n269\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.040\nSo we could do that as well, yeah.\n\n270\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.240\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam when we wanna, it just\nseems like I wouldn't wanna know about\n\n271\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.130\nevery single instance, maybe not at that\nparticular you know notification and\n\n272\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.290\nI wouldn't wanna have an extreme, have to\nsift through and find the important ones.\n\n273\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.440\nIs there a way to triage these alerts?\n\n274\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, you would wanna get multiple\ninstances if they refer to different\n\n275\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.130\nactivities.\n\n276\n00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So they may very well\n\n277\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.680\nbe legitimate reasons why we would wanna\nsee multiple occurences of a code.\n\n278\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.370\nUser hits a page five\ntimes in five minutes and\n\n279\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.750\nit's not coming up, we'd wanna get\nthat repetition and know that.\n\n280\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we wanna know there's a service\n\n281\n00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.255\noutage versus.\n\n282\n00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:56.600\nOr hit it once and it didn't come up and\nwe don't know if it actually ever did or\n\n283\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.910\nthat in other words right?\n\n284\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.830\nSo we would potentially wanna\nknow the things were happening.\n\n285\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.161\nWe can't filter but\n\n286\n00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:07.331\nthere usually is a mindset that we wanna\nsee it iterations as we're monitoring\n\n287\n00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:12.286\nto tell us whether multiple users from\ndifferent places in these streams.\n\n288\n00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:17.279\nIn other words, if we're doing inside or\nrather outside-in monitoring with GSM, and\n\n289\n00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:22.410\nwe're monitoring from different watcher\nnodes in Ireland, Brazil, or wherever.\n\n290\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.400\nCertain pathways may be functional, but\nothers may not be, right to your point.\n\n291\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.980\nAnd so we would wanna see iterations of\nthat to help us fine-tune the data and\n\n292\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.890\nmake it more valuable.\n\n293\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.390\nSo we would probably have\nsomeone of you doing that,\n\n294\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.200\nsupposed to filtering out for it.\n\n295\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.080\nWe could see here content match.\n\n296\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.202\nSo, we could actually do content match,\ndoes not contain,\n\n297\n00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:43.520\ndoes contain, equal to,\nless than, wild card, et cetera.\n\n298\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.130\nAnd we can actually see if it contains\nthis in the stream, it'll tell us.\n\n299\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.660\nSo, they're looking for a word.\n\n300\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.480\nWe're looking for the URL.\n\n301\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.790\nJust all sorts of stuff, potentially,\nthat we could do here in the request.\n\n302\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.190\nFor the base page, check for redirects,\nright, for being bounced to a URL and\n\n303\n00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.890\nthen bounce again to another URL through\nredirect, we wanna check for that.\n\n304\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.280\nWe could select all or\nspecify the criteria that we wanna use for\n\n305\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.460\nmanaging health state, this top one here\nis all about error states for alert.\n\n306\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.200\nDown here,same idea for\nwarning state for health.\n\n307\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.500\nIs the health of the system degrading or\nis it running the right way?\n\n308\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.420\nSo, we can be looking at all of this\nin addition as we scroll down here.\n\n309\n00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.700\nWe could specify the number of consecutive\ntimes the criteria would be generated,\n\n310\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.660\nso as you were saying,\nwe could filter it as you asked.\n\n311\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.160\nYou just have a little box there with\na number you specify how many consecutive\n\n312\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.730\ntimes you want to see that.\n\n313\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.712\nWe may, as I suggested,\nwant to see multiple iterations but,\n\n314\n00:15:40.712 --> 00:15:43.825\nCherokee's point, we could easily\nfilter that if we wanted to.\n\n315\n00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:47.337\nAnd then we can go ahead and we can do\nperformance collection down here, and\n\n316\n00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:50.459\nyou'll see that we can look at\nresponse times as I was suggesting,\n\n317\n00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:53.448\nwhat's the inbound and outbound and\nthe performance on that.\n\n318\n00:15:53.448 --> 00:15:56.037\nAnd we look at values.\n\n319\n00:15:56.037 --> 00:16:00.463\nSo seated with that DNS resolution\ntest time, round trip time, TCP,\n\n320\n00:16:00.463 --> 00:16:02.220\nthings of that nature.\n\n321\n00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.720\nWe also look at allowing redirects and\nspecifying HTTP version.\n\n322\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.915\nSo are we doing version 5 Version 1.1 or\nthinking HTML.\n\n323\n00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:17.595\nI'm thinking HTML not HTTP, 1.0 or\n1.1 is what I meant to say on HTTP.\n\n324\n00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:22.415\nWe can look at the HTTP method get head\npost and program that information for\n\n325\n00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:23.435\neach of those.\n\n326\n00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:27.195\nAnd then we also have information\nthat we could specify down here\n\n327\n00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.875\nabout the HTTP headers.\n\n328\n00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:31.435\nAnd how we're gonna deal with them,\nor what headers we wanna see.\n\n329\n00:16:31.435 --> 00:16:32.950\nSo this is very detailed.\n\n330\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.650\nVery, very detailed diagnostics in here.\n\n331\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.460\nSo it's interesting that we have\nthe ability to really detail out.\n\n332\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.840\nAnd spec out almost every\naspect of the interaction\n\n333\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.440\nacross the web server divide here.\n\n334\n00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.840\nFrom the monitor, the watcher node,\nto the web server, and back.\n\n335\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.730\nAnd then draw down all that data.\n\n336\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.890\nSo this is actually a really, really,\n\n337\n00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.362\nand I'm gonna use a very highly\ntechnical term here, nifty.\n\n338\n00:16:56.362 --> 00:16:59.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a very nifty\n\n339\n00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.710\nfeature that we have.\n\n340\n00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.800\nSo it is really kinda cool that\nwe have the ability to do GSM,\n\n341\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.680\nglobal service monitoring now.\n\n342\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.450\nBecause this is one of the big,\ncompetitive landscape points for\n\n343\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.680\nMicrosoft in the System Center stack and\nthe Ops Manager stack.\n\n344\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.200\nThere's a lot of other products.\n\n345\n00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.460\nYou've heard me talk about them\nin some other episodes and\n\n346\n00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.510\nother areas in the show.\n\n347\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.090\nThings like HP Open View.\n\n348\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:22.100\nIBM Tivoli.\n\n349\n00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.710\nSolar Winds.\n\n350\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.110\nThe Orion Product.\n\n351\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.730\nAll sorts of different products out\nthere that essentially do this and\n\n352\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.190\nspecialize in doing this.\n\n353\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.450\nAnd we do it too and we do it very well.\n\n354\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.512\nSo being able to delve into this feature\na little bit and see it is helpful.\n\n355\n00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:37.800\nEspecially if you haven't really had to\nset this up yourself or don't understand.\n\n356\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.390\nThe capabilities of this.\n\n357\n00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:44.160\nThis is really under the hood a very\nvaluable set of tests that we can run.\n\n358\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.550\nAnd very valuable information\nwe can get back as a result.\n\n359\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.570\nSo we're gonna finish out here,\nwe're gonna leave this here.\n\n360\n00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.990\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n361\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.940\nWe're then just gonna\nget our summary screen.\n\n362\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.880\nAnd as I've told you in other episodes,\nI'll remind you of this here.\n\n363\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.130\nIt's always a good idea to capture\nthe information on the summary screen for\n\n364\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.850\ndocumentation purposes.\n\n365\n00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.470\nA screen capture, a picture.\n\n366\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.405\nDo a little selfie.\n\n367\n00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:04.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do one of these with\n\n368\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.440\nthe camera, right there.\n\n369\n00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.100\nI can actually do it face-on\nbecause I'm standing there.\n\n370\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.650\nSo we'll just pretend to take a picture,\nlet me get it in frame, click, right?\n\n371\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:16.120\nSo you have that, and then with that you\ncan put that into your documentation.\n\n372\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.340\nSo you've got an exact reproduction\nof what the settings where when you\n\n373\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.110\nconfigured this thing.\n\n374\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.080\nVery important for you to think about\nthat, and make sure you're doing that.\n\n375\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.040\nWe're gonna click Create.\n\n376\n00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.476\nGive that just a minute to come up and\nthen when this is done.\n\n377\n00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:31.490\nWe'll have our monitor, it will show up.\n\n378\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.880\nAnd again, we may have to\nrefresh to get it to be there.\n\n379\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.210\nBut trust me, it will be there.\n\n380\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.600\nBut we can go in and\nwe'll have this available.\n\n381\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.870\nAnd we'll just go ahead and we'll refresh\nhere real quick to get this in there.\n\n382\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.360\nJust give it a second.\n\n383\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.520\nAnd then once we do that there we go,\nthere's our web monitor right there.\n\n384\n00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.810\nThen we will have it available and\nthen we'll be able to go ahead and\n\n385\n00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.050\ndeploy this and actually use this.\n\n386\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:19:00.405\nSo this will then allow us to be able to\ngo in and ultimate check our web status.\n\n387\n00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.945\nWe'll be able to go in and\n\n388\n00:19:01.945 --> 00:19:05.605\nwe'll be able to go monitoring,\nup under the web application.\n\n389\n00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:08.190\nSo we'll transition over here,\nsee the output of this.\n\n390\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.105\nEssentially to see where it goes live.\n\n391\n00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:12.825\nWe go in here,\nwe'll go into application monitoring.\n\n392\n00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:16.040\nWe went in here when we were\ndoing the .NET set up in\n\n393\n00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.290\nthe .NET framework transaction\ntemplate and doing APM.\n\n394\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.533\nWe went in and showed you what\nthe output would look like here.\n\n395\n00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:23.747\nIt's going to be the same idea.\n\n396\n00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.620\nWe're gonna go up under web application.\n\n397\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.895\nSo, let's just scroll\ndown here real quick.\n\n398\n00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:30.675\nAnd we've got a web application\navailability monitoring.\n\n399\n00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:32.865\nWe did our .NET monitoring last time.\n\n400\n00:19:32.865 --> 00:19:36.305\nAnd you'll see we can go in\nunder web application status and\n\n401\n00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:38.265\neventually we'll get our status to update.\n\n402\n00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:40.975\nAnd then remember it takes\na little bit of time.\n\n403\n00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:45.345\nI preloaded the application when we did\nthe .NET application monitoring demo.\n\n404\n00:19:45.345 --> 00:19:48.639\nSo we actually had it run for about 20\nminutes behind the scenes before we\n\n405\n00:19:48.639 --> 00:19:50.920\nactually brought it out and\nshowed it to you.\n\n406\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.670\nSo you actually would be\nable to see some status.\n\n407\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.850\nBut eventually, we will get a status here.\n\n408\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:00.710\nWe'll be able to see the state test status\nas well, if there are any active alerts.\n\n409\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.980\nWe won't have any right now but\n\n410\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.760\neventually if we do have anything\nwe'll be able to see them.\n\n411\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.570\nBut over time, we will be able\nto get this up and running.\n\n412\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.260\nAnd it will show up, and we will see our\nmonitor, our application running there.\n\n413\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.080\nOur web application status will show up.\n\n414\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.172\nHopefully it will show up it's healthy\nonce it spins up and starts running.\n\n415\n00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:19.848\nAnd then once we have that up and\n\n416\n00:20:19.848 --> 00:20:24.230\nrunning we're able to go in and look at\nthe diagram view on it if we choose to.\n\n417\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.523\nSo we actually can go in and we can,\n\n418\n00:20:26.523 --> 00:20:31.444\nlet me just see if we can refresh one\nmore time and see if we can get in there.\n\n419\n00:20:31.444 --> 00:20:34.040\nSee the web app monitor's\nstarting to build.\n\n420\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.136\nBut it's gonna take time to come online\nand actually be available to us.\n\n421\n00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:40.353\nBut in the meantime, what we can do\nbecause we at least have it up and\n\n422\n00:20:40.353 --> 00:20:42.710\nrunning now and since that it's out there.\n\n423\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.130\nWe can either go over here to the right,\ndraw our diagram view.\n\n424\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.446\nI wanna show the diagram view\nin the .NET APM monitor.\n\n425\n00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:49.550\nRemember you were pretty\nexcited about that.\n\n426\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; That was you interactive diagram.\n\n427\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.120\nWe'll show that again here, same idea.\n\n428\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.910\nThis is one of the benefits\nwe get from linking this\n\n429\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.590\nto our default management pack.\n\n430\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.828\nWe have all these objects\nalready built out.\n\n431\n00:20:59.828 --> 00:21:04.540\nAnd we're then able to use them as we set\nup the monitor and start to deploy it.\n\n432\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.530\nSo all the objects from the management\npack, like these views are then able or\n\n433\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.005\navailable to us to actually deploy.\n\n434\n00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Which is one of\n\n435\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.680\nthe values of this, right?\n\n436\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna right-click\n\n437\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.080\nhere just to show this to you.\n\n438\n00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.580\nWe did do the Health Explorer\nin our last demo.\n\n439\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.470\nI'm not gonna walk through\nthat whole thing again.\n\n440\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.260\nBut the idea was that we'll then, and\n\n441\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.629\nwe're not gonna have any data in\nthe Health Explorer right now.\n\n442\n00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:23.935\nStill speeding up the monitor.\n\n443\n00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:27.295\nBut eventually we will get the ability\nto walk through all the state changes.\n\n444\n00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:31.005\nAnd look at information about how healthy\nwe are over a period of time with\n\n445\n00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:31.605\nHealth Explorer.\n\n446\n00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:34.395\nSo, that's gonna be very important for\nus to think about.\n\n447\n00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:36.495\nWe do have the ability to run our reports.\n\n448\n00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:39.045\nAnd by the way these reports as,\ncan we go full screen for a minute.\n\n449\n00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:40.972\nSo we can see what's behind my box there.\n\n450\n00:21:40.972 --> 00:21:44.622\nThese report test right here are the same\nones that are sitting over here.\n\n451\n00:21:44.622 --> 00:21:45.992\nSo we don't have to right click and\nview it.\n\n452\n00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:46.932\n&gt;&gt; Just a different way to access them.\n\n453\n00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:47.592\n&gt;&gt; Same way to get to it.\n\n454\n00:21:47.592 --> 00:21:49.668\nIt doesn't matter where\nyou wanna see them from.\n\n455\n00:21:49.668 --> 00:21:53.302\nBut all of this stuff here\nis the same as over here.\n\n456\n00:21:53.302 --> 00:21:55.782\nAnd if we go to navigation and\nsee the views,\n\n457\n00:21:55.782 --> 00:21:59.712\nall of those views right there\nare the same as these views right here.\n\n458\n00:21:59.712 --> 00:22:02.690\nSo we're gonna bring up, let me just\nrefresh one more time to see if we have\n\n459\n00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.350\nanother status update\nbefore we do anything else.\n\n460\n00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.167\nIt's starting to go one from gray to green\nand you may not be able to see that.\n\n461\n00:22:08.167 --> 00:22:11.270\nBut the circle is now green\nwhich means it's initializing.\n\n462\n00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.625\nSo, we're getting data, eventually we'll\nget a green check there that says healthy.\n\n463\n00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.100\nBut we can go in and\nwe could do our diagram view.\n\n464\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.590\nAnd when we do this we will then\nsee our web app monitor and\n\n465\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.485\nwe've got our interactive diagram.\n\n466\n00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:27.703\nThere's no status there yet cuz again,\nthe monitor is still spinning up.\n\n467\n00:22:27.703 --> 00:22:31.340\nBut over time we will be able to go in and\nsee.\n\n468\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.790\nAnd we saw to green status\ngo on the circle there.\n\n469\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.270\nThe top circle went to green\nas I said a moment ago,\n\n470\n00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.360\nshows us that the monitor is initializing.\n\n471\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.570\nIt's not healthy or unhealthy,\nit's just turning on.\n\n472\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.710\nBut this stuff wants you to deploy it,\ntakes about 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n473\n00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.170\nMaybe even longer depending on what\nkind of monitoring you are doing\n\n474\n00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:49.840\nto come online.\n\n475\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.560\nSo you do have to be patient,\nit's not gonna happen right away.\n\n476\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.090\nAnd will not happen [LAUGH] during\nthe course of our demo fully.\n\n477\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.500\nWe're all just showing you\nthe outline of how to set this up.\n\n478\n00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.920\nBut over time this will come online.\n\n479\n00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.590\nAnd over time we then\nwill be able to monitor.\n\n480\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.390\nAnd if you look you'll see we\nhave MSN there, we have ITProTV.\n\n481\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.080\nEvery one of our URLs is\nset up as its own instance.\n\n482\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.610\nWe have our web app monitor information.\n\n483\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.566\nAnd all of this essentially will\nnow be monitored and come online.\n\n484\n00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:18.210\nWe'll be able to see the status of it and\ninteract with it along the way.\n\n485\n00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:19.100\nOkay?\n\n486\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Well folks there you have it.\n\n487\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.300\nWeb application availability monitoring\nbrought to you by the distinguished\n\n488\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.030\nAdam Gordon.\n\n489\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.400\nSo thank you so much Adam for\nbeing here today.\n\n490\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.100\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n491\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.611\nBut stay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n492\n00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:34.070\nFor this show I'll go ahead and\nsign out as your host.\n\n493\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.730\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n494\n00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.108\n&gt;&gt; I'm the distinguished,\nAdam Gordon apparently, but\n\n495\n00:23:38.108 --> 00:23:40.342\nit's always a pleasure to\nbe with you nonetheless.\n\n496\n00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:41.663\nTake care everybody,\ncome back and see you soon.\n\n497\n00:23:41.663 --> 00:23:42.295\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n498\n00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:52.588\n[MUSIC]\n\n499\n00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:56.062\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.026\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:14.761\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your Monitoring and\n\n5\n00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.065\nOperating a

and\n\n8\n00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:25.245\nwith us today in the studio,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.385\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:28.635\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n11\n00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:29.455\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, so\n\n12\n00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:34.165\nwe're gonna continue our conversations\naround showing you different aspects of\n\n13\n00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:38.020\nthe System Center Ops Manager capabilities\nfor monitoring application health.\n\n14\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.690\nTake a look at APM,\ntalked about inside out and\n\n15\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.470\noutside in transaction monitoring\nwith global service monitoring.\n\n16\n00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.540\nWe've taken a look at and talked about how\nto deal with event notifications, alert\n\n17\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.640\nnotifications, how we do run as accounts,\nrun as profiles and deal with that.\n\n18\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.680\nWe're gonna now put the capstone in place,\ntalk about distributed applications.\n\n19\n00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.200\nHow we can diagram out, or\nessentially create a visual reference for\n\n20\n00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.580\nour application stack, and\nthen monitor against that stack.\n\n21\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.440\nSo we're gonna start off in the console.\n\n22\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.870\nTake a look here,\nif you don't mind joining me\n\n23\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.910\nover here in the left wing of\nthe ITProTV demo environment.\n\n24\n00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.660\nI've already gone ahead and created\nan app that we can just look at first,\n\n25\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.350\njust to show you some things.\n\n26\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.850\nWe'll then go ahead and go back and\n\n27\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.880\nshow you how to create this using\nthe distributed application wizard.\n\n28\n00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.380\nBut we call this distributed\napp ITProTV Test App 1.\n\n29\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.400\nYou could see we've opened up or\nexploded out our diagram.\n\n30\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200\nThis is like that network diagram\nview that we've looked at\n\n31\n00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.750\nin some of the other episodes where we've\nlooked at the health status monitoring and\n\n32\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.820\nthe update in real time\naround those elements,\n\n33\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.900\nand this is gonna be the same idea,\nand we'll see underneath here,\n\n34\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.800\nI've added in two elements,\none that's called all computers and\n\n35\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.490\nI have all Windows computers as objects\nlisted here that I can monitor for.\n\n36\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.780\nI have an object called server and\n\n37\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.700\nI've added a specific instance\nof Windows Server here and\n\n38\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.760\nwhen I hover what you will notice is we\ngot a pop out and I'll select this and\n\n39\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.390\nthat information will show up at\nthe bottom pane in just a minute but\n\n40\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.840\nI get a pop out hover indicates that you\nknow, hey I wanna know some information\n\n41\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.450\nand when I do that, if I can get it to do\nthat again I get this nice little pop out\n\n42\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.025\nbox that gives me all the information\nabout the object in question.\n\n43\n00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.465\nBut it's only there for about 10 seconds.\n\n44\n00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:19.155\nIt's hard to read.\n\n45\n00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.875\nSo if you highlight that,\n\n46\n00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:24.575\nall that information shows up\ndown here in the lower third.\n\n47\n00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.995\nAnd we could see the name,\nthe display name, principle name, DNS,\n\n48\n00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:33.195\nthe net bios name, the IP address, all\nthe information about this object is here.\n\n49\n00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:34.985\nThe network name,\n\n50\n00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:38.550\nwe have the active directory\ninformation of it's domain joint.\n\n51\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.120\nWe have the number of logical processors\nand physical processors available here,\n\n52\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.490\nwe have quite a bit of information\nif it's a virtual machine\n\n53\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.620\nwe can tell that it's a virtual machine,\nall that stuff would be available to us so\n\n54\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.310\nall of that is here, in addition all\nthese diagrams are fully interactive,\n\n55\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.150\nwe can go in,\nwe can open up any of the views.\n\n56\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.170\nCan we go fullscreen just so you could see\nthis as it pops out, cuz it's kinda hidden\n\n57\n00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.680\nbehind me a little bit there, and I didn't\nbring my cloak of invisibility today with\n\n58\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.500\nme, so it's hard for me to disappear out\nof that box while you're taking a look.\n\n59\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next time Adam.\n\n60\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps next time,\nwhen I'm feeling more like a Harry Porter\n\n61\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.700\nkind of mood as opposed to my bright\neffervescent pink mood that I'm in today.\n\n62\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.470\nSo you'll see alert view, event view,\nperformance view, diagram view,\n\n63\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.460\nthese views can be opened response\nspecific to the object in the diagram and\n\n64\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.550\nif the stages would me allow me to be able\nto click and access the information for\n\n65\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.190\nthat, so you'll see that.\n\n66\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.360\nWe have our instance properties, health\nexplorer, we've talked about that before,\n\n67\n00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.760\nthe importance of the ops manager shell.\n\n68\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.420\nYou could see that and we could interact\nwith that here, and you'll see,\n\n69\n00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.060\nwe could start maintenance mode, and\n\n70\n00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.700\nwe could actually put this machine\ninto maintenance mode on to work hard.\n\n71\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.290\nAnd now we could do the same\nthing right over here and\n\n72\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.580\nthen have more on the right,\nwe have access to all of those options.\n\n73\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.700\nWe could use this information or\nthis set of Windows computer tasks,\n\n74\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.280\nright down here for instance to be\nable to go in, open Computer Manager,\n\n75\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.460\nping the computer, perhaps do\na remote desktop out to it, right?\n\n76\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.130\nSo there's all this different stuff that\nwe could do if we use one of these tasks\n\n77\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.430\nyou'll notice I'm able to open Computer\nManagement against the system immediately,\n\n78\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.700\nso long as the system's online and\navailable of course.\n\n79\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.590\nAnd I could do that, so you could see that\nI'm able to use tasks off to the right to\n\n80\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.610\ninteract with elements in\nthis diagram in real time.\n\n81\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.690\nWhich is incredibly important for us,\nbecause we don't have to go into five or\n\n82\n00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.230\nsix different screens to do\nadministration based on health status.\n\n83\n00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.150\nWe can do it right from within\nthe distributed app diagram itself.\n\n84\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.590\nWhich makes a lot of sense\nwhen you think about it.\n\n85\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.930\nSo we can see that.\n\n86\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.020\nAnd you know we obvious can execute\nany of these tasks depending on\n\n87\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.230\nwhat we are looking for.\n\n88\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.260\nNow as we scroll down, we continue to see.\n\n89\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.630\nI only opened up one area\nhere under the server.\n\n90\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.250\nI could do the same under\nall Windows computers.\n\n91\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.540\nBut I'll see that we have\nsome stuff that's healthy.\n\n92\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.770\nSo I can open this up,\nit'd tell us what is healthy here.\n\n93\n00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.390\nAll these things on the server\nare healthy elements.\n\n94\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.020\nI can look at,\nlet's just bring that back up,\n\n95\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.760\nthings that are not monitored, so what is\ncurrently not being monitored, I could\n\n96\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.510\nsee whatever is not being monitored and\nI would see the status of those.\n\n97\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.120\nAnd if there's anything in the warning\nstate I could see what's in the warning\n\n98\n00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.870\nstate, I could see that maybe our database\ninstance is in a warning state for\n\n99\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.200\ninstance hypothetically or\n\n100\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.250\nwhatever the case may be it may be\na service, or something like that.\n\n101\n00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.650\nAnd I can get more information,\ndepending on what's happening.\n\n102\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.340\nI can refresh in any area.\n\n103\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.640\nIt has to redraw, rerender diagram,\nbringing it back in and updating it.\n\n104\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.420\nSo I can do that.\n\n105\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.090\nIt takes just a moment,\nyou see that it comes back up.\n\n106\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.820\nAnd then I can delve in and\nsee if there's any updates.\n\n107\n00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.510\nSo the application, or distributed\napplication diagram, is very valuable for\n\n108\n00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.460\nus because it allows us to bring\nup an application that has been\n\n109\n00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.570\nput into the system.\n\n110\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.480\nHere you could see when close the diagrams\ngo back to the monitoring screen,\n\n111\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.520\nyou could see that under offering as we\nuse are distributed application area and\n\n112\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.580\nwe create our application.\n\n113\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.060\nSo this is the one that I preloaded before\nwe came on to do the demo just to show you\n\n114\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.910\nthe output, that once it's there and\ncreated, we then can simply go in.\n\n115\n00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.300\nIt's very simple to do.\n\n116\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.210\nRight click and just view diagram.\n\n117\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.690\nThat's what I was doing just now.\n\n118\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.010\nThat's what we will see.\n\n119\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.670\nWe could view state as well.\n\n120\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.360\nI can right click and view state.\n\n121\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.630\nGive this just a second.\n\n122\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.530\nWe can go in and see our state monitor.\n\n123\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.580\nWe've looked at our state monitor\nbefore in some of the other demos.\n\n124\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.070\nWe've seen the value of\nunderstanding what the state is.\n\n125\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.490\nWe could see the state in\nany of these categories.\n\n126\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.620\nAre we up to date with software updates?\n\n127\n00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.920\nAre or is our APM or application\nperformance monitoring taking place?\n\n128\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.890\nYou know all the different\nthings that are here and\n\n129\n00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.110\nyou'll see there are quite a number\nof them as we scroll over, right?\n\n130\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.910\nJust going by there.\n\n131\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.630\nLook at all that stuff that potentially\nwe can monitor for and tell the state of.\n\n132\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.580\nJust gonna keep going until either we run\nout of room, I run out of things to say,\n\n133\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.600\nor you get so dizzy that you go like\nthis and fall out of your chair.\n\n134\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.580\nBut you can see all the different stuff.\n\n135\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.101\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; That's potentially is\n\n136\n00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:01.500\nbeing monitored for here.\n\n137\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.000\nAnd we're not even halfway through yet.\n\n138\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.700\nLook at the slider at the bottom.\n\n139\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.830\nWe're approaching halfway right now.\n\n140\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.270\nAnd I've already actually shaved and\nchanged my shirt twice.\n\n141\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.470\nAnd we're still going.\n\n142\n00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.140\nAnd so you could see that this is\npulling down all of this information.\n\n143\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.294\nEvery aspect of all the information\nassociated with the management packs, and\n\n144\n00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.099\neverything we can be looking for.\n\n145\n00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.300\nNow clearly we're not monitoring for\nmost of this.\n\n146\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.350\nMost of it is just, essentially there,\nhey I've available but\n\n147\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.250\nI'm not really monitoring for you yet.\n\n148\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.320\nBut the point is you could see that I have\nhundreds of items that could be looked\n\n149\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.468\nat for state, right now we're just looking\nat the fact that we're in a warning\n\n150\n00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:44.460\nstage generically, we don't really know\nwhy but we know that we can go in and\n\n151\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.146\nwe can open up any of our views\nhere to get a sense of that.\n\n152\n00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:50.748\nWe also know that we can\nopen our help explorer and\n\n153\n00:07:50.748 --> 00:07:54.936\nbegin to look at state transition or\nchanges and see what's happening when and\n\n154\n00:07:54.936 --> 00:07:57.872\nthen work backwards to figure\nout what may be going on.\n\n155\n00:07:57.872 --> 00:08:00.818\nWe may want to do a quick look and\nsee if there's any alerts, so\n\n156\n00:08:00.818 --> 00:08:02.758\nmaybe we'll just do a quick alert view.\n\n157\n00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:04.585\nWe could see there are some alerts here,\n\n158\n00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:07.390\nthat may be leading to some of\nthe concern that we're seeing.\n\n159\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.578\nAnd we could see what they are,\nPowerShell scripts failed to run, may or\n\n160\n00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:12.892\nmay not be important.\n\n161\n00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:17.812\nWe can take a look and see that APM.net\nserver side configuration error\n\n162\n00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:22.821\nconflicts with something with setting\nup APM, may have been a problem.\n\n163\n00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:24.540\nLooks like IS needs to be restarted,\n\n164\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.143\nthat will be from one of our prior demos\nwhere I didn't bother to restart IS and\n\n165\n00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:30.750\njust continued to do some stuff and\nconfigure it.\n\n166\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.201\nSo we can see there's evidence of things\ngoing on in the system but that's okay,\n\n167\n00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:36.105\nwe can at least now tell what they are.\n\n168\n00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:40.021\nAnd if we needed to delve into one of\nthem in more detail we can go in, we can\n\n169\n00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:44.345\nclick on it, we could see down here that\nwe get the information about the alert.\n\n170\n00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:48.692\nWe can see the alert description down\nhere, what machine it came from,\n\n171\n00:08:48.692 --> 00:08:52.382\nif there is an action that is\nrequired it shows us what it is.\n\n172\n00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:56.420\nOver here as we scroll down, we could see\nthat there may be additional details in\n\n173\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.235\nthe alert summary, or in the error\nsummary that we'd wanna take a look at.\n\n174\n00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:04.105\nSo there's very detailed information with\nregards to performance monitoring that\n\n175\n00:09:04.105 --> 00:09:06.065\nthe system will give us in the console,\nbut\n\n176\n00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:08.308\nwe've gotta know where to\ngo in order to find it.\n\n177\n00:09:08.308 --> 00:09:11.977\nAnd we've gotta be able to follow\nthe breadcrumb trail, essentially,\n\n178\n00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:15.887\nthat we have from console to console\nwindow to be able to see what we're having\n\n179\n00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:19.134\nto figure out as administrators and\nwhat may be impactful to us so\n\n180\n00:09:19.134 --> 00:09:20.880\nwe better understand it.\n\n181\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.550\nVery powerful tool, lots and\nlots of things going on, and\n\n182\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.250\nlots of information that oops,\nthat we can interact with, I did click,\n\n183\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.410\nlots of things going on that\nwe can interact with in there.\n\n184\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.000\nSo what I wanna do is show you how to\ncreate this distributed application view,\n\n185\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.020\nso we're gonna do that right now.\n\n186\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.660\nWe're gonna right click on\nthe distributed application item,\n\n187\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.920\nnotice we are in the authoring workspace,\nwe are up under authoring.\n\n188\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.170\nWe've been through\nthe management pack templates,\n\n189\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.630\ndone a couple of different things there.\n\n190\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.530\nWe're gonna take a different tact here,\ndo Distributed Applications,\n\n191\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.410\nright click &gt; Create\na new distributed app.\n\n192\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.820\nGet a little wizard that shows up,\npretty straightforward.\n\n193\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.120\nWe're gonna name this one for\nmy lovely co-host over there, Cherokee,\n\n194\n00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.750\nand we're gonna say that this will\nbe called Cherokee App, right?\n\n195\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.290\n&gt;&gt; Yea, there's an app for that.\n\n196\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.320\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for that,\nthere's an app for Cherokee.\n\n197\n00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.160\nCherokee app one, okay.\n\n198\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.740\nAnd we have some templates\nhere that we can choose,\n\n199\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.070\nwe have a .NET three-tier application.\n\n200\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.630\nSo if the Cherokee app was a .NET app,\n\n201\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.610\nwe would choose that to be able\nto represent the different\n\n202\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.180\nfunctionality levels in a .NET app\nwith a two or a three-tier solution.\n\n203\n00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.140\nWe may do a blank advance,\nwhich is just a blank template.\n\n204\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.900\nThat's the one I'll do, and we can pull\nout and essentially create components and\n\n205\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.170\nthen join them and create a connection,\nI'll show you how to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.700\nWe could do a messaging one,\nwe could do a line of business web app.\n\n207\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.850\nSo every template has\ninformation specific to it and\n\n208\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.230\na specific way of diagramming\nthe application that we're gonna look at.\n\n209\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.162\nAnd if you're not familiar with\nit highlight the appropriate one,\n\n210\n00:10:50.162 --> 00:10:51.918\nyou'll get a little description here.\n\n211\n00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:55.684\nYou can view the details of it, go in, it\nbrings up purpose and feature, gives you\n\n212\n00:10:55.684 --> 00:10:59.628\na little bit more information about what\nthe template does, what you're able to do.\n\n213\n00:10:59.628 --> 00:11:03.027\nIt'll show things like websites and\ndatabase objects,\n\n214\n00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:07.010\nif you do the line of business\nweb app versus a messaging app.\n\n215\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.460\nWhere we'll go in and\nwe'll be able to see all the messaging\n\n216\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.390\ncomponents like Exchange, Mail Stores,\nDNS infrastructure, right,\n\n217\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.900\npretty standard messaging platform stuff,\nwe'd be able to diagram that out.\n\n218\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.530\nSo it's a question of what back end\napplication we're representing,\n\n219\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.340\nremember we're not creating\nthe application here.\n\n220\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.140\nWe're creating a representation\nof an existing app,\n\n221\n00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.715\nnot the real app itself, right,\n\n222\n00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:34.500\nwe're not about to create a messaging\nsystem if we choose messaging template.\n\n223\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.900\nWe're gonna represent the messaging\napplication that already exists\n\n224\n00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.010\nthat we wanna monitor, and\nthis is gonna gives us the structure and\n\n225\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.822\nthe objects that will be populated\nin order to be able to do that.\n\n226\n00:11:44.822 --> 00:11:46.520\nIf you've ever used Vizio,\nfor instance, and\n\n227\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.560\ndone any work in Vizio to create\na network diagram of some kind, or\n\n228\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.830\nif you've built workflows in either Vizio,\nor SharePoint Designer, or\n\n229\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:59.445\nVisual Studio for SharePoint, or\nany of those kinds of thought processes.\n\n230\n00:11:59.445 --> 00:12:02.753\nIf you've used SQL Server reporting\nservices report design, or\n\n231\n00:12:02.753 --> 00:12:06.195\nthe report builder tool to be\nable to build those objects,\n\n232\n00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:09.395\nyou're using some sort of a grid and\nyou're creating shapes or using\n\n233\n00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:14.825\npredetermined shapes to represent items,\nobjects, functionalities, services, etc.\n\n234\n00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:16.665\nAnd that's what we're doing here,\nthat's all we're doing,\n\n235\n00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:18.985\nso we're not actually creating the app.\n\n236\n00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:22.080\nWe're creating a visual representation\nof an existing app that we then wanna\n\n237\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.555\nmonitor, just to be clear, okay.\n\n238\n00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:26.390\nAnd we're gonna bind objects to it so\nthat obviously then\n\n239\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.750\nthey represent what we wanna monitor,\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n240\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.865\nWe'll do our blank advanced.\n\n241\n00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:34.794\nWe'll select our management pack.\n\n242\n00:12:34.794 --> 00:12:38.045\nWe've talked about the importance\nof selecting a management pack,\n\n243\n00:12:38.045 --> 00:12:40.970\nhaving the objects available that\ncome in as a result of that.\n\n244\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.784\nWe're gonna click OK and\nthen we get our designer,\n\n245\n00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:47.788\nright, this is the page where we're\ngonna go and actually lay this out.\n\n246\n00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:50.460\nCan we go full screen, just gonna need\nto be able to see everything as we go.\n\n247\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.080\nSo, Cherokee, you're gonna help me make\nsome choices here while we are doing this.\n\n248\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just go full screen,\n\n249\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.210\nfull screen for real so we see the grid,\nit's a little bit easier to work with.\n\n250\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.820\nSo we have first of all,\nthe need to put some objects out here and\n\n251\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.340\ncomponents out here on the screen.\n\n252\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.570\nSo what we're gonna do is\nclick Add Component, and\n\n253\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.600\nwhen we do that we're gonna get\nour little Add Component picker.\n\n254\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.830\nAnd we have to specify what we wanna call\nthe component, and then we have to specify\n\n255\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.212\nafter we call it something a certain kind\nof object that we're gonna bind to it.\n\n256\n00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:22.816\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So let's give our first component\n\n257\n00:13:22.816 --> 00:13:27.548\na name, what do you wanna call the first\ncomponent for the Cherokee app?\n\n258\n00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:29.998\n&gt;&gt; How about fuchsia?\n\n259\n00:13:29.998 --> 00:13:31.362\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia.\n\n260\n00:13:31.362 --> 00:13:34.671\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm seeing a lot\nof fuchsia right now.\n\n261\n00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:38.218\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to spell fuchsia so\nI'm gonna give it my best shot and\n\n262\n00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:40.062\nI'm gonna say F-U-C-H-I-A.\n\n263\n00:13:40.062 --> 00:13:42.586\n&gt;&gt; I think so, and\nmaybe there's an S in there.\n\n264\n00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:43.974\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps, but we're gonna go with that.\n\n265\n00:13:43.974 --> 00:13:45.162\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia.\n\n266\n00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:46.299\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or fuchia,\n\n267\n00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:48.166\ndepending on how you choose to\npronounce it, there may be an s.\n\n268\n00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:48.767\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n269\n00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:53.725\n&gt;&gt; But you called it, I didn't specify I\nhad to be able to spell it so bad for me,\n\n270\n00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:54.666\ngood for you.\n\n271\n00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:55.188\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n272\n00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:58.507\nI think Google has an operating\nsystem named Fuchsia out right now.\n\n273\n00:13:58.507 --> 00:13:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully they know how to spell it.\n\n274\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.585\n&gt;&gt; They're on to something.\n\n275\n00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:02.186\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully they are,\nhopefully they know how to spell it.\n\n276\n00:14:02.186 --> 00:14:03.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n277\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.130\nwe've got Fuchia there\nas our first component.\n\n278\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.200\nLet's add one more component so\nwe have a couple that we can then\n\n279\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.520\ncreate a connection between, and\nwe'll be able to interact with.\n\n280\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.760\nSo we're gonna click\nAdd Component one more time.\n\n281\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.428\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n282\n00:14:14.428 --> 00:14:16.473\nwe'll just do that,\nit's the same pick list, right,\n\n283\n00:14:16.473 --> 00:14:18.661\nthis time you're gonna pick\nsomething I know how to spell.\n\n284\n00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:21.250\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was thinking, I was like I\ndon't wanna say something like chartreuse.\n\n285\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.703\nHow about just we'll stick with colors and\ngo with green, how about that?\n\n286\n00:14:25.703 --> 00:14:28.596\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're gonna go with green.\n\n287\n00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:32.230\nNow we didn't talk about this\nlast time but if we want,\n\n288\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.237\nI'll just move this over here so\nyou can see.\n\n289\n00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:40.790\nIf we wanted to scope or narrowly define\nthe particular object down here, or\n\n290\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:47.550\ngroup of objects that we wanna be able to\nmake this shape, this component represent.\n\n291\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.540\nWe could decide hey, you know what,\ninstead of all objects, and\n\n292\n00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:56.110\nyou can see over here I have 313 objects\ncurrently in my pick list, all objects.\n\n293\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.300\nIf I wanna narrow that I\ncould say you know what,\n\n294\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.210\nI just want this particular one,\nthe one we're about to choose, green.\n\n295\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.176\nI just want it to be associated\nwith the administration item or\n\n296\n00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:11.672\nwhatever the case may be,\nor connector, or whatever.\n\n297\n00:15:11.672 --> 00:15:14.123\nAnd it would then narrowly define and\nconstrain the opportunity for\n\n298\n00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:17.401\nme to add objects to this component unique\nto the object choice I make, essentially.\n\n299\n00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:19.844\n&gt;&gt; Okay, based on that category.\n\n300\n00:15:19.844 --> 00:15:21.718\n&gt;&gt; Based on my initial choice, right.\n\n301\n00:15:21.718 --> 00:15:26.052\nSo as you're building out this though\nprocess and we're adding the components\n\n302\n00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:30.190\nin, you have to be thinking about what\nkind of components are gonna be used,\n\n303\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.365\nand what objects are gonna represent.\n\n304\n00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:36.359\nComponents are just empty shells, they're\nessentially just boxes that we ascribe\n\n305\n00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:39.521\nfunctionality to, think of them\nalmost like text boxes, right.\n\n306\n00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:43.005\nBut they're able to as containers\nhold objects that we bind to them,\n\n307\n00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:46.385\nwe're gonna bring objects in and\nadd them in here in just a minute.\n\n308\n00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:49.592\nSo they are a special kind of container, I\ndon't wanna minimize their functionality,\n\n309\n00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:50.558\nthey are very important.\n\n310\n00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.951\nBut they're really nothing more than\nessentially an empty box that we label\n\n311\n00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:57.608\nwith a name, that we hopefully spell\ncorrectly cuz Our co-host doesn't throw us\n\n312\n00:15:57.608 --> 00:16:00.224\nunder the bus with a color that\nwe don't know how to spell.\n\n313\n00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:02.960\nI'm not bitter by the way,\nI just found out late.\n\n314\n00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.307\nAnd then when we do that,\n\n315\n00:16:04.307 --> 00:16:08.490\nwe'll then gonna actually in Step Two\nhere as soon as we create the green one.\n\n316\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.505\nWe're gonna bind,\nwe're gonna go select an object and\n\n317\n00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:15.630\nbind it by adding it into the object,\nis gonna get added into the component.\n\n318\n00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.520\nI would then essentially\nhave an association.\n\n319\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.255\nAnd then we're gonna create a connection\nbetween those two components and\n\n320\n00:16:21.255 --> 00:16:24.811\nthen link them so as we create the\ndistributed app we get the nice diagram\n\n321\n00:16:24.811 --> 00:16:29.100\nwe're gonna see everything lined up for\nus, that's what we're gonna do right now.\n\n322\n00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.656\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\ninstantiate the green component here with\n\n323\n00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:38.370\nall objects selected, so let me just do\nthis, and we'll see we have both there.\n\n324\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.380\nNow we can position these,\nand move them around.\n\n325\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.720\nIf you would prefer to\nhave them set up and\n\n326\n00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.940\njust kinda dropped in here, right?.\n\n327\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.730\nThat way, you can put them side by side.\n\n328\n00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.040\nIf you wanna put it over here where it\nwas, kind of underneath each other.\n\n329\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.110\nUp to you to decide where to put them.\n\n330\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.820\nThis is you designing the app visually.\n\n331\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.887\nRemember just to show the components and\nunderstand the monitoring of these\n\n332\n00:17:05.887 --> 00:17:10.168\ncomponents when we link objects to them\nto represent them so we can see the data.\n\n333\n00:17:10.168 --> 00:17:12.030\n&gt;&gt; In other words-\n&gt;&gt; Whatever makes logical sense.\n\n334\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.555\n&gt;&gt; You can make it look as pretty or as\nugly as you want, it is up to you, okay?\n\n335\n00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:17.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it makes sense in your mind,\n\n336\n00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:20.280\nthat is what matters, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.760\nBrought to you from the mind of Cherokee,\nthis is gonna be interesting.\n\n338\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.800\nI'm not gonna ask her where she wants me\nto put them, we're gonna leave them there.\n\n339\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.580\n&gt;&gt; That's fine, Adam.\n\n340\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.707\n&gt;&gt; Because they may wind up, you know,\nwho knows, we're not quite sure.\n\n341\n00:17:30.707 --> 00:17:31.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n342\n00:17:31.358 --> 00:17:35.529\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna actually add objects into\n\n343\n00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:36.910\nour components, right?\n\n344\n00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.688\nSo next step is we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna come over here,\n\n345\n00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:41.835\nwe're gonna find an object\nthat's appropriate for\n\n346\n00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:44.418\nFuchsia I don't have a clue what\nthe heck that's gonna be, but\n\n347\n00:17:44.418 --> 00:17:47.770\nwe'll figure something out, and\nan object that's appropriate for green.\n\n348\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the primary colors,\nbecause those are secondary.\n\n349\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.532\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no logic that makes sense\n\n350\n00:17:53.532 --> 00:17:54.190\nthere-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.006\n&gt;&gt; I would just not say\n\n352\n00:17:55.006 --> 00:17:56.710\nanything about that if I was you.\n\n353\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.374\nBut what we would do in the real world,\nyou saw me in the demo,\n\n354\n00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:02.720\nby how I had already set up something,\njust from a labeling perspective that\n\n355\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.090\nactually made more sense would have\nbeen servers in all of these computers.\n\n356\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.913\nAnd then we would clearly be able to\nsign objects like a specific instance of\n\n357\n00:18:10.913 --> 00:18:11.620\na server.\n\n358\n00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.180\nWe're gonna pretend that\nwe did something like that.\n\n359\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.020\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n360\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.084\nThe labels as I said are pretty\nmuch just gonna be innocuous, but\n\n361\n00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:21.717\nif you wanted to remove the label and\nchange it, just right-click there and\n\n362\n00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:23.170\nwe can rename it if we need to.\n\n363\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.387\nSo it's not like if we made a choice and\nwe didn't like it we couldn't go back and\n\n364\n00:18:26.387 --> 00:18:28.645\nfix it,\nit will be easy enough to figure it out.\n\n365\n00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:31.050\nIt's just that we already went with that,\nso we're just gonna use that.\n\n366\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.678\nBut you get the idea, the real word\nis gonna be something meaningful,\n\n367\n00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:35.950\nlike a web server.\n\n368\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.630\nLike file and print server,\nsomething you name it.\n\n369\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.924\nSo as we add the object in and we drop it\nin specific instance of a file server,\n\n370\n00:18:41.924 --> 00:18:44.720\nit actually shows up and\nmakes sense when we track it, right?.\n\n371\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.600\nThat's what we wanna make sure we do.\n\n372\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.220\nSo let's scroll down here.\n\n373\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.850\nAnd we got all sorts of objects here by\nthe way, there's quite a number of them.\n\n374\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.136\nWe're gonna look for,\nLet's go back up right here,\n\n375\n00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:01.732\nwe're gonna look for an instance of the\nWindows operating system that has a server\n\n376\n00:19:01.732 --> 00:19:03.210\nname attached to it.\n\n377\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.900\nYou could see it right there, right?\n\n378\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.430\nSo we can drag this out.\n\n379\n00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.510\nRight-click on it, rather, I should say.\n\n380\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.941\nAdd to and specify,\neither create a new component group or\n\n381\n00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:14.650\nadd it to one of the ones\nthat we have here.\n\n382\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.665\nWe'll add the server to fuchsia,\nand you can see when we do that,\n\n383\n00:19:18.665 --> 00:19:22.400\nserver 12R2 operating system\ngets added in right there.\n\n384\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.740\nAnd we can then see that\nwe're gonna start monitoring.\n\n385\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.120\nCan we go full screen, cuz we gotta\nsee what's behind me here, okay?\n\n386\n00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.800\nAnd you'll see that we now have,\nwhen we do this, right?\n\n387\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.113\nWe have down here our object name,\nwe have our holding computer,\n\n388\n00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:37.366\nthe computer that we're gonna be using,\nand you'll see we have\n\n389\n00:19:37.366 --> 00:19:40.850\nthe different views that are gonna\nbe associated with this object.\n\n390\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.930\nWe have state view,\nour alert view and our diagram view.\n\n391\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.570\nSo we're starting to build in\nsome component structure and\n\n392\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.445\nthen objects bound to them as containers,\nand then logic that as we continue and\n\n393\n00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:56.259\nwe'll add another object into\nthe other component a minute.\n\n394\n00:19:56.259 --> 00:20:00.590\nClick Relationship, we'll then save it and\nwe'll go and look at the diagram.\n\n395\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.947\nThis is how we begin to see the monitoring\nbecause we're binding specific instances\n\n396\n00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:06.168\nof objects that we wanna get\nhealth monitoring for, and\n\n397\n00:20:06.168 --> 00:20:08.942\nthen they're gonna be brought in,\nwe're gonna be able to see them.\n\n398\n00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:09.456\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n399\n00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go grab another one.\n\n400\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.700\nFor green let's do-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably would have made it\n\n401\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.756\na little more instead of said green, maybe\nsomething like domain controllers, and\n\n402\n00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:24.270\nthen you could put those domain\ncontrollers in that grouping, right?\n\n403\n00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.490\nHey, reflection and self-awareness\nis a really importing concept.\n\n404\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.900\nThat is awesome that you came to\nthat on your own, that is great.\n\n405\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.950\nAnd yes it would have, but\nyou had your choice and you chose poorly.\n\n406\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.880\nSo you're now gonna have to live with\nthe outcome of your consequences.\n\n407\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.190\nAll right, so we are gonna choose,\nI'm just trying to find something here.\n\n408\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.590\nLet's do, let's go up here real quick.\n\n409\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.850\nLet's do the Ops Manager,\njust trying to find the one I want.\n\n410\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.400\nLet's do theOops Manager database, okay?\n\n411\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.060\nLet's grab that one, add that one.\n\n412\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.160\nWe'll add that one into green.\n\n413\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.540\nSo we have Ops Manager data, warehouse\ndatabase, one of our databases are.\n\n414\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.225\nReporting database where we're gonna get\nall that information that's held there,\n\n415\n00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:05.510\nand then send it over to\nthe reporting server.\n\n416\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.023\nAnd the reporting server\ninstance through querying, so\n\n417\n00:21:08.023 --> 00:21:09.550\nwe're gonna use that structure.\n\n418\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.510\nSo we have that.\n\n419\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.820\nLet's create a relationship\nbetween these two.\n\n420\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.060\nWe're gonna go click on our Create\nRelationship item right up here, and\n\n421\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.430\nwe're then gonna get our little connector.\n\n422\n00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.308\nI'll go full screen so you could see the\nlittle icon hanging at the bottom right\n\n423\n00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.186\nhand corner of my mouse,\nit's got that kind of sideways,\n\n424\n00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:28.750\nknocked off your face,\nhalf-broken glasses looking thing, right?\n\n425\n00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.368\nThe little square and circle icon,\nand as I grab and drag here,\n\n426\n00:21:32.368 --> 00:21:36.650\nyou'll see I can create a connection,\nessentially a relationship.\n\n427\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.064\nYou can see the little doohickey,\n\n428\n00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:41.450\nI don't know what to call it, but the\nlittle squiggly thing underneath my arrow.\n\n429\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.797\nThat is essentially the connector or\nCreate Relationship tool, and\n\n430\n00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:46.940\nI now have my relationship\nbetween the two.\n\n431\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.344\nSo I've gone ahead and said you know,\n\n432\n00:21:50.344 --> 00:21:53.000\nthese two items are going to be related,\nright?\n\n433\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.213\nAnd I wanna make sure that\nwhen they are linked up and\n\n434\n00:21:56.213 --> 00:21:58.930\nset up that I see this relationship.\n\n435\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.399\nNow that I've done this,\nI'm gonna go overhead, go ahead and\n\n436\n00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:05.160\ngo over here to the left and\nI'm gonna click Save.\n\n437\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.602\nSo let's click Save,\nwe'll give this just a minute.\n\n438\n00:22:07.602 --> 00:22:10.724\nTakes a moment or so to save,\nit doesn't take very long but\n\n439\n00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:13.030\nyou just have to be patient with it.\n\n440\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.684\nLet it finish up doing its thing, and then\nonce it is saved we'll then be able to see\n\n441\n00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:21.734\nthe application shut momentarily in\nthe pick list behind this window in\n\n442\n00:22:21.734 --> 00:22:26.122\nthe application, distributed application\narea that we're working with,\n\n443\n00:22:26.122 --> 00:22:28.230\nwe'll see another instance there.\n\n444\n00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.940\nWe may have to refresh to see,\nwe'll wait to find out.\n\n445\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.710\nIt's always a mystery, you never quite-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n446\n00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.420\n&gt;&gt; Whether you'll have to refresh or not.\n\n447\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.530\nBut we'll refresh if we need to.\n\n448\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.040\nAnd then once we're done,\nwe'll close this.\n\n449\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.840\nAnd then we will be able to,\nwhoops, did not mean to do that.\n\n450\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.250\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n451\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.590\nWhen you go to Close,\ndon't close the console, right?\n\n452\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.297\nThat's always a good piece of advice.\n\n453\n00:22:49.297 --> 00:22:50.600\nI hit the wrong x there.\n\n454\n00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.620\nSo let's just get back into where we were,\nlet's go back to Authoring.\n\n455\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.390\nAnd let's go here, you'll see now that\nwe do have our Cherokee app right there.\n\n456\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:04.850\nSo highlight that, and let's right click\nand we know we can do the View diagram.\n\n457\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.900\nAnd when we view our diagram,\nthere is our diagram.\n\n458\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.248\nAnd if we go ahead and\nopen up either Fuchsia and or Green,\n\n459\n00:23:12.248 --> 00:23:17.590\nwe will see whatever instance that we\nhave been asked to take a look at,\n\n460\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.034\nand we'll see information, either there or\n\n461\n00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:27.120\nover here, For\nour Ops Manager Data Warehouse database.\n\n462\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.000\nThat one does have information about it.\n\n463\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.950\nWe see a log file.\n\n464\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.300\nWe see primary databases, all healthy.\n\n465\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.839\n&gt;&gt; A lot better than trying\nto make this out of Paint or\n\n466\n00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:38.115\nsome other kind of [LAUGH],\ntool like that.\n\n467\n00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:41.151\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember these are also\ninteractive, so it's not just making them\n\n468\n00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:43.585\nout of paint and it looks nice, but-\n&gt;&gt; They've done a good job here.\n\n469\n00:23:43.585 --> 00:23:48.452\n&gt;&gt; They're actually, as you could see I'm\ndrilling down into the data table element,\n\n470\n00:23:48.452 --> 00:23:51.102\nand I see that data tables\nare healthy as well.\n\n471\n00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:52.827\nAnd remember we can right-click and\n\n472\n00:23:52.827 --> 00:23:56.732\nwe can interact with information around\nthe diagram here and see what's going on.\n\n473\n00:23:56.732 --> 00:24:01.692\nSo this is a much more powerful\nthing than just having a picture.\n\n474\n00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:04.462\nSo this is very nice, right?\n\n475\n00:24:04.462 --> 00:24:07.698\nIn the sense that now we have\na representation of our application

but\n\n478\n00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:17.000\nwe can also interact if necessary, and\ndo some investigation and monitoring.\n\n479\n00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Microsoft's done a really\ngreat job at showing us how to go ahead\n\n480\n00:24:20.338 --> 00:24:22.220\nand view those distributed applications.\n\n481\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.913\nAnd then thank you, Adam, for\nshowing us how to actually set it up and\n\n482\n00:24:25.913 --> 00:24:28.030\nuse this tool that they've provided.\n\n483\n00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.070\nIs there any final thoughts that you\nhave for this particular demo, or?\n\n484\n00:24:33.588 --> 00:24:37.310\n[LAUGH] All right, throw away the key.\n\n485\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.846\nWell, I think that about covers it for\n\n486\n00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:41.500\nthis particular episode, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n487\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.951\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n488\n00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:46.280\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO TV.\n\n489\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.880\n[MUSIC]\n\n490\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.270\nThank you for watching

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:15.361\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Monitoring and\nOperating a Private Cloud series,\n\n4\n00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.276\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:21.013\nIn this episode you will see\na demonstration on how to configure\n\n6\n00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:25.455\noverrides and with us today we have\nMr Adam Gordon in studios, thank you for\n\n7\n00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.260\njoining us today Adam [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.310\n&gt;&gt; So how you do everybody?\n\n9\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.080\nWe're gonna talk about over, like Cherokee\nwas saying and an override exactly she\n\n10\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.570\ndescribed is going to be something that we\ncall out and say, hey I need this, right?\n\n11\n00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.100\nSomebody help me with this and\nspecifically what the override really\n\n12\n00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.320\nimplies is the idea of taking\nwhat is the standard operational\n\n13\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.490\nthought process in the management\npack Whatever the monitoring is,\n\n14\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.280\ncuz we're gonna overwrite the monitoring,\nwhatever the monitoring that takes place.\n\n15\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.150\nWe're gonna kinda push that to the side\nand say hey normally it's this, but\n\n16\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.360\nlet's do it this other way instead.\n\n17\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.180\nWe're gonna put on top\nof what that monitor is\n\n18\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.510\nsomething different to chain it's behavior\nhence the concept of overwriting it and\n\n19\n00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.130\nthen we're gonna apply that override\nto achieve the desired outcome.\n\n20\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.500\nSo I'm gonna invite you to sit back,\nrelax and\n\n21\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.670\ntake a look, as we walk you\nthrough how to do this, right now.\n\n22\n00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.570\nSo what I've done, is we've gone into\nour Management Pack Objects area,\n\n23\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.240\nwe're still in the Authoring Area, because\nthis is where all of the things we have to\n\n24\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.510\ndo to configure, change, modify, apply,\nsomehow manipulate our objects and\n\n25\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.220\nthe templates that exist for\nmonitoring, are gonna be taking place.\n\n26\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.730\nSo we've been in and\nout of here doing demonstrations for\n\n27\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.830\nyou, have a whole bunch of episodes,\nwhere we go in and\n\n28\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.720\nlook at different aspect of\nthe monitoring pack templates or\n\n29\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.320\nthe management pack templates,\nrather up above distributed applications.\n\n30\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.100\nWe created an application\nin honor of Cherokee and\n\n31\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.480\nwe use that to be able to do\nsome diagrams and monitoring and\n\n32\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.310\nunderstanding of how things work,\nbut now what we're gonna do is\n\n33\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.990\ntake a look specifically at one of the\nmatterson pack objects called monitors.\n\n34\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.970\nRemember all the things that go\ninto matterson packs are called\n\n35\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.305\nmatterson pack objects, so we gotta\na list of here, we've got attributes,\n\n36\n00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:08.412\nwe've got monitors, we've got overrides,\nobject discoveries, rules,\n\n37\n00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:13.312\nservice overtracking, all that stuff,\nwe're gonna look at monitors specifically.\n\n38\n00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:16.800\nI've come and I've gone to the computer\narea over here on the right end,\n\n39\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.850\nwhere I can choose what kind of\nmonitors are available to me, so\n\n40\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.310\nthe computer category MT Health,\nwe're gonna go to availability.\n\n41\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.040\nSo I'm just gonna highlight availability\nhere since it's what we're gonna use and\n\n42\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.460\nwe're going to, you could see,\n\n43\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.480\ncome over here to the far side,\ngo to overrides, click on that.\n\n44\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.810\nAnd then we have the ability to disable\nthe monitor, that would be an override or\n\n45\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.490\nthe kind, but not really an override.\n\n46\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.080\nWe don't really call that an override,\nI mean in theory, in my mind,\n\n47\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.720\nI think of overriding is\nbeing making changes and\n\n48\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.870\ndisabling what's certainly be a kind of\nchange, but most people confuse this.\n\n49\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.020\nDisabling is just that,\n\n50\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.630\ndisabling, turn off the monitor and we\nclassify that differently than overriding.\n\n51\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.910\nSo we also have override the monitor,\nkeep the monitor on but\n\n52\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.200\nmake a change in some way.\n\n53\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.380\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\n\n54\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.460\nwe're gonna override here as you can\nsee and we have some object and or\n\n55\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.300\ngroup information we have to think through\nin our mind and decide how we wanna\n\n56\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.630\noperate with, could we go full screen just\nso you could see this a little better?\n\n57\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.690\nWhile we're talking, you'll see,\nwe can do an override here for\n\n58\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.720\nall objects of the class.\n\n59\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.160\nIn this case, computer and or four group\nor for specific object of class computer,\n\n60\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.010\nthis would be a specific computer,\nmaybe computer one\n\n61\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.360\nversus all objects of the class computer,\nmeaning any and all monitored and\n\n62\n00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.750\npoint set, classified themselves as\ncomputers difference between them, right?\n\n63\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.370\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that,\nwe're gonna choose for\n\n64\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.780\na group, we'll go in and\nthen we'll search for our group here.\n\n65\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.380\nYou can see that we have a whole\nlist of items that are going to be\n\n66\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.670\nconsidered groups,categories of different\ncomputers that we may be able to use.\n\n67\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.050\nWe have SQL Server in here,\n\n68\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.120\nwe have web services in here with some\nIS stuff looking further up we got\n\n69\n00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.930\nthe window server our category that used\nLinux in here we got all sorts of stuff\n\n70\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.800\nthat our categories really just\ndepends on what we want to used.\n\n71\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.550\nWe're gonna used the all\nwindows computer category so\n\n72\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.709\nthat we can get all of the windows\nmachines and override them with this\n\n73\n00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.152\nparticular override we're\ngonna create on this monitor.\n\n74\n00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:19.880\nSo, let me just find all Windows\ncomputers here, we'll scroll down,\n\n75\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.738\nthere we are, all Windows computers,\nwe'll highlight that,we'll click okay,\n\n76\n00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:27.210\nthen we have the ability to go in and\n\n77\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.380\nwe've actually seen this grid before\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n78\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.850\nWe've talked about the fact, I'll just\nmove this over so you can see this,\n\n79\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.780\nwe've talked about the fact that we can\nthen go in and do overrides and go in and\n\n80\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.050\nedit and modify the individual\nproperties here in the grid,\n\n81\n00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.260\nessentially row by row, we could go\nthrough and decide what we want to do.\n\n82\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.680\nWhat we're seeing here\nright now Is the set up or\n\n83\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.440\nessentially the way out of everything\nthat's currently taking place, right?\n\n84\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.550\nAnd what we can do is we get aside to go\ninto any one of these such as highlighted\n\n85\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.780\nrandomly one.\n\n86\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.550\nI think my second one down alert\npriority and just click so\n\n87\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.190\nthat I can enable the ability\nto edit it's override.\n\n88\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.360\nYou may have noticed when we were,\njust look out for a click here and\n\n89\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.080\nwhat all kind of great out of\nwashed up because we we're not or\n\n90\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.360\nhad not decided that we we're gonna\nwork with any one item in particular and\n\n91\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.760\nthe ones above and below are still looking\nlike they're kind of washed out a little\n\n92\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.755\nbit, looking kind of tired\nlike you were saying.\n\n93\n00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:22.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You feel like-\n\n94\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.200\n&gt;&gt; I feel a little washed out too.\n\n95\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.030\n&gt;&gt; So their looking kind of like that\nright, so when we click on one as you can\n\n96\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.660\nsee we highlight it, it becomes\ninteractive, we do put a selection there,\n\n97\n00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.830\njust a little check mark, little card\nindicating hey, you're here right?\n\n98\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.110\nAnd then we've got whatever the parameter\nname is, but what we have is the ability\n\n99\n00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.650\nto see the default value here, so we can\nsee, let's just go full screen, it'll be\n\n100\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.330\na little easier for me to talk to you and\nshow you this while we're doing it.\n\n101\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.350\nYou could say we see default value,\nin this case the default value is low,\n\n102\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.380\nyou'll see that the override\nvalue is specified here.\n\n103\n00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.820\nThe override value mirrors\nthe default value, initially, and\n\n104\n00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.430\nwhat we have to do is specify an override\nvalue, because by default, we don't\n\n105\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.970\nhave an override value until we provide\nsomething different than what's there, so\n\n106\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.310\nwe populate that override value with\nthe default value to specify data or\n\n107\n00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.172\nvalues in the column for us to work\nwith and then we go in to modify that.\n\n108\n00:06:16.172 --> 00:06:17.550\nSo you people often ask, okay,\n\n109\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.170\nwhy are all those override values\nidentical to the default values?\n\n110\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.010\nThey are, specifically because\nthat where we start out from, but\n\n111\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.750\nwe have to make a change and once we do\nthat we will then see that the effective\n\n112\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.630\nvalue column here will be modified\ndepending on the change we make, right?\n\n113\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.710\nSo let's instead of doing low,\nlet's go to hide, right?\n\n114\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.170\nLet's click there, so when we do that we\nhave, yeah, this new custom property, or\n\n115\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.390\nthis new custom override envelope will\nbe created, a not available, right.\n\n116\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.690\nWe have specified, click apply to\nachieve the new effective value for\n\n117\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.640\nthe parameter so we may go in, choose\na little edit here, we may decide to edit\n\n118\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.060\nthe override description, this is just\nthe language associated with the override.\n\n119\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.200\nHey, this is going to do this,\nI'm describing what it is,\n\n120\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.280\nso when somebody sees this,\nthey have a better understanding, right.\n\n121\n00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.480\nSo something like this\nwill allow me to change\n\n122\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.790\nthis from in a low to high,\n\n123\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.810\nwhatever we're doing, just you would write\nsomething in there that's meaningful.\n\n124\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we're just doing that,\n\n125\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.510\nthat's just gonna be our description,\nwe're gonna specify our management pack.\n\n126\n00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.440\nRemember we have to specify\nour management pack because\n\n127\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.390\nwe have to bind this to the management\npack that we want to be able to create or\n\n128\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.490\nuse this override with, so\nthat it overrides the objects in\n\n129\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.880\nthe management pack based on\nwhat we're specifying here, so\n\n130\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.960\nwe have to decide where we're\ngoing to want to put this, right.\n\n131\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.230\nWe do have to enable\nthe override parameter, and\n\n132\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.110\nwe put the check mark in the box,\nI talked to you about that.\n\n133\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.670\nWe do then need to make sure we\nput this onto the specified or\n\n134\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.510\nthe specific override management pack or\nwhatever management pack we're gonna use.\n\n135\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.800\nI'm gonna put this into\nthe client monitoring\n\n136\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.450\noverrides management pack\nright above the default one.\n\n137\n00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.160\nSo, we're gonna use that and then what\nwe're gonna do is, you can almost setup\n\n138\n00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.850\nwhatever our parameters are, whatever we\ndecide that we are going to do, right,\n\n139\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.840\nwhatever it may be or we may override or\ndecide to do a couple of these, whatever\n\n140\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:25.520\nthe case may be, but once we're done,\nclick Okay and we click Apply.\n\n141\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.450\nThen we now have created,\nessentially, an override, right, and\n\n142\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.540\nonce we've done this we then\nare gonna decide that we can\n\n143\n00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.930\nuse this override if necessary\nwhen we do monitoring.\n\n144\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.186\nWe can also take a look potentially at\noverrides that may have been created,\n\n145\n00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:45.630\nwe can go see,\njust give this a second here.\n\n146\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.550\nWe can go see different overrides that may\nbe available or that have been created,\n\n147\n00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.150\nyou'll see we have Management Pack\nObject Type Monitor, Object discovery,\n\n148\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.680\nrecovery and, or rule and so\ndepending on what we did and\n\n149\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.690\nwhere it is, we'd have to go in and take\na look, and we'd have to start looking and\n\n150\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.280\ndelving through all these different items,\nto be able to go and find the override,\n\n151\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.150\nbut our override will be there.\n\n152\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.260\nIf we go all the way through the different\noptions, take a look for it, we'll be\n\n153\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.750\nable to find our override and we will\nactually be able to see evidence of it.\n\n154\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.750\nNow we've talked about it the fact that we\ncan also pull all the overrides out using\n\n155\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.290\nthe System Center Ops Manager shell,\nin other words, PowerShell, right?\n\n156\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.110\nWe could use a PowerShell command\nto be able to pull overrides out,\n\n157\n00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.510\nI talked about this in one of the other\nepisodes and we can actually go in and\n\n158\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.210\nwe can see or get a list of overrides, and\nwe can actually get that from the shell.\n\n159\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.201\nWe can check and validate, yep, it's\nthere, all right or no it's not, there's\n\n160\n00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:41.139\nsomething wrong, we gotta go in, gotta\nmake sure that we did this the right way.\n\n161\n00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:45.175\nSo there's a few different ways to be able\nto look for evidence of overrides that\n\n162\n00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:48.850\nhave been created, because remember,\nyou can see there's probably,\n\n163\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.707\nit's almost 170 overrides just on\nthe management pack type here alone,\n\n164\n00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:55.590\nby the time I got done, so\nit's on 58 on the rules.\n\n165\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.428\nYou got probably almost 340 overrides just\nin the system, more or less by default,\n\n166\n00:10:00.428 --> 00:10:04.137\njust as we install instead of\nmanagement packs let alone what we may\n\n167\n00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:05.148\ndo to customize.\n\n168\n00:10:05.148 --> 00:10:06.270\n&gt;&gt; Your customize rules.\n\n169\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nas we go through to create our own, so\n\n170\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.530\ncould be hundreds of overrides that are\ncreated for you to do a variety of things,\n\n171\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.510\ngetting an authoritative list of them\nis actually gonna be very helpful and\n\n172\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.780\nyou wanna make sure your thinking about\nthat and just have a way of doing that.\n\n173\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.730\nYou can see we could go through and\nbrowse here, but may be hard for\n\n174\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.980\nus to see them here, so we may wanna be\nthinking about the use of PowerShell,\n\n175\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.370\nI'm also just clicking on\nreporting here real quick.\n\n176\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:36.610\nWe can go in inside of\nthe reporting area here and we\n\n177\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.980\ncan also go in and we can take a look at,\ndepending on what we're doing, we can take\n\n178\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.630\na look at either a report that may already\nbe created to show us overwrites in\n\n179\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.510\ncertain monitory areas or I was talked out\nvalue of creating our own report before.\n\n180\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.800\nWe could create a report,\nusing the report designer tool\n\n181\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.740\nthat will let us see overwrites, and\nwe could then pull that data out and\n\n182\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.740\nactually have a list of our answer and\nour ongoing report could be updated.\n\n183\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.970\nWe could actually create a dashboard,\nand use the customization options for\n\n184\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.310\ndashboard creation and perhaps create\na monitor that would show us overrides or\n\n185\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.275\nat least give us a list.\n\n186\n00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:15.980\nJust different options depending on\nwhat we want to do to be able to create\n\n187\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.910\nthe override and work with it, but it's\nimportant for us to be aware of the fact\n\n188\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.220\nthat we can create an override, it's\nimportant for us to know that overrides\n\n189\n00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.050\nare going to allow us to apply changes\nto a management pack that is sealed.\n\n190\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.050\nWe've talked about the different\nkinds of management packs before,\n\n191\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.330\njust while we're doing this, let me bring\nmanagement packs back up real quick.\n\n192\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.140\nRemember, we applied this to the client\nmonitoring overrides management pack,\n\n193\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.290\nthat's the managed pack I chose to apply\nmy override to, it is an open management\n\n194\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.660\npack, what we call an unsealed\nmanagement pack, it's there by default,\n\n195\n00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.310\nit's imported into the system to give\nus a place to put our overrides, but\n\n196\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.790\nwe can also apply these\noverrides to some other ones.\n\n197\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.530\nThe default management pack,\nothers that maybe available to us,\n\n198\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.220\nso we're taking the idea of what's in\nan existing management pack and existing\n\n199\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.660\nmonitor and then we're gonna modify it and\nthen store those changes override\n\n200\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.890\nin another management pack creating,\neither you're gonna combined the two and\n\n201\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.690\nthen generates something\nthat is gonna work for us.\n\n202\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.860\nAnd we may have to create a separate\nunsealed management pack for us to be\n\n203\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.250\nable to do that or use the few that\nare provided automatically out of the box.\n\n204\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.760\nThe choice is up to us and that's\nobviously gonna be something you'll figure\n\n205\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.600\nout in the real world based on the best\nway for you to approach that in your\n\n206\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.640\nbusiness but we've shown you how to create\na management pack will not be hard to do\n\n207\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.700\nand just by way of demonstration just\nspecifically to show you something.\n\n208\n00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.260\nJust to remind you this management pack\nright here, create management pack.\n\n209\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.310\nIt's very simple to do,\n\n210\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.090\nit's going to be a unsealed management\npack where it's gonna give it a name.\n\n211\n00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:50.091\nLet's call this ops or actually let's use\nA so it comes on the top of the list, so\n\n212\n00:12:50.091 --> 00:12:55.057\nwe'll call it A ops Manage\n\n213\n00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:59.118\npack overrider, right?\n\n214\n00:12:59.118 --> 00:13:04.070\nAnd all we have to do is give it a name,\nclick there, we're\n\n215\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.230\nnot gonna bother with any description or\ndocumentation on the knowledge tab,\n\n216\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.440\nthat would just be, hey, this management\npack overrides being used for.\n\n217\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.300\nSo, we'd just be narrating, we're not\ngonna bother with that right now,\n\n218\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.280\nwe'll just click Create here,\nas soon as that is, it's already there,\n\n219\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.120\nyou can see it there.\n\n220\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.100\nWhat we then can do, if we wanted to\ngo back here and have an option or\n\n221\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.830\nhave the ability,\nthink I actually put a period in there or\n\n222\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.960\na comma, have the ability to go\nback here and be able to use this.\n\n223\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.010\nLet's just say we go back here to\nthe monitors one more time and\n\n224\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.970\nwe go back here to\ncomputers one more time.\n\n225\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.982\nSo let's just scroll down to\nwhere we were just a minute ago,\n\n226\n00:13:40.982 --> 00:13:44.171\nwe just didn't see all the different\ncategories over there, so\n\n227\n00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:48.247\nit already select the computers, but let's\njust scroll down back here to where we\n\n228\n00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:51.107\nwere back through the 5,000\ninstances with cards.\n\n229\n00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:54.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or we get to computers, all right, so\n\n230\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.500\nthere we are right there, so we get to\ncomputer, and we'll just open this up real\n\n231\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.670\nquick, open up into the health the way we\nwere just doing, open up availability just\n\n232\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.360\none more time, right click,\nyou see we do an override right here.\n\n233\n00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.150\nWe don't have to necessarily go to\nthe right hand side we've pointed out and\n\n234\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.140\nCherokee has pointed out\nas I've been doing this.\n\n235\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.030\nHey, more than one way to do that,\nabsolutely, it's all the same,\n\n236\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.200\nwe're just operating on the object so\nwhether we do it from a right click or\n\n237\n00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.240\nwe go off to the right to the task area,\nwe get to the same place,\n\n238\n00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.650\nit's up to you, just a question\nof what you are in the mood for\n\n239\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.190\nand or where you feel more comfortable.\n\n240\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.838\nSo we'll go ahead and we will do\na group again and we will go ahead and\n\n241\n00:14:28.838 --> 00:14:33.984\nwill choose all Windows computers,\njust one more time, just click OK and\n\n242\n00:14:33.984 --> 00:14:39.471\nthen we have already got that you will\nsee the couple that I have there, right?\n\n243\n00:14:39.471 --> 00:14:43.605\nAnd we can I actually instead of doing\nthat want to set that one ,edit that one\n\n244\n00:14:43.605 --> 00:14:48.129\nforgot already did that I want to create a\nnew one assignment to the other management\n\n245\n00:14:48.129 --> 00:14:52.357\npacks, it's on me to override, but\nlet me overwrite for a different group.\n\n246\n00:14:52.357 --> 00:14:58.290\nAnd just do there,\nwe'll do data bases and let's go ahead,\n\n247\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.000\nlet's just select something, again we're\nnot worried about what we're overwriting\n\n248\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.290\nright now, I just wanna show you the idea\nthat since we created the management pack\n\n249\n00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.300\nthat is open you'll see that we\nhave an unsealed management pack.\n\n250\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.500\nIf we go full stream,\nyou can see them selecting, or\n\n251\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.512\nabout to select, my own management\npack that I just created there,\n\n252\n00:15:14.512 --> 00:15:18.530\nA OPS Manager Pack Override,\nor whatever, these are all\n\n253\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.550\nthe management packs that are unsealed\nthat we can store our overrides in.\n\n254\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.130\nSo, if we create a new one, it's easy for\n\n255\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.030\nus to then bind to that or\nwe can use one of the existing ones.\n\n256\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.570\nNow, the default management pack is\nconsidered in unsealed management pack,\n\n257\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.155\nwe could store stuff there, but\nwe also have one specific overrides.\n\n258\n00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:39.290\nClient monitoring override management\npack the one I selected first and\n\n259\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.850\nwe could do either one those or\ncreate our own and\n\n260\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.410\nthen we just name it accordingly and\nwe know what it is.\n\n261\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.180\nSo it's up to us to decide\nultimately whether or\n\n262\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.630\nnot we want to use the specific\nmanagement pack or\n\n263\n00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.300\nonce we figured out what management\npack we wanna be able to do.\n\n264\n00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.660\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe can enable this, set it up,\n\n265\n00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.370\nspecify it's gonna be true and then turn\non whatever other options we may want and\n\n266\n00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.850\nwe're off to the raises and\nwe're set to go, okay.\n\n267\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.040\nSo, just keep that in mind,\nwe are not going to save our changes,\n\n268\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.450\ncuz we don't care about that one and\nthat's how we will create an override,\n\n269\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.000\nwe'll just keep going through\nthat credits override as we need.\n\n270\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, Configuring Overrides 101,\nthank you so much, Adam for showing us how\n\n271\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.560\nto walk through that step-by-step process\nand thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n272\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.150\nfor tuning in, but stay tuned, we have\nmore demonstrations headed your way.\n\n273\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.230\nFor this show, we'll go ahead and\nsign out, remember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n274\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n275\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.498\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n276\n00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:39.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n277\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.167\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

your show host Cherokee Boose In\nthis episode we'll be\n\n6\n00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:20.880\nlooking at how to optimize\nyour cloud environment.\n\n7\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.910\nAnd with us today we have\nMr Adam Gordon in studio.\n\n8\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.980\n&gt;&gt; Good morning, hello everybody,\ngood afternoon, good day.\n\n10\n00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.887\n&gt;&gt; Wherever you are.\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you may be doing,\n\n11\n00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.500\nwherever you are hopefully you're well.\n\n12\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.910\nWe're gonna continue talking here about\nprivate cloud monitoring optimization.\n\n13\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.170\nAs Cherokee said is the name\nof this particular discussion,\n\n14\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.360\nmeaning we're to take a look at a set\nof technologies, different areas,\n\n15\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.680\ndifferent products,\ndifferent thought processes.\n\n16\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.110\nBut how we can tweak our\nperformance a little bit,\n\n17\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.670\nmake it that much better by doing\nsomething, enabling something,\n\n18\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.270\nsetting something up, and or combining\nour ability to monitor with another\n\n19\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.550\nproduct's stream that allows us then to\nengage in activities that make us better.\n\n20\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.670\nNot just optimizing but\n\n21\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.385\nalso making sure we're up to date\nfrom security patching stand point.\n\n22\n00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:08.585\nAnd put on the talked about that whole\nidea of WSUS, how we use that or\n\n23\n00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:14.365\nimmigrate that with the VMM and\nalso in system center\n\n24\n00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:18.687\nconfig manager to be able to do patching\nand patch management keep us up to date.\n\n25\n00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:22.767\nOn the host side as well as\non the virtual machine side,\n\n26\n00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:26.337\ncuz we have to take a slightly different\ntact and approach for patching in each\n\n27\n00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:29.147\narea depending on what we're doing and\nwhat product we're gonna patch through.\n\n28\n00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:32.417\nSo we'll talk through that, make sure you\nguys are comfortable with that whole idea.\n\n29\n00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:37.147\nSo let's begin, if we can, by talking a\nlittle bit about this idea of how we keep\n\n30\n00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:38.927\nvirtual machine infrastructure up to date.\n\n31\n00:01:38.927 --> 00:01:41.447\nThis idea I was just talking\nabout of patch management,\n\n32\n00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:45.270\nwhat we do, how we do it,\nhopefully you're familiar with the idea\n\n33\n00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.460\nof using the Windows Software Update\nService, what we just referred to as WSUS\n\n34\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.740\nto be able to do patch management\ngenerically in your infrastructure.\n\n35\n00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130\nMost of us I'm sure probably have one or\n\n36\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.180\nmore of these servers running\noutside in our network somewhere,\n\n37\n00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.920\ndownloading patches from a central\nrepository that Microsoft maintains.\n\n38\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.340\nAnd as a result of that,\nthen, sending them up, and\n\n39\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.640\nbeing able to use that as a launching pad,\na staging area for\n\n40\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.410\npatching throughout the organization,\nthroughout the enterprise.\n\n41\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.060\nAnd this is an ongoing thought process,\nthis happens on a monthly basis,\n\n42\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.570\ntraditionally.\n\n43\n00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.320\nWe're probably all familiar\nwith patch Tuesday, right?\n\n44\n00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.660\nAnd the idea that Microsoft, and\nall vendors, not just Microsoft, but\n\n45\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.590\nwe're here specifically talking about\nMicrosoft's infrastructure right now,\n\n46\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.510\nVMware does this the same way.\n\n47\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.240\nCisco does this, Oracle does this.\n\n48\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.630\nAny major vendor will\ndo something like this,\n\n49\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.595\nwhere they are putting out patches on\na more or less regular announced schedule.\n\n50\n00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:42.685\nWe may be entering patches,\nwhen there's an issue or a concern,\n\n51\n00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:47.175\nyou know a highly problematic or\nvery, very involved security issue.\n\n52\n00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:48.655\nMake it an our of cycle patch, but\n\n53\n00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:51.965\ntraditionally we'll have some sort of\nregulatory schedule we can rely on.\n\n54\n00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:56.325\nWe will download from one or more central\nwebsites that we can than use to catalog\n\n55\n00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.935\nand build up a library of updates,\nand we'll than be able to\n\n56\n00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:02.745\nsend those updates out using a variety\nof different technologies and\n\n57\n00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.780\nmethods to various endpoints\nin our organization.\n\n58\n00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.250\nAnd this is a process that's\nbeen going on for years.\n\n59\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.470\nAnd so hopefully that part's\nnot new to any of you.\n\n60\n00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.270\nAnd if it is new to you, we're gonna\nwalk through, not in this episode, but\n\n61\n00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.650\nin some upcoming episodes on the hands-on\npieces, we're gonna walk through\n\n62\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.130\nhow to set up WSUS, and show you, start\nto finish how to stand up WSUS, install\n\n63\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.780\nit as a feature set, configure it, set\nup the sync, build the content library.\n\n64\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.340\nAnd then actually push deployments out,\nso you'll get to see all of that, but\n\n65\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.970\nyou'll get to see that with a cloud twist.\n\n66\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.530\nWe are going to then link that\nin to SCCM and bring that in so\n\n67\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.045\nwe can show you using\na software update point.\n\n68\n00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:41.555\nhow to do that integration to do patch\nmanagement for a managed endpoint.\n\n69\n00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:44.975\nWe're also going to\nintegrate it with SCVMM,\n\n70\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:48.555\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\nour cloud fabric manager for\n\n71\n00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.965\nour private cloud that we've been\ntalking about in system center.\n\n72\n00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:53.475\nWe're going to integrate it there and\ndeal with and\n\n73\n00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:56.545\ntalk about how we do\nthe patching on the host side.\n\n74\n00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:58.615\nVMM is really all about\ntaking care of the hosts,\n\n75\n00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:03.460\nthe underlying physical machines that\nare providing the infrastructure for\n\n76\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.260\nrunning our guest operating systems or\nVMs.\n\n77\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.770\nAnd ICCM is gonna be able to\ndeal with the guest OS' or\n\n78\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.360\nVMs that are running on top of our host.\n\n79\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.720\nSo we're gonna split our\npatching between those two and\n\n80\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.710\nwe're gonna talk about how\nto integrate Integrate both.\n\n81\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.440\nSo let me just walk you through\nthe slot process to show you\n\n82\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.090\nsome of the little underlying areas and\nsecrets you wanna be aware of.\n\n83\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.170\nAnd we'll build this out more fully in\nan upcoming episode where we do a complete\n\n84\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.220\nset of walk-throughs and so.\n\n85\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.100\nIf you could join me here in the console.\n\n86\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.000\nWe'll take a look real quick.\n\n87\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.480\nSo what we're gonna start out with is\nwe're on our virtual machine management,\n\n88\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.490\nyou probably see that\nright at the top there.\n\n89\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.210\nHopefully this interface looks\nfamiliar to you by this point in time.\n\n90\n00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.570\nWe certainly been out here quite a bit.\n\n91\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.330\n&gt;&gt; It sure does.\n\n92\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.160\n&gt;&gt; If it doesn't,\nyou may want to start going back and\n\n93\n00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.100\nlook at some prior episodes to see\n&gt;&gt; Have a said to what we're doing, but\n\n94\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.280\nthis our Virtual Machine Manager Console.\n\n95\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.270\nI'm in the fabric of work\nspace just since we're we are.\n\n96\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.110\nWe're over here under infrastructure and\nI've got a list of\n\n97\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.735\nall my different servers that\nI could work with by category.\n\n98\n00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:57.295\n&gt;&gt; My VMM server is here.\n\n99\n00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.875\nAnd obviously our server we're connected\nthe consol to will be listed there.\n\n100\n00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.535\nIf I've integrated vCenter and\nI'm working with vCenter,\n\n101\n00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:06.095\nwe'll talk about that\nintegration in other areas.\n\n102\n00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:08.245\nWe'll have vCenter instance there.\n\n103\n00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:12.845\nWe'll have our Pixy servers there if we're\ndoing Pixy booting so we can support that.\n\n104\n00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:17.260\nOur library servers are listed here so\nwhen we set up our storage fabric,\n\n105\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.530\nwe did a whole hands on episode\nabout how to set that up and\n\n106\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.940\nwalk you through start to finish.\n\n107\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.440\nHow to do storage and integrate\na Windows file share for storage.\n\n108\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.830\nTalked about the different\nother options there.\n\n109\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.760\nThe fiber option using SAN or\nNAS, so if you haven't seen\n\n110\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.050\nthat episode you'd probably be\ngood to go back and watch that.\n\n111\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.570\nThere's actually a part one,\npart two, right?\n\n112\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.050\nBecause we did that,\nwe also did the network fabric\n\n113\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.190\nas a secondary hands on\nwalk-through there as well.\n\n114\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.390\nSo Setting up all\nthe underlying infrastructure,\n\n115\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.250\nwe've gone through that, but\nwe'd see that as library service here.\n\n116\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.450\nWhat we're focused on is the update server\npiece which is highlighted right there and\n\n117\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.390\nyou notice I don't have any service\nin my updates server, an area,\n\n118\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.720\nI've got the icon, but\nthere's nothing there.\n\n119\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.200\nCuz I haven't gone out and\nintegrated a WSUS server yet.\n\n120\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.260\nWhat I have to do out of the box,\nin other words, there's nothing there.\n\n121\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.070\nWe don't know what the WSUS\nserver infrastructure looks like,\n\n122\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.250\nwe don't know what\nthe named distances are.\n\n123\n00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.450\nHow many of the you have,\nwhich one of them you would want to use.\n\n124\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.940\nThere are some different\noptions with WSUS architecture.\n\n125\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.190\nYou may set up a WSUS server\nin the DMZ to act as a central\n\n126\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.840\nmagnet to pull down all of those options,\nall those packages, all those updates,\n\n127\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.000\nall those things that you would need for\nMicrosoft from the central download site.\n\n128\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.140\nAnd then from there,\nyou may stream them into internal\n\n129\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.420\nWSUS servers that are protected\nbehind the firewall.\n\n130\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.790\nThen you may use those by geography,\nby region, by VLAN,\n\n131\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.460\nby subnet, by different areas\ndepending on what you are are doing.\n\n132\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.630\nDo there's different\nways wsus may be set up.\n\n133\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.680\nYou may, in other words,\nnot directly have just simply\n\n134\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.930\none WSUS server in your architecture,\nyou may have multiple.\n\n135\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.660\nWe wouldn't know which one to connect to.\n\n136\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.640\nSo we're going to go out,\nwe have a little right click option here.\n\n137\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.680\nAdd update server.\n\n138\n00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.450\nIt's very straight forward, it's a wizard.\n\n139\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.998\nWe put in our computer name for\nwhatever the WSUS instance will be.\n\n140\n00:06:57.998 --> 00:07:01.260\nWe want to connect to, what port\nare we using to connect out there.\n\n141\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.230\nFor the WSUS server what\nthe administrative credential will be.\n\n142\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.180\nTalked about the importance of run\nas accounts in prior episodes.\n\n143\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.290\nYou'll hopefully be able to\nreference which one you may use.\n\n144\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.500\nWe've shown you how to do that,\nhow to build out those run as accounts and\n\n145\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.415\nlink them to profiles and\ncreate user roles to support them.\n\n146\n00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.760\nWalk through all that in prior episodes.\n\n147\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.120\nWe have a separate domain based user\nname credential that's specific to SUS,\n\n148\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.520\nwe put that in here as\nopposed to a run as account.\n\n149\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.340\nWe would enable if we choose to SSL so\n\n150\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.980\nwe can encrypt that communication and\nsecure it.\n\n151\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.920\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe'll run an initial synchronization.\n\n152\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.590\nNow it does tell us down here that\ninitial synchronization is, and\n\n153\n00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.720\nthis is an understatement,\njust to be clear.\n\n154\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.580\nA long-running operation, is what it says.\n\n155\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.935\nThis totally depends on the size of the\ncatalog for all of these software updates\n\n156\n00:07:46.935 --> 00:07:51.486\nand patches that you are gonna have a WSUS\nthat you have to bring in and synchronize.\n\n157\n00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:56.094\nSo understand that if you have several\ngigabytes of data sitting out there in\n\n158\n00:07:56.094 --> 00:08:00.638\nWSUS all ready, we're gonna replicate\nthat data in here To synchronize.\n\n159\n00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:03.729\nSo this could take a while,\nand just be aware of that.\n\n160\n00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:06.395\n&gt;&gt; You might wanna consider your\nbandwidth capabilities as well, so\n\n161\n00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:08.200\nyou're not slowing your network down.\n\n162\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, bandwidth should be on\na well connected, low latency network, so\n\n163\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.640\nthat's gonna be very important.\n\n164\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.960\nAnd Cherokee's right to point that out,\nbecause we could actually\n\n165\n00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.720\ncause a problem with communications\nhere if we're not careful, right.\n\n166\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.273\nAnd that can lead to an issue with\nour MOM and MOM Management or\n\n167\n00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:25.722\nMOM Agent Updates coming in if we're on.\n\n168\n00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:28.012\nNetworks that perhaps don't\nhave reliable bandwidth,\n\n169\n00:08:28.012 --> 00:08:30.784\nthis may not be the right thing to\ndo during normal production hours.\n\n170\n00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:34.075\nIt pushes off to a service window or\nmaintenance window activities.\n\n171\n00:08:34.075 --> 00:08:36.176\nSo, there are different\nthings to consider here.\n\n172\n00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:40.054\nSo we would set all this up and\nthen we would let these cook for a while.\n\n173\n00:08:40.054 --> 00:08:43.266\nKeep in mind with WSUS that it's\nnot just security patches and\n\n174\n00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:44.700\nupdates that we download.\n\n175\n00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.840\nAlthough traditionally that's\nthe main thing we think about.\n\n176\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.053\nBut we also have the ability\nto update products and\n\n177\n00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:51.540\ndrivers that are put out from\ntime to time by Microsoft.\n\n178\n00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.858\nThere's an extensive catalog of options\nthere when we set up WSUS as well as\n\n179\n00:08:55.858 --> 00:08:57.033\nlanguage formats.\n\n180\n00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:00.869\nBecause for every patch we put\nout there are 15, I think,\n\n181\n00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:03.645\nsupported language forms that we can use.\n\n182\n00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:07.939\nThere's Chinese, there's French, there's\nRussian, German, Spanish, English, etc.\n\n183\n00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:10.880\nThere are all the supported\nlanguages we support.\n\n184\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.710\nThose patches are made available for\nall those languages.\n\n185\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.130\nIf you are running\na multi-lingual environment.\n\n186\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.462\nGlobally, we're supporting\ndifferent operating systems,\n\n187\n00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:21.798\nin different operating environments\nin multiple languages.\n\n188\n00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:24.573\nFrom centralized infrastructure,\nyou may have four or\n\n189\n00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:27.649\nfive copies of each of those\npatches in different languages.\n\n190\n00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:28.810\nThat you're downloading and synchronizing.\n\n191\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.489\nSo, you do need to understand and\nbe aware of that.\n\n192\n00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:35.483\nYou also would want to take into account\nthe fact that by region and by geography,\n\n193\n00:09:35.483 --> 00:09:37.848\nif you're splitting\nthis infrastructure up.\n\n194\n00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:40.156\nAnd you're running different instances and\n\n195\n00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:42.899\nregions based on language\nas one of the key criteria.\n\n196\n00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:45.505\nYou'd have to sync to\nthe appropriate WSUS server.\n\n197\n00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:47.775\nTo pull down the appropriate\nlanguage packs and\n\n198\n00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:50.393\nthe appropriate language\nversions of those updates.\n\n199\n00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:54.188\nOr you would wind up with your English\nupdates being replicated out to your\n\n200\n00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:56.953\nFrench infrastructure or\nSpanish infrastructure.\n\n201\n00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:58.115\nWhatever it may be.\n\n202\n00:09:58.115 --> 00:10:01.159\nAnd that's not gonna work, because you\nwon't be able to apply those updates and\n\n203\n00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.291\nit won't work the right way.\n\n204\n00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:02.919\n&gt;&gt; No bueno.\n\n205\n00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:04.165\n&gt;&gt; No bueno, exactly.\n\n206\n00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:06.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You gotta do this though, no bueno,\n\n207\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.870\nyou gotta do the hands.\n\n208\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.180\nSo that would be bad, so\nyou wanna make sure you're thinking.\n\n209\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.512\nThere are a lot of small and\nsubtle items, in other words,\n\n210\n00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.100\nwhat I'm trying to convey to you.\n\n211\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.357\nThat have to be planned for and\n\n212\n00:10:15.357 --> 00:10:17.630\nthought through as we stand\nthis infrastructure up.\n\n213\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.525\nIt's not as simple as saying, I'm just\ngonna go in, connect to my WSUS server.\n\n214\n00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:25.620\nCheck off a couple boxes, wait a few hours\nfor it to all show up, and I'm good.\n\n215\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.370\nThere's a lot more to it than that, right?\n\n216\n00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.680\nSo we've shown you the integration\nhere on the VMM side.\n\n217\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.180\nWhat I wanna do, is I wanna go in and\nI wanna show you, just quickly,\n\n218\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.840\nwhat we do on the config manager side,\nto integrate that.\n\n219\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.600\nI'm gonna show you that\nconsole in just a minute.\n\n220\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.540\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe'll have both sides of the divide here.\n\n221\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.940\nWe'll be able to see or get a sense of\nhow we're gonna start doing the patching.\n\n222\n00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.227\nBefore we go do that, however,\n\n223\n00:10:49.227 --> 00:10:51.433\nlet me just show you one other\nlittle thing right here.\n\n224\n00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.711\nSo when we go to our library work space,\nlet's assume for\n\n225\n00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:54.950\na minute we'll fast forward.\n\n226\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.430\nAnd we've set up our integration,\nand we've got that all cooking.\n\n227\n00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.136\nWhat we'll then get is this area here of\nupdate catalog baselines in our library.\n\n228\n00:11:03.136 --> 00:11:04.042\nAnd we can open this up.\n\n229\n00:11:04.042 --> 00:11:07.442\nNow, right now this is blank, because\nwe don't have any update baselines or\n\n230\n00:11:07.442 --> 00:11:08.448\nan update catalogue.\n\n231\n00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:11.010\nWe haven't set up the WSUS integration,\nas you've seen.\n\n232\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.380\nWe haven't done the sync yet.\n\n233\n00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.692\nWe will do that in our upcoming\nepisode where we walk through, but\n\n234\n00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:18.715\nwhat will get is two baselines\nthat will be dropped in here.\n\n235\n00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:22.087\nWe'll have a sample baseline for\ncritical updates and a sample baseline for\n\n236\n00:11:22.087 --> 00:11:22.994\nsecurity updates.\n\n237\n00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:25.241\nThat will show up here\nonce we do the sync.\n\n238\n00:11:25.241 --> 00:11:28.110\nThese come from the WSUS server.\n\n239\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.424\nWe'll get those set up.\n\n240\n00:11:29.424 --> 00:11:33.023\nAnd then we'll be able to use those\nas templates to run through and\n\n241\n00:11:33.023 --> 00:11:35.323\ndo an assessment on our infrastructure.\n\n242\n00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:38.566\nAnd decide whether or not the\ninfrastructure has the patches it needs.\n\n243\n00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:42.450\nOr if we're out of compliance\nwe then can do some remediation.\n\n244\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.330\nThe trick is we gotta be\nupdating those base lines\n\n245\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.840\nas we add new patches to the catalog\nbecause they don't auto update.\n\n246\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.350\nSo we have to add in and\n\n247\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.520\naugment those baselines over\ntime from our update catalogue.\n\n248\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.500\nThis is where we're gonna see all the sync\nupdates that come in, but be listed here.\n\n249\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.063\nAnd if you're familiar with SUS and\nyou use it or administer it,\n\n250\n00:11:59.063 --> 00:12:00.973\nyou know the general thought process,\nright.\n\n251\n00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:03.480\nYou've got these areas where\nwe build out all the patches.\n\n252\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.013\nAnd then we've got the baselines,\neither ones that are standardized, or\n\n253\n00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:07.976\nthe ones we create.\n\n254\n00:12:07.976 --> 00:12:10.968\nAnd then we have to add patches\ninto them and refresh and\n\n255\n00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:14.101\nthen reapply that baseline\nover time to keep it current.\n\n256\n00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.722\nAnd to continue to do the monitoring and\n\n257\n00:12:15.722 --> 00:12:17.847\nultimately the remediation\nthat may be required.\n\n258\n00:12:17.847 --> 00:12:20.131\nAs we roll through and\nupdate those hosts or\n\n259\n00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:22.960\nwhatever the target\nendpoints are over time.\n\n260\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.630\nSo we'll build out this part of the\ninfrastructure after we do the connection\n\n261\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.440\nand we get the initial sync up.\n\n262\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.670\nSo you'll see that populate,\n\n263\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.570\nthat's where we'll go to manage our\nupdating capabilities through VM.\n\n264\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.500\nAnd this part of the puzzle is gonna deal\nwith remediating and managing, as I said,\n\n265\n00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.930\nand patching hosts.\n\n266\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:44.466\nNow remember, hosts typically\nwill run in or as Hyper-V hosts.\n\n267\n00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:46.590\nAnd they are running.\n\n268\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.014\nBecause what I mean to say is, typically\nwe'll have a Hyper-V host cluster.\n\n269\n00:12:50.014 --> 00:12:53.280\nThat we will be using to manage our\nvirtual machine infrastructure.\n\n270\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.245\nIn other words, we don't tend to just\nrun one VM or two VMs on a single host.\n\n271\n00:12:57.245 --> 00:12:59.425\nWe could, but\nit's a very small environment.\n\n272\n00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:02.995\nIn large scale enterprises,\nwe're clustering hosts together and\n\n273\n00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:05.515\nwe're then gonna use VMM\nto manage those hosts.\n\n274\n00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:10.157\nBut they're put together, we may have five\nor ten hosts running 50 or 100 VMs and\n\n275\n00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:12.363\nwe would call that a host group cluster.\n\n276\n00:13:12.363 --> 00:13:17.259\nAnd so in that cluster, the way we do\npatching through here, through VMM.\n\n277\n00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:23.053\nIs we patch one host at a time, and we\nmove synchronously through that cluster.\n\n278\n00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:26.316\nSo what we have to understand and\nbe aware of here,\n\n279\n00:13:26.316 --> 00:13:28.894\nis that our cluster, is going to take.\n\n280\n00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:31.768\nLet's say if we had five machines,\njust to keep it simple,\n\n281\n00:13:31.768 --> 00:13:33.041\none of the hosts at a time.\n\n282\n00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.142\nWe're gonna post that host\ninto maintenance mode.\n\n283\n00:13:35.142 --> 00:13:38.369\nPutting it into maintenance as we've\ntalked about in other areas implies\n\n284\n00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:41.180\nthe host cannot provide\nresources to virtual machines.\n\n285\n00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.330\nCannot spin up or do anything new,\ncannot host any new work loads.\n\n286\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.900\nIn other words,\nessentially it's unavailable.\n\n287\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.507\nIt's offline for all intents and\n\n288\n00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:51.381\npurposes we're going to work\nwith it outside the cluster.\n\n289\n00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:55.205\nWe effectively take it down, remove it\nfrom the cluster, patch it put it back.\n\n290\n00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.513\nThat's not the hard part.\n\n291\n00:13:56.513 --> 00:13:59.896\nThe thing we gotta be aware of and\nkeep in mind here with this.\n\n292\n00:13:59.896 --> 00:14:02.139\nIs as we are running through\nthe cluster patching.\n\n293\n00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:06.474\nWe have to be migrating those VMs\nthat are running, those guest OSs,\n\n294\n00:14:06.474 --> 00:14:07.900\noff of that host.\n\n295\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.000\nSo we have to support live migration.\n\n296\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.860\nLive migration, remember, is the ability\nto move the running virtual machine\n\n297\n00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.840\ninstance in realtime to another host.\n\n298\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.880\nSo we're taking it from host one.\n\n299\n00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.578\nWe're moving it without shutting\nit off without loss of continuity.\n\n300\n00:14:19.578 --> 00:14:24.460\nTo host two, runs on host two, and\nthen host one can be patch managed, and\n\n301\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.750\nwhatever we need to do.\n\n302\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.320\nSo the act of putting a host\ninto maintenance mode\n\n303\n00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.390\nis gonna involve live migrating.\n\n304\n00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.310\nJust so that in our mind\nwe're making that connection.\n\n305\n00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.656\nWhen we live migrate, hello.\n\n306\n00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:36.176\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n&gt;&gt; When we live migrate,\n\n307\n00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.770\n[LAUGH] we'll let Cherokee\njump in here in just a sec.\n\n308\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.380\nShe's waving to me because\nshe wants to ask a question.\n\n309\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.650\nSo when we live migrate,\nwhat we do is we're moving those VMs over.\n\n310\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.820\nAs long as we support live migration\nin the cluster, no big deal.\n\n311\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.350\nWe'll move them over.\n\n312\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.570\nWe'll essentially collapse those\nVMs onto one of the other hosts.\n\n313\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.540\nWe'll go through, patch our hosts, bring\nit back up, add it back into the cluster,\n\n314\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.810\ncome out of maintenance mode.\n\n315\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.630\nThen the VMs will live migrate through\nother hosts as we go sequentially\n\n316\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.550\none at a time.\n\n317\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.160\nEventually we'll have\nthe whole cluster patch.\n\n318\n00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.170\nNo problem, this is all gonna be managed\nby VMM and we could automate this process.\n\n319\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.696\nUse Orchestrator, set up a work flow,\ndo all sorts of great stuff.\n\n320\n00:15:12.696 --> 00:15:14.226\nIt's not difficult to do,\n\n321\n00:15:14.226 --> 00:15:17.694\ncould even kick it off with\nPowerShell through the VMM shell.\n\n322\n00:15:17.694 --> 00:15:20.400\nAnd we could set this whole thing up and\nautomate it if we want to.\n\n323\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.439\nThe trick is, however, depending on\nthe nature of the cluster we run.\n\n324\n00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:28.175\nNow with new technology, with Server\n12 R2, Hyper-V running on 12 R2.\n\n325\n00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:31.907\nOr even go ahead to Server 16 if\nwe're thinking in to the future here.\n\n326\n00:15:31.907 --> 00:15:36.542\nWith SVMM 2012 R2,\nwith System Center Config Manager 2012 R2.\n\n327\n00:15:36.542 --> 00:15:37.778\nIf everything's up to date and\n\n328\n00:15:37.778 --> 00:15:40.590\nrunning on the most recent versions\nof our infrastructure platform.\n\n329\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.833\nWe're not going to have an issue\nwith supporting live migration.\n\n330\n00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:47.162\nBut if you have older clusters in place\nthat may not support live migration,\n\n331\n00:15:47.162 --> 00:15:49.290\nwe actually take a different approach.\n\n332\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.072\nPut the host into maintenance mode,\nwe can't live migrate to VM,\n\n333\n00:15:52.072 --> 00:15:53.520\nwe can't move it off in real time.\n\n334\n00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.917\nWe save the config and\nshut it down in order to patch.\n\n335\n00:15:56.917 --> 00:16:00.208\nSo those VMs get turned off, and you gotta\nbe aware of that because That may not be\n\n336\n00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:03.403\nwhat you want in production, so you\ngotta be thinking about monitoring, and\n\n337\n00:16:03.403 --> 00:16:06.159\noptimizing, and interacting\nwithin your maintenance windows,\n\n338\n00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:07.810\nwe call them service windows, right?\n\n339\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.780\nAnd Microsoft hasn't\ntalked about it before.\n\n340\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.570\nBut in the industry generically,\nwe refer to them as maintenance windows.\n\n341\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.500\nSo within that agreed upon\noutage period based on your SLAs\n\n342\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.425\nthat you're gonna operate within,\nyou wanna be doing this and thinking about\n\n343\n00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:23.700\nthe fact you may be impacting service\non VMs by having to turn them off.\n\n344\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.089\nIf you are not able to live migrate them,\nand that's something to think about,\n\n345\n00:16:27.089 --> 00:16:30.529\nplan for, and be aware of cuz we'll do\nit for you, meaning we'll turn them off,\n\n346\n00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:33.735\nsave the config, and then bring them\nback up afterwards when we're done.\n\n347\n00:16:33.735 --> 00:16:37.942\nSo, just wanna think about some of the\nsubtlety going on here as we get ready to\n\n348\n00:16:37.942 --> 00:16:41.694\nflip over to the SCCM side and\ntake a look at how we stand up WSUS there,\n\n349\n00:16:41.694 --> 00:16:43.742\nintegrate it with our SCCM console.\n\n350\n00:16:43.742 --> 00:16:47.218\nAnd I'll show you how to push the SCCM\nclient out as a software update through\n\n351\n00:16:47.218 --> 00:16:50.700\nWSUS as part of that really quick,\nwe'll talk about that option as well.\n\n352\n00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.770\n&gt;&gt; I didn't really have a question, Adam.\n\n353\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.313\nJust, I wanted to stress the important\nof what you were saying,\n\n354\n00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:57.735\nbecause that's the beauty of\nsetting up clusters, right?\n\n355\n00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:03.342\nWe don't wanna be taking an independent\nmachine down to deploy updates.\n\n356\n00:17:03.342 --> 00:17:07.047\nAnd with our clusters, if configured\nproperly, like Adam was explaining,\n\n357\n00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:10.020\nthen we really don't have to\nhave that additional downtime.\n\n358\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n359\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.568\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's super important,\nwoo hoo.\n\n360\n00:17:13.568 --> 00:17:14.800\n&gt;&gt; High five, that's awesome.\n\n361\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.900\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the main concepts, right?\n\n362\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.466\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n363\n00:17:16.466 --> 00:17:17.630\n&gt;&gt; And you don't wanna mess that part up.\n\n364\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.400\n&gt;&gt; That's why I like hosting with Cherokee\ncuz she says I'm right all the time.\n\n365\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.540\nThat's exactly why I\nlike hosting with her.\n\n366\n00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.495\nAll right, so, it is a very important\npoint, I appreciate you actually stopping\n\n367\n00:17:25.495 --> 00:17:27.430\nus and really reinforcing that,\nall kidding aside.\n\n368\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.880\nWe do joke around quite a bit when\nCherokee and I host, but this is serious.\n\n369\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.240\nAnd it is a very important point.\n\n370\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.883\nIf you're not patch managing,\nif you're not keeping up to date with that\n\n371\n00:17:35.883 --> 00:17:40.056\ninfrastructure, securing it, and\nin some cases, updating features, drivers,\n\n372\n00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:42.897\nwhatever the patches may be,\nwe're gonna fall behind.\n\n373\n00:17:42.897 --> 00:17:45.686\nAnd we know for a fact, right,\nthose bad actors are gonna be knocking\n\n374\n00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:48.381\non the door and attempting to take\nadvantage of vulnerabilities or\n\n375\n00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:51.147\nweaknesses that we've allowed to\ncreep into our infrastructure.\n\n376\n00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:53.328\nSo this is really important stuff.\n\n377\n00:17:53.328 --> 00:17:57.122\nThis is just maintenance 101, but\nit's such a critical part of what we do.\n\n378\n00:17:57.122 --> 00:17:59.886\nAll right, let's go and let's take a look\nat the other side of the divide here.\n\n379\n00:17:59.886 --> 00:18:03.156\nI'm gonna flip over to\nthe config manager console,\n\n380\n00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:05.700\nso let me just do that here real quickly.\n\n381\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.714\nOkay, or maybe not, let me do that again,\n[LAUGH] and let me come over here.\n\n382\n00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.610\nThere we go, right there,\nokay, so let me just do that.\n\n383\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.580\nThe config manager console, SCCM,\nSystem Center Config Manager,\n\n384\n00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.380\na product we haven't really touched on,\ntalked about really in any way,\n\n385\n00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.100\nintegrated into our thought\nprocess throughout any and all\n\n386\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.300\nthe episodes in this category that we've\nbeen going through the 7246 material.\n\n387\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.190\nIt is an important part of what we do, but\n\n388\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.490\nit kinda sits in the background for\nthe most part in these discussions.\n\n389\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.450\nCuz it's not a front and\n\n390\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.570\ncenter piece of managing cloud\ninfrastructure in the data center.\n\n391\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.580\nIt can and indeed does play a very\nimportant role in what we do, because it's\n\n392\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.855\nour configuration management solution,\nit is our asset management solution.\n\n393\n00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:49.277\nWe can do and indeed do most likely\nour operating system deployment and\n\n394\n00:18:49.277 --> 00:18:51.090\nimaging through this product.\n\n395\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.220\nWe integrate WSUS into our software\npatching through this product.\n\n396\n00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.660\nThere's a lot of functionality here\nthat we may or may not be aware of and\n\n397\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.800\ntaking advantage of.\n\n398\n00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.587\nWe did a whole set of discussions,\n\n399\n00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:04.556\nepisodes instead of shows on\nhow to manage this product.\n\n400\n00:19:04.556 --> 00:19:06.833\nIf you haven't seen them, I encourage\nyou to go back and take a look,\n\n401\n00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:09.675\nyou'll see my smiling face there cuz\nI'm the one who put them together.\n\n402\n00:19:09.675 --> 00:19:13.045\nBut I hosted those, did them with Wes and\ndid them with, I think, Mike, and\n\n403\n00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:14.215\nwith Daniel.\n\n404\n00:19:14.215 --> 00:19:15.915\nI don't think Cherokee\nwas part of that one,\n\n405\n00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:17.602\nwe didn't have you involved with that.\n\n406\n00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:19.732\nBut we did a whole, big,\n\n407\n00:19:19.732 --> 00:19:23.992\nlong, probably 20 plus hours solution\non how to use this product end to end.\n\n408\n00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:26.281\nBut what we're gonna do quickly\nis to show you one piece here.\n\n409\n00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:29.494\nSo I'm in the console,\nI'm in the administration workspace.\n\n410\n00:19:29.494 --> 00:19:33.241\nI'm up under site configuration,\ngot the sites area selected here.\n\n411\n00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:35.591\nThis is where I go and\nI see my primary site,\n\n412\n00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.981\nyou could see it's labeled here,\nprimary site.\n\n413\n00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:40.961\nI could see my primary site\nserver name and my site code,\n\n414\n00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:42.321\nall that stuff that's good.\n\n415\n00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:43.911\nAnd I could see the site is active.\n\n416\n00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:46.755\nWhat I'm gonna do is go up here to\nSettings, and by the way, I could right\n\n417\n00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:49.850\nclick here and do the same thing with the\nmenu that I could do just from up above.\n\n418\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.667\nBut just because of the view with the\nstreaming screen, I'm gonna go up above,\n\n419\n00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:53.990\nit's easier for you to see.\n\n420\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.310\nWe could see Settings here.\n\n421\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.741\nWe'll see we're gonna come over to client\ninstallation settings, come down here.\n\n422\n00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:03.141\nAnd you'll see that we have two\noptions here, the second one,\n\n423\n00:20:03.141 --> 00:20:06.414\nthe one down below,\nSoftware Update Based Client Install,\n\n424\n00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:10.134\nis the wizard we would run to actually\nbe able to push the SCCM agent out\n\n425\n00:20:10.134 --> 00:20:13.730\nto an end point through a software\nupdate integration with WSUS.\n\n426\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.121\nNow we've talked extensively in all the\nother episodes up until now about the mon\n\n427\n00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:23.670\nagent, now rebranded Microsoft monitoring\nagent, that we use with SCOM to\n\n428\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.100\nbe able to do monitoring on an endpoint,\nwhere we pushed that software out there.\n\n429\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.810\nThe agent does all the monitoring.\n\n430\n00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.160\nWe get the updates and\n\n431\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.640\nthe configurations from our\nmanagement packs as we deploy them.\n\n432\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.460\nWe do our monitoring, we report back.\n\n433\n00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.891\nWe've been through all that, right, this\nidea of agents just to remind you that we\n\n434\n00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:42.277\nkeep referring back to, right, the\nsoftware that's installed on the endpoints\n\n435\n00:20:42.277 --> 00:20:45.390\nlike it is right down here that\nwe're gonna use for monitoring.\n\n436\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.415\nSCCM has its own monitoring\nagents that are used as well,\n\n437\n00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:51.511\nseparate from the Microsoft\nmonitoring agent from SCOM.\n\n438\n00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:55.351\nSo it's another piece of software we have\nto push out in order to be able to allow\n\n439\n00:20:55.351 --> 00:20:56.630\nthis to occur.\n\n440\n00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.284\nAnd the SCCM agent is what's used to\ndo the asset management, the update\n\n441\n00:21:01.284 --> 00:21:06.793\nmanagement, the configuration updates, and\nall that stuff that goes on with SCCM.\n\n442\n00:21:06.793 --> 00:21:08.570\nThat agent is what we need.\n\n443\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.637\nNow if we're gonna start being\nable to do patch management,\n\n444\n00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.050\ndoing security updates for\nvirtual machines.\n\n445\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.484\nAnd we treat virtual machines like\nthey're physical machines, in our world,\n\n446\n00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.260\nthey're no different.\n\n447\n00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.410\nIt's an instance,\nit's got an operating system,\n\n448\n00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.040\nwe put an agent on it, we register it\nin the console, we put it into one or\n\n449\n00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.300\nmore collections, and\nwe start keeping track of it.\n\n450\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.710\nAnd over time, we push updates out to it.\n\n451\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.240\nThat's what SCCM does.\n\n452\n00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.696\nSo if we wanna put that agent out\nthere for SCCM on a running instance,\n\n453\n00:21:31.696 --> 00:21:35.511\nphysical or virtual, we have the same\noptions basically that we do to deploy\n\n454\n00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:39.825\nthe way we do with SCOM, through a client\npush install essentially from the console.\n\n455\n00:21:39.825 --> 00:21:41.461\nWe've shown you how to do that with MON,\n\n456\n00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:43.840\nshowed you how to do that\nthrough a discovery method.\n\n457\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.830\n&gt;&gt; Do we have group policy options here?\n\n458\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.533\n&gt;&gt; We do have group policy options,\nso we can do that as well.\n\n459\n00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:52.930\nWe can do a manual update or\na manual install the way we do.\n\n460\n00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.500\nAnd we also can do an imaging update,\n\n461\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.060\nmeaning we could throw this into an image\nthrough an operating system deployment.\n\n462\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.066\nSo we could say hey,\nlet's build out our golden master,\n\n463\n00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:06.091\nlet's have server 12R2 already\nconfigured out, says prep ready to go.\n\n464\n00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:09.892\nPut the install of the client\neither already into the image and\n\n465\n00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:14.714\nhave it set up, or script it and do a task\nsequence enforce that we can apply it as\n\n466\n00:22:14.714 --> 00:22:19.520\na transform, a package as we walk\nthrough the install at various stages.\n\n467\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.570\nAnd so we have a couple of\ndifferent options there.\n\n468\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.488\nSo we have a lot of different\nways of getting this done.\n\n469\n00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:26.350\nBut one of the ways is we\ncould tie this into WSUS.\n\n470\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.380\nAnd I'm gonna show you where to stand\nup the WSUS server here in a minute\n\n471\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.140\nby adding what's called\na software update point,\n\n472\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.410\nthe role that we use in Config Manager\nto actually integrate WSUS.\n\n473\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.390\nWe could set up the software update point.\n\n474\n00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.660\nOnce we've done that, we could package the\nclient agent up as a software update and\n\n475\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.550\npush it out to machines as\npart of the WSUS cycle.\n\n476\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.590\nSo we've got about seven or\n\n477\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.610\neight different ways we could push the\nagent out, a little bit more flexible than\n\n478\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.460\nSCOM matrix, we really only have two major\nways of doing this, three in theory.\n\n479\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.050\nIf we do console push, manual, and we\nthink about using either an orchestrated\n\n480\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.750\nworkflow or a PowerShell script to kick\noff the install, it's still manual.\n\n481\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.440\nBut we would say it's\nkind of a third option.\n\n482\n00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.300\nBut we've got twice as many at least here,\nso\n\n483\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.860\nit's actually a little bit more involved.\n\n484\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.220\nBut it is also a lot more flexible.\n\n485\n00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.352\nSo we could do that right from here.\n\n486\n00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:15.140\nIn addition, let me show you where\nthe software update point is gonna be,\n\n487\n00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.128\nwhere our role is.\n\n488\n00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.710\nCome over here to Administration.\n\n489\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.560\nCome down here to Server and Site System\nRoles, same area under Site Config,\n\n490\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.840\nbut just a different thought process.\n\n491\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.230\nHere, we see all the different roles\nthat are assigned to the site server.\n\n492\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.650\nNow, if you notice in the list there,\n\n493\n00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.220\nwe do not see a software\nupdate point right now.\n\n494\n00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.750\nIt's alphabetical, so it would sitting\nright here on your site system,\n\n495\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.190\nand we don't see it listed.\n\n496\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.510\nSo what we're gonna do is right\nclick here, Add Site System Roles.\n\n497\n00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.060\nThey have a little wizard we run.\n\n498\n00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.093\nAnd if you're familiar with the product,\nyou've probably done this several times,\n\n499\n00:23:43.093 --> 00:23:44.059\nbe able to add in your role.\n\n500\n00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:47.458\nLet me just hide the lower\npart of our taskbar here,\n\n501\n00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:51.903\nso that way, we can see the lower\npart of our window, click Apply.\n\n502\n00:23:51.903 --> 00:23:54.130\nAll right, so we're gonna skip\nthrough the first couple of screens.\n\n503\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.010\nThey just don't really\nmatter to us right now.\n\n504\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.037\nWe're not using a proxy server.\n\n505\n00:23:57.037 --> 00:24:00.106\nWe've already got our server set up,\nso we're targeting our site server.\n\n506\n00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.947\nWhat we really just wanna\nsee is our software update\n\n507\n00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:04.664\npoint selection right here And\n\n508\n00:24:04.664 --> 00:24:09.307\nwhen we do this, what we're gonna find,\nlet's move this over so you can see that.\n\n509\n00:24:09.307 --> 00:24:13.272\nWhat we're gonna find is that all of a\nsudden we get all these options here that\n\n510\n00:24:13.272 --> 00:24:16.200\nwe now have to configure to\nintegrate the SUS server in and\n\n511\n00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.350\ntie it to the software update point role.\n\n512\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.260\nAnd we're gonna go through and\nas I said do a separate walk through and\n\n513\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.030\nshow you step by step, hands on,\nexactly what to do here.\n\n514\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.080\nThis process takes a bit of time and we\nare not going to spend all the time on it\n\n515\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.170\nin this episode, but definitely invite you\nto come back and see that cuz we're going\n\n516\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.120\nput that together for you and\nhave it available right after this show.\n\n517\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.550\nLiterally as you are watching\nme it is already being done.\n\n518\n00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.763\nThe alternate me, right, is already\nshooting that with the alternate Cherokee,\n\n519\n00:24:38.763 --> 00:24:39.968\nand we're all finished already.\n\n520\n00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:42.183\nAll right, so we're gonna ahead and\nwe're gonna do this and\n\n521\n00:24:42.183 --> 00:24:44.720\nobviously if we go through and\nanswer these questions, set thus up.\n\n522\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.619\nAt the end of this we'll do that same sync\nprocess that we've been talking about on\n\n523\n00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:51.500\nthe SCV and M side where we have\nto rebuild that WSUS catalog,\n\n524\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.705\nbring those updates in.\n\n525\n00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:55.245\nSo again, it's gonna take\nawhile to set the sync up here.\n\n526\n00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:58.235\nBut once we have it all setup\nwe're then just gonna be\n\n527\n00:24:58.235 --> 00:25:01.485\nonly syncing replicated changes or deltas\nat that point if we build the initial\n\n528\n00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:03.805\ncatalog once that becomes a lot quicker.\n\n529\n00:25:03.805 --> 00:25:06.225\nSo these are all the moving\nparts on the back end.\n\n530\n00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:07.870\nLet's get out of this while we're talking.\n\n531\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.935\nThese are all the moving parts on\nthe back end to do the SCCM and\n\n532\n00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:16.652\nthe SCVMM immigration with WSUS,\nsound like the alphabet guy right.\n\n533\n00:25:16.652 --> 00:25:19.490\n&gt;&gt; I know [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Spouting acronyms left and right here.\n\n534\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.270\n&gt;&gt; Alphabet soup.\n\n535\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Alphabet soup exactly.\n\n536\n00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.200\nSo, it's kinda like chicken soup,\nit's good for the soul.\n\n537\n00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.315\nIt's good for the IT administrator.\n\n538\n00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:25.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n539\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.500\nthat's how we actually set\nup this integration, and\n\n540\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.360\nhow we go ahead and we use this piece of\nthe puzzle with regards to optimizing.\n\n541\n00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.530\nWhat we also wanna do is just quickly\ntalk about a few other options for\n\n542\n00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.830\nus here with regards to setting up and\nusing things in System Center\n\n543\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.110\nacross the suite of products\nthat can be helpful for us.\n\n544\n00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:48.530\nWe've talked about using\nthe System Center Advisor before, and\n\n545\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.920\nI just wanna remind us of that\nquickly while we're here.\n\n546\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.630\nI'm in the SCOM console, I'm just gonna\ngo into Administration for a moment.\n\n547\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.220\nJust wanna remind you of where we see\nSystem Center Advisor integrated here,\n\n548\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.610\nsay a few words about it.\n\n549\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.230\nRemember I told you in 12R2, you see\nit down there on the left by the way,\n\n550\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:08.170\nin 12R2 we've integrated System Center\nAdvisor into the console directly whereas\n\n551\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.600\nin prior versions we had to download and\ninstall the System Center Advisor product.\n\n552\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.020\nWe now actually see it available for\nus, there we go.\n\n553\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.590\nWe actually see it available for\nus and installed.\n\n554\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.350\nSo it's already there, but\nwe do have to configure it.\n\n555\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.810\nAnd we walk through and talk about how to\ndo the configuration, how to set up and\n\n556\n00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.670\nregister the advisor service, and\n\n557\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.380\nconnect our SCOM management group to an\nexisting account, and then use the online\n\n558\n00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.160\nportal through Microsoft to do\nassessments of our infrastructure.\n\n559\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.320\nGet the advantage of the best practices.\n\n560\n00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.950\nThis is like an updated version of the\nBPA, the Best Practice Analyzer, if you're\n\n561\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.570\nfamiliar with that idea and that thought\nprocess from prior versions of products.\n\n562\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.820\nWe're running through\nlooking at the configuration,\n\n563\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.740\nlooking at the architecture, and\ntrying to figure out if everything's\n\n564\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.330\noptimized the right way\nwe're using this product.\n\n565\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.750\nAnd if it is, great, if it's not,\nwe'll make recommendations to you and\n\n566\n00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.540\ngive you ideas about what\nyou can do differently.\n\n567\n00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.310\nNow, what's important for us to know about\nhere, so let's just go out to the web for\n\n568\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.310\njust two minutes, show you a couple of\nquick things that may be valuable for\n\n569\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.620\nyou to be aware of.\n\n570\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.316\nWhat we have is, and we'll come back to\nthat idea of managing updates in a minute\n\n571\n00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:13.792\njust to remind you of some features and\nmost importantly some resources you\n\n572\n00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:17.671\ncan look at to augment that conversation\nwe just had about patch management in VMM.\n\n573\n00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.838\nWe have a nice little website here\nthat Microsoft put together for\n\n574\n00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:24.812\nus with regards, as you can see, to System\nCenter Advisor doing the deployment of\n\n575\n00:27:24.812 --> 00:27:26.750\nSystem Center Advisor end-to-end.\n\n576\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.550\nWe have links that we can click on so\nwe can understand the system requirements.\n\n577\n00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.720\nWell, we've already got it installed,\nSystem Center Config Manager,\n\n578\n00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.100\nexcuse me,\nSystem Center Ops Manager 2012R2.\n\n579\n00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.280\nSo if we meet the requirements there,\nand it's already stood up,\n\n580\n00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.120\nwe've essentially met the requirements\nbecause that's not too difficult.\n\n581\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.530\nBut making sure we understand what is\nrequired to stand this product up.\n\n582\n00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.420\nNow, we can install this\nas a standalone piece.\n\n583\n00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.620\nIf we're not gonna run SCOM,\nwe can actually run system center advisory\n\n584\n00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.120\nseparately, and\ninstall it on our own and build it out.\n\n585\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.490\nSo, looking at the requirements\nmay be helpful,\n\n586\n00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.410\njust to make sure we\nunderstand that piece.\n\n587\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.555\nBut if you're integrating it with SCOM,\nmeet the requirements to stand up a SCOM\n\n588\n00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:03.150\nserver, and System Center Advisory\ncomes along for the ride.\n\n589\n00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.970\nSo, that part's not gonna be hard.\n\n590\n00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.880\nWe can then set up and walk through and\ninstall all the different pieces.\n\n591\n00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.665\nIf we are gonna be authorizing and\nusing a gateway server, right,\n\n592\n00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:15.080\nwe would just want to make\nsure we go through there.\n\n593\n00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.720\nMaking sure that we have\nour Run As accounts set up.\n\n594\n00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.830\nWe talked about the need for\nRun As accounts.\n\n595\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.400\nNow, we actually, it may be hard to see.\n\n596\n00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.640\nCan we go full screen for just a second?\n\n597\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.900\nI just want to show this.\n\n598\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.420\nThe print is so tiny,\nit's kinda hard to see.\n\n599\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.520\nAnd what you'll see here is we actually\nhave the ability to monitor and\n\n600\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.780\nanalyze not just the infrastructure but\nspecifically SharePoint sites, and\n\n601\n00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.970\nthey refer to it here as Lync.\n\n602\n00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.718\nThey just haven't updated\nthe documentation, but\n\n603\n00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:38.832\nyou hopefully know that Lync is\nnow called Skype for Business.\n\n604\n00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:39.471\n&gt;&gt; Skype for Business.\n\n605\n00:28:39.471 --> 00:28:41.800\n&gt;&gt; So it's either one,\ndepending on what versions you're running.\n\n606\n00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.890\nWhen you see Lync,\njust think Skype for Business.\n\n607\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.070\nIt's the same, even though the screens and\nthe wizard and\n\n608\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.900\nthe documentation still say Lync,\nit works for either product.\n\n609\n00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.460\nBut we can set up Run As accounts for\neach of those.\n\n610\n00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.500\nWe do have to configure those,\nand just set those up separately.\n\n611\n00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.880\nWe've talked about the value of\nRun As accounts and how they work.\n\n612\n00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.700\nWe can use it to monitor VMM as well.\n\n613\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.230\nSo you see,\nwe have three product options there.\n\n614\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:07.260\nAnd so it gives us the information and\ncapability set to be able to go through\n\n615\n00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.300\nand configure the various aspects of\nthe product that we are going to be using.\n\n616\n00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.850\nSo you want to just take a look at this\nand make sure you're comfortable building\n\n617\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.120\nout on that thought process we've talked\nabout already using System Center Advisor.\n\n618\n00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.020\nIt's going to let you go through and\nsee all the different information and\n\n619\n00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.910\nthe requirements that will be helpful for\nus, or at least good for\n\n620\n00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.720\nus to be aware of and to know.\n\n621\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.150\nJust quickly,\nsince we're here before we go back and\n\n622\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.634\nI show you the last area that\nwe want to talk about here,\n\n623\n00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:36.060\nwhich are the pro tips and\nhow we use pro-enabled management packs.\n\n624\n00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.990\nI want to quickly bring you up to date\nwith the a couple of the web resources\n\n625\n00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.830\nthat we have.\n\n626\n00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.070\nFor the first part of our conversation,\nI talked about how to do the WSUS and\n\n627\n00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.180\nfabric management update integration for\nVMM and for Config Manager and\n\n628\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.681\nhow we manage all of that.\n\n629\n00:29:49.681 --> 00:29:53.379\nGot a great website that Microsoft put\ntogether with regards to doing our fabric\n\n630\n00:29:53.379 --> 00:29:55.260\nmanagement and our updates here.\n\n631\n00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.130\nSo you can follow the links here.\n\n632\n00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.630\nIt gives us all the capabilities\nthat we need, checklists, etc.\n\n633\n00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.190\nRight down here to go through\neverything I discussed with you.\n\n634\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.000\nI just did the high level 15\nminute discussion, quick show and\n\n635\n00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.250\ntell version of this.\n\n636\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.020\nYou're going to see me do a deeper\ndive and walk-through and\n\n637\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.110\nthere's other episodes but\nall the information you need for\n\n638\n00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.590\nreference here in case you\nwant to try this on your own.\n\n639\n00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.730\nAnd if you are going to manage this,\n\n640\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.710\nyou will need a little bit of\nguidance to get it set up.\n\n641\n00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.650\nSo do take a look at the website,\nspecifically setting up\n\n642\n00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.220\nthe software update part on the SCCM\nproduct, got a separate website for that.\n\n643\n00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.745\nWalks us through the configuration and\nthe installation and\n\n644\n00:30:28.745 --> 00:30:29.990\ncoordination of that piece.\n\n645\n00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.260\nSo we have both sides of the divide here.\n\n646\n00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.530\nSo we have .guidance on both for you.\n\n647\n00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.660\nAnd we talked about the log analytics\npiece and the use of OSM, the operational\n\n648\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.840\ncapabilities that Azure Fabric gives\nus for the operational suite that is up\n\n649\n00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.500\nin the sky so to speak, our cloud version\nof SCOM, right, so the Ops Manager Suite.\n\n650\n00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.820\nThat is up in the cloud\nthat Microsoft runs.\n\n651\n00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.460\nAnd we mentioned this in other episodes,\n\n652\n00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.750\njust wanted to bring it up here\nquickly and show you because we can\n\n653\n00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.300\nlink this to what we're doing with\nmonitoring System Center Advisor.\n\n654\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.320\nRemember, talks about best practices and\n\n655\n00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.885\nthe log analytics piece is a very powerful\npart of how we can use Systems Center\n\n656\n00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:11.775\nto optimize what we're doing from\nthe cloud fabric side with Azure.\n\n657\n00:31:11.775 --> 00:31:14.435\nWhether we're running our VMs and\nour infrastructure,\n\n658\n00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:17.012\nour cloud, in Azure,\nwhether we're running it on\n\n659\n00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:21.702\nour private cloud hosted on-prem in\nour own infrastructure doesn't matter.\n\n660\n00:31:21.702 --> 00:31:25.382\nWe could use the Azure Fabric and\nthe Operations Manager Suite,\n\n661\n00:31:25.382 --> 00:31:28.882\nthe OMS piece, essentially\nOps Manager in the cloud, right.\n\n662\n00:31:28.882 --> 00:31:32.112\nWe can use that to manage\nfrom Microsoft's cloud down.\n\n663\n00:31:32.112 --> 00:31:36.752\nWe can use it to manage from our private\ninfrastructure up, and monitor either way.\n\n664\n00:31:36.752 --> 00:31:40.900\nAnd so we get the capability of being\nable to monitor both on-prem and\n\n665\n00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.830\nin the cloud resources,\nand either or or both and\n\n666\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.690\nbring that all together into a common\nfront end through the cloud.\n\n667\n00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.176\nDo all of the heavy lift, the data\nanalysis, and analytics up in Azure and\n\n668\n00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:54.441\nthen get the benefit of all\nthe dashboarding and all the collection,\n\n669\n00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:58.058\ncombining, correlation, and visualizing\nof data that we may want to use.\n\n670\n00:31:58.058 --> 00:32:01.891\nAnother really interesting option for\nus with regards to optimization,\n\n671\n00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.438\nthe cool thing here,\nyou can try a free account.\n\n672\n00:32:04.438 --> 00:32:05.966\nI've shown you this in one or\ntwo episodes.\n\n673\n00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:09.017\nYou get a $200 service credit\nat least right now anyway.\n\n674\n00:32:09.017 --> 00:32:12.174\nYou're getting a $200 service\ncredit with Microsoft to start out.\n\n675\n00:32:12.174 --> 00:32:13.416\nYou do pay as you go.\n\n676\n00:32:13.416 --> 00:32:17.385\nWe've talked about this where essentially\nevery billable usage cycle is so\n\n677\n00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:21.100\nmany cents or so many dollars per\nminute per hour, whatever it is.\n\n678\n00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.240\nAnd so you chip away at that.\n\n679\n00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.130\nSo, depending on the loads\nyou put in there and\n\n680\n00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.110\nhow much you're running, maybe good for\nabout 30 days of service to try it out.\n\n681\n00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.858\nAnd after that you convert that account\nover to a pay as you go account with\n\n682\n00:32:30.858 --> 00:32:33.919\na credit card, or you just walk away and\nsay hey, you know what, it's nice, but\n\n683\n00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:34.980\nI'm just not interested.\n\n684\n00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.978\nI already have something\nthat does this and\n\n685\n00:32:36.978 --> 00:32:38.985\nI don't wanna actually spend more money.\n\n686\n00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:41.282\nYou just walk away from the account,\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n687\n00:32:41.282 --> 00:32:42.410\nyou don't get charged anything.\n\n688\n00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.497\nSo if you're interested in doing this\nyou can go through, and you can see\n\n689\n00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:49.053\nthe dashboards, what they look like here,\nand just some information about this.\n\n690\n00:32:49.053 --> 00:32:52.154\nYou can go through and\nyou'll take a look at your workloads, and\n\n691\n00:32:52.154 --> 00:32:54.174\nall sorts of stuff is very valuable here.\n\n692\n00:32:54.174 --> 00:32:57.250\nSo you may wanna take advantage\nof this and think about this.\n\n693\n00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.549\nThe last piece we wanna talk\nabout with optimization,\n\n694\n00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.220\nis the idea of pro enabling\nyour management packs.\n\n695\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.150\nThe idea of pro tips.\n\n696\n00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:07.960\nYou've heard me talk about this\nin SUVMM in one or two instances.\n\n697\n00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.950\nLet's go back in here to our console for\njust a second.\n\n698\n00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.030\nAnd we'll see, there we go.\n\n699\n00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.580\nWe'll see right here,\nthat as we go through.\n\n700\n00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.460\nAnd I'm gonna go back to settings here.\n\n701\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.350\nWe see pro tips right up here, but I'm\ngonna take you in where I have to show you\n\n702\n00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.590\nwhere the integration takes\nplace to enable this.\n\n703\n00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.760\nWhen we talked about integrating via\nan ops manager, we talked about turning on\n\n704\n00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.940\npro functionality like going\ninto our settings area,\n\n705\n00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.550\ngoing to systems center settings, you\ncan see I'm in that workspace right now.\n\n706\n00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.100\nOps manager server, this is where we right\nclick, we run that wizard that tells us\n\n707\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.290\nhow we're gonna integrate Ops manager and\nSUVMM slide this over so you can see this.\n\n708\n00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.014\nWe do have some requirements here for\n\n709\n00:33:45.014 --> 00:33:48.050\ncredentials we have an account that\nis a member of the ops manager.\n\n710\n00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.631\nHave a user role, an account that\nis the member of the VMM user role.\n\n711\n00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:52.383\nWill be asked for those.\n\n712\n00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:53.770\nI'll show you those in a minute.\n\n713\n00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.380\nWe have some management packs that\nhave to be installed in SCOM.\n\n714\n00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.006\nThey're listed there with version support.\n\n715\n00:33:58.006 --> 00:34:00.470\nSo you'll just wanna make\nsure you're aware of those.\n\n716\n00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.845\nWe talked about them SQL Server Core\nLibrary, Windows Server IIS version 6.\n\n717\n00:34:04.845 --> 00:34:11.080\nAnd IIS 2003 version 6 or\nlater support and 2008 version 7.\n\n718\n00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.930\nSo you know IIS version 6 and\n7 have that support available.\n\n719\n00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.830\nAnd then once we do that we also need\nthe Ops Manager Console installed on\n\n720\n00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.880\nthe VMM server.\n\n721\n00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.010\nActually have that already there.\n\n722\n00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.330\nAnd although we don't say it here,\nin addition,\n\n723\n00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.540\nit is something that you need to know.\n\n724\n00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.218\nIt's not on the wizard screen, but\nit is a recommended best practice,\n\n725\n00:34:28.218 --> 00:34:32.204\nyou should install the SCOM monitoring\nagent on the VMM server as well prior to\n\n726\n00:34:32.204 --> 00:34:33.578\ndoing this integration.\n\n727\n00:34:33.578 --> 00:34:35.626\nThat is also,\nalthough it's not on the list,\n\n728\n00:34:35.626 --> 00:34:37.525\nI would say it's actually a requirement.\n\n729\n00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:41.650\nIt's not listed as one,\nit's not Chiseled in stone, right?\n\n730\n00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.664\nIt's not gonna say in the documentation,\nyou must do this,\n\n731\n00:34:43.664 --> 00:34:45.096\nwe say it's a recommended best practice.\n\n732\n00:34:45.096 --> 00:34:48.551\nBut I would tell you that things go\na lot better if you have the monitoring\n\n733\n00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:49.480\nagent installed.\n\n734\n00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.100\nSo add that to your checklist\nreal quick just so you know,\n\n735\n00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.890\neven though we don't list it here.\n\n736\n00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:58.440\nWhen we click Next, we put in the server\nname that we're gonna connect to, so\n\n737\n00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.400\nwe're gonna go in and\nspecify the Ops manager server, and\n\n738\n00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.250\nthe credential we're gonna use to\nbe able to do this integration.\n\n739\n00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.080\nThen enabling pros it's just\na matter of leaving the check\n\n740\n00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.280\nbox you're enabled cuz it's\nturned on by default, but just\n\n741\n00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.950\nhaving that check box selected when we do\nthe integration, enables the pros support.\n\n742\n00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.380\nNow that port is actually fairly\neasy cuz this wizard kicks off,\n\n743\n00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.660\ndoes everything itself.\n\n744\n00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.425\nIt takes about 15 to 20 minutes,\ndoes the integration,\n\n745\n00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:25.008\nsets up the synchronization of the\ncommunication between the two products and\n\n746\n00:35:25.008 --> 00:35:26.541\nthen everything starts to flow.\n\n747\n00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:27.725\nThat part's not hard.\n\n748\n00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:31.409\nWhich you, then need to be aware\nof is the fact that we need,\n\n749\n00:35:31.409 --> 00:35:33.193\nnot just management packs.\n\n750\n00:35:33.193 --> 00:35:37.330\nBut we need specific management packs\nthat are enabled with PRO capabilities.\n\n751\n00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.600\nAnd these are different from\nnormal management packs.\n\n752\n00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.295\nAnd this is the piece, I wanted to\njust spend a minute on with you.\n\n753\n00:35:42.295 --> 00:35:45.214\nAs we're just finishing up\nhow we optimize here so\n\n754\n00:35:45.214 --> 00:35:48.460\nlet's go over to our ops\nmanager console for a minute.\n\n755\n00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.770\nLet's remind ourselves of where\nour management packs are.\n\n756\n00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:54.790\nWe'll see them right here\nin the admin workspace.\n\n757\n00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.360\nWe've got all of our management packs,\n\n758\n00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.450\nwe've talked extensively\nabout these already.\n\n759\n00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.339\nSealed, unsealed, create overrides,\nput all the things together,\n\n760\n00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:02.169\nuse our templates.\n\n761\n00:36:02.169 --> 00:36:06.500\nBeen through all that stuff in many, many\nof our prior episodes and conversations.\n\n762\n00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.065\nWhat I wanna point out to you is that\nstandard management packs are not\n\n763\n00:36:09.065 --> 00:36:12.880\npro-enabled, meaning,\nthey don't utilize the pro technology, and\n\n764\n00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.380\noffer what are called pro tips for\nus, recommendations that are made.\n\n765\n00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.540\nThey will help us optimize\nour infrastructure and\n\n766\n00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.240\nmake changes that will benefit\nour capability utilization and\n\n767\n00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.910\nallow us to be better able to utilize\nthe resources that we're managing.\n\n768\n00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.599\nSo in other words standard\nMonitoring has no knowledge of and\n\n769\n00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:33.033\ndoes not take advantage of PRO.\n\n770\n00:36:33.033 --> 00:36:35.819\nWhat you need to do is get\nPRO-enabled management packs.\n\n771\n00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:38.886\nNow PRO-enabled management packs,\nalmost without exception,\n\n772\n00:36:38.886 --> 00:36:40.755\nare coming from third-party vendors.\n\n773\n00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:43.775\nMicrosoft has a couple that they provide,\nbut traditionally,\n\n774\n00:36:43.775 --> 00:36:44.935\nthey come from third-party vendors.\n\n775\n00:36:44.935 --> 00:36:47.665\nI'll show you what one\nvendor is that does this and\n\n776\n00:36:47.665 --> 00:36:50.685\nwhat their solution looks like here\nin a minute, we'll go take a look.\n\n777\n00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:52.886\nBut you have to know,\nthese typically are not free.\n\n778\n00:36:52.886 --> 00:36:55.700\nThis is the little gotcha\nthing you gotta be aware of.\n\n779\n00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.530\nMost of our management packs are the ones\nyou're seeing here are most of\n\n780\n00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.510\nthe ones we've downloaded.\n\n781\n00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:03.372\nEspecially all the ones from Microsoft and\neven many from third party vendors for\n\n782\n00:37:03.372 --> 00:37:04.919\nstandard monitoring are free.\n\n783\n00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:08.196\nBut the pro enabled ones you\ntypically have to pay for, so\n\n784\n00:37:08.196 --> 00:37:10.730\nthere is an added fee\nassociated with this.\n\n785\n00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.370\nYou do wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n786\n00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.870\nWhat it is, how much it is,\nit varies by vendor.\n\n787\n00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.983\nVaries by a million\ndifferent consequences,\n\n788\n00:37:16.983 --> 00:37:20.882\ncircumstances things you wanna be aware of\nas variables, check with the vendor see if\n\n789\n00:37:20.882 --> 00:37:24.531\nthey have PRO-Enabled management packs\nthey do, find out how much they cost.\n\n790\n00:37:24.531 --> 00:37:28.157\nSome vendors give them to you if you\nbuy the products through design force\n\n791\n00:37:28.157 --> 00:37:29.174\npart of licensing.\n\n792\n00:37:29.174 --> 00:37:31.309\nOthers say yeah,\nyou bought the product, but\n\n793\n00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:34.783\nby the way you gotta buy the management\npack it varies across the industry.\n\n794\n00:37:34.783 --> 00:37:36.606\nIt's hard to say for\nsure what that will look like.\n\n795\n00:37:36.606 --> 00:37:39.730\nBut what you do wanna take a look at here,\nPRO-Enabled Management Packs.\n\n796\n00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.260\nWe can go back and take a look.\n\n797\n00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.687\nYou'll see that we do have virtual manager\nmanager, and some different options for\n\n798\n00:37:45.687 --> 00:37:49.254\nvirtual machine manager management\npacks that are PRO-Enabled.\n\n799\n00:37:49.254 --> 00:37:53.870\nSo Microsoft does give us some specific\nto VMM, already, as the baseline.\n\n800\n00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.200\nBut then, out beyond that, when we wanna\ntake a look at one option, F5, for\n\n801\n00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.110\ninstance, Big Ion, if you're familiar\nwith them, and the stuff they do.\n\n802\n00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.640\nPretty popular company for VPN solutions,\n\n803\n00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.840\nnetwork monitoring,\nHigh end gear, things like that.\n\n804\n00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.040\nYou'll see they do have a PRO-Enabled\nManagement Pack or Monitoring Pack for\n\n805\n00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.220\nMicrosoft System Center.\n\n806\n00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.395\nEssentially automated\nprovisioning is what they do.\n\n807\n00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:19.356\nAnd you can see that they talk\na bit about System Center,\n\n808\n00:38:19.356 --> 00:38:22.040\ntheir PRO-enabled Monitoring Pack here.\n\n809\n00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.690\nThey've got several different, or\nthree different module solutions.\n\n810\n00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.790\nCore management pack makes the FI\nbig IP device available and\n\n811\n00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.481\nvisible for statistics gathering and\nmonitoring.\n\n812\n00:38:31.481 --> 00:38:34.685\nIf you're using FI big IP,\nyou'd be able to use that.\n\n813\n00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:38.529\nPPO-Enabled monitoring pack for Microsoft\nSystems Center gives us pro tips for\n\n814\n00:38:38.529 --> 00:38:41.369\nmanaging the big IP device,\nand also integrates with VMM.\n\n815\n00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:44.798\nSo if you run that device you can\nactually then monitor on both sides, so\n\n816\n00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:46.220\nthat's kinda good.\n\n817\n00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.230\nAnd then our virtual appliance or virtual\napplication monitoring pack where we\n\n818\n00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.680\nintegrate the big IP devices with VMM 2012\nthrough adding orchestrator solutions.\n\n819\n00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.007\nYou could run this device,\nessentially, as a virtual appliance.\n\n820\n00:38:57.007 --> 00:39:00.711\nAnd then you can integrate this, and\nyou can manage this with workflows.\n\n821\n00:39:00.711 --> 00:39:03.814\nSo when you get this whole product suite,\nand you buy this device, and\n\n822\n00:39:03.814 --> 00:39:07.560\nyou get this pro-enabled management pack,\nyou get all these added capabilities.\n\n823\n00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.510\nAnd you install the pro-management\npack the same way you would\n\n824\n00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.380\nnormal management packs.\n\n825\n00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.290\nBut it brings in additional monitors and\nadditional objects that are designed\n\n826\n00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.110\nspecifically to work\nwith this pro technology.\n\n827\n00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.880\nAnd this is where those pro tips start\npopping up and start being utilized.\n\n828\n00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.396\nSo you have to use a PRO-Enabled\nsolution in order to take advantage of\n\n829\n00:39:27.396 --> 00:39:29.371\nthe technology once you integrate it.\n\n830\n00:39:29.371 --> 00:39:33.340\nNow, what are some of these PRO Tips that\nI keep talking about, things you will see?\n\n831\n00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.860\nWell, take a look back here on this page.\n\n832\n00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.450\nThe different types of PRO Tips.\n\n833\n00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.650\nCan we go full screen for a second so\nit's a little bit easier?\n\n834\n00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.164\nWe'll get PRO Tips for the hosts,\nPRO Tips for VMs as we were just saying.\n\n835\n00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:46.417\nPRO Tips for Virtual Machine Manager\nitself and PRO Tips for\n\n836\n00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.660\nservices within VMM.\n\n837\n00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.243\nIn other words,\nthese are the areas we target for\n\n838\n00:39:50.243 --> 00:39:52.387\noptimization based on the monitoring.\n\n839\n00:39:52.387 --> 00:39:56.560\nAnd we will then get pop ups or\ncapability recommendations.\n\n840\n00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.270\nSo I'm gonna show you where\nthey'll show up in the console.\n\n841\n00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.707\nWe'll go back in and we'll take a look.\n\n842\n00:39:59.707 --> 00:40:02.574\nBut you'll see these they'll come up and\nthey'll say, hey Adam,\n\n843\n00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:03.920\nthis is what's going on.\n\n844\n00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.177\nYou could do this or make this change or\nwhatever the recommendation will be.\n\n845\n00:40:07.177 --> 00:40:09.821\nSo that way all the hosts or\nthe virtual machine or\n\n846\n00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:13.460\nwhatever it is that we're\nmonitoring will behave better.\n\n847\n00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.780\nAnd so we can set this up, and\n\n848\n00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.980\nwe'll then be able to take advantage\nof this proactive monitoring.\n\n849\n00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.225\nLet's go in to VMM and let's just take\na look at where we would see those.\n\n850\n00:40:22.225 --> 00:40:25.815\nSo you'll see here that we have\nthe pro option up on the tab in\n\n851\n00:40:25.815 --> 00:40:27.785\na couple of different places,\nit doesn't matter where we are.\n\n852\n00:40:27.785 --> 00:40:30.403\nWhen you click on it you get\nthis workspace that pops up,\n\n853\n00:40:30.403 --> 00:40:33.148\nnow it's blank because I\nhaven't done the integration.\n\n854\n00:40:33.148 --> 00:40:35.749\nAnd I don't have any PRO-Enabled\nmanagement packs running.\n\n855\n00:40:35.749 --> 00:40:38.180\nBut when I do and\nwe start do the monitoring,\n\n856\n00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.430\nwe'll see the pro tips popping up here.\n\n857\n00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.071\nAnd this is where we'll go to enable\nthem and interact with them and\n\n858\n00:40:43.071 --> 00:40:44.073\ntake advantage of them.\n\n859\n00:40:44.073 --> 00:40:45.779\n&gt;&gt; Wow, can you take a breath now?\n\n860\n00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:46.290\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n861\n00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That was a lot of information.\n\n862\n00:40:48.647 --> 00:40:49.224\nAnd it's really great.\n\n863\n00:40:49.224 --> 00:40:51.666\nBut at least,\nnow we've got some really great tips and\n\n864\n00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:54.867\nconcepts on how to better optimize\nour private Cloud infrastructure.\n\n865\n00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:56.005\nSo thank you for that, Adam.\n\n866\n00:40:56.005 --> 00:40:58.370\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n867\n00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.652\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have
