Cherokee and\n\n13\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.280\nall of you here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n14\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.430\nLooking forward to spend some time\ntalking about the private cloud, but\n\n15\n00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.300\nspecifically, how we gonna plan for\nthe cloud.\n\n16\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.420\nAs we think about what it takes to\nnot only become an MCSA E-certified\n\n17\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.480\nin private cloud.\n\n18\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.730\nBut out beyond that, when we think about\nwhat it takes to consider how to setup,\n\n19\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.170\nmanage, maintain, ultimately optimize and\n\n20\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.910\noperate a private cloud or\neven a hybrid cloud.\n\n21\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.085\nAnd we'll talk about the difference\nthis is a public cloud,\n\n22\n00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.485\nwe'll go through them here, and\nthen discuss some just a moment.\n\n23\n00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:02.821\nWhen we think about all that,\nwe have to really step back and\n\n24\n00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:05.627\nunderstand the larger picture,\nthe strategic or\n\n25\n00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:09.534\nhigher level thought process of\nwhat cloud represents for us today.\n\n26\n00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:14.490\nWhy it's so important to us,\nto our businesses as IT professionals,\n\n27\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.420\nas security professionals, as individuals\nthat are customers, as providers.\n\n28\n00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.190\nThere's so many different things,\nso many different moving parts\n\n29\n00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.150\nthat go into the cloud that It's really\nimportant as we get started to have this\n\n30\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.680\nhigh level thought process and view to\ngive us a sense of what we're gonna do,\n\n31\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.440\nhow we're gonna do that, what our goals\nare, what we're looking to accomplish.\n\n32\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.320\nAnd when I speak with customers, when\nI speak with clients, when I meet with\n\n33\n00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.440\nbusinesses that are looking to either\nengage in moving their services,\n\n34\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.830\nreporting them to the cloud, or are in the\ncloud, but are looking for a better way.\n\n35\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.800\nHow do we get better at what we do?\n\n36\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.579\nWhat's the value proposition to the cloud?\n\n37\n00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.176\nAnd when I spend time with them, and\n\n38\n00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:58.647\nI spend a great deal of time talking\nwith people about the cloud, these days.\n\n39\n00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:01.911\nIt is, after all,\nprobably one of the fastest-growing and\n\n40\n00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:05.520\nmost important areas of how we\nservice provision these days.\n\n41\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.260\nYou think of things like the Internet of\nThings, and you hear all these buzzwords.\n\n42\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.620\nThis is just the ongoing thought process\nof how we are scaling up and scaling out.\n\n43\n00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.410\nAnd as we think about these services and\n\n44\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.040\nwhat they represent to us, we really have\nto make sure probably first and foremost.\n\n45\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.198\nMost importantly that we're on the page\nthat we're talking about the same\n\n46\n00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:30.422\nthing and that we're referring to it and\nspeaking about it in a way that makes\n\n47\n00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:33.988\neverybody understand what our end result,\nwhat our goals are.\n\n48\n00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:35.377\nSo, we're gonna play a little game.\n\n49\n00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.783\nCherokee, would you mind helping me for\njust a minute here,\n\n50\n00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.030\nI know you're always interested and\neager to jump in.\n\n51\n00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have no clue what the game\nwill be, but I'm ready, I'm on.\n\n52\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's got a look of fierce,\n\n53\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.120\nshe's like what the heck\nare you gonna make me do.\n\n54\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.950\nAll right, so\nit's gonna be real simple, really,\n\n55\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.470\nI just wanna play a little word\nassociation game, a little help for\n\n56\n00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.680\nall of our studio members out there,\npeople that are gonna be listening to\n\n57\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.860\nus both live and certainly as you watch\nthis at some point in the future.\n\n58\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.290\n&gt;&gt; Is this a psychology exam?\n\n59\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.980\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not all.\n\n60\n00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.565\nI'm not gonna ask you\nto look at any blots.\n\n61\n00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:02.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it's always a cow,\n\n62\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.460\nno matter what they say,\nit's always a cow.\n\n63\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.430\nBut no,\nwe're not gonna take a look at ink blots.\n\n64\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.564\nWhat I just wanna do, so\nI wanna actually define between us and\n\n65\n00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.960\ncertainly for everybody.\n\n66\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.750\nI want to define the words that are so\n\n67\n00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.088\nimportant to us when we\nthink about the cloud.\n\n68\n00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:20.369\nI wanna spend a couple of minutes helping\nus build out our vocabulary to better\n\n69\n00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:25.163\nunderstand what the cloud is and\nif we have that operational lexicon,\n\n70\n00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.249\nthat thought process in place and\nwe agree on the concepts.\n\n71\n00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.385\nWe could then really use them not\nonly in this episode, not only for\n\n72\n00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:35.200\nthis discussion, but\nthroughout all of our discussions.\n\n73\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.363\nIt will be a lot easier for us to refer\nto things, and we can always say,\n\n74\n00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.885\nhey, remember, we went back and\ndefined those terms,\n\n75\n00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:42.818\nwanna make sure you know what they are,\nand\n\n76\n00:03:42.818 --> 00:03:46.220\ngo back and listen to that episode,\nif you forgot, but make sure you know.\n\n77\n00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.350\nSo, I wanna make sure we understand\nthe concepts of public and private cloud.\n\n78\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.230\nAnd I want to agree on, as we talk\nthrough those, we'll do that in a minute,\n\n79\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.800\nwhat are what we would call the fab four,\nnot the Beatles, by the way, but\n\n80\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.820\nthe other fab four, the four resource\ngroups are that we refer to and\n\n81\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.410\nthat we think of when we talk about\nmanaging cloud-based infrastructure?\n\n82\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.820\nLet's start by just talking a bit about\nwhat a cloud is generically, right?\n\n83\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.560\nAnd when you think about the cloud\nwhat we have to understand and\n\n84\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.000\nreally think through the logic of is we\nhave to extract and remove ourselves from\n\n85\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.640\nthe Microsoft centric thought process and\nmindset that we often have.\n\n86\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.087\nAnd rightly so we should have\nin a conversation like this.\n\n87\n00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:26.624\nThis is after all a conversation\nabout MCSC private\n\n88\n00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:29.338\ncloud in the Microsoft Solution Four,\n\n89\n00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:34.369\nthat already is part of that cuz\nwe've done the 7246 conversation.\n\n90\n00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:37.399\nI encourage you to go back and\ntake a look at all those shows and\n\n91\n00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:40.660\nreally make sure you understand\nthose thought processes.\n\n92\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.360\nAlso did a whole set of episodes,\nCherokee played a part in that as well.\n\n93\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.830\nOn the 10946 content,\nmanaging the data center with SCOM,\n\n94\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.470\nwith System Center Ops Manager.\n\n95\n00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.100\nWhole probably what 20, 30 hours for\nthe content just stand that alone.\n\n96\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.464\nSo, we have done a lot of work,\nmyself, Cherokee and\n\n97\n00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.240\nDaniel also played\na large part on this one.\n\n98\n00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.484\nWe spend a lot of time with you helping\nyou to understand those concepts,\n\n99\n00:05:03.484 --> 00:05:05.932\nsome have defined having\nthis conversation with you,\n\n100\n00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:07.918\nsome of those other\nshows around the cloud.\n\n101\n00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:11.189\nBut I also brought out the ideal thought\nabout me or how viewer think about\n\n102\n00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.568\nthe though process that, you know,\nMicrosoft did not invent the cloud and\n\n103\n00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:17.481\nthey don't claim to have done that\nby the way, just to be clear.\n\n104\n00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:21.251\nBut they did not invent the cloud,\nneither did Amazon, neither did Google,\n\n105\n00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.615\nneither did VM or Cisco, independent\nof each other and on their own,\n\n106\n00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.460\nnone of those companies claim to and\nnone of them did.\n\n107\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.400\nYou know, the concepts of the cloud\nhave been well defined by many vendors.\n\n108\n00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.160\nAnd all those vendors I just named and\nmany more have played a very important\n\n109\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.990\npart in continuing to mature,\ngrow, optimize, and\n\n110\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.980\nmanage, as well as provide resources that\nhelp us to make up the cloud these days.\n\n111\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.540\nThey all have very important features and\ninfrastructure offerings and\n\n112\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.420\nservices that help us to define what\nthe thought process of a cloud is.\n\n113\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.240\nBut it's not just one vendor\nthat has done this and\n\n114\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.180\nall of them play an important role.\n\n115\n00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.360\nBut when we look to get an understanding\nof the defined criteria,\n\n116\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.200\nthe thought process specific to,\n\n117\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.740\nwhat is the accurate definition of\nwhat a public or a private cloud is?\n\n118\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.946\nWe have to think beyond the borders of\na single operational thought processes,\n\n119\n00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:12.050\na single vendors, lexicon.\n\n120\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.240\nWe have to look more broadly and\n\n121\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.030\nspecifically we have to look towards\nagreed upon concepts that everybody in\n\n122\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.890\nthe world regardless of where they\ncome from what they do can focus on.\n\n123\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.990\nAnd that leads us towards the thought\nprocess of spending a little time\n\n124\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.730\nlooking at the nist\ndefinitions of what cloud is.\n\n125\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.340\nThe nist definitions of cloud both\non the service offering side, so\n\n126\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.110\ninfrastructure, platform, and\nsoftware as a service, IaaS, PaaS, and\n\n127\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.700\nSaas are defined and accepted globally.\n\n128\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.820\nThe kinds of clouds that are available,\npublic, private, hybrid, and\n\n129\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.580\ncommunity cloud.\n\n130\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.170\nYou may have heard of one or\nmore of these terms before.\n\n131\n00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.710\nI'm sure you're probably familiar\nwith public and private cloud.\n\n132\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.770\nYou may or may not have thought\nthrough and heard of hybrid,\n\n133\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.780\nit's really just a combination\nof two types of cloud offerings.\n\n134\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.780\nAnd communities often that one that\na lot of people are not familiar with,\n\n135\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.730\nit's essentially just a subset\nof the private cloud.\n\n136\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.160\nUnique to a certain user group or\n\n137\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.400\narea within the business that has\ntheir own specified offerings\n\n138\n00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.190\nthat are offered uniquely to them within\nthe context of the broader private cloud.\n\n139\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.370\nSo, it's almost like a sub-set of\nthe private cloud, uniquely tailored and\n\n140\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.340\nsplit off.\n\n141\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.220\nBut really the two main ones,\nwe talk about public and private cloud.\n\n142\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.820\nThose definitions are well defined.\n\n143\n00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.410\nAnd it's important for us to think about\nthem, because this lays down the baseline.\n\n144\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.946\nThis lays down the foundational elements,\nthat only we use and\n\n145\n00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.100\nwe're refer to,\nas I suggested started talking.\n\n146\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.950\nBut that all vendors will align with,\nevery vendor will define the concept of\n\n147\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.150\npublic and private cloud the same way\nbased on this standardized definition.\n\n148\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.190\nSo, it is important for\nyou to just think about that.\n\n149\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.906\nSo, let's think about what\nthe concept of a cloud implies.\n\n150\n00:07:42.906 --> 00:07:46.182\nIf I asked you what a cloud would be in\nyour mind Cherokee, things that maybe\n\n151\n00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:49.099\nimportant to you, what are some of\nthe things you throw out there?\n\n152\n00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:52.694\nWhat are some things\nthat maybe on your list?\n\n153\n00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:55.644\n&gt;&gt; Well, we still have hardware which\nis something that I think a lot\n\n154\n00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:58.540\nof people kind of forget, but\nit might just be relocated and so,\n\n155\n00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.167\nI might even be looking at cluster.\n\n156\n00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:03.372\nSo, large amounts of hardware,\nmaybe even a data center,\n\n157\n00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:07.680\nI have to have network connectivity I\nstill need IT professionals to manage it.\n\n158\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.488\nJust in different ways.\n\n159\n00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:12.583\nSo, those are the first few things\nthat come to my mind, Adam.\n\n160\n00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:16.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you mentioned a lot\nof things that are really important.\n\n161\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.220\nBut let's also think\nabout some of the things.\n\n162\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.569\nAlthough you didn't mention them,\nare going to be equally important right?\n\n163\n00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:21.138\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n164\n00:08:21.138 --> 00:08:24.030\nwe don't always need to have\na data center to do a cloud.\n\n165\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.710\nAlthough you said absolutely\nusually as we scale up.\n\n166\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.200\nEspecially in the enterprise and we have\nwhat is called a multi-tenant cloud,\n\n167\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.290\nmultiple customers, right?,\nkinda co existing hosting that.\n\n168\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.030\nData centers are therefore\nthe good way to go.\n\n169\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.940\nBut could we build a smaller version of\nthat cloud perhaps outside the data center\n\n170\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.470\non just local infrastructure\nthat we would control?\n\n171\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n172\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.030\n&gt;&gt; Could we do that, right?\n\n173\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.060\nAnd that's the hallmarks\nof the private cloud.\n\n174\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.500\nMore often than not, that's what\nwe call an on prem private cloud.\n\n175\n00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.990\nNot that you don't necessarily build\nthat in a data center on your premise.\n\n176\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.779\nCuz you may have what you refer to,\n\n177\n00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:57.440\nan individual business\nrefers to as a data center.\n\n178\n00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.298\nBut it may be a smaller version of, and\n\n179\n00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:02.841\nprobably not as scaled out as the data\ncenter that Cherokee was referring\n\n180\n00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:06.517\nto where she was thinking most likely\nof a large scale data center, right?\n\n181\n00:09:06.517 --> 00:09:10.305\nA really big one that a corporate entity\nlike Microsoft, or Amazon would run.\n\n182\n00:09:10.305 --> 00:09:12.615\nIt may have thousands of customers, and\n\n183\n00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:15.550\nhundreds of thousands of computers,\nvery large scale one.\n\n184\n00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.460\nBut we could have\na miniature version of that.\n\n185\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.110\nBut we could also build the cloud on\none of our machines right here, right?\n\n186\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.370\nAny of our laptops, in theory, or\nany computer any of you may own.\n\n187\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.520\nSitting at home, watching us in\nyour office, wherever you may be.\n\n188\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.260\nYou could have a cloud running\nlocally in just a very small amount of\n\n189\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.960\ninfrastructure.\n\n190\n00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.720\nSo, we do need computers,\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n191\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.410\nBut we just wanna be clear that we\ndon't necessarily need to scale that\n\n192\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.495\nto a massive level in order to\nbe able to run it cloud, but\n\n193\n00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:45.115\ntraditional clouds, as Cherokee rightly\npointed out, are going to be hosted,\n\n194\n00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:48.775\nespecially at the enterprise level,\nin large-scale infrastructure farms.\n\n195\n00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:50.895\nTypically hosted in data centers.\n\n196\n00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:54.010\nBut the one thing that she didn't mention,\nthat we do need, typically,\n\n197\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.291\nnot always, but typically-\n&gt;&gt; Virtualization.\n\n198\n00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:58.417\n&gt;&gt; But what we need that,\nwe a also need customers.\n\n199\n00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:01.437\nRight?, we need people to come and\nconsume those services.\n\n200\n00:10:01.437 --> 00:10:03.017\nI mean, not necessarily need them, but\n\n201\n00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:06.417\nit will be nice we get all the trouble to\nbuild stuff, it will be nice and somebody,\n\n202\n00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.157\nwas actually to use it,\nwhether they are internal customers, or\n\n203\n00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:13.897\npeople that work in our company enterprise\nwhatever it may be, or whether we saw\n\n204\n00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:18.410\nthe service assist other people whoever\nthey are, outside, or combination.\n\n205\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.984\nBut we want to have people\nthat are consuming services,\n\n206\n00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:23.119\nbecause that's going to help us to frame,\nand\n\n207\n00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:26.432\ndrive what the things that we're\ngoing to offer through the cloud are.\n\n208\n00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:29.494\nWhat kind of services,\nwhat kind of infrastructure do we need,\n\n209\n00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:33.405\nall the things Cherokee mentioned are\ndefinitely there, but we're going to have\n\n210\n00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:36.545\noptions based on the needs of\nthe customer and we have to tailor.\n\n211\n00:10:36.545 --> 00:10:38.225\nWe have to uniquely scope and\n\n212\n00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:43.765\nkind of figure out what customers want to\nthen essentially provide those services.\n\n213\n00:10:43.765 --> 00:10:48.827\nAnd we may have an ala carte menu of some\nkind, we may have a self service solution,\n\n214\n00:10:48.827 --> 00:10:53.027\nanother hallmark of cloud today,\nat least in the private cloud space\n\n215\n00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:57.420\nis a lot of cloud infrastructure,\nis set up and maintained and offered, but\n\n216\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.570\nit is a la carte to individual customers,\npay as you go.\n\n217\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.273\nAnd it is in some respects setup in a self\nservice environment where at least for\n\n218\n00:11:04.273 --> 00:11:07.769\ncertain at least for certain aspects\nof cloud, certain functionality.\n\n219\n00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:10.043\nWe may let customers self service and\n\n220\n00:11:10.043 --> 00:11:13.787\nprovide their own infrastructure\nmanagement capabilities\n\n221\n00:11:13.787 --> 00:11:18.200\nof their configuration capabilities\nbased on a preset menu of things.\n\n222\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.320\nIn other words, you may come in and\nbe able to reset your password.\n\n223\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.480\nYou may come in and be able to create\na new network and hook VMs up to it and\n\n224\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.110\ncreate your own virtual machines,\nand provision and launch, and\n\n225\n00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.610\ndeploy your own services, or applications\nthrough a self-service portal.\n\n226\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.160\nWe have this capability with\nSystem Center, with the App Controller,\n\n227\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.600\none of the key components of\nthe System Center infrastructure,\n\n228\n00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.530\nand we'll speak about that and\ntalk about that and how it plays here.\n\n229\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.020\nSo, it is important to be thinking\nabout all these things and\n\n230\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.370\nyou mentioned virtualization, which is\na huge underlying component of what we do.\n\n231\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.960\nHere we can virtualize,\nI often tell customers and students.\n\n232\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.270\nWe can virtualize without the cloud but\n\n233\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.650\nyou can't do the cloud\nwithout virtualization today.\n\n234\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.380\nNot, because you can't create\nwithout virtualized technology, but\n\n235\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.230\nat the scale that we operate at\nat the enterprise level, and\n\n236\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:10.100\nthe way we define cloud today at\nthe massive scales that we provide it,\n\n237\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.970\nyou wouldn't be able to do that\nwithout virtualization technology.\n\n238\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.550\nSo, it is probably one of the most\nimportant things you mentioned on\n\n239\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.390\nthat list.\n\n240\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.960\nBecause it's the key enabling technology\nthat's allowed us to scale up and\n\n241\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.950\nscale out.\n\n242\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.980\nScaling up, scaling out,\nand scaling down on demand.\n\n243\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.070\nIs one of the key hallmarks,\n\n244\n00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.360\none of the five critical criteria\nthat helps us define cloud services.\n\n245\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.980\nPay as you go, on demand capabilities,\nresource pooling.\n\n246\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.370\nAll the resources together the common\npool that can be allocated out.\n\n247\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.430\nThese are all hallmarker\ncriteria definitions, and\n\n248\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.710\nitems that exist on that hit list\nof things that we want to do.\n\n249\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.950\nSo, it is important for\nus to think about that.\n\n250\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.850\nI like the definitions we got so far, I\nlike list of things you up to us provide,\n\n251\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.240\nI think, those are very not only accurate,\nbut spot on,\n\n252\n00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.040\nthey're exactly what we wanna see and\nbe thinking about.\n\n253\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.270\nSo, we think about a public\nversus private cloud.\n\n254\n00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.440\nWhat's the key hallmark?\n\n255\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.780\nWhat's key defining characteristics for\nus?\n\n256\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.020\nBoth of them are clouds, but\n\n257\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.090\nboth are built the same way,\nboth are maintained the essentially\n\n258\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.080\nin the same kind of infrastructure\nfarms that we've been talking about.\n\n259\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.190\nBoth are based on virtualization.\n\n260\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.600\nBut the key defining characteristics,\nthe key difference, what is the focus?\n\n261\n00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.710\nWhat is the customer of that cloud?\n\n262\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.740\nAnd where is that cloud going to be\naccessible, how are we gonna use it.\n\n263\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.490\nIn a private cloud, we have two options,\nwe have what's called on-prem, and,\n\n264\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.210\nor, a hosted or off-prem cloud hosted\nthrough a third party provider.\n\n265\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.810\nOn-prem private cloud is us running on\nnormal infrastructure the way we would've\n\n266\n00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:39.880\nrun an extra-net, or an Intranet\nyears ago the only difference is that\n\n267\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.620\nwe're simply now labelling it, by the way\nit's a Cloud, it's private cloud.\n\n268\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.740\nIt's still us managing,\nmaintaining our infrastructure,\n\n269\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.630\nwe have our racks of servers and\n\n270\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.260\nall the stuff behind you that you see,\nall that stuff is part of the cloud.\n\n271\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.710\nAll that's there, it's just that\nit's sitting in our environment.\n\n272\n00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.980\nWe control it as opposed\nto renting it on demand,\n\n273\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.450\npay as I go from a third party provider.\n\n274\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.324\nThe Microsofts, the Amazons,\nthe Googles, the VMWares of the world.\n\n275\n00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:09.558\nIn their data centers, so when I host\nit myself it's a private on prem cloud.\n\n276\n00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:13.553\nWhen I outsource to a third party managed\nprovider, then it is private cloud,\n\n277\n00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:16.355\nbut it's off prem,\nit's hosted private cloud.\n\n278\n00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:20.325\nPublic cloud, same idea, it's hosted by\na third party vendor, traditionally, but\n\n279\n00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:23.455\nit's offered to the public in large\nindustry groups, whatever it may be.\n\n280\n00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:25.835\nWe all use, all of us with out exception,\n\n281\n00:14:25.835 --> 00:14:27.640\nyou're using right now\nif you're watching us.\n\n282\n00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.580\nWe all use public cloud all the time.\n\n283\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.220\nThe worldwide web and\n\n284\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.180\nthe Internet is a large example\nof private cloud in the world.\n\n285\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.940\nSo, we certainly use\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n286\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.170\nBut even in the public, or private\ncloud space, we wanna keep in mind and\n\n287\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.384\nrefer to that idea and\ndifferentiate between the tenant,\n\n288\n00:14:42.384 --> 00:14:48.270\nwhich what we call the customer,\nthat is hosting their services.\n\n289\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.360\nThey are the tenant.\n\n290\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.680\nWe have the service providers sometimes\ncalled ISP, traditional name for\n\n291\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.170\na provider of internet, i for\ninternet Internet service provider.\n\n292\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.570\nYou often now more so of these days\nwill hear that transformed into CSP,\n\n293\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.100\ncloud service provider.\n\n294\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.980\nEssentially an Internet provider\nthat does cloud services primarily.\n\n295\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.180\nSo, there's not really a difference there,\nbut\n\n296\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.750\nit's just a vocabulary item\nyou just wanna be aware of.\n\n297\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.220\nBut whether you're an ISP, a CSP, just\ngenerically a provider it doesn't matter.\n\n298\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.960\nYou are the entity, whether you're in\nthe internal IT function the business,\n\n299\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.900\nthe outsource cloud provider.\n\n300\n00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.240\nYou're the entity that's providing the\nbackbone cloud services that the tenant\n\n301\n00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.160\nis hosting with, and\nthat are providing to their customers.\n\n302\n00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.280\nSo, make sure you're\ncomfortable with that.\n\n303\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.300\nWhen we think about service identification\nand migration, we think about, hey,\n\n304\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.950\nwhat can I put in the cloud?\n\n305\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.270\nWhat's gonna run there?\n\n306\n00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.430\nIs it that service that I offer today,\nis it that app that I offer today,\n\n307\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.960\nwhatever the case may be?\n\n308\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.552\nRight?\n\n309\n00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:48.570\nExpanding it today in theory\ncan be cloud enabled.\n\n310\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.540\nYou hear about all these crazy stories\nabout cloud enabled refrigerators and\n\n311\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.500\ncoffee makers.\n\n312\n00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.610\nAnd all sorts of stuff,\nand all that's true.\n\n313\n00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.397\nNot a lot of value in\nsome of that perhaps,\n\n314\n00:15:58.397 --> 00:16:01.271\nI don't know that you need a cloud\nenabled refrigerator, right?\n\n315\n00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:04.311\nBut the reality is, is there a lot of\ngood that comes out of enabling stuff and\n\n316\n00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:05.606\noffering it through the cloud?\n\n317\n00:16:05.606 --> 00:16:07.342\nAbsolutely, no doubt about it.\n\n318\n00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:10.865\nIs there a lot of stuff that may just be\nkinda wacky and here today, gone tomorrow?\n\n319\n00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:13.460\nYeah, I'm sure there's probably\nsome of that as well, right?\n\n320\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.490\nBut ultimately in the business world,\nin the enterprise,\n\n321\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.070\nin the space that all of us inhabit,\nwe've gotta be\n\n322\n00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.790\nreally focused on figuring out what it\nis that we're gonna use the Cloud for.\n\n323\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.870\nTo build the infrastructure,\nbelieve or not, is not the hard part.\n\n324\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.110\nI have this conversation with\nmy customers on a regular basis.\n\n325\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.180\nWe could stand a Cloud environment up for\nyou very quickly, especially with\n\n326\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:40.138\nautomation technology, PowerShell\nscripting and things of that nature today.\n\n327\n00:16:40.138 --> 00:16:43.520\nWhether it's Microsoft-centric or\ngenerically on any platform,\n\n328\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.505\nlook generically at container\ncapabilities, things like Docker, Salt,\n\n329\n00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:52.745\nPuppet, Chef on the automation side for\ndev ops to automate and provision.\n\n330\n00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:56.855\nWe could stand Cloud infrastructure up\nin minutes, it doesn't take very long.\n\n331\n00:16:56.855 --> 00:17:01.855\nYou can build an enterprise grade global\nservice platform in less than a day\n\n332\n00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:05.490\nas long as you understand the technology\nand have the resources at your disposal.\n\n333\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.990\nEspecially if you're hosting\nwith a third party provider and\n\n334\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.220\nall you have to do is essentially sign up.\n\n335\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.200\nAnd once they give you\naccess to the platform,\n\n336\n00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.020\ngo through their configuration\nwizards to provision.\n\n337\n00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.630\nThe hardest part is just making\nsure everything gets done in\n\n338\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.770\na reasonable amount of time,\nbut it's all there.\n\n339\n00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.942\nSo getting the Cloud set up is\nactually not the hard part,\n\n340\n00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:23.590\npeople often misunderstand this.\n\n341\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.611\nWhat is really the hard part is figuring\nout what to do with it once you build it.\n\n342\n00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:31.638\nBecause if you think about the logic\nof it, a lot of companies jump in and\n\n343\n00:17:31.638 --> 00:17:34.203\nreally think, we gotta go to the Cloud.\n\n344\n00:17:34.203 --> 00:17:38.141\nAnd they race there because they don't\nwanna be the last person on their block\n\n345\n00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.604\nleft out, not doing Cloud.\n\n346\n00:17:39.604 --> 00:17:42.283\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of interesting,\nyou said just kind of jump in,\n\n347\n00:17:42.283 --> 00:17:44.816\ninstead of tiptoeing in and\ngetting your feet wet first.\n\n348\n00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:48.785\nBecause I kind of thought that a lot of\ncompanies will, I guess, if we look at\n\n349\n00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:53.204\nCloud services over the past decade or so,\nand what we really have been using it for.\n\n350\n00:17:53.204 --> 00:17:57.751\nOriginally maybe companies would enter\nas something simple like maybe like\n\n351\n00:17:57.751 --> 00:17:59.110\nadditional storage.\n\n352\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.076\nBut now that's really not the case, Adam.\n\n353\n00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:05.214\nBecause we saw earlier this year, when AWS\nwent down for a period of time, there were\n\n354\n00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:09.030\nseveral hundreds of websites and\norganizations that were affected by that.\n\n355\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.399\n&gt;&gt; Thousands.\n\n356\n00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:11.702\n&gt;&gt; Thousands, okay, yeah.\n\n357\n00:18:11.702 --> 00:18:12.406\n&gt;&gt; Thousands.\n\n358\n00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:13.485\nI was just saying thousands.\n\n359\n00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And saying it over and over and\n\n360\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.436\nover again because it was many,\nmany websites.\n\n361\n00:18:17.436 --> 00:18:18.920\nBut no, you're absolutely right, Cherokee.\n\n362\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.659\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n363\n00:18:19.659 --> 00:18:23.990\nI mean, today this is the beauty and the\nhorror of the Cloud all rolled into one.\n\n364\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.571\nThis is the conversation that you have to\nhave with yourself, with your customers,\n\n365\n00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:32.120\nif you work as an IT professional,\nif you are offering guidance,\n\n366\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.948\noffering consulting services.\n\n367\n00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:38.166\nIf you are the voice of IT,\nthe voice of reason in your organization.\n\n368\n00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:41.373\nOr if you're just starting out, and\nwant to learn more about this, and\n\n369\n00:18:41.373 --> 00:18:42.976\nare trying to make sense of it all and\n\n370\n00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:46.411\nunravel it and say, what the heck is this\nCloud thing and do I wanna be there?\n\n371\n00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:47.778\nAnd is that gonna make sense for me?\n\n372\n00:18:47.778 --> 00:18:49.780\nOr anything in between, doesn't matter.\n\n373\n00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.110\nThis is the beauty but\nalso the horror of the Cloud all in one.\n\n374\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.029\nBecause we come, unfortunately,\nto the crossroads in this conversation.\n\n375\n00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:01.186\nAnd it's really the key focal point for\neverybody in the Cloud.\n\n376\n00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:02.658\nWhich is,\nwhat am I going to put in the cloud?\n\n377\n00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:04.610\nWhat I was suggesting\na couple of minutes ago.\n\n378\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.638\nAnd as a result of that, how much risk and\n\n379\n00:19:06.638 --> 00:19:09.271\nexposure do I ultimately\nhave relying on the Cloud?\n\n380\n00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.303\nWhich is the piece that\nCherokee's asking us to focus and\n\n381\n00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:13.954\nthink about with her comment.\n\n382\n00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:18.370\nAnd as a result of that,\nhow am I gonna make this make sense?\n\n383\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.828\nHow am I gonna take all this stuff,\nblend it in the Cloud coffee cup,\n\n384\n00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.111\nthe proverbial Cloud coffee cup?\n\n385\n00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:29.117\nAnd how am I then gonna have something\nthat's valuable that I can maintain,\n\n386\n00:19:29.117 --> 00:19:32.951\nthat I can rely on, but that also\nnobody's gonna come take away from me?\n\n387\n00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:36.557\nBecause if somebody likes my version of\nthe Cloud enough that they wanna try to\n\n388\n00:19:36.557 --> 00:19:39.287\nget into it, they wanna steal it,\nborrow it, whatever.\n\n389\n00:19:39.287 --> 00:19:41.154\nThen I gotta be ready to defend it.\n\n390\n00:19:41.154 --> 00:19:44.279\nAnd if I'm not prepared to do that,\nthen I got a problem on my hands.\n\n391\n00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:47.746\nSo do you, by the way, because you're not\ngonna be able to do this successfully.\n\n392\n00:19:47.746 --> 00:19:51.760\nNow we're not gonna get into this\nconversation or any of these episodes,\n\n393\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.325\nalmost without exception.\n\n394\n00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.485\nWe'll touch here and there on security,\ndelegated admin roles, host groups,\n\n395\n00:19:57.485 --> 00:20:01.156\nhow we do things important in\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager and\n\n396\n00:20:01.156 --> 00:20:02.660\nSystem Center overall.\n\n397\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.530\nWe'll touch on these concepts.\n\n398\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.751\nBut this is not the beat down, hardcore,\n\n399\n00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:10.825\nhey I need to know everything about\nCloud and Cloud security conversation.\n\n400\n00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:14.537\nWe have those shows for you and\nI've done a lot of them.\n\n401\n00:20:14.537 --> 00:20:18.121\nCherokee's been involved in some of them,\nDaniel's helped me to do them,\n\n402\n00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:20.650\nMike's done some of them,\nDon's done some of them.\n\n403\n00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.986\nYou could see many of the edutainment\nhosts here at ITPro.TV and\n\n404\n00:20:23.986 --> 00:20:27.320\nsmees like myself and others that\ncome in to spend time with you,\n\n405\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.760\nhelping you to walk through those things.\n\n406\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.024\nSo there's definitely thought process out\nthere you can go take a look at when you\n\n407\n00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.770\nwanna get into the specifics of that.\n\n408\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.260\nBut at a high level this\nis the main focal point.\n\n409\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.920\nAs we begin our journey into ultimately\nwhat will become an in-depth conversation\n\n410\n00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.970\non the Microsoft Cloud and\nthe underlying networking architecture and\n\n411\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.170\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager's\ncapabilities\n\n412\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.120\nto provide the virtualized platform\ninfrastructure to do Cloud and\n\n413\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.210\nops manager and\nall the other pieces that go into it.\n\n414\n00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.430\nYou gotta be thinking about that.\n\n415\n00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.823\nBecause as I said, the easy part is,\nhey let me build the Cloud.\n\n416\n00:21:00.823 --> 00:21:04.408\nThe hard part is, what am I gonna put\nin there, what's gonna run there, and\n\n417\n00:21:04.408 --> 00:21:07.451\nhow I'm gonna keep the bad people out and\nlet the good people in?\n\n418\n00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:12.357\nAnd make sure the good people can do the\nthings they need to do, to be successful,\n\n419\n00:21:12.357 --> 00:21:15.965\nto do their job, to provide services,\nwhatever that is and\n\n420\n00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:17.574\ndo it in an optimized way?\n\n421\n00:21:17.574 --> 00:21:20.930\nIt's one thing to say I can get in there,\nbut it's not really working very well.\n\n422\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.670\nIt's a different thing to say we've\ngot self service portal set up.\n\n423\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.220\nWe've got service templates available.\n\n424\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.690\nEverything's already been loaded and\nis optimized.\n\n425\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.390\nHere is the 20 or 30 things you can\ndo on the menu of things we offer.\n\n426\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.150\nAnd here is what, based on your role and\nyour need, is the most likely path or\n\n427\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.107\nscenario for you to engage and\nultimately consume.\n\n428\n00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:41.939\nIt's a very different conversation.\n\n429\n00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:45.830\nWhether you do it in\nthe Microsoft Azure stack,\n\n430\n00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.246\nwhether you do it in the Amazon AWS stack.\n\n431\n00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:53.820\nThese are all essentially just names for\na service that you're ultimately gonna use\n\n432\n00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.374\nto provide and then consume\nthrough vendor specific certainly.\n\n433\n00:21:57.374 --> 00:22:00.023\nBut generically at the end of the day,\nyou get to the same place,\n\n434\n00:22:00.023 --> 00:22:03.529\nit's just a matter of what the interface\nlooks like, and who's name is on the bill.\n\n435\n00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:06.005\nBecause that's really the only\ndifference at the end of the day.\n\n436\n00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:10.657\nBut we're here to talk about the whole\nidea of Microsoft's Cloud security, or\n\n437\n00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:12.857\nexcuse me Cloud,\nI'm doing it myself now, Cloud security.\n\n438\n00:22:12.857 --> 00:22:16.151\nCloud Solution, System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager being front and\n\n439\n00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:17.236\ncenter as part of that.\n\n440\n00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:20.090\nAnd when we think about service\nidentification and migration we just have\n\n441\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.911\nto keep in our minds that as professionals\nthat are working in this area.\n\n442\n00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:26.538\nWe've got to be willing to and be\nthinking through the logic of walking our\n\n443\n00:22:26.538 --> 00:22:29.874\ncustomers, ourselves and others,\nthrough the thought process,\n\n444\n00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:34.089\nthe discussion of what our private Clouds,\ntraditionally it will be private Cloud,\n\n445\n00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:36.863\nwhat our private Cloud\ninfrastructure will look like.\n\n446\n00:22:36.863 --> 00:22:38.015\nWhat are we gonna offer?\n\n447\n00:22:38.015 --> 00:22:41.407\nAre we gonna offer ten different\nflavors of virtual machines?\n\n448\n00:22:41.407 --> 00:22:46.011\nVirtual machines, by the way, commonly in\nour industry, you will hear them referred\n\n449\n00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:49.492\nto them as either VMs,\nMicrosoft tends to refer to them that way.\n\n450\n00:22:49.492 --> 00:22:52.374\nBut we also refer to them as\nguest operating systems, and\n\n451\n00:22:52.374 --> 00:22:54.367\nyou see that in our own documentation.\n\n452\n00:22:54.367 --> 00:22:57.866\nWhen I say our own I mean Microsoft's,\nlet me put on my Microsoft hat.\n\n453\n00:22:57.866 --> 00:23:02.693\nAnd/or VMWare in particular also, in their\ndocumentation very specifically typically\n\n454\n00:23:02.693 --> 00:23:05.050\nrefers to them as guest operating systems.\n\n455\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.600\nSo if you hear those terms,\nthey mean the same thing.\n\n456\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.600\nHow many VM templates are we offering?\n\n457\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.364\nDo we have a server 12 R2, server\ntemplate, a Red Hat, Souza, Enterprise,\n\n458\n00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:19.425\nLinux, Debian, whatever template,\nwho knows what, there's all these options.\n\n459\n00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:20.822\nWhat kind of configurations?\n\n460\n00:23:20.822 --> 00:23:23.947\nHow many resources are we gonna make\navailable and what do they look like?\n\n461\n00:23:23.947 --> 00:23:26.155\nAnd so we have to think about that.\n\n462\n00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.690\nAnd when we think about resources\nwe have to think about it.\n\n463\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.435\nAnd I started out the episode\nby talking about the fact,\n\n464\n00:23:31.435 --> 00:23:33.078\nwe define the concepts of Cloud.\n\n465\n00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:36.289\nBut we'd also define the resources\nthat are managed through the Cloud.\n\n466\n00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:40.907\nWhat I will commonly call the fab four,\nthe fabulous four resource groups.\n\n467\n00:23:40.907 --> 00:23:45.398\nBecause these are the underlying\nelements of virtualization.\n\n468\n00:23:45.398 --> 00:23:49.646\nThe resources we extract from the host,\nthe physical entity, through a hypervisor,\n\n469\n00:23:49.646 --> 00:23:51.950\nwhatever that hypervisor's called.\n\n470\n00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.437\nThe VMWare hypervsior,\nVMkernel is what it's called.\n\n471\n00:23:54.437 --> 00:23:58.233\nMicrosoft's hypervisor,\nHyper-V, Citrix hypervisor,\n\n472\n00:23:58.233 --> 00:24:01.303\nthe Zen hypervisor,\ndoesn't matter what it is.\n\n473\n00:24:01.303 --> 00:24:02.590\nIt's a hypervisor, right?\n\n474\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.688\nHyper Visors do one thing and\none thing only.\n\n475\n00:24:04.688 --> 00:24:08.333\nThey abstract physical resources from\nthe hosts providing them through\n\n476\n00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.370\nan abstraction layer logically to one.\n\n477\n00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.370\nOr more guest operating system where\nthe machines running on that host.\n\n478\n00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.754\nAnd they manage and\ncontrol the interaction on access to and\n\n479\n00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:19.116\nfrom those resources.\n\n480\n00:24:19.116 --> 00:24:22.631\nAnd control all elements of the hosts\noperation with respect to the virtual\n\n481\n00:24:22.631 --> 00:24:25.930\nenvironment that are created,\nthat's what hypervisors do.\n\n482\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.270\nSay that three times fast, right?\n\n483\n00:24:28.354 --> 00:24:29.446\nI'm waiting-\n&gt;&gt; Sally sells sea shells by the seashore.\n\n484\n00:24:29.446 --> 00:24:30.188\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n485\n00:24:30.188 --> 00:24:32.160\nExactly, right.\n\n486\n00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.140\nSo, that's what hypervisors do, and as a\nresult we have four resources we focus on.\n\n487\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.350\nSo, tell me what those four resources\nare if you would, kind lady.\n\n488\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, we've got RAM,\nwe've got CPU network and storage.\n\n489\n00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, now,\nbefore we talk about each one\n\n490\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.950\nare they prioritized in any special order.\n\n491\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.460\nIn other words, generically,\n\n492\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.540\nare all resources from our\nperspective equally important?\n\n493\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.850\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, I hear a lot about RAM,\nvirtualization environments love.\n\n494\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.090\nSo, as much RAM as your\nmother board will support.\n\n495\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.170\nWe definitely wanna be maxing that out.\n\n496\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nit is important to have a lot of memory.\n\n497\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.891\nBut, is it equally important\nto have a lot of CPUs?\n\n498\n00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:09.486\n&gt;&gt; I think it is equally, and\nalso your CPUs have to support\n\n499\n00:25:09.486 --> 00:25:11.820\nvirtualization otherwise\nit's not gonna work.\n\n500\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.200\nSo, you can't have one without the other.\n\n501\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.674\nIt's team effort.\n\n502\n00:25:14.674 --> 00:25:16.553\n&gt;&gt; It is, and do we need network cards,\n\n503\n00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:19.536\nand hopefully a lot of them to\nbe able to get out of the host.\n\n504\n00:25:19.536 --> 00:25:24.245\nAnd get to various places beyond the host\nin the Cloud where we may be going.\n\n505\n00:25:24.245 --> 00:25:24.754\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\n\n506\n00:25:24.754 --> 00:25:29.229\nyou don't have to have multiple network\ncards if you're working on a small scale.\n\n507\n00:25:29.229 --> 00:25:33.065\nBut obviously the larger mountain\nof user's bandwidth that we need.\n\n508\n00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:35.400\nWe definitely want to implement\nsomething like NIC teaming.\n\n509\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.760\nAlso, to have that redundancy,\nespecially in an enterprise environment.\n\n510\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we need that,\nand what about storage?\n\n511\n00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.070\nHow important is storage?\n\n512\n00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Storage is important, if you want\nto have those virtual machines.\n\n513\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.230\nYou need a place to store them, right?\n\n514\n00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.331\nSo, I think exponentially,\nthe more virtual machines that I have,\n\n515\n00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:51.510\nthen the more storage I'll need.\n\n516\n00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, and so, what I'm trying to\nget at is that what we typically will\n\n517\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.026\nsuggest is that all four resources\nare of equal importance, right?\n\n518\n00:25:58.026 --> 00:26:01.603\nThere's not one that's more important than\nthe others, cuz as we just walk through,\n\n519\n00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:02.828\nyou need all of them, right?\n\n520\n00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:05.720\n[LAUGH] In order to make\nvirtualization function.\n\n521\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.290\nStorage can't have VMs without putting\nthem somewhere, as Cherokee was saying.\n\n522\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.700\nWhether it's local, whether it's remote,\nSAN, or NAS technology would be remote.\n\n523\n00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.160\nLocally attached storage\nis sometimes called DAS,\n\n524\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.710\nDirect Attached Storage\non an individual host.\n\n525\n00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.456\nWorks well, may not be our preference,\nmay not work for certain things.\n\n526\n00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:23.532\nBut in a pinch we can put\nVMs there if we need to,\n\n527\n00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:26.270\ndepending on how we are setting\nthem up and what we are doing.\n\n528\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.896\nYou may be able to use local storage\nwith an SSD drive as opposed\n\n529\n00:26:29.896 --> 00:26:31.866\nto an over the network solution.\n\n530\n00:26:31.866 --> 00:26:33.985\nBut if we don't have\nstorage we've got nothing,\n\n531\n00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:36.921\ncuz virtual machines are essentially\njust a bunch of files, right?\n\n532\n00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:41.380\nThat are configured and running by being\nread to and from a storage system.\n\n533\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.650\nWithout a network access to that\nstorage system traditionally, again,\n\n534\n00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.980\nunderstanding that most storage in virtual\nenvironments is done over the network.\n\n535\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.340\nWe do have a local option,\nwe can use that.\n\n536\n00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.490\nBut traditionally we need a network path,\nhopefully teamed, as Cherokee was saying,\n\n537\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.630\nso we have redundancy and\nreliability in terms of a failure event.\n\n538\n00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.520\nGotta have storage,\ngotta have network to get there.\n\n539\n00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.505\nWithout RAM and\nCPU in the host we got nothing,\n\n540\n00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:10.420\ncuz we have no resource to provide\nthose VMs, so they can spin up and run.\n\n541\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.250\nWe maybe able to see them over the\nnetwork, may be able to read the config\n\n542\n00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:18.070\nfile, but without resources to allow them\nto function, those VMs won't power on.\n\n543\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.940\nSo, we need all four of those resources,\nthey are equally important.\n\n544\n00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.730\nWe don't tend to say, one's more\nimportant than the other, we tend to say,\n\n545\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.950\nall of them are important.\n\n546\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.069\nSo, just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that, and\n\n547\n00:27:27.069 --> 00:27:30.072\nthat we're thinking about some of those\nthings as we look to get started.\n\n548\n00:27:30.072 --> 00:27:34.599\nAgain, understanding the general\nfoundation of elements, of Cloud,\n\n549\n00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:37.503\nof virtualization, how they come together.\n\n550\n00:27:37.503 --> 00:27:40.516\nThis particular episode has not\nreally been vendor specific.\n\n551\n00:27:40.516 --> 00:27:44.212\nIt's really been more general, I've tried\nto keep it at a high level, just so\n\n552\n00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:47.752\nwe have a sense of the thought process,\nthe technology, the vocabulary.\n\n553\n00:27:47.752 --> 00:27:51.002\nSo, as we start adding the vendor\nspecificity going forward,\n\n554\n00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:54.451\nwe can refer to it and say,\nregardless we always think about this.\n\n555\n00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:58.075\nAnd this is what we wanna make sure, we're\nfocused on, and we're thinking about.\n\n556\n00:27:58.075 --> 00:27:58.663\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n557\n00:27:58.663 --> 00:28:00.533\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n558\n00:28:00.533 --> 00:28:01.659\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there we are.\n\n559\n00:28:01.659 --> 00:28:03.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hello, that means I'm done.\n\n560\n00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.000\nI got nothing else to say.\n\n561\n00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.060\nAt least for this episode,\n\n562\n00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.700\nI just wanna really layout\nthe foundational elements for you.\n\n563\n00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.280\nGive you a sense of how\nthose things come together.\n\n564\n00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.780\nIn future episodes we're gonna delve into\nspecifics of the Microsoft solution.\n\n565\n00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.340\nBut you can't be successful at really\ntalking about Cloud with people\n\n566\n00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.010\ntoday in the enterprise unless you have\na background with the general vocabulary.\n\n567\n00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.739\nYou wanna go out ultimately take\nthe Microsoft MCC Private Cloud exams,\n\n568\n00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:30.299\n7246, 7247.\n\n569\n00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:34.081\nThe definitions of cloud, understanding\nthe basic resources we manage,\n\n570\n00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:36.740\nfundamental to your\nsuccess in those exams.\n\n571\n00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.556\nRegardless of what the vendor is, it's\ngonna be important, just general knowledge\n\n572\n00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:43.584\nfor you, and we always wanna start\nout building from the baseline.\n\n573\n00:28:43.584 --> 00:28:46.630\nAnd then adding all of that\nadditional details as we go.\n\n574\n00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Adam, it is important to have that\nbasic general understanding not only for\n\n575\n00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.840\nthe exam purpose, but\nlike you've mentioned before.\n\n576\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.450\nIn the real world, I wanna be able to\nhold an intelligent conversation with my\n\n577\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.350\npeers and\nmake sure we're all on the same page.\n\n578\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.760\nSo, I know, we're out of time for\nthis episode, but\n\n579\n00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.610\nwe still have more information\nto cover especially terminology.\n\n580\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.750\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n581\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.150\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n582\n00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.240\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n583\n00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n584\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.968\n&gt;&gt; See you next time on ITProTV\n\n585\n00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:18.916\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:21.974\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your configuring and\n\n5\n00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.090\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.050\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.630\nIn this episode we'll continue\na previous conversation where we\n\n8\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.460\nwere really talking about how to plan for\na private cloud.\n\n9\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.980\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.370\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody,\n\n12\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.480\nhopefully you're doing well,\nalways glad to be here talking with you.\n\n13\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.380\nEspecially if it's a part two\n\n14\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.150\ncuz that means I said something\nimportant in part one.\n\n15\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.520\nAnd I gotta now do more stuff\nthat's important in part two.\n\n16\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.950\nSo gonna see if we can make\nthat make sense for you.\n\n17\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.450\nSo we've talking about the private cloud,\nin the last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.930\nIf you didn't see it always good\nto just think about going back,\n\n19\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.770\ntaking a look before you go forward.\n\n20\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.250\nWe just layed down the foundational\ndiscussion elements about what cloud is,\n\n21\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.870\nthe resources associated with it.\n\n22\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.590\nAt a high level, not vendor specific,\nreally just generic\n\n23\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.420\nto the idea of our industry today and what\ncloud represents in that thought process.\n\n24\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.660\nWanna go a little bit deeper,\n\n25\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.250\na little bit more focused now around\nthe Microsoft Stack and solution.\n\n26\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.460\nI wanna talk about how we plan for\nwhat we're gonna run in the Cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.540\nWe talked about that at\nthe end of the last episode.\n\n28\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.310\nBut we didn't really talk about\nthe Microsoft specific tool sets\n\n29\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.330\nthat may help us to do that.\n\n30\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.080\nWe have a great little tool\nout there called the MAP tool,\n\n31\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.750\nMicrosoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit.\n\n32\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.160\nIt's gonna help us to figure out, if we\ncan just take a quick look over here.\n\n33\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.750\nWe'll go ahead and\nbring that up and show it to you.\n\n34\n00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.350\nThe Microsoft Assessment and Planning\nToolkit is going to be, and by the way,\n\n35\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.400\nwe do have these URLs captured for\nyou in the show notes.\n\n36\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.930\nYou always know when we\nprovide these websites to you.\n\n37\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.060\nWe encourage you to go out and\ntake a look, just so\n\n38\n00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.230\nthat way you can explore\na little bit on your own.\n\n39\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.660\nMake sure you know where they are.\n\n40\n00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.880\nBut this helps us to figure out what\nare going to be ideal candidates.\n\n41\n00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.590\nApplications and\nservices that can get ported over\n\n42\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.870\ninto our virtual offerings\nenvironments as we run them.\n\n43\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.420\nThis will let us go through,\nassess our current infrastructure.\n\n44\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.860\nLook at applications,\n\n45\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.780\ndesktop servers, all of the stuff\nthat's not in the Cloud today.\n\n46\n00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.880\nAnd get a sense of what's gonna survive\nand thrive there as we move over.\n\n47\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.569\nIt is an interactive tool,\nyou set it up, download it,\n\n48\n00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.417\nrun it, typically on a work station.\n\n49\n00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:09.905\nSomewhere in your environment,\nyou connect it in, you let it go out and\n\n50\n00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:11.081\nprofile the solution.\n\n51\n00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.763\nIt's agentless, so\nit just goes out, scans the system,\n\n52\n00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:17.292\nyou don't have to worry about installing\na whole bunch of agents on things.\n\n53\n00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:19.557\nThen never worry about\nremoving them after the fact.\n\n54\n00:02:19.557 --> 00:02:23.161\nSo it's really simple and straight forward\nAnd then it gives you an interactive\n\n55\n00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.750\nenvironment where you can see reports and\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n56\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.380\nSo it'll help you to be able to go in and\n\n57\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.040\nto assess what offerings may be\nvaluable for you to focus on.\n\n58\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.310\nCurrent version is 9.x, and\nyou can download right from here.\n\n59\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.510\nLet's you run this on Windows 10,\nWindows 8, Windows 7 workstations.\n\n60\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.674\nSo you can run it on a variety of\ndifferent platforms that you may\n\n61\n00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:48.060\ncurrently possess or own.\n\n62\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.190\nAnd the nice thing about\nthe website that we are on here.\n\n63\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.580\nWhere you find the map tool is,\n\n64\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.820\nis there's a lot of other tools that\nare called solution excelerators.\n\n65\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.200\nThat's what Microsoft refers to them as.\n\n66\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.630\nAnd there are a lot of other tools that\nmay be valuable for different areas for\n\n67\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.870\ndifferent reasons here.\n\n68\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.545\nBut things like the MDT, the Microsoft\nDeployment Toolkit that we'll come back in\n\n69\n00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:11.170\na conversation later about\nSCCM System Center Config Manager.\n\n70\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.580\nIf you're gonna go through and\ndo operating system deployments.\n\n71\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.330\nYou're gonna wanna run the MDT toolkit\nto be able to understand how to do that.\n\n72\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.270\nWe've got the MOF framework here,\nthe Microsoft Ops Framework here,\n\n73\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.260\ngovernance risk and\ncompliance capabilities.\n\n74\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.660\nThere's a lot of different valuable tools\nthat you may wanna explore broadly,\n\n75\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.730\nout beyond our conversation here.\n\n76\n00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.840\nBut it is going to help you to understand\nand assess your current environment,\n\n77\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.870\njust so you know.\n\n78\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.630\nYou can download that right from here.\n\n79\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.060\nWe got the download link\nalready loaded up for you.\n\n80\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.910\nSee, this cloud, you download it, and\n\n81\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.830\nthen you install and\njust follow the instructions.\n\n82\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.330\nYou'll see the system requirements here,\njust you you get a sense, as I've said.\n\n83\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.174\nWindows 10, Windows 7 Service Pack One,\nWindows 8, 8.1.\n\n84\n00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:52.840\nAny of the current desktop platforms\nthat you would be running.\n\n85\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.690\nIt will be supported on with no trouble.\n\n86\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.593\nOn the server side, 2008 R2 SP1.\n\n87\n00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:01.969\nCan run it on some older infrastructure\nall the way into the new infrastructure.\n\n88\n00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.109\nStack doesn't require a lot,\n2 gigs of RAM, 1 gig available disk space,\n\n89\n00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.960\npretty minimal footprint,\nright, not a lot.\n\n90\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.850\nCould you run this in a virtual machine\nand then deploy it, and have it scan and\n\n91\n00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.740\ndo everything?\n\n92\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.870\nWe don't tell you that, but yeah,\nyou could run it in a virtual machine.\n\n93\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.730\nIt'll work just as well there, so\nit really won't be a problem at all.\n\n94\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.980\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n95\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.390\nWe do need the .NET framework 4.5, so\nthere's a little download link for\n\n96\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.750\nthat, you'll see it right there.\n\n97\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.340\nAnd we do need to make sure, and\nMicrosoft calls this out as well,\n\n98\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.410\ninstallation of all updates for\nthe OS system, right?\n\n99\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.140\nAnd so they're telling you, hey, you gotta\nbe up to date with your patches to make\n\n100\n00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.960\nsure that you're running this securely.\n\n101\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.530\nSo just be aware of that, it does install\na SQL Server 12 Express database locally.\n\n102\n00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.770\nWe use a local instance, built in.\n\n103\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.862\nSo we could run against that,\ndevelop all the back-end data.\n\n104\n00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:50.350\nPut it in the tables,\nthen do the reporting that we show you.\n\n105\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.053\nSo just be aware of that, and\nthere is some guidance there and\n\n106\n00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:54.539\njust different versions of SQL.\n\n107\n00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.044\nHow to set up some stuff specific to it,\nand\n\n108\n00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:59.630\njust making sure you're in line with that.\n\n109\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.770\nJust very basic, nothing too involved.\n\n110\n00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd you see we do have some install\ninstructions here, very simple.\n\n111\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.760\nJust download, there's a little FAQ\nonline you could go read up on and\n\n112\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.020\nunderstand how to deal with.\n\n113\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.780\nAnd there's some resources, a blog that\nthe MAP team maintains, you go out and\n\n114\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.830\nread up on the tool from there as well.\n\n115\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.450\nAnd just have a sense of how it works.\n\n116\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.720\nSo it would be helpful for\nyou to go take a look.\n\n117\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.789\nProbably a good idea for you to have just\na little bit of knowledge on it, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.006\nAll right, with regards to the MAP tool,\nyou could download that,\n\n119\n00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.660\nuse that to profile\nthe existing infrastructure.\n\n120\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.830\nHelp you to better understand what\ntargets of opportunity may exist for\n\n121\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.470\nyou to be able to start\nmoving things into,\n\n122\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.010\nultimately what will become\nyour C`loud environment.\n\n123\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.215\nBut keep in mind,\nit's a very limited use tool in a sense,\n\n124\n00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:40.760\nthat's what it's designed for.\n\n125\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.600\nYou're not gonna run\nthe tool on a regular basis,\n\n126\n00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.670\nyou're gonna run it once take\nthe recommendations out of there.\n\n127\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.500\nGet what you need and\nthen you're gonna along, right?\n\n128\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.270\nI mean that's basically what it does.\n\n129\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.011\nSo, when we've done that piece, let's just\nsay, hypothetically, we have our hit list.\n\n130\n00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:57.462\nWe've got three or four applications,\ngot our desktop infrastructure,\n\n131\n00:05:57.462 --> 00:05:59.660\nmaybe we're thinking VDI for that.\n\n132\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.780\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure,\ncreate some virtual instances.\n\n133\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.120\nMaybe we've got our server infrastructure,\nwe're gonna port a bunch of servers over.\n\n134\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.710\nOur file and print capabilities,\nour ECM, Enterprise Content Management.\n\n135\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.690\nOur Enterprise Messaging Stack,\nOur Web Services Stack.\n\n136\n00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.610\nThink Exchange, think SharePoint, think\nSQL on the back-end for our databases.\n\n137\n00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.580\nAll the stuff that many of you\nare probably familiar with.\n\n138\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.410\nYou all manage, own, and\nrun on a regular basis.\n\n139\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.300\nThat's the targets or those\nare the targets that this tool will hit.\n\n140\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.890\nAnd say, yeah,\nif you're running SQL 2008 R2, no problem,\n\n141\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.180\nwe can port that over virtualize that.\n\n142\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.020\nGot that SQL 2005 thing going on,\nguess what?\n\n143\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.640\nProbably not gonna be wanting\nto move that into the Cloud.\n\n144\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.670\nMaybe time to think about retiring that,\nmaybe time to think about upgrading that.\n\n145\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.840\nBut that's probably not gonna\nbe a prime candidate, right?\n\n146\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840\nSo all those things that we will find.\n\n147\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.485\nOne of the little things you\nwanna be aware of with this tool,\n\n148\n00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:56.050\none of the vagueries or\njust random things you wanna know.\n\n149\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.984\nIf you've got a lot of custom app\ndev work done in your environment.\n\n150\n00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:01.757\nIn other words, you're hosting\na lot of custom applications.\n\n151\n00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:03.376\nYour own internal dev teams or\n\n152\n00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:07.380\nperhaps external third parties\nunder contract to build for you.\n\n153\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.581\nKeep in mind no guarantee, number one,\nthis tool will identify those correctly.\n\n154\n00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:15.172\nEspecially if they're not .NET\nMicrosoft framework centric.\n\n155\n00:07:15.172 --> 00:07:17.500\nLikelihood is,\nwe're not gonna know much about them.\n\n156\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.917\nWe may identify them, but we're not gonna\nbe able to tell you much about them and\n\n157\n00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:22.560\nwhether they will virtualize or not.\n\n158\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.257\nSo just understand, this is really a tool\ndesigned primarily to focus on Microsoft\n\n159\n00:07:27.257 --> 00:07:28.810\ncentric infrastructure.\n\n160\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.848\nThat we can understand and\nunderstand through interrogation and\n\n161\n00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:33.069\nunderstand the value of.\n\n162\n00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.578\nBecause we own it, we understand that,\ntherefore we can manage and\n\n163\n00:07:35.578 --> 00:07:37.178\nwe can tell you about it.\n\n164\n00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:41.081\nIf you built your custom third party\napp on .NET, we probably can indicate,\n\n165\n00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:45.482\nbased on version number of the framework,\nwhether it's likely to virtualize or not.\n\n166\n00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:49.425\nThat does not mean it's 100% guarantee,\nby the way, that that will work.\n\n167\n00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:52.857\nIt means it's an indication that\nyou are likely to be successful.\n\n168\n00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:55.157\nBig asterisk on that statement.\n\n169\n00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:59.082\nThe caveat is you tried and figured it\nout for yourself cuz there's no way for\n\n170\n00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:02.000\nus to guarantee with custom\ncode that it will work.\n\n171\n00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.530\nI'm not suggesting it won't.\n\n172\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.750\nI'm simply pointing out\nthere's no guarantee it will.\n\n173\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.490\nAnd that's just what you wanna\nunderstand about a tool like this.\n\n174\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.007\nAll right, having said that,\nlet's talk about Hyper-V.\n\n175\n00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:17.300\nHyper-V, Microsoft's hypervisor, this is a\nbare metal hypervisor installed directly.\n\n176\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.110\nAnd people often,\n\n177\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.710\nwe talked about bare metal hypervisors\nhave this conversation all the time.\n\n178\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.900\nI don't know if it has\never confused you or\n\n179\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.180\nyou got caught with this when\nyou were just starting out.\n\n180\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.060\nI know it wrapped my\nhead around a little bit,\n\n181\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.120\nI had trouble getting my\nhead around it early on.\n\n182\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.080\nWhen I started working in the industry and\n\n183\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.850\nI started working back in the age of\nthe dinosaur when we had coconuts and\n\n184\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.200\nvines to create networks and\nthere was no such thing as hypervisors.\n\n185\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.160\nThat didn't exist for the first 25 or so\nyears of my existence in this industry.\n\n186\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.405\nBut back in the day as this started to\nbecome a reality, virtualization, and\n\n187\n00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:53.131\nultimately certainly we think of now as\ncloud technologies, became a realization.\n\n188\n00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.018\nThere are two types of hypervisors,\ntype one and\n\n189\n00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.867\ntype two is how we\ngenerically refer to them as.\n\n190\n00:08:56.867 --> 00:09:02.021\nAnd we talked about them as being either\nbare metal hypervisors, what Hyper-V is,\n\n191\n00:09:02.021 --> 00:09:06.533\nwhat the VM kernel the VMware hypervisor\nis, what the zen hypervisor is.\n\n192\n00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:08.770\nThose are all bare metal hypervisors.\n\n193\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.240\nBut we also talk about a client\nhypervisor, essentially one that runs as\n\n194\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.500\nan application through\na virtualization product of some kind.\n\n195\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.080\nThink VMware Workstation,\n\n196\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.028\nthink Microsoft's, in earlier days,\nMicrosoft's virtual PC.\n\n197\n00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:29.460\nNow, we would think of client side\nHyper-V which is what refer to it as\n\n198\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.690\namong the many iterations that\nit's come through in Microsoft.\n\n199\n00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.435\nThink of VirtualBox,\nthe Oracle Sun solution that's out there,\n\n200\n00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:39.940\nthat's like the Swiss Army Knife of\nvirtualization, it runs anything.\n\n201\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.720\nThink Parallels, think Boot Camp on the\nMac, any of those things, those are all\n\n202\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.350\nclient based hypervisors that install\nas a program on top of an OS and\n\n203\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.960\nyou run them as an application separate,\ndivorced from the OS.\n\n204\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.837\nBut when we think of the bare\nmetal hypervisor, at least for me,\n\n205\n00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:58.302\nI always get a little confused from\nthe beginning because I would think okay,\n\n206\n00:09:58.302 --> 00:10:01.551\nbare metal but then I have to install\nan OS in order to get the hypervisor,\n\n207\n00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:03.123\ncuz that's how it works, right?\n\n208\n00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:06.699\n&gt;&gt; You know Adam, it really is confusing\nwhen you look at it from Microsoft's\n\n209\n00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:10.389\nperspective because the way that you\njust defined it, it seems pretty cut and\n\n210\n00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:11.495\ndry but like you said.\n\n211\n00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:15.698\nIf I go ahead and install Hyper-V as\nan actual role onto a machine that already\n\n212\n00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:19.787\nhas an operating system, it doesn't\nseem like it's totally bare metal.\n\n213\n00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:24.697\nI mean, you can go out and get the free\ncore version just of Hyper-V server, but\n\n214\n00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:26.103\nI don't know though.\n\n215\n00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:29.519\nI guess the only thing that really kept me\nfrom confusing the two is I would think of\n\n216\n00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.484\nit like if you think about the different\nlayers, like you described,\n\n217\n00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:33.712\nthe layers of abstraction.\n\n218\n00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:38.609\nAnd Hyper-V just kind of punches through\nthat layer with the hypervisor to\n\n219\n00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:41.886\ndirectly communicate with the hardware,\nokay.\n\n220\n00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:46.278\nSo that's kind of how I think of it\nbecause it is a type one hypervisor,\n\n221\n00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:51.192\nalthough you may be running on top of\nan operating system instead of just having\n\n222\n00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.040\nit run directly on that\nbare bones hardware.\n\n223\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.850\n&gt;&gt; More often than not you will,\nI mean there is certainly,\n\n224\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.540\nin the enterprise level and\nthe hosted environment,\n\n225\n00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.280\nyou may be running core server.\n\n226\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.230\nAnd you may be installing through there,\nbut most enterprise hosting today,\n\n227\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.730\nas you were suggesting, is done through\nserver of some kind, some sort of OS.\n\n228\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.230\nEven on the Linux side, we're still\nrunning an OS that binds the hypervisor\n\n229\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.270\nas a feature traditionally,\nas you were suggesting we install it.\n\n230\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.990\nThat's what we do in Windows,\nwe do in any OS.\n\n231\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.360\nYou install VMware's or\nESXi operating system, vSphere ESXi.\n\n232\n00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.120\nAnd it brings the VM kernel\nas part of that and installs,\n\n233\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.510\nit's a Linux based operating system.\n\n234\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.860\nAnd we use that operating system to\nessentially instantiate the hypervisor.\n\n235\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.900\nSame thing with Microsoft's Server,\ngo all the way back to 2008,\n\n236\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.956\nas we started doing gen one of Hyper-V and\nwe moved through several generations or\n\n237\n00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:43.190\niterations of it, and into the latest\nserver 16 for instance, now.\n\n238\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.760\nAll of them install Hyper-V as a role or\na feature after the fact.\n\n239\n00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.198\nAnd then we use it, and I like the way\nyou described it, we punch through.\n\n240\n00:11:51.198 --> 00:11:53.574\nOr I just think of it as binding,\nbut essentially the same idea,\n\n241\n00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:54.898\nwhat you were suggesting, right.\n\n242\n00:11:54.898 --> 00:11:57.942\nWe punch through or\nbind to those resources and\n\n243\n00:11:57.942 --> 00:12:02.484\nthe key defining characteristic of\nthe hypervisor is it abstracts.\n\n244\n00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:07.614\nIt removes the direct knowledge of those\nresources coming through the host OS and\n\n245\n00:12:07.614 --> 00:12:12.410\npresents them to guest OSs remember,\nguest OSs are virtual machines.\n\n246\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:18.990\nPresents them to the guest OS to the VM as\nif they were directly a part of that VM,\n\n247\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.575\nphysical and logical notwithstanding\ncuz the VM doesn't know the difference.\n\n248\n00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:28.045\nThe virtual machine guest OS sees those\nresources as actually being its own, and\n\n249\n00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:29.515\nthinks they are physically,\n\n250\n00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:32.995\ndirectly available to it as if\nit was running in real hardware.\n\n251\n00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:36.175\nIt doesn't understand the idea of the fact\nthat it's running in a memory isolated\n\n252\n00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:41.637\nbubble, essentially abstracted as\na set of files that are animated and\n\n253\n00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:45.287\nbrought to life through the hypervisor\nthat are then being given resources\n\n254\n00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:46.367\nthrough a control channel,\n\n255\n00:12:46.367 --> 00:12:49.397\ncommunication channel which is as you\nwere suggesting what the hypervisor does.\n\n256\n00:12:49.397 --> 00:12:54.153\nSo, it's very important to understand that\nwe call this a bare metal hypervisor, cuz\n\n257\n00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:59.597\nthat's what Hyper-V is, and for purposes\nof not only our discussion but for\n\n258\n00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:04.360\npurposes of your success both on an exam\nand theory at some point in the future,\n\n259\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.025\nand in the real word just as you're\ntalking to your peers and colleagues.\n\n260\n00:13:07.025 --> 00:13:09.887\nIt's important for you to be able\nto understand the difference and\n\n261\n00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:13.425\ndifferentiate appropriately as you discuss\nit and and call it what it is, right.\n\n262\n00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:16.039\nIt is a bare mental hypervisor,\nso understand that.\n\n263\n00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:18.017\nInstalled directly on the bare mental,\n\n264\n00:13:18.017 --> 00:13:21.490\nas Cherokee was suggesting we\ncould download the free version.\n\n265\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.240\nAll the major vendors have\ntheir free version of that.\n\n266\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.894\nAgain, VMware, Citrix, etc,\nthey all have free versions of their\n\n267\n00:13:27.894 --> 00:13:31.410\nhypervisors that will run\nliterally bare metal.\n\n268\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.645\nAlmost bare metal, I mean there is some\nsort of an install program OS thing you\n\n269\n00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:37.400\nhave to do to get it running.\n\n270\n00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.240\nSo it's not really, really, really,\nbare metal, but it's just a term we use.\n\n271\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.100\nBut there is an operational environment\nthat's instantiated that allows\n\n272\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.090\nthe hypervisor to bind to those resources.\n\n273\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.820\nBut the hypervisor and\nthe operational environment are one in\n\n274\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.400\nthe same in the sense that they\nare related to each other.\n\n275\n00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.900\nIt's not a separate\napplication that installs and\n\n276\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.250\nruns as a program on top of that OS.\n\n277\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.920\nThat would be the defining\ncharacteristic or\n\n278\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.040\nthe difference between\nthe two types of hypervisors.\n\n279\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.600\n&gt;&gt; Good way to put it.\n\n280\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\nI worked on that all day yesterday\n\n281\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.310\nbefore I came in here to talk to you guys.\n\n282\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.190\nI was really nervous\nabout that by the way.\n\n283\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.292\nCuz, you know, if I got that wrong boy,\n[SOUND] Cherokee was going to take me out\n\n284\n00:14:12.292 --> 00:14:13.181\nback and-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n285\n00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.375\n&gt;&gt; She was just going to beat me\nsenseless if I didn't get that right.\n\n286\n00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:20.295\nAll right, so Hyper-V installed on your\nserver, Server 12, R2, whatever it is.\n\n287\n00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:22.085\nNot very difficult to go and install.\n\n288\n00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:22.635\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n289\n00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:25.585\nif you wanna just join me here for one\nsecond, we're not going to install it but\n\n290\n00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.685\nI'm gonna show you a couple of cool\nthings about what you can do with it.\n\n291\n00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:28.930\nJust give it just a second here.\n\n292\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.830\nLet's go into our little\ndemonstration environment.\n\n293\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.510\nWhat I have here is a typical lab\nenvironment we use for all sorts of stuff.\n\n294\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.770\nI'm gonna show you some PowerShell\ntips and tricks here along the way.\n\n295\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.820\nBut you probably,\nif you are familiar with Hyper-V,\n\n296\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.130\nnotice we do have Hyper-V Manager\nalready up and running here.\n\n297\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.620\nI've got it installed here,\nlet me just click here real quick and\n\n298\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.720\nsee that my console is locked out.\n\n299\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.520\nJust one second,\njust timed out cuz I wasn't in there.\n\n300\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.910\nSo let me just log back in,\njust one second while we do that.\n\n301\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.860\nThere we go,\nthat's going to work a lot better now.\n\n302\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.880\nSo we've got Hyper-V up and running in\nthere, I've already installed it and\n\n303\n00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880\nconfigured it.\n\n304\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.200\nSo this is, if you haven't seen it,\n\n305\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.380\nwhat it looks like this is just\nthe GUI management interface.\n\n306\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.950\nNow we can manage this from PowerShell,\nwe'll take a look at that in a moment.\n\n307\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.330\nBut if you have to install and\nconfigure this,\n\n308\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.755\nall you need to do is bring\nup the Server Manager.\n\n309\n00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:18.105\nAnd you would simply go in here to Manage.\n\n310\n00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:21.905\nAnd under Manage,\nyou would Add Roles &amp; Features.\n\n311\n00:15:21.905 --> 00:15:25.730\nThis is how we would stand up\na Hyper-V instance on a machine,\n\n312\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.260\nassuming we were doing it through the GUI.\n\n313\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.450\nIf we're doing it through PowerShell,\n\n314\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.520\nI'm gonna show you how to do it\nthrough PowerShell in a minute.\n\n315\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.340\nIt's essentially the same thing,\nwe're just not pointing and clicking.\n\n316\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.240\nPowerShell's going in and\n\n317\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.460\ndoing all this for us, but\nI'm gonna show you the install cmdlet or\n\n318\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.720\nthe string that will let you do this exact\nthing through PowerShell in just a minute.\n\n319\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.190\nI'm gonna show you what that looks like.\n\n320\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.880\nSo we would use the Add Roles and\nFeatures Wizard here.\n\n321\n00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.780\nGo through role based or\n\n322\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.440\nfeature based install, so\nwe're gonna select the default there.\n\n323\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.100\nWe're gonna select a server.\n\n324\n00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.604\nObviously, in our role we only have\nthe local server we're running on, so\n\n325\n00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:54.859\nthere's not a lot of mystery there.\n\n326\n00:15:54.859 --> 00:15:57.281\nBut if you had multiple servers,\nif you were in a cluster,\n\n327\n00:15:57.281 --> 00:15:58.968\nResource pools, something like that.\n\n328\n00:15:58.968 --> 00:16:00.272\nYou just select the appropriate target.\n\n329\n00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:04.360\nIf you're gonna do it remotely, just make\nsure you have the appropriate thing.\n\n330\n00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.510\nIn Windows,\nin Microsoft we call it a server pool,\n\n331\n00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.890\nyou heard me refer to it as a cluster or\nresource pool.\n\n332\n00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.840\nIt's different terms depending on\nwhat vendor solution you're using.\n\n333\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.990\nA server pool is just a collection\nof servers that we're gonna target.\n\n334\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.830\nWe'll select one out of that pool,\nthat's all that means.\n\n335\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.550\nSo we have one there,\nthat's our local instance.\n\n336\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.850\nThen we go through and you could see\nhere Hyper-V's already installed.\n\n337\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.230\nBut as a role, it's there.\n\n338\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.140\nYou would just check it off.\n\n339\n00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.980\nYou would then go through if there's\nany supporting requirements.\n\n340\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.110\nThe wizard is smart\nenough to tell you that.\n\n341\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.770\nThere are additional tools and features\nyou may need, it'll pop up and say, hey,\n\n342\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.260\nwhat about all these things?\n\n343\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.810\nYou'll say, absolutely, click OK.\n\n344\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.910\nSo you'll do that.\n\n345\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:39.940\nAnd then you're off and running.\n\n346\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.910\nTakes a couple of minutes depending\non how quick your machine is.\n\n347\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.310\nAnd then it'll be configured.\n\n348\n00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.624\nIt doesn't require a restart, which is\nnice, we've got out of that whole hey,\n\n349\n00:16:47.624 --> 00:16:51.140\nlet's restart every time we do something,\nthe treadmill we were on for years.\n\n350\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.190\nSo that's pretty simple, so\nthat's if you do it from the GUI.\n\n351\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.319\nWhat if you wanna do it\nfrom the command line?\n\n352\n00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.610\nWell, in PowerShell, right here.\n\n353\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.380\nSee I cheated a little bit and I typed out\na bunch of commands for you ahead of time.\n\n354\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.370\nBecause as you know,\n\n355\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.470\nif you've seen me in prior shows,\nI am the world's absolute worst typer.\n\n356\n00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.130\nI am even more horrible at\nspelling than I am at typing.\n\n357\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.440\nSo it's usually better for\nme to type stuff out ahead of time.\n\n358\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.770\nSo you could see install WindowsFeature.\n\n359\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.800\nYou would just do this from PowerShell.\n\n360\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.220\nWhat's the name of the feature?\n\n361\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.360\nHyper- V, Hyper-V.\n\n362\n00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.065\nWhat computer are we targeting?\n\n363\n00:17:22.065 --> 00:17:23.390\nComputername parameter,\n\n364\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.468\nspecify the name of the computer,\nthis will be the local machine.\n\n365\n00:17:26.468 --> 00:17:30.190\nAnd then includemanagementtools that's\ngoing to include all the supporting\n\n366\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.500\nelements required to do the install.\n\n367\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.520\nAnd then if I want to restart I can\nforce a restart with the restart switch,\n\n368\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.300\nI don't have to, it's up to you.\n\n369\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.700\nBut if you do that, that'll install\nHyper-V in whatever machine you target,\n\n370\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.680\njust substitute the local value for\nyour computer name there, and\n\n371\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.400\nthat'll let you install Hyper-V directly\nfrom PowerShell with no trouble.\n\n372\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.870\nI'm going to do one of these.\n\n373\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.380\nAnd we're done.\n\n374\n00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.180\nI should drop the mic.\n\n375\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.880\nThere you go, right?\n\n376\n00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.510\nSo that's how you would do that,\nvery simple, very easy to do.\n\n377\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:59.250\nSo you would start, you set it up,\nit then takes control of it being Hyper-V,\n\n378\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.030\ntakes control of the physical resources on\nthe box and then makes it available, makes\n\n379\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.140\nthem available to us so that we can start\ncreating and hosting virtual machines.\n\n380\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.613\nSo, let's go in, let's quickly take\na look at how we can create a VM,\n\n381\n00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:13.201\nyou see I have one there already.\n\n382\n00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.700\nJust to click over here so\nyou can see it, adam01.\n\n383\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.320\nNow, I created that VM but\nI didn't do it through the GUI.\n\n384\n00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.040\nI didn't come in, right click, to new VM.\n\n385\n00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.940\nI could do that but we don't need no\nGUI to be able to do this, right?\n\n386\n00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.340\nWe are gonna do it through PowerShell.\n\n387\n00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.110\nSo let me show you how to\ndo that from PowerShell.\n\n388\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.460\nAnd I'm gonna show you just\na real simple one liner\n\n389\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.960\njust to create the config\nfile essentially as a shell.\n\n390\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.250\nWe can then go in and edit it.\n\n391\n00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.820\nI'll show you a little more involved\nscript in a couple of minutes that'll let\n\n392\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.690\nyou provision the entire VM,\nmemory, CPU, switch affiliation,\n\n393\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.050\nnetwork, storage, you name it.\n\n394\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.090\nI'll show you a PowerShell\nscript that'll do all of that.\n\n395\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.970\nAnd I'll show you what that looks like.\n\n396\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.080\nBut let's just start with the basics for\na minute.\n\n397\n00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.910\nSo let's go in here real quick.\n\n398\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.030\nSee line number two right here, new-vm.\n\n399\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.065\nOops, hold on let me\nhighlight that the right way.\n\n400\n00:18:59.065 --> 00:19:03.470\nnew-vm, now, what this is going to do,\n\n401\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.730\nI'm gonna stop right here just on\nthis part just for the beginning.\n\n402\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.030\nThat one, new-vm, and let me actually\nmake this just a little bigger so\n\n403\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.760\nyou guys can see this.\n\n404\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.780\nI think we're at 16 right now,\nlet's go to 20.\n\n405\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.440\nThat is probably a little bit easier for\nyou to see.\n\n406\n00:19:20.822 --> 00:19:24.300\nSo, new-vm name and\nthen whatever the name of the VM will be,\n\n407\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.840\nthat will give you that shell that\nI just showed you in Hyper-V.\n\n408\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.840\nAll that is, is essentially a place holder\nwith a metadata descriptor and name.\n\n409\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.990\nAnd it's got no configured settings yet.\n\n410\n00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.620\nI would have to go in and edit all that.\n\n411\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.660\nNow, could you then go in and\ndo that yourself?\n\n412\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.070\nAbsolutely, if you wanna go in and\nyou already have a base image.\n\n413\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.030\nYou have like a hard drive you wanna\nattach to a VM, run that VM with that hard\n\n414\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.880\ndrive, give it 4 gigs of memory, that full\ncommand line right there, assuming of\n\n415\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.980\ncourse you modify the variables vhdpath\nwill be local to wherever you are.\n\n416\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.510\nYou'd have to have a drive\nwith a folder called vhd and\n\n417\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.960\na base image .vhdx file sitting\nin there to run that VM.\n\n418\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.840\nBut assuming you did that,\nthat would spin the VM up and\n\n419\n00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.750\nallow you to give it 4\ngigabytes of memory and\n\n420\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:11.290\nrun it, assuming we already had a generic\nVHDX file that we wanted to use.\n\n421\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.630\nSo I can create just the shell and\nedit it.\n\n422\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.800\nI can grab an existing hard drive,\ngive it some memory and run it.\n\n423\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.690\nThere's lots of different\nthings that we can do.\n\n424\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.560\nNow how do you learn about all this stuff?\n\n425\n00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.780\nWell, you can obviously talk to myself,\nCherokee Boose and us.\n\n426\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.480\nOr anybody else that talks\nto you about PowerShell.\n\n427\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.120\nBut if you wanna do this on your own,\nhere's what you wanna do right here.\n\n428\n00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.724\nGet the commands for\nthe Hyper-V module in PowerShell.\n\n429\n00:20:33.724 --> 00:20:36.456\nget-command -module, what module, hyper-v.\n\n430\n00:20:36.456 --> 00:20:40.990\nPipe that, the stand up line right there,\nthis thing right here is called a pipe.\n\n431\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.870\nThe pipe in PowerShell does something\npretty cool, pretty amazing, right?\n\n432\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.593\nWhat the pipe does, in case you're\nnot familiar with PowerShell,\n\n433\n00:20:47.593 --> 00:20:50.523\nin case you don't know, is it takes\nwhatever's on the left of the pipe.\n\n434\n00:20:50.523 --> 00:20:54.881\nSo in this case, the get-command,\n-module hyper-v, right?\n\n435\n00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:57.576\nRuns that sets of commandlets,\nso this will go out,\n\n436\n00:20:57.576 --> 00:21:01.030\nthis first part of the command will\nrun in the PowerShell command.\n\n437\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.212\nAnd I'm gonna show you this\nin a minute in the show.\n\n438\n00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:06.794\nIt's gonna go, search for\nthe module called Hyper-V,\n\n439\n00:21:06.794 --> 00:21:09.520\nit's gonna get all of the commands for\nthe Hyper-V module,\n\n440\n00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.970\nit's going to load them up into memory and\nessentially keep them there.\n\n441\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.290\nWe're then saying with the pipe,\ntake everything from the left-hand side,\n\n442\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.490\npass it over the pipe, and give it\nto the commandlet on the right, and\n\n443\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.150\nthen execute the commandlet\non the right and\n\n444\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.430\nuse the input from the left\nto then drive that command.\n\n445\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.780\nSo what the pipe does,\n\n446\n00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.740\nis it lets us differentiate\nbetween two sets of commands.\n\n447\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:35.300\nAnd let's us create input on the left, and\npass it to make it output on the right.\n\n448\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.680\nAnd then execute that as input against\nwhatever the output command will be.\n\n449\n00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.780\nAnd you see I'm using pipes in most\nof my little script lines there.\n\n450\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.660\nThe next three or four down all have pipes\nsomewhere in them to do various things.\n\n451\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.270\nAs a matter of fact, the second one\ndown from where we are, get-vm where\n\n452\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:56.720\nparentheses open, ($_state equals,\n-eq is shorthand for equals off.\n\n453\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.110\nAnd then pipe that to Start-VM.\n\n454\n00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.050\nI got two pipes in the same line, right?\n\n455\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:05.100\nCoz if one is good, two is better\nis the thought process there.\n\n456\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.960\nSo we could pipe continuously through a\nline, moving from left to right as we go.\n\n457\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.700\nBut what that command that I've\nhighlighted is gonna do for\n\n458\n00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.345\nus is that following.\n\n459\n00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.555\nLet's grab that real quick.\n\n460\n00:22:15.555 --> 00:22:17.270\nLet's come over here to PowerShell.\n\n461\n00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.330\nLet's just put that in there, let's click\nhere to make sure that we can use that.\n\n462\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.560\nnow when I'm piping it out to grid view,\nwhat out -gridview does,\n\n463\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.560\nis it puts up a pop up window for us that\nis formated, it's actually like a table,\n\n464\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.470\njust table in a shell window.\n\n465\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.060\nThat we can then manipulate and work with.\n\n466\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.220\nSo it gives us a nice\nlittle separate window,\n\n467\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.220\nthat is going to pop up\nshowing us this information.\n\n468\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.720\nSo when I do that,\ngot this right here, its searchable,\n\n469\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.180\nI got a little add criteria thing,\nI can filter.\n\n470\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.890\nBut what this does is this gives me a list\nof all of the different, and notice\n\n471\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.260\nthe module name, hyper-v, gives us a list\nof all of the different commandlets.\n\n472\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.020\nAs I'm scrolling down,\n\n473\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.660\nyou could see there's several hundred\nof them associated with Hyper-V.\n\n474\n00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.930\nNow we have a separate command\nshell dedicated to SCVMM,\n\n475\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.960\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager\nwith its own module,\n\n476\n00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.360\nits own commands, it does support\nthe Hyper-V commands but there are other\n\n477\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.550\ncommands specific to System Center\nVirtual Machine Manager in there.\n\n478\n00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.370\nYou'll see me run that, we'll talk about,\nthen at some point we'll take\n\n479\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.300\na look at it, but it's loaded when\nyou install and configure SCVMM.\n\n480\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.350\nAnd you're gonna see us do that\nin upcoming episodes, by the way.\n\n481\n00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.400\nCherokee, is gonna roll her sleeves up,\nget in there, fight the good fight and\n\n482\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.770\nconfigure SCVMM for it.\n\n483\n00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.710\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n484\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.610\nShe doesn't know she's doing that but\nit's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n485\n00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.900\nSo you're gonna see us walk through and\ndo a live demo for\n\n486\n00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.930\nyou on how to do an install.\n\n487\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.390\nBut in the meantime, you could at least\nknow that there's a separate dedicated\n\n488\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.740\nmanagement shell specific to that.\n\n489\n00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.480\nAnd the way we load these commands\nis through the idea of a module in\n\n490\n00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.264\nPowerShell.\n\n491\n00:23:44.264 --> 00:23:48.788\nThe module is really just a preconfigured\nset of instructions with all the commands\n\n492\n00:23:48.788 --> 00:23:53.052\nand all the supporting elements associated\nwith it available to us that either\n\n493\n00:23:53.052 --> 00:23:53.580\nimport.\n\n494\n00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.648\nWe can use an import module command in\nPowerShell to bring those functions in,\n\n495\n00:23:57.648 --> 00:23:59.571\nload them up, make them available.\n\n496\n00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:03.797\nOr if we run one of the pretty configured\nmanagement shells specific to our product.\n\n497\n00:24:03.797 --> 00:24:08.912\nThe SCVMM shell for instance or the SCOM\nthe system center ops manager shell.\n\n498\n00:24:08.912 --> 00:24:12.990\nOr whatever it is the exchange management\nshell, the SharePoint shell, whatever.\n\n499\n00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.760\nThose are just pre loaded.\n\n500\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.350\nThose modules are already set up and\navailable in there ready for you.\n\n501\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.500\nYou don't have to bother to import them.\n\n502\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.660\nSo it's just a matter of\nhow you choose to do it.\n\n503\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.040\nBut could I load those modules\nspecific to System Center and\n\n504\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.050\nAzure Active Directory Management into\nmy generic PowerShell section and\n\n505\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.140\nuse them right there?\n\n506\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.040\nAbsolutely, just use\nthe import module command,\n\n507\n00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.280\nand you'll be able to do\nthat with no trouble.\n\n508\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.350\nSo we can do this.\n\n509\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.620\nNow let's go back if we could,\n\n510\n00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.280\njust take a look at a couple of\nwhiz bang things, real quick.\n\n511\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.890\nSo I can output it here,\nand I can use this, but\n\n512\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.390\nthe problem is I've got\nno way of saving this.\n\n513\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.620\nI've got no way of interacting with it.\n\n514\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.440\nI can't print it out.\n\n515\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.280\nIt's just that it's a flat window.\n\n516\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.320\nIt's nice to work with, but\n\n517\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.660\nI'd have to have it up and\nconstantly be looking at it.\n\n518\n00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.440\nIf you want something a little\nmore portable that's searchable,\n\n519\n00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.040\nwhy not do this?\n\n520\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.030\nInstead of out-gridview, right.\n\n521\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.920\nLet's just do,\nyou could do pipe it to out file, right?\n\n522\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:10.550\nOr the equivalent of piping it to out\nfile if you're old school, is just this.\n\n523\n00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.620\nOops, just do that.\n\n524\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.461\nDo this, give it a name.\n\n525\n00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:26.751\nAnd all I did was just output that same\ninformation to a text file on the C\n\n526\n00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:30.123\ndrive in the VHD directory\ncalled command.txt.\n\n527\n00:25:30.123 --> 00:25:32.560\nAnd that just may make\na little more portable for me.\n\n528\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.360\nSee it's right there.\n\n529\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.490\nIf I go in, open that up,\nuse our Notepad tool.\n\n530\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.400\nYou'll see I've got all\nthose same commands but\n\n531\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.290\nnow they're sitting in Notepad.\n\n532\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.080\nCould I then print them, do something with\nthem, make notes on them, who knows what?\n\n533\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Like use it like a check list to\ngo through as you're studying, and\n\n534\n00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.680\nsay hey do I know what this stuff does?\n\n535\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.\n\n536\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.340\nSo just be a great way for you to\nmake this a little more portable and\n\n537\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.810\ninteractive for you since you can\ntake it out and work with it.\n\n538\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.850\nSo you can just export it out that way.\n\n539\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.437\nI just showed you out gridview because\nit's nice to pop it up on the screen.\n\n540\n00:26:01.437 --> 00:26:03.922\nBut reality is out gridview's\nnot all that practical.\n\n541\n00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:06.496\nIt's just, for something small where\nyou're working quickly trying to find\n\n542\n00:26:06.496 --> 00:26:07.709\nsomething, it makes a lot of sense.\n\n543\n00:26:07.709 --> 00:26:10.275\nBut when you wanna actually have it,\nprint it out, make notes,\n\n544\n00:26:10.275 --> 00:26:13.318\nwork with it, maybe study with it like\nCherokee was suggesting Out GridView\n\n545\n00:26:13.318 --> 00:26:14.759\njust doesn't really work for you.\n\n546\n00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:17.518\n[LAUGH] So, this may make\na little bit more sense for you.\n\n547\n00:26:17.518 --> 00:26:19.111\nSo, we could do it that way.\n\n548\n00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:20.690\nWouldn't be too hard to do.\n\n549\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.520\nNow, having said that, one of\nthe thing I just wanna show you here,\n\n550\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.080\nsince we're talking about Hyper-V, let's\ntake a look at all the Hyper-V components.\n\n551\n00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.193\nCan we go full screen, cuz you're\ngonna have trouble seeing this with me\n\n552\n00:26:31.193 --> 00:26:33.092\nsitting over top of\nthe half the file there.\n\n553\n00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:36.100\nBut this is gonna allow\nus to be able to go in.\n\n554\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.650\nJust show you all the different components\nthat make up the Hyper-V solution.\n\n555\n00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.040\nThis Word document will be\navailable to you in the show notes.\n\n556\n00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.470\nWe're gonna make sure\nyou have a copy of it.\n\n557\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.827\nA little chart I just put together for\nyou.\n\n558\n00:26:45.827 --> 00:26:48.886\nSo you'll see we have the different\nvirtualization components,\n\n559\n00:26:48.886 --> 00:26:52.329\nthe configuration component,\nHypercall, the Hyper-V module itself,\n\n560\n00:26:52.329 --> 00:26:56.220\nthe Virtual Machine Management Service,\nthe Virtualization Service Providers.\n\n561\n00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.990\nYou go down all this stuff is here.\n\n562\n00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.430\nThis just breaks out for you,\nyou see it's about two pages,\n\n563\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.610\nright, just what all\nthe working components are.\n\n564\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:08.160\nThe individual pieces that make\nHyper-V do what it does and\n\n565\n00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.040\nallows it or allows the role\nto be able to function, right?\n\n566\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.110\nSo this is all the stuff that\nyou're gonna wanna look at.\n\n567\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.680\nWould this be good for\nyou to take a look at and\n\n568\n00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.390\nmake sure you're familiar\nwith as you're studying?\n\n569\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.160\nDefinitely.\n\n570\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.540\nMay you get some questions on an exam at\nsome point about whether or not this or\n\n571\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.270\nthat is part of this solution and\nwhat does it do?\n\n572\n00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.010\nYou never know.\n\n573\n00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.150\nI'm not saying you will, but\nI'm also not saying you couldn't, right?\n\n574\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.410\nSo it's possible.\n\n575\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.470\nSo, any day is Tuesday.\n\n576\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.990\nSomewhere in the world,\nit's probably Tuesday going on.\n\n577\n00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.530\nSo you just wanna think about\nthe fact that it's likely\n\n578\n00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.350\nthat this information may be valuable for\nyou.\n\n579\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.250\nSo we've got that up there,\njust thought we'd show that to you.\n\n580\n00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.500\nWhile we're here, there's also\nthe ability to go out online to look\n\n581\n00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.160\nup all the Hyper-V commands I just showed\nyou that you can pull out of PowerShell.\n\n582\n00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.520\nYou can see them right there\non Microsoft's website.\n\n583\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.589\nNow the reason that I would\nsuggest you may wanna look online\n\n584\n00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.790\nat some point, right?\n\n585\n00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.550\nOnly for the following reasons.\n\n586\n00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:05.540\nThe cmdlets you have locally in your\nsystem are gonna be frozen in a moment\n\n587\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.050\nin time, unless use the PowerShell\nto go out and update and\n\n588\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.640\ndownload the latest cmdlets.\n\n589\n00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.870\nMake sure it's integrating all\nthe updates to the library.\n\n590\n00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.430\nWe add new functionality,\n\n591\n00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.370\nthere's new cmdlets based in the features\nbased on the lest deployment.\n\n592\n00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.800\nSo there are may be things that you are\nnot able to do in your version of the Ls\n\n593\n00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.530\nwith PowerShell that\nare supported in later versions.\n\n594\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.250\nAnd you won't see them because your\nversion of PowerShell will not run them.\n\n595\n00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.495\nAnd so if you want to see the latest\ninformation, it's a good idea to always\n\n596\n00:28:29.495 --> 00:28:33.245\nlooks those up online cuz you'll\nsee based on the last update.\n\n597\n00:28:33.245 --> 00:28:39.080\nThis was updated May 17th, 2017 so\nif you are looking at an older version or\n\n598\n00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.020\nPowerShell that doesn't\nsupport some of this.\n\n599\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.430\nYou may or may not see these commands when\nyou output them or do an out gridview but\n\n600\n00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.210\nthey would be here.\n\n601\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.460\nSo it's just important to know you\ncan go out and find these things\n\n602\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.140\nin different places not necessarily\njust always rely on what's local.\n\n603\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.390\nIn general, with tools like this,\n\n604\n00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.530\nwe always tell you, hey,\nlook at the local machine, start there.\n\n605\n00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.890\nBut always go out on the Web because you\nnever know if something's been updated,\n\n606\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.570\nand you wanna make sure\nyou understand that, okay?\n\n607\n00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.760\nLet's go back to PowerShell in here,\nlet me just demo a couple other things for\n\n608\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.670\nyou that may be of interest to you.\n\n609\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.730\nThere's a lot of really cool\nstuff we can do in here.\n\n610\n00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.450\nSo let's go back to our\nlittle cheat sheet of stuff.\n\n611\n00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.420\nSo I showed you the first three commands.\n\n612\n00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.320\nLet's say that you have a VM, right,\n\n613\n00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.990\nalready created, get-vm would be a command\nthat goes out and gets all the virtual\n\n614\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.765\nmachines that are available given\nparameters, whatever you choose to add on.\n\n615\n00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:30.327\nGet-vm pipe that to a where statement.\n\n616\n00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:32.823\nNow the where statement\nkind of cool in PowerShell.\n\n617\n00:29:32.823 --> 00:29:35.621\nIt allows you to specify\nwhat the parameter or\n\n618\n00:29:35.621 --> 00:29:40.185\nrequirement will be that you want to\nuse as a filter against the command and\n\n619\n00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:42.490\nthis case get VM where, something.\n\n620\n00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.430\nSome state or some value or\n\n621\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.260\nsome event has happened,\nthere's all sorts of ways you can go here.\n\n622\n00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.300\nSo we're doing where a state\nis equal to running.\n\n623\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.480\nI would run that and any VM that is turned\non would come back in my subdivided or\n\n624\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.795\nfiltered list.\n\n625\n00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:01.060\nGet-vm where state is equal to off,\nbut then, guess what?\n\n626\n00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.480\nI can pipe that list to another command.\n\n627\n00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.680\nStart all the VMs that are turned off.\n\n628\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.220\nSo that second one down,\nthis one right here\n\n629\n00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.140\nwill take a list of all the VMs that are\ncurrently off and start them up for me.\n\n630\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.393\nJust by running one straight,\nmaybe 30 letters or so.\n\n631\n00:30:16.393 --> 00:30:19.024\nAnd that would actually let me start\nup all the VMs that have been turned\n\n632\n00:30:19.024 --> 00:30:20.440\noff, right.\n\n633\n00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.890\nSo you can see that.\n\n634\n00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.140\nWhat about creating a snapshot?\n\n635\n00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.000\nI can do that.\n\n636\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.170\nAnything I can do in the GUI environment,\nI can do from PowerShell, right.\n\n637\n00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.630\nGet VM, name again,\n\n638\n00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:33.950\nspecify the target, in this case Adam01,\nthat's the one I created up above.\n\n639\n00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.260\nPipe that to Checkpoint-vm and then create\na snapshot with the snapshot name and\n\n640\n00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:38.830\ngive it a name.\n\n641\n00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.483\nI called mine Snappy1, cuz you know\nthat's a good name for a snapshot.\n\n642\n00:30:41.483 --> 00:30:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Snappy I like it.\n\n643\n00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's a good one.\n\n644\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.190\nYou always wanna use a number for\nthese kind of things, so\n\n645\n00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.070\nyou can keep track of them.\n\n646\n00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.160\nYou know what they are right?\n\n647\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.500\nSo you could see I could do that and\nthat would allow me to go in and\n\n648\n00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.960\ncreate a snapshot right?\n\n649\n00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.820\nSo I'd be able to go in and\n\n650\n00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.980\ndo anything I wanna do with this\nVM created locally in Hyper-V.\n\n651\n00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.510\nBut here's the challenge with Hyper-V.\n\n652\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.395\nI'm managing just the VMs\non this one host.\n\n653\n00:31:01.395 --> 00:31:03.655\nAnd I'm managing them local to this host.\n\n654\n00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:05.515\nI could use PowerShell to remote.\n\n655\n00:31:05.515 --> 00:31:08.925\nI can create a remote connection through\nPowerShell, secure it to the host.\n\n656\n00:31:08.925 --> 00:31:10.545\nThere are ways I could\nuse PowerShell remotely.\n\n657\n00:31:10.545 --> 00:31:13.457\nIt's more involved, we're not gonna\nget into that in this conversation.\n\n658\n00:31:13.457 --> 00:31:16.437\nBut I definitely could use PowerShell\nas a remote management tool.\n\n659\n00:31:16.437 --> 00:31:19.477\nBut I'm still using it\nagainst one host at a time.\n\n660\n00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:22.477\nCould I batch the job out\nto multiple hosts and\n\n661\n00:31:22.477 --> 00:31:24.407\nrun this on 25 hosts simultaneously?\n\n662\n00:31:24.407 --> 00:31:25.947\nCould do that with PowerShell as well.\n\n663\n00:31:25.947 --> 00:31:27.007\nIt's a very flexible tool.\n\n664\n00:31:27.007 --> 00:31:32.077\nBut even then, it's not giving me all of\nthe capabilities that I would like easily.\n\n665\n00:31:32.077 --> 00:31:33.690\nI gotta really work at it.\n\n666\n00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.450\nSomething like\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager\n\n667\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.090\nis gonna give me a GUI environment\nwhere I can load hosts up and\n\n668\n00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.770\nI can manage them all\nfrom a central console.\n\n669\n00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.782\nWe'll talk about that scalability\nin upcoming conversations and\n\n670\n00:31:45.782 --> 00:31:47.618\nreally see how we scale up and scale out.\n\n671\n00:31:47.618 --> 00:31:51.602\nAnd we create switches and road balancers\nand IP pools, Mac address pools,\n\n672\n00:31:51.602 --> 00:31:55.898\nlogical networks, and mirror the physical\nnetworks and create VM networks, and\n\n673\n00:31:55.898 --> 00:31:58.094\nstop me when you hear something you like.\n\n674\n00:31:58.094 --> 00:31:59.336\n&gt;&gt; That's it, Adam?\n\n675\n00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:01.299\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's only like the first five minutes.\n\n676\n00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:03.009\n&gt;&gt; That's all?\n&gt;&gt; That's just with my eyes closed.\n\n677\n00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:04.158\nBefore I even get started.\n\n678\n00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:07.197\nWe're gonna do all that stuff, but all\nthat's gonna happen in a separate product.\n\n679\n00:32:07.197 --> 00:32:09.710\nRight now,\nwe're running just our one machine.\n\n680\n00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.290\nSo let's take a look.\n\n681\n00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.790\nI promised you I would show you\na script that let's you set up a VM and\n\n682\n00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.930\nstand it up start to finish.\n\n683\n00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.410\nLet's take a look at what that looks like.\n\n684\n00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.260\nSo this script right here will show\nyou how to create a virtual machine\n\n685\n00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.020\nusing PowerShell.\n\n686\n00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.610\nNow it's,\nI set up there using PowerShell ISE.\n\n687\n00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.890\nYou could do it from just\nthe PowerShell shell I was showing you.\n\n688\n00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.180\nOr you can use ISE.\n\n689\n00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.210\nISE is the integrated PowerShell Editor.\n\n690\n00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.200\nIt's just a graphical interface that\nlets you type your scripts out,\n\n691\n00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.890\nlets you troubleshoot them,\nbecause you can debug them.\n\n692\n00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.070\nSo, it's PowerShell with\na graphical editor thrown in.\n\n693\n00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.090\nThat's all it is.\n\n694\n00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.340\nStill PowerShell, but\n\n695\n00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.350\nyou can go in, you can create\na VM using a variable statement.\n\n696\n00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:50.400\nVM name here will be setting a variable\nname equal to ADAM01 for my VM.\n\n697\n00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.480\nI could then go ahead and\nspecify another variable called VM, and\n\n698\n00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.780\nI'll open up a block here, right?\n\n699\n00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.770\nA function's gonna allow me\nto declare all these states.\n\n700\n00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.560\nThis is essentially an array,\na memory table, that I'm gonna create and\n\n701\n00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.580\nuse if you run the script\nto then run the VM.\n\n702\n00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.120\nName will be set to whatever\nthe VM variable name is, Adam01.\n\n703\n00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.470\nMemory startup in bites,\nthat's gonna be 4 gigs in memory.\n\n704\n00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.070\nIf you wanna do it in megabytes or\ngigabytes you could do that,\n\n705\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.230\nyou just gotta do the math and\nfigure it out.\n\n706\n00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.640\nGeneration, this is a Gen 2 VM meaning\nit'll use the most recent technology.\n\n707\n00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.050\nThere's Gen one and\nGen two VMs we support.\n\n708\n00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.770\nYou'd probably wanna do a Gen two.\n\n709\n00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.010\nBut if you're not familiar with that,\nyou can read up a little bit on that and\n\n710\n00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.370\nfigure out the details.\n\n711\n00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.145\nNew VHD path, that'll be the path\nstatement for where I'm gonna put my VM.\n\n712\n00:33:35.145 --> 00:33:37.585\nNotice, local drive virtual machines,\n\n713\n00:33:37.585 --> 00:33:42.695\n$VMname is being used to specify\nthe name of the container for the VM.\n\n714\n00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:44.280\n$VM.vhdx.\n\n715\n00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.250\nAgain, substitute the name Adam01 for\nevery see $VM name,\n\n716\n00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:52.970\nand we're naming our path using our\nvariable that's been declared, right?\n\n717\n00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.980\nAt the top.\nThis is how PowerShell works.\n\n718\n00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.020\nNew VHD size in bytes again.\n\n719\n00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.230\nIn bytes that's gonna give me\na hard drive of 10 gigs or\n\n720\n00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.310\nroughly about 11 gigs in size.\n\n721\n00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.410\nBoot device will be a VHD,\nso I'm gonna boot there.\n\n722\n00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.670\nPath, what's our path,\nwe already said that.\n\n723\n00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.580\nAnd our switch name.\n\n724\n00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.055\nWe're gonna do a get VM switch, so\nwe get a list of the switches and\n\n725\n00:34:13.055 --> 00:34:14.915\nwe're gonna use the very\nfirst switch that's there.\n\n726\n00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:20.025\nZero is always the first numbered item\nwe start with in situations like this.\n\n727\n00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:22.635\nSo whatever the switch is, name zero,\n\n728\n00:34:22.635 --> 00:34:26.160\nthat's gonna pull the very first\nvirtual switch out of Hyper-V and\n\n729\n00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.080\nattach us to that switch,\nwhatever that is on the local host, right?\n\n730\n00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.980\nSo that's gonna go ahead and\nthat's gonna let us create that.\n\n731\n00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.860\nJust resetting our timer on\nthe lab while we're talking so\n\n732\n00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.105\nwe don't lose our capability to\ngo in there and play around.\n\n733\n00:34:41.105 --> 00:34:43.630\nIt runs out of time,\nbad things happen, right?\n\n734\n00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.780\nSo that would allow us in theory to come\nin here, do the same thing as right-click,\n\n735\n00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.660\nNew, Virtual Machine, and\nrun through this wizard, right?\n\n736\n00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.320\nWhich you haven't seen, but I'll just\nrun through real quick just to show you.\n\n737\n00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.340\nWe would go through in the wizard here.\n\n738\n00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.100\nNext, give it name, right?\n\n739\n00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.037\nSo adam02.\n\n740\n00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:04.067\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] whenever you're typing,\nyou're just kind of using the GUI to fill\n\n741\n00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:06.520\nin the syntax for\nthe PowerShell commandlets.\n\n742\n00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.609\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is not, this particular\nwizard's not gonna use PowerShell,\n\n743\n00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:11.430\nit's gonna create it directly on the host.\n\n744\n00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.910\nBut what I'm doing is,\n\n745\n00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:17.690\nin PowerShell, I'm providing the inputs\nto these fields in the wizard.\n\n746\n00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.860\nIf you wanna think of it exactly kinda\nthe opposite way of what you were saying.\n\n747\n00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.470\nI am, in PowerShell, creating an answer\nfile that will go through and execute and\n\n748\n00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.910\nprovide the answers to the equivalent\nof this wizard as I go.\n\n749\n00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.761\nBut instead of having the wizard\nscreen up and providing the answers,\n\n750\n00:35:31.761 --> 00:35:35.415\nI'm calling the screen of the wizard\nexecuting the equivalent command and\n\n751\n00:35:35.415 --> 00:35:39.510\nproviding the input all in one\nstep in the script line by line,\n\n752\n00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.940\npage by page on the wizard,\nif you think of it that way.\n\n753\n00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.700\nAnd as a result, the PowerShell\nscript does what this wizard does.\n\n754\n00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.020\nIt just does it without you\nhaving to use the wizard.\n\n755\n00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.264\nHere, I'm providing the inputs\nin the text line or whatever, so\n\n756\n00:35:53.264 --> 00:35:58.434\nthat I'm giving the input to the wizard\nthat will be required to, in this case,\n\n757\n00:35:58.434 --> 00:36:03.081\nname the VM or specify the size of\nthe hard drive or the path or whatever.\n\n758\n00:36:03.081 --> 00:36:06.438\nAnd I'm providing the inputs that I'm\nalso providing through PowerShell.\n\n759\n00:36:06.438 --> 00:36:10.141\nBut I'm doing without having to worry\nabout providing the commandlets because\n\n760\n00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:12.085\nthe wizard is executing that part for me.\n\n761\n00:36:12.085 --> 00:36:14.605\nSo it's just a matter of how\nI choose to do it, right?\n\n762\n00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:16.910\nBut either way, you're essentially\ngoing to get to the same place.\n\n763\n00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.210\nSo I'm gonna specify my name.\n\n764\n00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.960\nNow, I can store the VM files in\nthe same location as everything.\n\n765\n00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.300\nI usually put them together.\n\n766\n00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.760\nBut I can move them to separate location\nif I want to, and hard-code the location.\n\n767\n00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.310\nSo I could just go ahead and\nsay store in a different location.\n\n768\n00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:35.680\nAnd notice, the default location\nProgramData Microsoft Windows Hyper-V.\n\n769\n00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.850\nI can put it anywhere I want.\n\n770\n00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.810\nIf I wanna put them into the VHD\nfile on the C drive that I created,\n\n771\n00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:42.560\nI could do that.\n\n772\n00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.260\nI could put them anywhere I'd like,\nit's up to me, right?\n\n773\n00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.783\nSo if I go there, go to VHD,\nI could just select that folder.\n\n774\n00:36:50.783 --> 00:36:53.680\nI'll just put them in that\ndirectory that I created.\n\n775\n00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.670\nClick Next.\n\n776\n00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.830\nGen1 versus Gen2.\n\n777\n00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.270\nRemember, we talked about\ngenerations of VMs.\n\n778\n00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:03.830\nYou'll see here, the main differences is\nthat a Gen1 VM is backwards compatible.\n\n779\n00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.690\nIt runs in earlier versions of Hyper-V.\n\n780\n00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.490\nUses a VHD instead of a VHDX hard drive.\n\n781\n00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.515\nAnd uses earlier hardware support.\n\n782\n00:37:10.515 --> 00:37:11.710\nGen2 is the newer gen.\n\n783\n00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.750\nIt only runs on the newer\nversions of Hyper-V.\n\n784\n00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.870\nThat's one of the main differences.\n\n785\n00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.640\nAnd it does things like secure boots,\nSCSI boot, pixie boot, etc.\n\n786\n00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.329\nYou gotta be running at\nleast Windows Server 12 or\n\n787\n00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:24.338\nWindows 8 or better to run Gen2 VMs.\n\n788\n00:37:24.338 --> 00:37:26.960\nIt's really the key\ndefining characteristic.\n\n789\n00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.290\nSo you specify what you want there,\nup to you.\n\n790\n00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:32.750\nThen you specify the amount of memory,\nstart up memory.\n\n791\n00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.430\nThis is 512 megabytes.\n\n792\n00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.120\nUp to us to decide how much you want.\n\n793\n00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.645\nYou want a gigabyte,\n1,024 megabytes is a gigabyte.\n\n794\n00:37:38.645 --> 00:37:40.295\nSo you do the math.\n\n795\n00:37:40.295 --> 00:37:41.485\n2 GB, 2,048 MB, whatever you want.\n\n796\n00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:45.075\nSo we specify that, click Next.\n\n797\n00:37:45.075 --> 00:37:47.665\nAre you going to link it to a network?\n\n798\n00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.345\nRight now,\nI don't have any network created here.\n\n799\n00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:52.130\nI'd have to go in and create them\nunder the virtual switch manager.\n\n800\n00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.000\nDon't have anything.\n\n801\n00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.070\nSo, I can create an isolated VM for\nthe moment, no big deal.\n\n802\n00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.010\nClick Next.\n\n803\n00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.040\nWhat about our hard drive?\n\n804\n00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.950\nRight now, it's gonna have the name in\nthe machine that I provided, .vhpx.\n\n805\n00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.095\nIt's gonna go to the path I specified,\n\n806\n00:38:04.095 --> 00:38:08.450\ncreate a sub folder there under the Adam02\nfolder called virtual hard disks.\n\n807\n00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.090\nAnd it will specify the size here,\nup to a maximum of 64 TB, with a T.\n\n808\n00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.160\nThat's-\n&gt;&gt; Not too bad.\n\n809\n00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Pretty big file, right?\n\n810\n00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.350\nBut I can make it as big as\nI would like in gigabytes.\n\n811\n00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.580\nSo it's 127 gigs.\n\n812\n00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.790\nI'll just put 11 gigs there.\n\n813\n00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.680\nIt doesn't matter right now.\n\n814\n00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.770\nI'm not installing an OS.\n\n815\n00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.040\nSo it really doesn't matter.\n\n816\n00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.610\nBecause we are not going\nto blow this up and\n\n817\n00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.680\nactually create 127 gig\nhard drive right now.\n\n818\n00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.310\nWe're gonna provision that, but we're not\ngonna grow that until we do an install.\n\n819\n00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.710\nSo we can specify that.\n\n820\n00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.130\nI can attach a hard drive later\nif I want to, it's up to us.\n\n821\n00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.830\nDo I install an OS later or install\na bootable image and mount it now so\n\n822\n00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.590\nI have an ISO available so\nwhen I boot up I can start the install?\n\n823\n00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.940\nIt's up to me to decide.\n\n824\n00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.540\nI don't have an ISO I'm gonna work with,\nso I'm not gonna bother with it now.\n\n825\n00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.510\nBut you guys could install one\non your own if you would like.\n\n826\n00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.110\nClick Next.\n\n827\n00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.050\nClick Finish.\n\n828\n00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.910\nJust quick word here, and I talk to my\ncustomers and students about this all\n\n829\n00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.130\nthe time, and Cherokee I know you've\nheard me say this in other episodes.\n\n830\n00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:05.160\nWe all IT professionals overlook\nthe value of summary screens.\n\n831\n00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.021\nWe blow right by them\nlike I was about to do.\n\n832\n00:39:07.021 --> 00:39:08.120\nHey, I'm done, right?\n\n833\n00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.360\nI know what I'm doing,\nand we just hit Finish.\n\n834\n00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.214\nNumber one, it's always a good gut\ncheck to stop and just say, hey,\n\n835\n00:39:13.214 --> 00:39:14.682\ndid I really do that the right way?\n\n836\n00:39:14.682 --> 00:39:15.560\nDid I make a mistake?\n\n837\n00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.640\nProbably good idea to stop and check.\n\n838\n00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.060\nNumber two, it's a valuable resource for\nyou to screenshot, or\n\n839\n00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.380\ntake a picture of and provide for\ndocumentation purposes.\n\n840\n00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.443\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n841\n00:39:25.443 --> 00:39:28.740\n&gt;&gt; Because this is gonna be\nthe authoritative setup statement.\n\n842\n00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.220\nThis is what you should get\nif everything runs well.\n\n843\n00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.530\nWouldn't it be great when you're auditors\nlike me, because I do a lot of audit work,\n\n844\n00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.360\nshow up and say, hey,\ncan you verify and validate for\n\n845\n00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.120\nus that it really is what it says it is?\n\n846\n00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.400\nWouldn't it be great if you\ncould go in and have that and\n\n847\n00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.520\njust say this what it should be and\nhere's the proof right here.\n\n848\n00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.680\nTake a quick screenshot of that and\ndump into your config documentation.\n\n849\n00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.880\nAnd, boy, you were just gonna\nmake that auditor smile.\n\n850\n00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.110\nAnd when we smile, things come out nicely,\n\n851\n00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.540\ncuz your audits typically\nare a lot less painful.\n\n852\n00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.620\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n853\n00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:58.310\nClick Finish.\n\n854\n00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.410\nYou'll see it spinning that up, inserting\nthe disk into the drive, boom, we're done.\n\n855\n00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.705\nAnd there is our new VM right there.\n\n856\n00:40:05.705 --> 00:40:06.890\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] do another mic drop?\n\n857\n00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.870\n&gt;&gt; No, no I already did mine for the day.\n\n858\n00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.565\nI only get one per show, that's the deal.\n\n859\n00:40:11.565 --> 00:40:15.058\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll have to [CROSSTALK]\ncelebratory gesture here in a moment.\n\n860\n00:40:15.058 --> 00:40:16.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm scared, but all right.\n\n861\n00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.950\nWe'll give you a shot at\nthat in just a second.\n\n862\n00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.980\nOr you can do your Woodstock happy dance,\nthat would be cool.\n\n863\n00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.930\n&gt;&gt; I don't know that one.\n\n864\n00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.900\n&gt;&gt; You don't know that one, okay.\n\n865\n00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.290\n&gt;&gt; But this is one,\nmy son taught me this one.\n\n866\n00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.380\nIt's what the cool kids are doing.\n\n867\n00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.956\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay.\n\n868\n00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:29.000\nYou said it, so now you've gotta do it.\n\n869\n00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait.\nWe need a full screen on, no.\n\n870\n00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.440\nIt's gotta be Cherokee, full screen.\n\n871\n00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.470\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we can see it.\n\n872\n00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is a dab.\n\n873\n00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's a dab.\n\n874\n00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.790\n&gt;&gt; And that's what the cool thing,\nthe cool thing is.\n\n875\n00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.293\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that was cool, that was cool.\n\n876\n00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:41.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was cool, that was good.\n\n877\n00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.720\nI'm not gonna tell the dab's been\naround for like a long time.\n\n878\n00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.469\n&gt;&gt; I have no clue what it means,\nI hope I'm not offending anyone.\n\n879\n00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:52.474\n&gt;&gt; It's not a [INAUDIBLE] it's areal\nthing, it is cool, it is cool.\n\n880\n00:40:52.474 --> 00:40:55.071\nJust been around for bit,\nbut it's a cool thing.\n\n881\n00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.134\nSo, high five.\n\n882\n00:40:56.134 --> 00:40:56.893\nFist bump.\n\n883\n00:40:56.893 --> 00:40:59.110\nThat's also a old school cool thing.\n\n884\n00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.650\nYou do that with the dab,\nbut you gotta be careful.\n\n885\n00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.430\nYou do it the wrong way you\ncould bang somebody right\n\n886\n00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.000\nin the head if you're\nnot paying attention.\n\n887\n00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.200\nAll right, so we showed you how to stand\nup Hyper-V, showed you how to focus\n\n888\n00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.320\non provisioning with PowerShell, give you\na little tutorial Powershell, showed you\n\n889\n00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.050\nhow to do a GUI based installation of\nthe VM in the Hyper-V environment.\n\n890\n00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.980\nShowed you the equivalent in Powershell.\n\n891\n00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.862\nJust getting your feet wet.\n\n892\n00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:22.930\nGetting you comfortable with\nthe ideas here of what Hyper-V is,\n\n893\n00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.000\nhow we can use it.\n\n894\n00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.145\nHow we can get in there.\n\n895\n00:41:25.145 --> 00:41:28.095\nThis is the underlying\nvirtualization platform, remember,\n\n896\n00:41:28.095 --> 00:41:32.055\nthat we're gonna then take and leverage\nby putting multiple hosts together and\n\n897\n00:41:32.055 --> 00:41:33.495\nmanaging them through System Center.\n\n898\n00:41:33.495 --> 00:41:35.805\nAnd as you come back and\njoin us for episode three,\n\n899\n00:41:35.805 --> 00:41:37.970\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe talking about next.\n\n900\n00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n901\n00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.100\nThank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us today,\n\n902\n00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.450\nbut we are gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n903\n00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.450\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n904\n00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n905\n00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.050\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n906\n00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Take care, everybody.\n\n907\n00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.858\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n908\n00:41:55.858 --> 00:41:59.174\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.971\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITVProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Configuring and\nDeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.091\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.880\nSo in this episode, this is part three\nwhere we continue to plan a deployment for\n\n7\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.960\na private cloud.\n\n8\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.240\nBack in the studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.080\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.960\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\nhopefully everybody's doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.490\nGonna continue conversing, discussing, and\n\n12\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.860\nthinking through the logic of how\nwe plan for our private cloud.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.640\nWe've been through\nthe underlying vocabulary and\n\n14\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.290\nthe architectural assumptions\nwith you at a high level.\n\n15\n00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.350\nTaking in a little bit closer, folks,\n\n16\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.450\na little bit more formally on\nMicrosoft Centric discussions,\n\n17\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.450\nlooked at Hyper-V, looked at PowerShell\nin the local host, dealing with the basic\n\n18\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.150\nthought process of what a hypervisor is,\nand how we spin one up.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.060\nAnd how we begin the journey\ntowards hosting our virtualized\n\n20\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.030\ninfrastructure on an individual\nhost in our last episode.\n\n21\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.280\nIf you haven't seen that,\nencourage you to go back and take a look.\n\n22\n00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.234\nThe whole idea of how we dab\nwas introduced by Cherokee.\n\n23\n00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.182\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't miss it, right.\n\n24\n00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:10.780\n&gt;&gt; Groundbreaking, revolutionary\nthought processes for success.\n\n25\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.170\nSo we have all that.\n\n26\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.370\nGoing and building on that.\n\n27\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.235\nAnd it's gonna be tough\nto top that by the way.\n\n28\n00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:15.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just so\n\n29\n00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.355\nyou know,\n&gt;&gt; Building on that,\n\n30\n00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:18.420\nwe're going to do our best.\n\n31\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.000\nWe are going to take a look at what\nthe components are of systems center.\n\n32\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.525\nI mentioned in our last episode,\n\n33\n00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:26.750\nwe're going to broaden our though\nprocess within the Microsoft world.\n\n34\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.720\nLook at the architectural components that\nmake up the entire suite of products\n\n35\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.480\nthat help us to envision, plan and\ninteract with and understand how to use\n\n36\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.080\nthe Microsoft Cloud Solution,\nthe system center suite of products.\n\n37\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.290\nWe have a whole bunch of them.\n\n38\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.340\nYou can break them into three distinct\nareas in terms of functionality,\n\n39\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.500\nwe can think of application management,\nand what goes on under application\n\n40\n00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.480\nmanagement would be some of the things\nwe've already talked about.\n\n41\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.860\nThe System Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n42\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.270\nactually plays a role in\napplication management.\n\n43\n00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.810\nTalk about this sometimes and people look\nat me like well what do you mean it's\n\n44\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.870\nreally about virtualized infrastructure.\n\n45\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.670\nIt's about networks, it's about VMs.\n\n46\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.420\nIt doesn't really have a role formally\nunder application management but\n\n47\n00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.600\nthat's not actually the case because\nwe are essentially creating, managing,\n\n48\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.500\ndeploying and updating virtual machines.\n\n49\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.550\nWhich are Applications essentially,\nthey are configured and\n\n50\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.140\ndeployed as software and so you may not\nthink of them that way but they actually\n\n51\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.390\nfall into that solution as well as\napplications and services all making up\n\n52\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.800\nthe parts of a private club that we would\nmanage through and deploy with a CVMM.\n\n53\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.330\nSo we're talking more about that.\n\n54\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.710\nWe have the app controller product,\n\n55\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.610\nI mentioned this in the last discussion,\nthis provides our self-service portal and\n\n56\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.020\nallows us to be able to manage and\ndeploy services and applications but\n\n57\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.870\ngive customers and end-users in\nour cloud the ability to do so.\n\n58\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.750\nAnd we have the ops manager product, the\nSCOM product, System Center Ops Manager,\n\n59\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.490\ndoes our moment to moment continuous\nmonitoring of the data center,\n\n60\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.480\nthe private and\npublic cloud environments, and\n\n61\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.340\nthe application workloads that\nare going to be found there.\n\n62\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.840\nSo some of these products\nstraddle multiple categories,\n\n63\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.300\nwe have service delivery and automations\nwill be the second major categorical\n\n64\n00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140\narea that we can break\nthe system center suite into.\n\n65\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.060\nService delivery and automations,\norchestrator, our workflow and\n\n66\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.690\nautomation product Is\ngonna be found there.\n\n67\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.490\nHelps us across multiple other\nproducts to use integration packs,\n\n68\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.010\nwhich give us the capabilities and\n\n69\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.610\nthe building block to be able to\nautomate functionality and process.\n\n70\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.219\nWe certainly have PowerShell that does\nthat across all of the different products\n\n71\n00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.950\nas well but different product, different\ntool, different set of technologies.\n\n72\n00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.795\nWe have service manager, this is our help\ndesk or service desk software product\n\n73\n00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:40.570\nthat allows us to integrate incident\nproblem and configuration management,\n\n74\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.067\nalong with all the bells and whistles that\ngo with that from an centric perspective\n\n75\n00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:50.914\ninto System Center Ops Manager, into\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\n\n76\n00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:54.790\ninto Orchestrator and\ninto System Center Config Manager.\n\n77\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.200\nSo that we have different dependencies and\ncapabilities that allow us to monitor\n\n78\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.000\ninfrastructure with SCOM, System Center\nOps Manager alert on problems we find,\n\n79\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.020\nand then tee up change incident and\nproblem management, and resource\n\n80\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.820\navailability management, compatibility and\nconfiguration management and all that.\n\n81\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.600\nThrough Service level manager and\ninto config manager, and\n\n82\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.410\ninto SCVMM as necessary to affect change.\n\n83\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.280\nAnd to spin up whatever the solution may\nbe, or to make a change in infrastructure.\n\n84\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.810\nRecord that, track that, and then tie\nthat back to SCOM so we can close out\n\n85\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.480\nthe alert and put that to bed, documenting\nit in our knowledge base as we go.\n\n86\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.430\nSo service manager is both ITIL or\nITIL depending on how you choose\n\n87\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.480\nto pronounce and where you're from and or\nMOF, Microsoft Operations Framework, and\n\n88\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.490\nITIL, the IT Infrastructure Library\nframework.\n\n89\n00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.450\nIt is ITIL and MOF certified and aligned\nso that that product will operate and\n\n90\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.300\ngive you the flexibility around both those\nframeworks depending on where you come\n\n91\n00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.290\nfrom and what you're looking for.\n\n92\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.770\nMOTH is Microsoft's distill down and\n\n93\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.450\nplatform specific implementation of ITIL,\nfor we are ITIL aligned as well.\n\n94\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.280\nSo MOF is just essentially\nMicrosoft's guidance\n\n95\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.520\non ITIL on their platform specifically,\nITIL's the broader industry-wide,\n\n96\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.760\nindustry standard solution For\nIT service management.\n\n97\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.100\nAnd then we have\ninfrastructure management.\n\n98\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.520\nWe have the config manager product, SCCM.\n\n99\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.580\nThis is where we do our operating system\ndeployment, our software patch management\n\n100\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.775\nintegration, and all the configuration\nmanagement that we need to be doing there.\n\n101\n00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:36.730\nInventorying, and looking at what's\ndeployed, and keep a track on software and\n\n102\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.560\nhardware, and all of those kind of things.\n\n103\n00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.835\nAnd then add a protection manager, the DPM\nproduct is our enterprise level back up\n\n104\n00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:48.845\nsolution that allows us to understand\nalong the lines of arc serve,\n\n105\n00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:53.515\nof backup exec, of Veme, of any of\nthose products you may be familiar with\n\n106\n00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:57.530\nthat you may be using or\nknow of that are used in your enterprise.\n\n107\n00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.620\nThis is just our competitive\nproduct on the Microsoft platform.\n\n108\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.250\nIntegrated in the system center,\nwe have the virtual machine manager\n\n109\n00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.270\nfalling into infrastructure management\narea as well clearly aligned there.\n\n110\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.425\nWe have the ops manager falling\ninto In this category as well.\n\n111\n00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:12.775\nClearly aligned there.\n\n112\n00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:15.955\nSo we want to make sure we're\njust thinking through the logic\n\n113\n00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:17.435\nof these different areas.\n\n114\n00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:21.495\nAnd how they are breaking down\nthe functionality of the suite or\n\n115\n00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:22.595\nthe set of products.\n\n116\n00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:24.515\nIf we take a look at\nmy machine real quick.\n\n117\n00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:29.010\nWe'll just show you the system\nrequirements for System Center 2012 R2.\n\n118\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.510\nNow keep in mind, depending on the version\nof system center you are looking for,\n\n119\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.020\nthere are different requirements.\n\n120\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.330\nWe have system center 2012,\n2012 SP1, 2012 R2 in the 12 space.\n\n121\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.743\nWe have 2016 going forward.\n\n122\n00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:47.745\nAnd the on that depending on\nfar in to the future you watch\n\n123\n00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:51.185\nthis based on when we put the content\ntogether and when you're looking at it.\n\n124\n00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:53.785\nThere may even be a 2018 by that time,\nwho knows?\n\n125\n00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:59.370\nHard to say, but the point is there will\nbe multiple iterations of the product and\n\n126\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.140\nyou have to be looking for and\n\n127\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.290\nunderstanding the requirements based on\nthe version you're looking to implement.\n\n128\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.035\nWe're talking about 2012 R2 throughout\nthe These episodes across this entire\n\n129\n00:07:09.035 --> 00:07:11.305\nthought process so\nthat's where we will focus.\n\n130\n00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:15.885\nBut we can see that we have again\nat a high system requirements\n\n131\n00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:17.945\nthat are going to be necessary for this.\n\n132\n00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:21.370\nBut if you look off to the left here,\nyou'll see that we have not just\n\n133\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.510\nthe ability to look at how to prepare\nour environment overall all up, but\n\n134\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.070\nwe can drill down by product\nthat I just mentioned.\n\n135\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.740\nAnd each one of them has\na link here that says hey,\n\n136\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.790\nto prepare to deploy me, go here.\n\n137\n00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.110\nAnd then out beyond that, off this page,\ntowards the bottom, We have system\n\n138\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:44.360\nrequirements for earlier versions of the\nproduct 2012 SP1 2012 and upgrade paths.\n\n139\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.030\nAnd how you would set those up.\n\n140\n00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.340\nSo if you are interested in any of that,\nand it may not be a bad idea for\n\n141\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.800\nyou to have a sense of things like,\nhey what can I upgrade from?\n\n142\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.228\nWhat prior versions are there?\n\n143\n00:07:54.228 --> 00:07:58.037\nOr is there a direct supported upgrade\npath, or is there an intermediate path?\n\n144\n00:07:58.037 --> 00:07:59.917\nWhat does that path look like?\n\n145\n00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:01.368\nAnd how do I get there?\n\n146\n00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:03.459\nWhat are the basic system requirements?\n\n147\n00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.250\nThose are testable items in any\nMicrosoft exam, on any product line.\n\n148\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.090\nThat's not something that hopefully\nshould be a surprise to you and\n\n149\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.620\nthat you should not be aware of.\n\n150\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.730\nSo, a page like this is going to give you\nthe central information and the links to\n\n151\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.170\nall that information that you require for\nyou to be able to figure this stuff out.\n\n152\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.240\nAnd also, in the real world, it's going to\ngive you the most up to date information\n\n153\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.943\nthat Microsoft's putting out there for you\nto operate on properly, and strategically.\n\n154\n00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:31.810\nAnd when you do this six months,\na year, or two years down the road,\n\n155\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.510\nyou don't wanna necessarily rely\non information we may reference,\n\n156\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.910\nor maybe in Show Notes or wherever it is.\n\n157\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.830\nMaybe it's changed, right?\n\n158\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.580\nI mean, that stuff does update.\n\n159\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.910\nI wanna be clear about that, right?\n\n160\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.160\nBig disclaimer,\nalways look up the most critical and\n\n161\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.450\nrecent information at time of connection.\n\n162\n00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.200\nThat way, when you're doing this, you're\ngetting the most accurate information.\n\n163\n00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.656\nThe information we give you is accurate,\nbut it may have been accurate two years.\n\n164\n00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:58.760\nMay have been accurate two days ago.\n\n165\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.752\nYou gotta keep that in mind and\nunderstand that, right?\n\n166\n00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:04.680\nBecause we're essentially frozen in time\nonce we put this content together for\n\n167\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.500\nyou live.\n\n168\n00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.160\nAnd then at that point,\nthe clock starts ticking, right?\n\n169\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.690\nAnd Microsoft doesn't call us up and\nsay, hey, we're gonna change stuff.\n\n170\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.810\nThey just change stuff.\n\n171\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.910\nSo then, you gotta make sure\nyou keep up to date on that.\n\n172\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.070\nAnd I know you know that, but it's good to\nhear us remind you of that from time to\n\n173\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.670\ntime so that way it's just something\nthat you're always thinking about.\n\n174\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.550\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n175\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.880\nThought it would be good for\n\n176\n00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.870\nus to take a look at how to actually do\nan installation of SCVMM live for you.\n\n177\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.180\nThought it would be helpful for\n\n178\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.370\nyou to see how that's done in case\nyou haven't done this before.\n\n179\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.666\nJust resetting the timer on the lab\nenvironment while we're getting started,\n\n180\n00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:37.612\nso we're ready to go.\n\n181\n00:09:37.612 --> 00:09:40.282\nI'm on my machine,\nwe're gonna target for our CVMM.\n\n182\n00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:43.460\nI've got the SCVMM ISO installed there,\nloaded up,\n\n183\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.435\nrunning as administrator,\nabout ready to kickoff this install.\n\n184\n00:09:47.435 --> 00:09:51.505\nWe've created a couple of service accounts\nso that we could drive this installation.\n\n185\n00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:54.855\nI've done that ahead of time, just gonna\nquickly show you what those look like so\n\n186\n00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:56.805\nwhen I reference them you\nwill know what they are.\n\n187\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.030\nI went into my domain controller.\n\n188\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.810\nThis product is integrated into\nthe active directory domain,\n\n189\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.850\nas all the systems center\nproducts traditionally are.\n\n190\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.700\nAnd as a result, we're gonna create\nour service accounts there and\n\n191\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.880\nwe'll use those.\n\n192\n00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.480\nI went into the users OU inside\nour domain, practicelabs.com.\n\n193\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.470\nI went ahead and I,\neasiest way to do this, real world tip.\n\n194\n00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.110\nTake the administrator account,\nright-click, copy, and\n\n195\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.970\nthen create your service\naccounts from that.\n\n196\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.010\nSo that way, you have the admin\nrights necessary to install, but\n\n197\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.350\nthen you can use those accounts and\nhave them modified by the install,\n\n198\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.120\ngranting them the rights necessary\nin order for you to be successful.\n\n199\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.480\nIt's up to you to decide how to do this.\n\n200\n00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.630\nYou can create those\naccounts from scratch, but\n\n201\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.530\nthen you have to go through and understand\nwhat rights have to be assigned.\n\n202\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.210\nYou can program those rights in.\n\n203\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.050\nIt's up to you to decide how you do it.\n\n204\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.138\nI just went ahead,\nright-click administrator, copied,\n\n205\n00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:47.900\nlabeled one VMM service account.\n\n206\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.785\nYou could probably tell\nwhat that one's gonna be.\n\n207\n00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:51.440\nAn app controller service account.\n\n208\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.270\nYou could probably tell what\nthat one's gonna be, right?\n\n209\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.040\nI'm gonna switch it up and use them for\nthe opposite thing just to confuse you.\n\n210\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.060\nAll right, so we've got those.\n\n211\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.980\nWent ahead and showed you how to do that.\n\n212\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.685\nThat's just sitting on\nour domain controller.\n\n213\n00:11:01.685 --> 00:11:04.040\nJust save a little time by\ndoing that ahead of time,\n\n214\n00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.670\nthat way you don't have to worry about it.\n\n215\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.080\nThe other thing I did,\nand I did ahead of time,\n\n216\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.000\none of the requirements is we need the\nWindows ADK, the AUtomated Deployment Kit.\n\n217\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.120\nAnd I went ahead and downloaded and\ninstalled, configured that already.\n\n218\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.610\nThat's about a 20 to 30 minute install,\n\n219\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.620\nnot because it's going to take a long\ntime, you gotta do a lot of stuff.\n\n220\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.664\nIt's fairly quick, it's three or\nfour clicks of the mouse.\n\n221\n00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:26.486\nBut it's gotta download\nthe WinPE environment and\n\n222\n00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:29.970\nall that other stuff from Microsoft and\nconfigure it all.\n\n223\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.739\nAnd depending on how you're setting it up,\nif you're installing the local SQL\n\n224\n00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:36.959\ndatabase to do the assessment services,\nit's about five to 6GB.\n\n225\n00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:40.900\nIt's gotta build a lot of stuff out,\nso it takes a long time to do.\n\n226\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.160\nSo instead of just freeze framing the\ninstall and saying, okay, come back, and\n\n227\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.920\n30 minutes later we're done,\nwe come back, and it's ready.\n\n228\n00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.525\nI just went ahead and\n\n229\n00:11:47.525 --> 00:11:50.010\npre-installed that cuz it's really\nnot pertinent to what we're doing.\n\n230\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.510\nIt needs to be there but\nyou don't need to see it installed.\n\n231\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.800\nThere's no magic there,\nyou just click a couple of buttons.\n\n232\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.600\nYou wait, it's finished, and you take off.\n\n233\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.950\nSo we're gonna jump in at the point\nthat we've got all that prepped out.\n\n234\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.770\nWe've talked to you about the prereqs.\n\n235\n00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.780\nYou could see it based on the website\nI showed you where to go find them.\n\n236\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.220\nWe talked about them in\nprior episodes as well.\n\n237\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.330\nThe .NET framework needs to be there and\nall the associated stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.850\nSo, the assumption is you have all that.\n\n239\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.270\nIf you don't know what you need, you\ngo look it up and you'll figure it out.\n\n240\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.460\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're just gonna click install here.\n\n241\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.550\n&gt;&gt; So we're specifically installing\nthe VMM, the virtual machine manager?\n\n242\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.530\n&gt;&gt; Wait a second,\nI'm not logged in as a domain admin?\n\n243\n00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.450\nYeah, we need to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.670\nLet me just make sure I'm logged\nin the right way here, one second.\n\n245\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.160\nI could have sworn I was\nlogged in as the right user.\n\n246\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.160\nSo, yeah, we do need to do that.\n\n247\n00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.110\nAnd let me just sign out here real quick.\n\n248\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.990\nAnd just log back in.\n\n249\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.580\nSo, yeah, we do need to make sure.\n\n250\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.580\nLet me just spin my console back up here.\n\n251\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.497\nJust one second, just connect\nback into the machine real quick.\n\n252\n00:12:46.743 --> 00:12:50.369\nThere we go, let me just bring that up and\nconnect back into the machine,\n\n253\n00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.098\nI should say.\n\n254\n00:12:51.098 --> 00:12:53.770\nAll right, yeah,\nI was logged in as the administrator.\n\n255\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.508\nThat's kinda odd.\n\n256\n00:12:57.185 --> 00:13:00.527\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nget that going.\n\n257\n00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:04.780\nSo, minimize that.\n\n258\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.420\nAnd let's just go full screen there real\nquick so you guys can see that without\n\n259\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.431\ngetting all confused by the multiple task\nbars, cuz that happens to me sometimes.\n\n260\n00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:15.740\nDid almost an entire lab for\na demo once for a class.\n\n261\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.630\nGo to do almost the very last thing,\nand I'm like all right, ready?\n\n262\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.675\nI'm doing it on my local\nmachine the whole time.\n\n263\n00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.210\nScrewed the whole thing.\n\n264\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.790\nHow do we do it in the environment,\ncuz I have multiple taskbars.\n\n265\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.850\nAnd boy, did I feel silly?\n\n266\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.880\nLet me tell you what.\n\n267\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.920\nAll right, so I'll just go in here.\n\n268\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.320\nWe're just mounting the ISO,\nright now, right?\n\n269\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.620\nThat's just our local ISO.\n\n270\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.460\nIt's gonna go ahead, set that up.\n\n271\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.650\nAnd just minimize that,\nget that out of our way.\n\n272\n00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.851\nAnd there we go.\n\n273\n00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:44.820\nOkay, but\nwe are logged on as a domain admin.\n\n274\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.830\nWhat's going on?\n\n275\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.270\nAll right, let me restart the machine.\n\n276\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.450\nIt looks like it is just not\nhappy with what we're doing.\n\n277\n00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.520\nSo, let me just restart this real quick.\n\n278\n00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.180\nAnd should be able get\nthat to clear itself.\n\n279\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.420\nIt looks like for some odd reason we're\nnot logged into the domain when we are.\n\n280\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.180\nAll right,\njust while we're waiting on that,\n\n281\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.390\nlet's just talk about something else for\njust two minutes.\n\n282\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.620\nWe'll come back as soon as that comes up,\nwe'll log back in, no big deal on that.\n\n283\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.960\nSo just what I wanted to mention to you\njust while we're waiting on that so\n\n284\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.130\nwe can go through and do our deployment,\nis I wanted to just talk for\n\n285\n00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.850\na minute about how we deploy\nHyper-V clusters with VMM.\n\n286\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.860\nSo assuming we have VMM up and running,\nand assuming we're all set, ready to go,\n\n287\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.891\nwhen we wanna do our cluster or bring\ntogether multiple Hyper-V hosts, right?\n\n288\n00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:32.510\nIf you think about the logic\nof what a cluster represents.\n\n289\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.660\nAnd then as a result of that, be able to\ngo ahead and leverage that with SCVMM\n\n290\n00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.486\nto be able to go ahead and\n\n291\n00:14:42.486 --> 00:14:47.695\nto be able to, doesn't like it when\nI click away to log on as a user.\n\n292\n00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:54.187\nTo be able to set that up,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\n\n293\n00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:59.970\ngoing to All right, there we go.\n\n294\n00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:06.786\nAll right, so let me do the following.\n\n295\n00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:20.462\nLet's give this one more try And\n\n296\n00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:24.619\nsee if we can make this\ncome up real quick.\n\n297\n00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:30.135\nJust go there, and let's just go there.\n\n298\n00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:31.716\nJust go there.\n\n299\n00:15:33.358 --> 00:15:37.767\n&gt;&gt; We can see how important it really is\nto have those administrative credentials\n\n300\n00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:41.600\nbecause if you can't,\ncertain functions are just not gonna work.\n\n301\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n302\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.610\nwe're gonna install\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n303\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.790\nSo, I'm gonna click Install.\n\n304\n00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.969\nI'll just wait for that.\n\n305\n00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:51.077\nIt takes just a moment to go ahead and\njust once you load the ISO,\n\n306\n00:15:51.077 --> 00:15:52.966\nyou hit Install, it starts running.\n\n307\n00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:56.656\nIt takes a moment, as you can see,\njust to spin up, read the ISO, load it and\n\n308\n00:15:56.656 --> 00:16:00.149\nthen give us our select features to\ninstall page that'll come up here.\n\n309\n00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:01.275\nMomentarily.\n\n310\n00:16:01.275 --> 00:16:02.739\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll just wait for that.\n\n311\n00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:04.503\nAs soon as that comes up,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n312\n00:16:04.503 --> 00:16:06.680\nwe'll see if we could choose\nVMM Management Server.\n\n313\n00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.615\nAnd we'll notice that the console\ngets selected as part of that.\n\n314\n00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:12.200\nYou could see that on the screen\nin front of you right there.\n\n315\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.730\nYou'll notice that if I\njust choose the console,\n\n316\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.500\nI could do the console by myself\nbecause I may just be installing this\n\n317\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.590\non a workstation somewhere,\nI'm gonna remote in.\n\n318\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.720\nIn other words, to an existing SCVMM\ninstall and I may not want the server.\n\n319\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.615\nI just want the remote admin capability.\n\n320\n00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:32.150\nOr if I choose the VMM server, notice\nit automatically chooses the console.\n\n321\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.930\nCuz you can't install the server\nwithout having the console on\n\n322\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.420\nthe same machine to administer.\n\n323\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.280\nBut then, you could remote the console\nto other machines as well.\n\n324\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.250\nSo you have a couple of options for\n\n325\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.910\nyou to decide how you wanna do that,\nit's up to you.\n\n326\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.640\nSo we have all of that.\n\n327\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.212\nNow, it does say, down here, and\nI mentioned the Windows automated\n\n328\n00:16:48.212 --> 00:16:52.352\ndeployment, or rather Windows Assessment\nand Deployment toolkit, the ADK.\n\n329\n00:16:52.352 --> 00:16:55.690\nYou'll see here the ADK is\na requirement for Windows 8.1.\n\n330\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.637\nI'd mentioned we had just\npre-installed that and set it up so\n\n331\n00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:00.230\nwe didn't have to wait for that.\n\n332\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.450\nAnd that's been done ahead of time.\n\n333\n00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.660\nAnd I mentioned that we were\ndoing that as we got started.\n\n334\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.533\nSo we have that here,\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n335\n00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:09.380\nWe're then gonna specify product\nregistration information,\n\n336\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.330\nthis is up to us to decide.\n\n337\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.137\nWe obviously have to put in the name\nof the user, the organization, and\n\n338\n00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:16.350\nthe product key here.\n\n339\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.166\nSo we're gonna go ahead and I'm just\ngonna type in myself for the user.\n\n340\n00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:25.198\nFor organization, I'll put ITProTV.\n\n341\n00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:28.850\nYou would put in obviously,\nwhatever you would use in the real world.\n\n342\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.670\nWe're not gonna put a product key in to do\na demo, but in the real world, clearly,\n\n343\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.560\nyou would wanna license this.\n\n344\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.330\nIt does tell you here if you don't\nprovide a product key during setup,\n\n345\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.720\nwe install as an eval.\n\n346\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.950\nWe can then provide a product\nkey at some point later.\n\n347\n00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.600\nSo we do have the option to install\nwithout providing a product key,\n\n348\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.710\nperfectly fine to do that.\n\n349\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.033\nWe're not gonna break any laws or\nrun afoul of the licensing police.\n\n350\n00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:51.280\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\njust move this over so\n\n351\n00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.390\nyou guys can see this part of\nthe screen here while I'm doing that.\n\n352\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.360\nA little bit more, just so\nyou can see that outside the box there.\n\n353\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.014\nClick Next, we have our EULA,\nour end user license agreement.\n\n354\n00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:06.890\nYou would wanna go through that,\nmake sure you understand the terms of use.\n\n355\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.707\nClick Next, we then have the Customer\nExperience Improvement Program, the CEIP.\n\n356\n00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:16.286\nIn the real world, I always encourage\nmy customers to take part in the CEIP.\n\n357\n00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:18.759\nI think it's an important\nthing that you do.\n\n358\n00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:21.513\nYou help Microsoft, and any vendor,\nit's not just Microsoft, but\n\n359\n00:18:21.513 --> 00:18:22.521\nwhatever the vendor is.\n\n360\n00:18:22.521 --> 00:18:26.431\nYou're helping them by offering them\nthe opportunity to learn from your usage,\n\n361\n00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:29.027\nthe errors that are created and\nthings that go wrong.\n\n362\n00:18:29.027 --> 00:18:31.540\nIn lab environments,\nin classroom environments,\n\n363\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.430\nin demo environments, we tend to opt out\njust because there's no value in that.\n\n364\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.468\nMicrosoft's not gonna get any usable\ninformation from you, but in production,\n\n365\n00:18:39.468 --> 00:18:41.354\nobviously, your call, you decide.\n\n366\n00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:44.810\nI'm gonna click No, but\nyou may choose to click Yes.\n\n367\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:45.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n368\n00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.000\nMicrosoft Update, now here in our demo,\nwe're not gonna opt in for\n\n369\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.770\nMicrosoft Update here.\n\n370\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.570\nBut in the real world, you would\nuse Microsoft Update to check for\n\n371\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.200\nupdates you would wanna choose on and\nmake sure that that is a choice.\n\n372\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.359\nAnd that's not an optional thing,\nI'm telling you, you need to do that.\n\n373\n00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:05.120\nI'm simply opting out here cuz we're\nnot gonna bring this thing online,\n\n374\n00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.228\nput it in production, use it,\nand worry about patching it.\n\n375\n00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:11.350\nBut in the real world, you need to,\nand so that would be important.\n\n376\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.580\nThis is just gonna streamline the install\nfor us, make it a lot quicker.\n\n377\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.310\nSo from our perspective we\ncan get through the demo and\n\n378\n00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.860\nstill be able to do what we need to do.\n\n379\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.330\nBut in the real world,\nyou do wanna make sure you opt in for\n\n380\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.910\nMicrosoft updates, okay?\n\n381\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.020\nClick Next there.\n\n382\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.460\nInstall location,\nwhere are you gonna put this?\n\n383\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.500\nIf you wanna modify the install path,\ntotally up to you.\n\n384\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.590\nThe default, as you could see there,\nC:\\ProgramFiles\\MicrosoftSystemCenter2012.\n\n385\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.430\nR2 in this case, cuz it's 2012 R2 for us.\n\n386\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.150\nVirtual Machine Manager, so\n\n387\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.090\nwe'd wanna make sure we know that\nthat's where we're gonna install.\n\n388\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.878\nGonna just copy that,\nand that way we can go,\n\n389\n00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:53.560\nand we can take a look and we can see.\n\n390\n00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.994\nLet's just go in here real quick.\n\n391\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.454\nThat does not exist yet.\n\n392\n00:20:00.454 --> 00:20:03.210\nIt's gonna get created as\na part of the install, right?\n\n393\n00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.800\nSo while certainly, the C drive is there,\nProgram Files is there, but\n\n394\n00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.390\nthe rest of that path may or\nnot be, depending on what it is.\n\n395\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.588\nBut you can see that once we're done,\nwe'll be able to go back,\n\n396\n00:20:12.588 --> 00:20:13.707\nactually find that directory.\n\n397\n00:20:13.707 --> 00:20:17.560\nIt'll be created as part of the install,\nso just wanna make sure you know that.\n\n398\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.762\nDon't be afraid to go take a look and\nsee whether it's there or not,\n\n399\n00:20:19.762 --> 00:20:20.894\nyou're not gonna hurt anything.\n\n400\n00:20:20.894 --> 00:20:23.070\nAs long as you're not scared of\nan error screen, you'll be fine, right?\n\n401\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.160\nIt's no big deal.\n\n402\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.790\nAll right, so we're gonna click Next.\n\n403\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.030\nIt's gonna check for prereqs.\n\n404\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.600\nNow this is important,\nwe haven't started installing yet.\n\n405\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.120\nAll we've done is gone out and\nrun the wizard that says, hey,\n\n406\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.500\nis this system ready?\n\n407\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.610\nDo we have all the software we need,\ndid you install the ADK?\n\n408\n00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.682\nDo you have the proper amount of memory?\n\n409\n00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:40.800\nDo you have enough space?\n\n410\n00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.960\nAll those things we need\nto make sure are done.\n\n411\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.300\nIs the .NET Framework available?\n\n412\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.190\nThings like that, so all that's there, and\nyou'll notice it comes up with a warning.\n\n413\n00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.710\nNow, people sometimes get confused.\n\n414\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.110\nI know it's a little hard to see.\n\n415\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.550\nThis little yellow caution triangle,\nblack exclamation point.\n\n416\n00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.707\nPoint to it right there.\n\n417\n00:20:55.707 --> 00:20:57.630\nSQL Command Line Utilities check.\n\n418\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.860\nIt says SQL Server Command Line Utilities\nare not installed on this computer.\n\n419\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.960\nMy, heaven forbid, that's not installed.\n\n420\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.440\nWell, not a big deal,\njust warning us that they're not there.\n\n421\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.310\nBut it's not saying,\nhey, you can't install.\n\n422\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.890\nIt's just telling us that's something\nwe may wanna check into, and\n\n423\n00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.890\nwe may have a need for.\n\n424\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.580\nSo it gives us a little link to go out and\n\n425\n00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.090\nfigure out what those are,\nwhere we need to do that.\n\n426\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.150\nIf we wanna do that and\ntake care of it, great.\n\n427\n00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.330\nRun the prereq check\nagain when we're ready.\n\n428\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.340\nBut notice that's the only\nthing that comes up.\n\n429\n00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.900\nWhich means we're perfectly fine\nto do an install, all right?\n\n430\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.860\nClick Next, now we've gotta go in and\nnow we start getting into, hey,\n\n431\n00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.530\nlet's configure this system.\n\n432\n00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.598\nAnd let's make sure that we\nknow what it is we're gonna do.\n\n433\n00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:38.658\nThis is the portion where we actually\nspecify what we're gonna do, and\n\n434\n00:21:38.658 --> 00:21:40.800\nwhere we're gonna it, and\nwhat accounts to use.\n\n435\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.238\nAnd the nuts and bolts, in other words.\n\n436\n00:21:42.238 --> 00:21:44.387\nAnd notice of our five bars for\nconfiguration,\n\n437\n00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.191\nwe're three-fifths of the way\nthrough the wizard, right?\n\n438\n00:21:47.191 --> 00:21:48.748\n&gt;&gt; We're progressively getting there.\n\n439\n00:21:48.748 --> 00:21:50.440\n&gt;&gt; We're progressively getting there,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n440\n00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.850\nSo you'll see server name, we need\nto specify the name of the machine.\n\n441\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.810\nIt does load the local\nname in the machine.\n\n442\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.940\nSo we could see cloud VMM build is\nthe local machine we're operating on.\n\n443\n00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:06.850\nWe have to go in and we would have to\nspecify here what it is that we wanna do.\n\n444\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.180\nNow, for this,\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna,\n\n445\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.260\ninstead of using the machine name,\nI'm gonna use the IP address.\n\n446\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.771\nSo 192, we could do either one by the way,\n68.0.2.\n\n447\n00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:21.449\nNot because this is a problem but\nbecause I wanna path this to my\n\n448\n00:22:21.449 --> 00:22:24.861\nSQL Server database or\nwhere my SQL instance is gonna be.\n\n449\n00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:28.380\nAnd I'm using the IP address of that\nmachine to be able to do that, right?\n\n450\n00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.110\nSo then we're gonna do that,\nit's gonna go out and\n\n451\n00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.370\ncheck, communicating with\nthe server down there.\n\n452\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.750\nAnd when it comes back, we're then\ngonna go ahead and we are going to,\n\n453\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.970\nas soon as it's ready, we'll see,\nhopefully, the SQL server's online.\n\n454\n00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.565\nWe'll see that it comes back, it's good.\n\n455\n00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:46.980\nFinds the instance name, MSSQLSERVER.\n\n456\n00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.870\nFinds the fact that we do not have\na database that already is associated\n\n457\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.850\nwith the virtual machine manager.\n\n458\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.570\nAnd as a result, gives us the option\nto create a new database.\n\n459\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.585\nYou'll see that down at the bottom there.\n\n460\n00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:02.383\nWe can go ahead and we could decide\nto accept the name, VirtualManagerDB.\n\n461\n00:23:02.383 --> 00:23:06.118\nWhich is the standard default name, that's\nprobably what we would normally go with.\n\n462\n00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:09.931\nOr we can use an existing database if\none is already there, and/or name it,\n\n463\n00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:11.980\nin theory, something different.\n\n464\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.978\nNow we do need to specify\na port number up here.\n\n465\n00:23:13.978 --> 00:23:17.552\nWe kinda bypassed that for a minute,\njust triggering the, hey, go out and\n\n466\n00:23:17.552 --> 00:23:20.412\nremotely connect by putting\nthe IP address in and tabbing.\n\n467\n00:23:20.412 --> 00:23:22.488\nBut we didn't actually\nautocomplete the port number.\n\n468\n00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:26.126\nAnd surprisingly, it's not that\nsurprising, but surprisingly,\n\n469\n00:23:26.126 --> 00:23:29.838\nwe don't autocomplete the tab or\nrather the box report number there.\n\n470\n00:23:29.838 --> 00:23:33.202\nEven though we would normally use\nthe standard default port for SQL,\n\n471\n00:23:33.202 --> 00:23:34.604\nwe don't autocomplete it.\n\n472\n00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:38.604\nBecause you may decide to change that port\nand communicate on a non-standard port,\n\n473\n00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:40.020\nit would be up to you.\n\n474\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.376\nSo we're gonna put in our\nstandard port of 1433.\n\n475\n00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:45.883\nIt's the port that we normally\ncommunicate with SQL on.\n\n476\n00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:48.596\nSo we're gonna specify that.\n\n477\n00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:52.425\nThen once we're done with that,\nwe're gonna go ahead, and\n\n478\n00:23:52.425 --> 00:23:54.088\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n479\n00:23:54.088 --> 00:23:55.869\nOr actually, you know what,\nwait, hold on, I forgot.\n\n480\n00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:58.698\nGotta put our credentials in there,\nwait till it errors out and comes back.\n\n481\n00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:01.614\nI forgot, I gotta check off the box for\nthe credential to connect.\n\n482\n00:24:01.614 --> 00:24:02.860\nWe'll give it just a second.\n\n483\n00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.710\nSo busy looking everywhere\nelse I forgot to do that.\n\n484\n00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.110\nThere we go, we'll go back\njust real quick, no big deal.\n\n485\n00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.090\nI'll use the following credential there.\n\n486\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.640\nGonna ago ahead and\n\n487\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.620\nspecify our domain credential that\nwe're gonna use to connect out.\n\n488\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.940\nSo we'll do practice labs and\nwe're gonna do our administrator.\n\n489\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.730\nAnd we'll put in our password,\nwhatever that would be,\n\n490\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.630\nof course, got all that there.\n\n491\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.614\nWe just make sure we spelled all that\ncorrectly, that all looks good, all right,\n\n492\n00:24:31.614 --> 00:24:33.040\nso we'll click Next.\n\n493\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.169\nThen we're gonna go ahead.\n\n494\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.385\nAnd we are going to make sure that\nunder configuring service accounting\n\n495\n00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:44.436\ndistributed key management we talk for\na minute about this.\n\n496\n00:24:44.436 --> 00:24:46.510\nAnd then we'll make our decision here.\n\n497\n00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.040\nAnd so let's talk about not the virtual\nmachine service manager account,\n\n498\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040\nbecause that's real simple.\n\n499\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.408\nThat's one of the accounts\nthat I actually created.\n\n500\n00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:56.540\nThe VMM service account that I showed\nyou when we were getting started.\n\n501\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.900\nWe'll put that in here right\nnow just to put that in.\n\n502\n00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.660\nBut I wanna talk about distributed\nkey management in just a minute.\n\n503\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.800\nSo let me just type this in so\nI don't forget to do that.\n\n504\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.070\nAnd then we're gonna have a word to say\nabout the distributed key management.\n\n505\n00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.500\nAnd the difference between\nstoring keys locally and\n\n506\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.460\nstoring them in the Active Directory.\n\n507\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.460\nSo let me just type this in here.\n\n508\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.730\nAll right, so we got all that.\n\n509\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.370\nSo let's talk about distributed\nkey management for just a minute.\n\n510\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.530\nThe idea here is whether we store the\nencryption keys in Active Directory as I\n\n511\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.550\nwas just suggesting.\n\n512\n00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.910\nPutting them into the AD and\n\n513\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.390\ndistributing them means that during a\nrecovery it will be more accessible to us.\n\n514\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.490\nAnd we have a backup of them if we\nare backing up our system state.\n\n515\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.570\nWe'd have a copy of the keys,\nfor instance.\n\n516\n00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.870\nFor highly available VMM installs,\nwe must do this.\n\n517\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.710\nBecause we can't have the keys\nonly locally on one instance.\n\n518\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.460\nIn case that instance fails,\n\n519\n00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.690\nthe either additional surviving\nmembers of the HA solution.\n\n520\n00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.970\nHigh availability means more than\none system doing the same thing.\n\n521\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.640\nAnd or a recovered system we\nbring up to bring back online\n\n522\n00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.390\nthrough a failover scenario\nmust have access to the keys.\n\n523\n00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.931\nThe keys are the encryption keys that are\nused to safeguard the data available for\n\n524\n00:26:02.931 --> 00:26:05.215\nconfiguration of management of SVCMM.\n\n525\n00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:07.480\nIf we don't have those, we're done.\n\n526\n00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.440\nIf they're a local instance only and\nthey're not distributed,\n\n527\n00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.243\nwe cannot run an HA solution.\n\n528\n00:26:13.243 --> 00:26:15.680\nWe cannot fail over and recover.\n\n529\n00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.942\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n530\n00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:20.020\nWe gotta make this choice ahead\nof time when we do our install.\n\n531\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.485\nIf you don't choose to check the box here,\nright?\n\n532\n00:26:22.485 --> 00:26:28.665\nAnd provide the location using a fully\nqualified path as you can see there.\n\n533\n00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:35.292\nCN equals your domain, DC equals\nwhatever your path is for your OU.\n\n534\n00:26:35.292 --> 00:26:39.255\nYour domain name .com or\nwhatever in the example there.\n\n535\n00:26:39.255 --> 00:26:42.630\nIn our case, practicelabs.com for\nthe domain, etc.\n\n536\n00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.950\nIf you don't do that, then you're storing\nthe keys locally on this one server.\n\n537\n00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.265\nAnd you're not gonna distribute them.\n\n538\n00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:51.420\nSo just keep in mind,\nthis is an important pivot point for you.\n\n539\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.090\nWe're not gonna store them in\nthe Active Directory in the demo.\n\n540\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.170\nWe're just showing you\nwhy that's important and\n\n541\n00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.970\nmaking sure you're aware of the option.\n\n542\n00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.305\nIn the real world, this would be\nan important thought process for you.\n\n543\n00:27:02.305 --> 00:27:05.911\nAnd you wanna make sure you have the\nthought process aligned here with how you\n\n544\n00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:07.670\nwanna architect and build this out.\n\n545\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.590\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n546\n00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.260\nWe've got our default ports for\nmanagement server.\n\n547\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.710\n8100 for connecting with the console.\n\n548\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.020\n5985 for the agents on the host\non the library servers.\n\n549\n00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.180\n443 for\nfile transfers between the host and\n\n550\n00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.070\nthe library server,\nsecured communication over the web.\n\n551\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.710\n8101, 8102, it's gonna act with\nWindows Deployment Services and\n\n552\n00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.881\nthe Win PE environment to do deployments.\n\n553\n00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:35.810\nAnd 8103 for\nWin PE Agent Time Synchronization.\n\n554\n00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.090\nAll of them are there.\n\n555\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.372\nMight be a good little\nbit of minutiae there for\n\n556\n00:27:39.372 --> 00:27:43.423\nyou to make sure you're focused on and\naware of if you're preparing for the exam.\n\n557\n00:27:43.423 --> 00:27:43.923\n&gt;&gt; Understanding those port numbers?\n\n558\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.200\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft is known for their love\nof asking about port numbers and\n\n559\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.590\nrandomizing whether you\nknow what they are or not.\n\n560\n00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.850\nI can see a great mix and\nmatch question there.\n\n561\n00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.640\nLiterally a console picture like this,\nwith a bunch of ports on one side,\n\n562\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.680\nblanks there.\n\n563\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.913\nAnd you having to drag them in and\n\n564\n00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:05.880\ndrop them in to see what they are would\nbe one way to ask this material.\n\n565\n00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.016\nI'm not suggesting that's\ngonna do what you see,\n\n566\n00:28:08.016 --> 00:28:10.910\njust pointing out it may not just\nbe a multiple choice question.\n\n567\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.590\nWe do have interactive questions\non our exams, important for\n\n568\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.520\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n569\n00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.280\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll click Next here.\n\n570\n00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.917\nWe specify a share for the library server,\n\n571\n00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:23.664\nthe configuration of the virtual\nmachine manager library.\n\n572\n00:28:23.664 --> 00:28:26.176\nIt's where we're gonna be\nstoring our information.\n\n573\n00:28:26.176 --> 00:28:31.180\nWe're gonna create a new library\nshare by default, MS SCVMM library.\n\n574\n00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.120\nIt'll be called the VMM library share.\n\n575\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.370\nIt's gonna be in the program data virtual\nmachine manager library files directory.\n\n576\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.660\nAnd that's gonna be where we\nstore our ISOs,our templates.\n\n577\n00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.390\nAnything associated with the use and\n\n578\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.580\nthe provisioning of\ninfrastructure will be there.\n\n579\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.680\nWe have an existing infrastructure,\nSCVMM install, already up and running.\n\n580\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.250\nWe have a file share through the library\nthere, we can reference that.\n\n581\n00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.380\nYou'll see the lower option\nI'm pointing to there.\n\n582\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.160\nHey, let's use an existing library server,\nso we can do that if we want to.\n\n583\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.410\nSo we click there,\ngot our install summary.\n\n584\n00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.150\nI've told you before this would be a great\nopportunity for you to capture all of this\n\n585\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.750\nand make sure you know what's\nhappening by screen capturing.\n\n586\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.197\nNow we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll click Install.\n\n587\n00:29:10.197 --> 00:29:14.533\nYou'll see that this is gonna go through\nand it'll take a few minutes for\n\n588\n00:29:14.533 --> 00:29:15.540\nthis to happen.\n\n589\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.492\nWhile we're waiting on that,\nwe're not gonna watch it, just let is go.\n\n590\n00:29:18.492 --> 00:29:21.628\nI'm gonna talk to you quickly about how\nwe set up VMM and host V clusters, and\n\n591\n00:29:21.628 --> 00:29:24.080\nthen we'll come back,\nwe'll see this finished up.\n\n592\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.100\nBut I just wanna make sure that we\nget a chance to see this finish.\n\n593\n00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.705\nAnd then we'll kind of wrap up our\ndiscussion about the thought process here.\n\n594\n00:29:30.705 --> 00:29:31.568\nLet's talk about cluster.\n\n595\n00:29:31.568 --> 00:29:33.335\nYou can leave it running\nwhile we're talking,\n\n596\n00:29:33.335 --> 00:29:35.330\nwe'll just kinda watch\nit in the background.\n\n597\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.670\nBut let's talk about cluster\ndeployment prereqs and\n\n598\n00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.250\nhow we set up Hyper-V clustering with VMM.\n\n599\n00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.945\nOnce this is up and running,\nonce we have this all configured,\n\n600\n00:29:43.945 --> 00:29:46.609\nhosts are going to be\nmanaged through SCVMM.\n\n601\n00:29:46.609 --> 00:29:49.922\nBut remember we have Hyper-V running\non every host as we talked about on\n\n602\n00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:51.130\nthe prior episode.\n\n603\n00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.260\nOur hypervisor is local to the host.\n\n604\n00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:59.270\nSCVMM is simply the graphical interface\nthat we use to all up manage our host.\n\n605\n00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.570\nBring them in and group them together,\nso they can provide resources.\n\n606\n00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.515\nAnd we have central\nmanagement capabilities.\n\n607\n00:30:05.515 --> 00:30:08.685\nThis is like VMwares, V center product,\n\n608\n00:30:08.685 --> 00:30:13.775\nthis is like the Zen product in Zen or\nin Citrix rather, the Zen Center, right?\n\n609\n00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:17.140\nThis is the centralized thought\nprocess for management.\n\n610\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.217\nSo we just wanna understand that\nwe're providing resources from hosts,\n\n611\n00:30:21.217 --> 00:30:22.608\nbringing them in to VMM.\n\n612\n00:30:22.608 --> 00:30:24.130\nVMM is managing them centrally.\n\n613\n00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:29.100\nBut the hypervisor and the physical\nresources, the CPU, the memory,\n\n614\n00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.370\nthe network connectivity and the storage,\nis being passed in through those hosts.\n\n615\n00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.290\nAnd those VMs are managed on those\nhosts because that's where they live.\n\n616\n00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.250\nSo VMM plays a part in this.\n\n617\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.442\nBut we're gonna create what's\nknown as a Virtual Machine Manager\n\n618\n00:30:43.442 --> 00:30:44.470\nhost group in SCVMM.\n\n619\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.990\nWe'll see how that works and\nhow that's done later on.\n\n620\n00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.735\nAnd once we do that, we are gonna\nthen put our host into that group and\n\n621\n00:30:51.735 --> 00:30:54.230\ncreate a cluster out of that host group.\n\n622\n00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.170\nSo that way we have resources\nthat are aggregated.\n\n623\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.675\nAnd we can manage those\nhosts inside SCVMM.\n\n624\n00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:03.190\nSo the concept of the host group will play\nan important part in this going forward.\n\n625\n00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.030\nAnd we'll have more to say about\nthat in some upcoming episodes.\n\n626\n00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.400\nWe'll talk more about that.\n\n627\n00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.170\nHosts have to run a supported\nWindows operating system.\n\n628\n00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:16.380\nRemember 2008 R2 forward, 2012, 12 R2,\nall those things are gonna be found there.\n\n629\n00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.760\nServer 16 going forward\ninto the future as well.\n\n630\n00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.260\nWe can also use server core.\n\n631\n00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.330\nSo we can actually run our host group,\n\n632\n00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:28.180\nand our SCVMM is capable of\nmanaging our server core hosts.\n\n633\n00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.960\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n634\n00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.390\nKind of an interesting option for\nus if we decide that we wanna do that.\n\n635\n00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.950\nHosts have to all be in the same domain,\nso\n\n636\n00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.630\nthey have to be a member of the same\ndomain, same name space in other words.\n\n637\n00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.210\nVery important to think about that.\n\n638\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.220\nAny and all requirements for\nclustered fail over from a hardware and\n\n639\n00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.360\nsoftware perspective have to be met.\n\n640\n00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.820\nWhether it's certain kinds of controllers,\ncertain amount of memory,\n\n641\n00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.640\ncertain software requirements maybe-\n&gt;&gt; Even processors,\n\n642\n00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.287\nI know with Citrix and Zenserver.\n\n643\n00:31:53.287 --> 00:31:56.111\nTthey recommend having the same\nprocessor obviously, so\n\n644\n00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:58.850\nthey're not running it\nDifferent speeds and so forth.\n\n645\n00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.540\n&gt;&gt; In general all the vendors\nrecommend same processors for that.\n\n646\n00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.612\nFor lots of reasons, one of the ones\nyou mentioned, mismatch on the speed.\n\n647\n00:32:05.612 --> 00:32:09.820\nBut certainly also mismatch on\nthe architecture in terms of\n\n648\n00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.570\nthe capabilities that the processors\nprovide could probably,\n\n649\n00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.920\nnot probably, could be detrimental to us.\n\n650\n00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.610\nIt could imbalance the cluster,\n\n651\n00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:22.610\nit also leads to problems with what we in\nMicrosoft's world called live migration.\n\n652\n00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.265\nVMware calls VMotion.\n\n653\n00:32:24.265 --> 00:32:26.030\nYou may have heard of that technology.\n\n654\n00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.010\nThe idea of moving live\nrunning VMs between hosts\n\n655\n00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.780\nin real-time without shutting them off.\n\n656\n00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.090\nAnd the equivalent of that on\nthe storage side called storage VMotion,\n\n657\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.800\nor storage migration.\n\n658\n00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.960\nWhere we move the back end of files\nthat are running the VM in real time.\n\n659\n00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480\nBetween data stores\nwhile the VM is running.\n\n660\n00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.270\nThe bigger issue for us, with what\nyou were describing, is the VMotion,\n\n661\n00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.300\nor live migration issue.\n\n662\n00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.589\nIf we have different processors from\ndifferent points in time, Intel,\n\n663\n00:32:51.589 --> 00:32:55.595\nlet's say, Windmere, Nehalem,\nor Sandy Bridge, or whatever,\n\n664\n00:32:55.595 --> 00:32:58.361\ndifferent process, or architecture types.\n\n665\n00:32:58.361 --> 00:33:01.757\nWe run into issues where we may\nnot be able to live migrate, or\n\n666\n00:33:01.757 --> 00:33:06.130\nmay not be able to VMotion without\nlosing the VM, because of the mismatch.\n\n667\n00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.330\nSo, it's actually really\nan important point that you raise\n\n668\n00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.110\nas all of the points that you raise are.\n\n669\n00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.900\nBut this one's really important for\nlots of reasons.\n\n670\n00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.500\nBut one of the biggest ones even\nbigger than the speed issue\n\n671\n00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.940\nleading to mismatch and\nconcerns about performance.\n\n672\n00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.219\nCuz we could compensate for\nthat and overcome that, but\n\n673\n00:33:23.219 --> 00:33:27.918\nthe big, really big issue, is if we have\na mismatch in that architecture core.\n\n674\n00:33:27.918 --> 00:33:32.150\nAnd let's say, an older processor doesn't\nsupport maybe a newer feature, right?\n\n675\n00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.810\nOr the other way around,\n\n676\n00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.380\nwhichever you think of it, that one\nof the newer generations provides.\n\n677\n00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.340\nThat can actually blow up\na running VM in real-time, and\n\n678\n00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.140\ncan actually blow your Exchange Server\nup when you go to migrate it, and\n\n679\n00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.190\nit stops working,\nwhich would be catastrophic in production.\n\n680\n00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.660\nThat would be a really big issue for us,\nso it's a really important thing and\n\n681\n00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.020\nyou want to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n682\n00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.530\nIf we have different processor\ntypes just to be clear.\n\n683\n00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.850\nAnd I'm not talking about\nIntel Sandy Bridge, and Intel Windermere.\n\n684\n00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.180\nOne generation apart.\n\n685\n00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.880\nI'm tied at Intel and AMD, right?\n\n686\n00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.000\nNo mixing and\nmatching on different platforms.\n\n687\n00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.240\nThat's on every virtualization\nvendor in the world.\n\n688\n00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.457\nI don't care if you use Oracle,\nyou use Citrix, Microsoft VMware,\n\n689\n00:34:10.457 --> 00:34:11.745\nthe four biggies, right?\n\n690\n00:34:11.745 --> 00:34:16.212\nNo matter who you run, everyone has the\nsame issue, nobody has come up with a way\n\n691\n00:34:16.212 --> 00:34:20.563\nto totally zero out those architectural\ninconsistencies between vendors.\n\n692\n00:34:20.563 --> 00:34:25.050\nIntel and AMD, two major vendors that\nwe talked about in the space for chips.\n\n693\n00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.360\nSo, neither of those vendors\nuses the same architecture,\n\n694\n00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.970\nthey have very radically different\nthought processes and designs.\n\n695\n00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.030\nAside from the fact that all build on\nsilicone everything else is different.\n\n696\n00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.370\nAnd as a result of that, at least\ntoday anyway they build on silicone.\n\n697\n00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.220\nAs a result of that, you cannot mix and\nmatch processor types.\n\n698\n00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.240\nIt's all Intel, it's got to be almost\nidentical by family as we talked about, or\n\n699\n00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.500\nall AMD.\n\n700\n00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.750\nThere's no way to go between them.\n\n701\n00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.540\nAt least not at this point in time.\n\n702\n00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.050\nNot to say in the future\nthat may not happen.\n\n703\n00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:54.770\nWorking on some real interesting stuff,\nand\n\n704\n00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.500\nyou never know what can come out of the\nbrains that are behind all the technology.\n\n705\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.540\nBut for the moment, not happening.\n\n706\n00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.630\nWe get our share of storage presented for\nthe cluster.\n\n707\n00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.930\nThat's pretty common.\n\n708\n00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.210\nWe configure our LUNs so that VMM can\nmanage them, so we present our storage.\n\n709\n00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.680\nEvery host has to have access to\nthe shared common storage array.\n\n710\n00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.280\nSo, if we're doing a SAN, or a NAS,\n\n711\n00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.715\nwhatever it is gotta all have access to\nthe network, cuz we talked about that.\n\n712\n00:35:15.715 --> 00:35:19.446\nAnd we talked about not only being\nin the same domain, or I mentioned,\n\n713\n00:35:19.446 --> 00:35:23.762\nwe have to be in the same domain, but\nfrom an AD perspective, same site, right?\n\n714\n00:35:23.762 --> 00:35:28.710\nWhich, remember is our boundary for\nreplication and control of information.\n\n715\n00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.590\nAs well as security within AD.\n\n716\n00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.353\nSame site, same IP subnet.\n\n717\n00:35:32.353 --> 00:35:34.460\nAnd we all have to have\nstatic IP addresses.\n\n718\n00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.130\nNone of this crazy DHCP, let's change\nour IPs all the time business.\n\n719\n00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.510\nEverything has to be static.\n\n720\n00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.510\nGeneral rule of thumb with clusters,\nright?\n\n721\n00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.360\nEverything has to be the same.\n\n722\n00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.580\nIn the sense that the architecture,\nthe configuration, the back end components\n\n723\n00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.260\nhave to match generally generation and\nprocessor platform type.\n\n724\n00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.150\nAnd that everything has to be static.\n\n725\n00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.625\nMeaning if there's an option for\ndynamic, or manual configuration.\n\n726\n00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:58.991\nYou're never gonna be wrong if you say,\nI'm gonna go with manual, and\n\n727\n00:35:58.991 --> 00:36:00.520\nI'm gonna put it in myself, right?\n\n728\n00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.410\nCuz we want static configurations,\nwe want standardization, we want sameness,\n\n729\n00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.960\nwe don't want things changing.\n\n730\n00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.680\nThat blows up the cluster,\nthat's a general rule of thumb.\n\n731\n00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.465\nJust so you know.\n\n732\n00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:14.214\nAll right, let's go back to where we\nwere and, because of the magic of time,\n\n733\n00:36:14.214 --> 00:36:15.510\nthere we go.\n\n734\n00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.570\nLook at that.\n\n735\n00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.130\nAll finished and done, it's awesome.\n\n736\n00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.315\nIt's actually been done for two hours,\nwe just tricked you, when we started and\n\n737\n00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.950\nMADE pretend that it wasn't there.\n\n738\n00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.680\nIt actually just finished up while we\nwere just talking about the clusters.\n\n739\n00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.260\nSo, you can see it's all set up now.\n\n740\n00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.910\nNow, notice down here, check for\nthe latest updates for VMM, right?\n\n741\n00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.959\nSo, obviously we're gonna uncheck that for\nnow,\n\n742\n00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:37.020\ncuz we're not gonna want to go out\n[LAUGH], and start patching and updating.\n\n743\n00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.340\nBut in the real world,\nwanna make sure you have that.\n\n744\n00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.440\nOpen THE VMM console\nwhen this wizard closes.\n\n745\n00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.380\nNow, let me give you a little hint about\nsomething that happens in the real world.\n\n746\n00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.530\nAnd if this happens to you don't be\nsurprised and don't fear it, just fix it.\n\n747\n00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.710\nIt's real simple.\n\n748\n00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.100\nYou do this the first time you install and\nthe VMM service sometimes even though it's\n\n749\n00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.050\ninstalled and\nconfigured doesn't always auto start.\n\n750\n00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.760\nAnd it may hang, and\nif you go to launch the console now, and\n\n751\n00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.900\nit doesn't start up,\nit's no big deal it's the service.\n\n752\n00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.100\nEither go and\nstart the service from services MMC, or\n\n753\n00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.400\njust restart the machine, make sure\nthe service starts up and you're fine.\n\n754\n00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.310\nBut I'm just telling you that,\nso if I go to load this now, and\n\n755\n00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:17.320\nyou see it doesn't open, you know it's the\nservice, and we'll fix it if it doesn't.\n\n756\n00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.874\nBut that's what causes the problem,\njust so you know.\n\n757\n00:37:19.874 --> 00:37:22.120\nAll right, so\nyou can see we have our little shortcut.\n\n758\n00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.730\nFor the console I created there.\n\n759\n00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.620\nLeave the checkmark there,\nwe'll go ahead and bring it up.\n\n760\n00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:31.310\nLocal host, meaning connect locally, Port\n80-100, our default port for the console.\n\n761\n00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.270\nGonna use our current credential.\n\n762\n00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.100\nGo ahead, and we're gonna connect.\n\n763\n00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.030\nAnd again, if it doesn't go in, if we\nget an error, it could be the service.\n\n764\n00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.300\nYou'll be aware of that.\n\n765\n00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.760\nLooks like it's gonna spin up for us.\n\n766\n00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.640\nSo, thankfully it's not gonna\npresent a problem for us.\n\n767\n00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.660\nBut if it did, just, so you know,\nwe'll be able to fix that.\n\n768\n00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.990\nAnd we have our running SCVMM console,\nand our SCVMM product install.\n\n769\n00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.525\nThey can't see that,\nbut, okay, that's good.\n\n770\n00:37:54.525 --> 00:37:57.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, Cherokee was like, awesome,\n\n771\n00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.602\nwe don't have to re-shoot that again,\nthat's so cool.\n\n772\n00:38:00.602 --> 00:38:02.280\nAll right, so we got that running.\n\n773\n00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.322\nEverything is up and available for us.\n\n774\n00:38:04.322 --> 00:38:06.907\nWe're gonna journey back into this\nconsole in upcoming episodes.\n\n775\n00:38:06.907 --> 00:38:08.470\nWe're not gonna give\nyou a guided tour now.\n\n776\n00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.590\nWe are gonna spend extensive amounts\nof time going through there,\n\n777\n00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.570\nlooking under the hood talking about all\nthe capabilities and features we have.\n\n778\n00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.200\nWe're gonna jump in, in our next set of\nepisodes coming up in our next discussion.\n\n779\n00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.352\nStart talking about networking, and focus\nin on the fabric area inside that console.\n\n780\n00:38:23.352 --> 00:38:26.635\nAnd talk about logical networks,\nand MAC address pools, and\n\n781\n00:38:26.635 --> 00:38:30.468\nIP pools, and load balancers and\nall sorts of really cool stuff.\n\n782\n00:38:30.468 --> 00:38:32.660\nAnd that's gonna be coming up,\nif you come on back and see us.\n\n783\n00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.181\nIf not, then I don't know.\n\n784\n00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:35.777\nYou're gonna get to look at\nsomething not so special.\n\n785\n00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:37.152\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n786\n00:38:37.152 --> 00:38:38.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not as cool as us.\n\n787\n00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.040\n&gt;&gt; No, so definitely get comfortable\nlike you heard Adam say.\n\n788\n00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.730\nExtensive amounts of information.\n\n789\n00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.850\nSo, ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned for that.\n\n790\n00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.560\nBut for this show we are out of time.\n\n791\n00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.420\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n792\n00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.908\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n793\n00:38:49.908 --> 00:38:50.869\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n794\n00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:54.108\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV\n\n795\n00:38:54.108 -->

00:00:12.054\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.Tv.\n\n4\n00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:16.629\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to your\nconfiguring and deploying a private Cloud\n\n5\n00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:21.202\nseries show host Cherokee Boose and this\nepisode will take a look at configuring\n\n6\n00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:25.200\na private Cloud utilizing system\ncenter virtual machine manager.\n\n7\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.910\nWith us today back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.560\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.350\n&gt;&gt; Always a pleasure.\n\n10\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.810\nThank you for inviting me.\n\n11\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.960\nSo we're gonna continue talking about\nsystem centers specifically system virtual\n\n12\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.160\nmachine manager.\n\n13\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.010\nPrivate cloud how we\nbring those together and\n\n14\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.400\nwe're gonna build on what we just did in\nour last episode if you haven't seen that.\n\n15\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.180\nThird part of part one where we\nactually did the install of SCVMM,\n\n16\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.740\nstood the product up for\nyou walked you through how to do that.\n\n17\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.220\nTalked about how to incorporate a hyper\nv or host based hyper v cluster.\n\n18\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.270\nWe're gonna go in and start playing\nwith the console in a little bit,\n\n19\n00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.470\ngive you a guided tour.\n\n20\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.920\nTalk about the overview of the VMM\narchitecture and components,\n\n21\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.820\nvirtual machine manager, architecture and\ncomponents by way of doing that.\n\n22\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.580\nThought we'd start real quick just by\nputting up a quick little picture of what\n\n23\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.330\narchitecture looks like, maybe we can go\nfull screen for just a minute to do that.\n\n24\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.900\nWe've got console sitting out there,\nwe've got a web portal out there.\n\n25\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.940\nWe've got a database set out there,\nwe've got connectors between the DMM and\n\n26\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.670\nthe Ops management product.\n\n27\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.690\nWe've got a bunch of additional\ninfrastructure storage and networking.\n\n28\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.360\nThis is the only product\nthat actually allows us\n\n29\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.100\nto be able to fully manage\nsystem centre machine manage.\n\n30\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.280\nThe only product currently\non the market that allows us\n\n31\n00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.760\nto fully manage Citrix XenServers,\nVMware ESXI hosts and\n\n32\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.020\nservers, and Microsoft Hyper-V hosts all\nfrom one console, all using one product.\n\n33\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.745\nAnd so as a result,\nWe're able to go in and actually interact.\n\n34\n00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:55.835\nAnd if you wanna come back\nup here to my machine,\n\n35\n00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:59.055\nyou could see if we start out in\nthe console in the library area,\n\n36\n00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:02.285\nyou're gonna see that under profiles,\nwe have profiles for each of the three\n\n37\n00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:06.490\nvendors I just mentioned fully available\nInstantiated setup ready to go for\n\n38\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490\nus to use so that we can bring\nour hosts in and manage them.\n\n39\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.630\nSo it's interesting cuz we have\nfull management capabilities across\n\n40\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.270\nthe enterprise virtualization\nspace using this product.\n\n41\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.430\n&gt;&gt; I could see how that could really save\na lot of time instead of going to each\n\n42\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.470\nindividual console for\n\n43\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.350\nthe different types of vendors that\nyou have out there, pretty cool idea.\n\n44\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.170\n&gt;&gt; It does and it doesn't.\n\n45\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.500\nYou would think it does, and\nit does in many respects.\n\n46\n00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.960\nDon't get me wrong, but\nwe're not gonna be able to fully,\n\n47\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.080\nfully manage throw away the other vendors\nnever use their management solution.\n\n48\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.320\nWe still need vCenter\nto do certain things.\n\n49\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.120\nWe still need Zen server to\nbe able to do certain things.\n\n50\n00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.991\nBut at a high level we can\nbring those hosts in and\n\n51\n00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:43.895\nessentially coordinate the hosting and\nmanagement of virtualized infrastructure\n\n52\n00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:47.425\nto scale our enterprise data center so\nthat we could be cross platform ready.\n\n53\n00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:51.205\nSo it is a nice setup of\nopportunities that we're presented.\n\n54\n00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:52.535\nSo that's pretty good.\n\n55\n00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:56.325\nWe're gonna spend time focusing in on\nthe fabric piece which is where I was just\n\n56\n00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.285\nto solve a console pop\nup before we went away.\n\n57\n00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:00.850\nWhen back full screen and came back in.\n\n58\n00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.150\nWe are to spend some time drilling\ndown on the networking portion here.\n\n59\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.070\nThat's gonna be our focus to several of\nour conversations in this block of time we\n\n60\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.870\nare gonna spend with you, but I wanna give\nyou a broader overview of the console\n\n61\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.420\nquickly and then we'll drill in and\nwe'll talk about the process specifics\n\n62\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.040\nto the fabric interconnectivity and the\nnetwork and component that make that up.\n\n63\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.290\nWe do have all the VMN management server\noverall as you saw in the picture\n\n64\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530\nthat makes up our architecture.\n\n65\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.450\nThe VMN management server you saw in the\ninstall one and go through the demo with\n\n66\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.150\nyou is a Windows Server host that's\ngot the VMM product running on it.\n\n67\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.160\nThe VMM services running\non it we talked about that.\n\n68\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.180\nThis orchestrates communication between\nall the agents on managing the fabric,\n\n69\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.280\nsupporting all the resources like\nthe library, file share that's there,\n\n70\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.620\nall that stuff that's going on.\n\n71\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.300\nCould we put the console back up because\nwe need to be able to refer to that\n\n72\n00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.100\nas we're talking.\n\n73\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.890\nSo wanna make sure we have all that and\nthat we understand that the VMM server\n\n74\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.280\nitself, this server that we're logged into\nwhere we're looking at we're managing is\n\n75\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.030\nproviding all the resources through this\nconsole that we're gonna leverage, right?\n\n76\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.590\nAnd we've got the library capability\nI was just showing you this.\n\n77\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.530\nI showed you the profiles\n\n78\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.660\nthat are being used to be able to\nconnect out to different vendors.\n\n79\n00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.380\nWe've got our templates up\nhere that we would use.\n\n80\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.480\nWe don't have any in there currently, but\nwe would be able to make templates for\n\n81\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.430\nservices or virtual machines.\n\n82\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.050\nYou can see them right up here.\n\n83\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.100\nAnd as a result, we'd be able to have\npre-made dies that we can use to\n\n84\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.420\nstamp out Copies of VM or copies of\na service that we want to deploy.\n\n85\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.220\n&gt;&gt; Like boiler templates?\n\n86\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean just an adjective for\nwhat a template should be.\n\n87\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.570\nOur general way of\ndescribing a template Play.\n\n88\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.900\nThe idea would be pre-made, right?\n\n89\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.200\nTemplates are gonna be pre-configured.\n\n90\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.020\nThink of them as answer files,\nif you will.\n\n91\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n92\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.140\nthey allow us to make those choices ahead\nof time what core operating system or\n\n93\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.430\nwhat functional OS.\n\n94\n00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.700\nDo we put into the VMM?\n\n95\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.250\nMaybe you, let's say, may wanna have and\ncome to me and say, hey Adam,\n\n96\n00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.640\nI'm gonna be able to deploy or I need to\ndeploy a set of Server 12 R2 web servers.\n\n97\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.100\nThat's gonna be one of the things I'm\ngonna need to do when I start hosting.\n\n98\n00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.760\nYou may not wanna have to make every one\nevery time by hand, if I tell you hey,\n\n99\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.210\nI need this, I want this particular\nconfiguration, need these services loaded.\n\n100\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.590\nCould you create a template,\nis the conversation you and I would have.\n\n101\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.530\nAnd then I would say,\nyeah, let's go do that so\n\n102\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.370\nit will save us a lot of time and\nthen when I have the templates made,\n\n103\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.710\nI could set them up through\nthe self-service portal.\n\n104\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.990\nYou could actually go out and\nwhen you're ready to play your VMs,\n\n105\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.320\nyou're not gonna need me at that point,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, you've already set it up for me.\n\n107\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540\n&gt;&gt; I've set it all up for you.\n\n108\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.170\nIt's all there.\n\n109\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.700\nYou're welcome.\n\n110\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.620\nSo then you would just be able to go and\nsay, It's two o'clock\n\n111\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.220\nin the morning I need that template,\nand I wanna go deploy that web server.\n\n112\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.790\nAnd you could go ahead and\ndo that, wouldn't be a big deal.\n\n113\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.680\nSo we could use those templates or\nCherokee could or I could, or\n\n114\n00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.170\nany of you could to be able\nto drive those deployments.\n\n115\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.990\nSo all that stuff's stored here\nin part of this deployment, or\n\n116\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.960\nwill be as we make them.\n\n117\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.300\nObviously, they're not there by\ndefault but you get the idea.\n\n118\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.820\nOur library servers are here.\n\n119\n00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.670\nThis is where we're gonna\nstore our generic hard drives,\n\n120\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.030\nthat are used to drive our templates,\nour blank hard disk that is a large,\n\n121\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.190\na small, medium size, things like that,\nthat we use as the building blocks.\n\n122\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.570\nRemember when we did the install of SCVMM,\n\n123\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.900\nwe specified we'd have\na generic library server.\n\n124\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.440\nIt gets created as part of the install,\nand the share and all that is set up.\n\n125\n00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.120\nAnd this is what we're looking at, and\nthis is part of what's here, as well.\n\n126\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.390\nWe have our ability to be able to go in,\nManager of VMs and\n\n127\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.440\nservices assuming we have those setup,\nwe can look at our tenants,\n\n128\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.860\nwe can look at our cloud or VM networks,\nstorage would be available here.\n\n129\n00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.210\nAll our host if we add them would be\navailable here, nothing is there yet,\n\n130\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.150\nwe havent populated any, that We're\ngonna go through how to do all that.\n\n131\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.140\nIt's gonna be part of\nwhat we're gonna discuss.\n\n132\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.710\nBut we could add our post in and we can\ngo ahead and create a virtual machine.\n\n133\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.190\nEither a virtual machine created\nfrom scratch or converted VM.\n\n134\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.890\nTake a VM that exist and\n\n135\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.850\nconvert it into something or more of\nit from something into something else.\n\n136\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.090\nWe can create our host groups here.\n\n137\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.530\nWe'll gonna take a look at\nhow to do our host groups.\n\n138\n00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.630\nWe can go through create a host group,\n\n139\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.230\nspecify it then populate it with\nhost set domain and deal with that.\n\n140\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.740\nRight?\n\n141\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.710\nSo you can do all sort\nof stuffs that is here.\n\n142\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.750\nI just going to go ahead and delete the\nhost group because we have no reason for\n\n143\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.700\none of these created right now.\n\n144\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.370\nNow we will come back and take a look.\n\n145\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.450\nSo we have our capabilities here, we have\npowershell and a great warden to the tool\n\n146\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.740\nand talked about the importance\nof powershell, how to use that.\n\n147\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.480\nThis powershell button right\nhere opens up powershell but\n\n148\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.150\nit opens up PowerShell focused\non virtual machine manager.\n\n149\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.570\nThis is the SCVMM manager\nconsole that we talked about or\n\n150\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.600\nmanagement shell that we talked about.\n\n151\n00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.625\nThat's specific to SCVMM with\nthe module already loaded,\n\n152\n00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:50.566\ninstead of the generic PowerShell that\nwe'd have to import the module into.\n\n153\n00:07:50.566 --> 00:07:54.162\nWe talked about that if you remember\nback in our first set of episodes under\n\n154\n00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:55.618\nplanning the private cloud.\n\n155\n00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:59.299\nRight did the plan and walk through\nthe architecture, the thought process and\n\n156\n00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.350\ndiscussion of PowerShell with you.\n\n157\n00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.260\nAnd explain the difference between\nusing PowerShell in a local machine and\n\n158\n00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.820\nhaving just generic module support and\n\n159\n00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.230\nthe specific shelves that\nare created by product.\n\n160\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.010\nWhere those modules are pre-loaded.\n\n161\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.370\nSo this will be the one where\nthe modules are pre-loaded.\n\n162\n00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.490\nWe have that integrated\nright into the console.\n\n163\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.237\nWe can go in and take a look in there.\n\n164\n00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:25.617\nJust bring my [COUGH], my virtual console\nback up it just timed out for me.\n\n165\n00:08:25.617 --> 00:08:28.661\nSo let me just connect back in\nreal quick while we're talking.\n\n166\n00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:31.964\n&gt;&gt; Sure and Adam did you access that\nby actually using a drop down GUI?\n\n167\n00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:36.729\nBecause I know like with other PowerShell\nmodules you can actually just open\n\n168\n00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.931\na generic PowerShell window,\nand then invoke, or\n\n169\n00:08:39.931 --> 00:08:43.770\ncall in that particular module\nwith a separate commandlet.\n\n170\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the import module\ncommandlet that I was talking about.\n\n171\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.460\nYou can just run in any\nPowerShell session.\n\n172\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.300\nYou can use import module, which is\na commandlet that will import any module.\n\n173\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.100\nYou'd have to specify the name of\nthe module and port module, name and\n\n174\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.390\nthen the name of the module.\n\n175\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.520\nI think I showed you that for hyper V\nwhen I did the PowerShell walk through.\n\n176\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.686\nI gave you that command and\n\n177\n00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:03.890\nsaid any module name that's\nspecified here would be imported.\n\n178\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.264\nAll I did to open it if you just\ntake a look right there I'm pointing\n\n179\n00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:07.040\nto in yellow.\n\n180\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.290\nThere's an integrated button.\n\n181\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.837\nIt's not a GUI pull down but it's just a.\n\n182\n00:09:09.837 --> 00:09:10.533\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n183\n00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Button just in the menu\nthere up on the tab or\n\n184\n00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.230\nin the ribbon rather\nas how we refer to it.\n\n185\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.030\nJust up on the ribbon.\n\n186\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.610\nIt's just there, you just click on it.\n\n187\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.500\nIt just is a shortcut to launch it.\n\n188\n00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.420\nWe could actually go in and\n\n189\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.030\nwe can go just right in here\nright to our area where\n\n190\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.530\nwe see all of our programs installed\non the server in question.\n\n191\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.300\nAnd we can just simply go browse for and\n\n192\n00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.520\nfind virtual machine manager command\nshell and that's what we're loading.\n\n193\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.180\nIt's just a shortcut for that.\n\n194\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.030\nit's just that way we dob't have to\ngo look for it outside the tool.\n\n195\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.530\nWe have it all in one place but\n\n196\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.670\nwe're essentially just loading that\nthrough a shortcut right inside of there.\n\n197\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.925\nThat's all we're doing.\n\n198\n00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:55.415\nSo we've got all these different areas, we\nhave settings in here as well we can go in\n\n199\n00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:57.869\nunder settings, look at general settings.\n\n200\n00:09:57.869 --> 00:10:00.952\nWe have settings for the library,\nthe database, if you choose to opt in or\n\n201\n00:10:00.952 --> 00:10:03.030\nout of the customer experience program.\n\n202\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.750\nNetwork settings.\n\n203\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.390\nRemote control.\n\n204\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.450\nVarious things.\n\n205\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:11.150\nSecurity, so we can go in and\nunder security we have our user roles.\n\n206\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.730\nWe have our run as accounts.\n\n207\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.750\nWhatever maybe in there.\n\n208\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.230\nBy default whatever we choose to add in.\n\n209\n00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.280\nWe have our servicing windows.\n\n210\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.840\nMicrosoft calls maintenance Windows\nServicing Windows is just what we call\n\n211\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.090\nthem in our products.\n\n212\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.141\nGenerically in the industry, and\nin most documents you read, and\n\n213\n00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:29.313\nin most frameworks, they're\nreferred to as maintenance Windows.\n\n214\n00:10:29.313 --> 00:10:33.275\nWhen you talk about SLAs, generically,\nso don't get confuse or put off by that.\n\n215\n00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:34.745\nIt just means a maintenance window.\n\n216\n00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.705\nIt's a period of time you carve out\nto do your change management and\n\n217\n00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:40.915\nto do your integration for\nyour patching and\n\n218\n00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:44.090\ntaking down and patching and\nbringing back up the servers.\n\n219\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.060\nWell you're not gonna disrupt services.\n\n220\n00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.600\nCuz you've negotiated with the business\nthat you have what we call\n\n221\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.510\nplanned outages.\n\n222\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.450\nAnd that's what a service window is.\n\n223\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.780\nSo we have those there.\n\n224\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.220\nWe have our providers,\nour system center settings.\n\n225\n00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.950\nWhere we're gonna go in and link to other\nsystem center products, likes SCOM or\n\n226\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.360\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n227\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.570\nOur interaction and\nour connectivity will be driven here.\n\n228\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.460\nSo we have all of those capabilities, so\n\n229\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.490\nwe have different areas\nthat we could go in.\n\n230\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.520\nTake a look at, we have our jobs area.\n\n231\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.972\nWe could see jobs that are running.\n\n232\n00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:16.943\nWe see a history and any jobs that have\nhappen, good or bad, if they failed or\n\n233\n00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.460\nthey were successful.\n\n234\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.220\nSo we have a running track\nrecord of what we've done here.\n\n235\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.375\nWe've configured, deployed,\nchanged, modified, etc.\n\n236\n00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:27.695\nWe'll see all that here as\nwe do jobs in real time.\n\n237\n00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:31.772\nYou'll see me as we start doing stuff,\nyou'll see the demos where we spin up\n\n238\n00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:35.784\na job, the job wizard will run through\nrather the configuration wizard for\n\n239\n00:11:35.784 --> 00:11:37.320\nthe task in question.\n\n240\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.055\nThe job window will pop up at the end,\nshow me the job is running.\n\n241\n00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:43.774\nAnd we'll just be able to track it\nthere we can close it but we could\n\n242\n00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:47.355\nopen it back up from here whenever we need\nto, so we have all that sitting here.\n\n243\n00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:50.235\nSo this is just a high level\nof the console over all and\n\n244\n00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:51.515\nsome of the key areas.\n\n245\n00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:55.887\nWe have the VMM data base, so the actual\nprimary repository for all configurations,\n\n246\n00:11:55.887 --> 00:11:59.060\nand status information,\nwherever that database server is.\n\n247\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.091\nYou remember during the demo, I linked\nto SQL Server running somewhere else and\n\n248\n00:12:03.091 --> 00:12:05.997\nI deployed against that,\ninstalled my database there.\n\n249\n00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:08.277\nWe have the management consoles\nwe've been talking about.\n\n250\n00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:11.997\nWe've talked about the library,\ntalked about the VMM command shell.\n\n251\n00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:17.497\nThe self-service portal, which I mentioned\na couple of times, is run through the app\n\n252\n00:12:17.497 --> 00:12:21.080\ncontroller, a separate product we install\nas part of the Systems Center suite.\n\n253\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.060\nWe configure that, and that's where and\nor through the Windows Azure pack,\n\n254\n00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.730\nwe configure and\nset up our self service solutions.\n\n255\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.680\nSo, we have all the general moving parts\nand pieces here, and we're gonna just\n\n256\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.100\nstart delving in a little deeper and\npeeling back some of the layers.\n\n257\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.863\nI wanna talk about the library for\njust another minute or two.\n\n258\n00:12:37.863 --> 00:12:40.560\nIt's really central important\npart of what we do.\n\n259\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.190\nThe VMM library is our file\nbased resources that we store.\n\n260\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.690\nAnd have available to us so\nwe can configure and use them and\n\n261\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.790\nprovide them as the building blocks for\nvarious things.\n\n262\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.860\nYou'll see here that we have\nunder our library servers let's\n\n263\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.658\njust pull this down so you can see this.\n\n264\n00:12:56.658 --> 00:13:01.385\nWe have our machine, our local server that\nwe are using just to open this up and\n\n265\n00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:05.899\nwe have our MSSCVMM library,\nour standard library configuration that is\n\n266\n00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:09.140\ninstalled during\nthe installation of the product.\n\n267\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.277\n&gt;&gt; So people who managed these libraries,\nwould they be called librarians?\n\n268\n00:13:13.277 --> 00:13:14.138\n&gt;&gt; They would be.\n\n269\n00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:16.481\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's very true.\n\n270\n00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.033\nWe're just in rare form today, aren't we?\n\n271\n00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.942\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's outstanding.\n\n272\n00:13:19.942 --> 00:13:20.580\nAll right, so\n\n273\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.837\nyes you would actually call them\na librarian that's what you call them.\n\n274\n00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.929\nIf you ever see the I know I'm gonna ask\nthis I'm gonna regret it cuz whenever I\n\n275\n00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:27.785\nask have you seen it,\n\n276\n00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:31.039\n[CROSSTALK] Cherokee's like you gotta be\nkidding me you haven't learned by now?\n\n277\n00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:32.439\nThe answer is no.\n\n278\n00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:33.790\nBut I'm gonna give it a shot anyway.\n\n279\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.880\nSo you mentioned librarians,\nso there's a TV show.\n\n280\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.544\nA series of shows that were done called\nThe Librarian, which is actually\n\n281\n00:13:42.544 --> 00:13:47.217\nbased on a figure from a set of books\nthat were written about a librarian.\n\n282\n00:13:47.217 --> 00:13:51.471\nNot the traditional type one, that is\na very special library full of magical and\n\n283\n00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:52.964\nmythical things.\n\n284\n00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:55.002\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen he is kind of all the adventurers,\n\n285\n00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:58.467\nalmost like an Indian Jones kind of\ncharacter that they they go through.\n\n286\n00:13:58.467 --> 00:13:59.446\nYou never seen that?\n\n287\n00:13:59.446 --> 00:14:01.798\n&gt;&gt; No, I never have.\n&gt;&gt; Bob Newhart plays the original\n\n288\n00:14:01.798 --> 00:14:04.464\nlibrarian, the master librarian in that.\n\n289\n00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:05.500\nKind of a cool series.\n\n290\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.340\nPretty cool.\n\n291\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n292\n00:14:07.552 --> 00:14:08.256\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n293\n00:14:08.256 --> 00:14:09.274\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't ring the bell, okay?\n\n294\n00:14:09.274 --> 00:14:12.145\n&gt;&gt; It was like a librarian movie with\nMacaulay Culkin I think that's what\n\n295\n00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:12.834\ncame to my mind.\n\n296\n00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:15.600\nBut I think that stretch for region.\n\n297\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with that one.\n\n298\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.773\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm not sure with that one was.\n\n299\n00:14:18.773 --> 00:14:20.607\nSo we'll call this one\na draw cuz we don't,\n\n300\n00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:23.547\nneither one of us has a point of\nreference what the other one is saying.\n\n301\n00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:24.251\n&gt;&gt; Sorry guys.\n\n302\n00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:26.077\n&gt;&gt; So okay that's our random aside for\nthis episode.\n\n303\n00:14:26.077 --> 00:14:26.970\nWe got it out of the way.\n\n304\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.230\nAwesome, very cool.\n\n305\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.463\nPlenty of time left to actually\ntalk about important stuff.\n\n306\n00:14:30.463 --> 00:14:33.712\nAll right so we did the library\nwe got our librarian function.\n\n307\n00:14:33.712 --> 00:14:37.557\nAnd we have our as I said MSCVMM library.\n\n308\n00:14:37.557 --> 00:14:40.880\nWe have our vhd's folder their\napplication framers folders.\n\n309\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.838\nI think I was just going\nthrough about to show you.\n\n310\n00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:47.292\nWe have some stuff in there by default and\nthen of course we do have as I said in\n\n311\n00:14:47.292 --> 00:14:51.465\nthe vhd area those blank hard drives\nI was pointing to that can be used as\n\n312\n00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:54.678\nthe basis for\nthe kind of hard drive we want to attach.\n\n313\n00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:58.488\nTwo RVM's when we create them so\nwe'll have those there.\n\n314\n00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:02.622\nThe vmm agents scans this periodically\nlooks for any resources we've added,\n\n315\n00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:05.507\nadds them in publishes them and\nmakes them available.\n\n316\n00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:07.505\nSo that way we support\nthe creation of vms and\n\n317\n00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:09.777\nall the other stuff that\nwe're going to do there.\n\n318\n00:15:09.777 --> 00:15:12.979\nWe have our templates for\nservice deployments as I showed you and\n\n319\n00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:15.301\nwe have our profiles for\napplications os's.\n\n320\n00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:19.280\nAnd all sorts of other stuff that may\nbe there if we are integrating wsus\n\n321\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.540\nthe window software update service for\nupdates and patch management.\n\n322\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.750\nYou'll notice down here update catalog and\nbaselines.\n\n323\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.530\nWe would be able to go in and\nuse the WSUS functionality.\n\n324\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.329\nWe'd be able to open up our update\nbaselines or update catalog, but\n\n325\n00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:37.539\nwe'd have to integrate a WSUS server,\nlink it to SCVMM.\n\n326\n00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:41.756\nAnd then we would be able to actually\nsee that and see how that works.\n\n327\n00:15:41.756 --> 00:15:45.686\nIn I believe it was the 7246 run through.\n\n328\n00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:50.836\nSo the other part of MCSE for\nprivate cloud part one and part two.\n\n329\n00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:53.628\n246 material for the 70 246 exam.\n\n330\n00:15:53.628 --> 00:15:57.798\nIf you haven't gone through and seen\nthose set of shows and those episodes, I\n\n331\n00:15:57.798 --> 00:16:02.369\nactually do a complete walk-through on how\nto stand up and integrate a WSUS server.\n\n332\n00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:05.517\nLink it to SCVMM, and\nbuild out that catalog.\n\n333\n00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:09.440\nSo, you actually see they do that,\nor you can see me do that there.\n\n334\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.040\nSo, if you wanted to see\nwhat that looked like,\n\n335\n00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.310\nyou could jump over there,\ntake a look at that.\n\n336\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.380\nCome on back at some point when you're\ndone, and you'll at least be able to see\n\n337\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.970\nthe reference point for that, cuz we don't\nhave that set up and currently configured.\n\n338\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.480\nBut you would have to stand up and\ninstall a complete W server or\n\n339\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.420\nlink to an existing one and\n\n340\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.050\nthen create the linkage between that and\nSCVMM in order for it to show up here.\n\n341\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.840\nI have the shell here, in other words,\nI have the place holders on the menu.\n\n342\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.370\nBut there's nothing in there because\nthey're not integrated right now.\n\n343\n00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.540\nJust so you know, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n344\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.190\nIf we set up the SCVMM server as a stand\nalone server, we could configure it as\n\n345\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.720\nthe default library server, as we did\nwith the demo when I did that for you.\n\n346\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.490\nWe don't remove or\n\n347\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.940\nmodify the default library server that's\ncreated during the install process.\n\n348\n00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.530\nIt's always there but we can add\nadditional library servers as needed, so\n\n349\n00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.660\nwe can scale out creating additional\nserver capabilities for management, for\n\n350\n00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.290\nstorage, and for\nscaling up and scaling out.\n\n351\n00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.320\nIf it's a highly available solution,\n\n352\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.050\nwe typically break the VMM\nlibrary server out separately.\n\n353\n00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.280\nThat gets installed separately and we have\nthat away from the management server so\n\n354\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.640\nit can scale the storage back in and\nmanage it separately.\n\n355\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.110\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n356\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.260\nRemember this is really where we gonna\ngo to get all the tools necessary.\n\n357\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.280\nThe component parts to\nbuild our virtual machines.\n\n358\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.120\nFirst and\nforemost that's what we need, right?\n\n359\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.630\nSo when we want to add a new library\nshare, we add what's known or\n\n360\n00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.420\nwe use what's known as\nthe add library share wizard.\n\n361\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.700\nWe can go and\nadd new library shares if necessary.\n\n362\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.990\nYou could see up here we\nhave the library server.\n\n363\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.010\nWe could add a new one in, if necessary,\nright up there by using that wizard.\n\n364\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.200\nAnd then, we can go ahead and\nbring in additional resources.\n\n365\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.070\nWe can create subfolders in there,\norganize our content as we go.\n\n366\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.500\nI'm not a big fan of folders, personally.\n\n367\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.230\nI talk about about sometimes with my\nstudents early with my customers cuz it is\n\n368\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.390\na pivot point decision point.\n\n369\n00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.350\nSo tell me are you the kind of person that\ncan find your stuff in just a big file and\n\n370\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.598\nyou know where everything is but\nyou just leave it all one place?\n\n371\n00:18:04.598 --> 00:18:07.678\nOr are you that meticulous person\nas to organize everything and\n\n372\n00:18:07.678 --> 00:18:10.230\nit's gotta be labeled and really no exact?\n\n373\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.870\n&gt;&gt; I love baskets and Benz Adams so\nI think I found my meticulous category.\n\n374\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're gonna be the folder\nqueen as well as the librarian.\n\n375\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.170\nYou're gonna be the person who\nwants all those folders, right?\n\n376\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.920\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't know.\n\n377\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.310\n&gt;&gt; They're kinda like Benz and Baskets.\n\n378\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.440\n&gt;&gt; They're kind of like Benz and Baskets.\n\n379\n00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.420\n&gt;&gt; Because we don't have a Benz and\nBasket options so-\n\n380\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n381\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.254\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking more often than\nnot Cherokee may tend towards\n\n382\n00:18:29.254 --> 00:18:30.910\nwanting,maybe not everything,\nin the folder.\n\n383\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.620\n&gt;&gt; I have a folder.\n\n384\n00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.290\n&gt;&gt; But some folders.\n\n385\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.590\n&gt;&gt; For your information it's called Adam,\non the desktop.\n\n386\n00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.310\n&gt;&gt; But if I change my name then it's\nnot going to be referable anymore.\n\n387\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n388\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.600\n&gt;&gt; If I come tomorrow and I'm John, then\nyou're going to have to rename the folder.\n\n389\n00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm just going to be\ncompletely confused.\n\n390\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.940\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna know what to do.\n\n391\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.780\nSo you may be that person\nthat wants some folders.\n\n392\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.710\nThis is what I'm guessing.\n\n393\n00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.376\nMaybe, illogically, there may be certain\nthings in your mind that would make\n\n394\n00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:54.261\na lot of sense if you had a category four,\nbut maybe not that meticulous person needs\n\n395\n00:18:54.261 --> 00:18:56.670\nevery little thing in\na folder on its self, right?\n\n396\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.934\nYou maybe somewhere in that,\nthat bell curve if you will.\n\n397\n00:18:59.934 --> 00:19:02.510\nI'm on the exact opposite\nof that bell curve.\n\n398\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.450\nI'm like, yeah,\nif it's in there, I'll find it.\n\n399\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.940\nI don't need to have a folder.\n\n400\n00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.470\nIt's just another directory I\ngotta worry about pathing to.\n\n401\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.170\nIt's another name I gotta remember.\n\n402\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.780\nIf I just put everything in the root,\nquote unquote,\n\n403\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.255\nmeaning just the general Part of\nthe console there, underneath the server.\n\n404\n00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:18.105\nI'm gonna find it,\ncuz it's only gonna be in one place.\n\n405\n00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:19.245\nI know where it is.\n\n406\n00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:23.385\nI just gotta be smart about how I name it,\nso I know what to refer to it as, so\n\n407\n00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:25.685\nI know what it's called, and\nthat name makes sense, right?\n\n408\n00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:26.770\nIn other words-\n&gt;&gt; So you're not overwriting it\n\n409\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.830\n&gt;&gt; Files that you\n\n410\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.340\nchoose to name something the same, or?\n\n411\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, you wouldn't do that cuz you\nwould get an error it would tell you\n\n412\n00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.370\nhey that already exists.\n\n413\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.770\nYou don't want to do that but what I'm\nsuggesting is if you have, lets say,\n\n414\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:42.310\na template for a VM and you don't give\nthat template a name that make sense, like\n\n415\n00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:47.430\nServer 2012 R2 with Web Server, something\nlike that, like we were discussing.\n\n416\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.200\nInstead, you just say Template 1.\n\n417\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.973\n&gt;&gt; Pulling the wrong template, and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you wouldn't necessarily know.\n\n418\n00:19:52.973 --> 00:19:56.604\nYou know, you may not get something that's\nbad, but you may get a SQL Server deployed\n\n419\n00:19:56.604 --> 00:19:59.143\ninstead of a web server,\nyou may not label it the right way.\n\n420\n00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:01.456\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou do need some sort of specificity,\n\n421\n00:20:01.456 --> 00:20:05.314\nI'm not advocating for normal,\nI'm suggesting to be clear in the real\n\n422\n00:20:05.314 --> 00:20:08.545\nworld that you don't need\nthat kind of standardization.\n\n423\n00:20:08.545 --> 00:20:11.530\nI'm just falling up that am\nnot a big fan of folders.\n\n424\n00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.330\nI just think from my own\nstyle they get in the way and\n\n425\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.250\nmake things more complex for me.\n\n426\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.100\nBut that's not to say\nthey don't add value.\n\n427\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.480\nI wanna be clear, I wanna be fair.\n\n428\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.770\nI was trying to give you\nthe benefit of experience and\n\n429\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.920\ngive you a decision point that you gonna\nhave to go out and operationalize.\n\n430\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.160\nIt's up to you,\ntotally up to you how you figure that out.\n\n431\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.810\nWe do refresh the content on\nthe library once an hour.\n\n432\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.210\nThat is a configurable default setting,\nby the way.\n\n433\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.370\nGo in and modify that.\n\n434\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.960\nBut we look at it once an hour, publish\nnew updates when we see them in there, so\n\n435\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.120\nit's up to us to decide what to do or\nhow to deal with that.\n\n436\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.029\nWe talked about tenants.\n\n437\n00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:45.680\nI'm just gonna go back to\nthe console if we could.\n\n438\n00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.790\nI pointed out just so\nwe spend any time on it.\n\n439\n00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.840\nI talked about the fact\nthere are tenants here,\n\n440\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.440\nat least potentially that\nwe can see tenants there.\n\n441\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.930\nTenants share the resources\nof the cloud and\n\n442\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.250\nmake them available between\nmultiple users, groups, teams, etc.\n\n443\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.090\nRemember we said in a multi tenant\nenvironment in our first set of episodes,\n\n444\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.150\nthat we could have multiple\ncustomers as an ISP or\n\n445\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.940\na CSP an internet or\ncloud service provider.\n\n446\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.880\nIf we're in the business of\nselling private hosted cloud off\n\n447\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.550\nprem through our data centers to\ncustomers, we're taking tenants on.\n\n448\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.650\nThose customers become tenants, and\nwe're hosting their content and\n\n449\n00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.790\nwe're putting their own VMs,\ntheir own hosts,\n\n450\n00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.400\ntheir own networks, their own storage,\ntheir own IP addresses.\n\n451\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.670\nAll that stuff becomes unique and\ninstantiated for them.\n\n452\n00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.840\nAnd so, the tenant is going\nto allow us as an owner and\n\n453\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.910\na provider,\nto think about the logical abstraction and\n\n454\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.530\nthe border, the definition of\nwhere resources are allocated.\n\n455\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.520\nThat's what the tenant represents for us.\n\n456\n00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.750\nAnd so, we have to think about that\nbecause we can't just put everybody's\n\n457\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.020\nstuff in one big pool right?\n\n458\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.630\nOtherwise, things are gonna commingle and\n\n459\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.190\nCherokee's stuff's gonna\nget seen by somebody else.\n\n460\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.780\nAnd she may wanna keep that stuff\nprivate cuz she has her own VMs running,\n\n461\n00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.860\nproviding services for\nher internal customers.\n\n462\n00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.560\nAnd there may be private information and\nproprietary content there.\n\n463\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.450\nShe doesn't want other companies\nseeing that stuff, right?\n\n464\n00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.360\nThat's gonna be very problematic.\n\n465\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.180\nSo the tenant is that level\nof isolation as a container,\n\n466\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.800\na thought process that we think\nof that identifies a customer and\n\n467\n00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.170\nall the resources that customer\nis gonna have the access to and\n\n468\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.700\nallows us to ensure isolation between\nthem in a multi tenant environment.\n\n469\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.410\nNow, most of you may not operate\n\n470\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.480\nin private cloud environments\nthat are gonna be multi tenant.\n\n471\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.690\nYou may and it's a 50/50 split.\n\n472\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.550\nBut what I'm suggesting is, if you're in\nthe business doing private on prem cloud,\n\n473\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:42.070\nyou're hosting your own private cloud\nusing SCVMM and system center to build it\n\n474\n00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.880\nbut it's on prem and you're data\ncenters you own it, you maintain it.\n\n475\n00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.800\nYou're not in the multi tenant business.\n\n476\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.970\nYou're hosting one set of cloud\nresources for one customer, that's it.\n\n477\n00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.430\nSo you don't worry about that.\n\n478\n00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.400\nYou have a single tenant,\nthat tenant is you, right?\n\n479\n00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.470\nAnd everything associated with\nyou in other words in theory.\n\n480\n00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.600\nBut if you are gonna be\nconsuming as a tenant inside\n\n481\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:07.580\nof Microsoft's Office 365 cloud\nYou're one tenant among millions.\n\n482\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.520\nIf you're consuming on AWS you're\none tenant among millions.\n\n483\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.920\nIf you are in the hey let's provide\ncloud services to the business but\n\n484\n00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.220\neach business unit or each department\ngets their own set of resources business\n\n485\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.800\ninternally, then you are a cloud provider\ndoing private cloud with tenants.\n\n486\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.160\nBut you're doing it privately for\nyour own business.\n\n487\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.460\nSo you could easily find yourself in\nthis model doing this, it's up to you,\n\n488\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.810\nin the sense you gotta think through the\nlogic of how you gonna put Provision this.\n\n489\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.260\nSo you may or\nmay not have multiple tenants.\n\n490\n00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.830\nIt's hard to say.\n\n491\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.690\nBut, if you decide to go into the I'm\ngonna sell cloud services business,\n\n492\n00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.180\nyou're definitely gonna have tenants.\n\n493\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.230\nJust be aware of that.\n\n494\n00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.840\nWe talked about virtual machines and\nclouds right here.\n\n495\n00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.568\nLike the cloud is going to be essentially\nmade up of a bunch of resources from\n\n496\n00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:58.147\nthese various areas that we put together\nare the common resources that we\n\n497\n00:23:58.147 --> 00:24:01.922\nmanage to create a Cloud are as follows,\ngot a list of them.\n\n498\n00:24:01.922 --> 00:24:08.569\nWe have host groups and/or VMWare pools,\nmeaning.\n\n499\n00:24:08.569 --> 00:24:12.816\nHost groups and the systems and\nmake them up to provide the resources.\n\n500\n00:24:12.816 --> 00:24:14.244\nWe have logical networks,\n\n501\n00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:18.255\nwe're gonna take a look at how to create\nthose we'll talk a bit about those.\n\n502\n00:24:18.255 --> 00:24:21.094\nRemember we talked about down here\nunder host the fact that we can\n\n503\n00:24:21.094 --> 00:24:22.440\ncreate a host group.\n\n504\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.090\nWe talked about the fact\nthat up under fabric here.\n\n505\n00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.340\nWe have networks and\nlogical networks right here.\n\n506\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.960\nWe're gonna create some\ntalk about them in a bit.\n\n507\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.310\nLoad balancers,\nthey're also gonna be here.\n\n508\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.570\nWe'll be able to go in and use either the\nexisting load balancer or create our own.\n\n509\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.620\nSo we have load balancing templates,\nand the ability to bring in third\n\n510\n00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.370\nparty vendors that have approved load\nbalancers that we could add in here.\n\n511\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.410\nWe have VIP templates,\nvirtual IP templates, right down here.\n\n512\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.530\nWe don't have any in there yet,\nagain we'll be creating these and\n\n513\n00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.760\ntalking about them.\n\n514\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.870\nPort classifications, we can go in,\n\n515\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.810\nmost of this stuff's up under\nthe networking fabric as you can see.\n\n516\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.080\nPort classification, so we can go in and\nyou'll see we can assign\n\n517\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.238\ndifferent ports and what they do and\nwhat their profile looks like.\n\n518\n00:25:04.238 --> 00:25:08.180\nSingle root I/O virtualization for\nmachines that require\n\n519\n00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.378\nessentially non-abstract to pass through\nthe Hypervisor direct to the resources.\n\n520\n00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:17.740\nSingle route I/O virtualization\nallows us to bypass the hypervisor\n\n521\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.560\ngoing direct to the hardware for\ncertain functions and capabilities.\n\n522\n00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.330\nAnd we have to support that\nin certain situations.\n\n523\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.503\nWe have host management,\nnetwork load balancing,\n\n524\n00:25:27.503 --> 00:25:32.492\ngeneral or guest dynamic IP, live\nmigration workload, band width allocation.\n\n525\n00:25:32.492 --> 00:25:34.896\nSo there's different\nport classifications for\n\n526\n00:25:34.896 --> 00:25:38.300\ndifferent functions that we may\nprovide and those are here.\n\n527\n00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.753\nWe have storage and the ability down\nhere under fabric to come down here,\n\n528\n00:25:42.753 --> 00:25:43.707\ngo to storage.\n\n529\n00:25:43.707 --> 00:25:46.880\nAnd we could see our storage providers.\n\n530\n00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.420\nWe could see the arrays,\nthe file servers for doing fiber channel.\n\n531\n00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.520\nWe have our fabric for fiber there.\n\n532\n00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.630\nWe have our library.\n\n533\n00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.250\nWe've been looking at the library.\n\n534\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.200\nWe have our capacities and\nquotas and capabilities.\n\n535\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.950\nAll nine of these items all go\nin towards making up the Cloud.\n\n536\n00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:07.660\nThey are the feeder elements and\nthe functional capabilities, capacities,\n\n537\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.360\nlibrary storage, port classification,\n\n538\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.080\netc., all these things\nare the building blocks of the Cloud.\n\n539\n00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.060\nAnd they all go in and help us to\nunderstand how to make a cloud, and\n\n540\n00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.950\nwe'll be walking through and\nthinking through the logic of that.\n\n541\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.630\nWe have three distinct areas in\nthe fabric, as you've already seen.\n\n542\n00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.950\nWe have storage, we have networking,\nand we have servers, right?\n\n543\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.659\nThe host area, and\nwe've been through these three, but\n\n544\n00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:27.094\nwe just wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with.\n\n545\n00:26:27.094 --> 00:26:29.412\nLet me just open up the servers area here.\n\n546\n00:26:29.412 --> 00:26:30.487\nYou're familiar with the logic here.\n\n547\n00:26:30.487 --> 00:26:34.113\nWe have all of our hosts,\nwhatever host you may have,\n\n548\n00:26:34.113 --> 00:26:36.462\nup under infrastructure in here.\n\n549\n00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:39.808\nWe have our library servers,\nour PXE servers, our update servers,\n\n550\n00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:43.675\nour vCenter servers if we have vCenter,\nour VMM server, if we're integrating\n\n551\n00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:48.030\nthe wsus functionality our update server's\ngonna be managed and integrated from here.\n\n552\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.588\nSo these are the places\nwhere we plug in and\n\n553\n00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:56.110\ncoordinate management of all server based\ninfrastructure, through the fabric.\n\n554\n00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.180\nFabric generically in our world,\nmeans connectivity,\n\n555\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.370\nmeans management resources,\nmeans configuration.\n\n556\n00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.970\nAnd means the ability to manage and\ndeploy those resources so\n\n557\n00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.610\nthe fabric's the interconnect.\n\n558\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.140\nIt's the things that allow us to\nsee resources, connect to them, and\n\n559\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.820\nuse them broadly and widely.\n\n560\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.050\nAnd they're broken out into the servers,\nnetworking, and storage categories.\n\n561\n00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.109\n&gt;&gt; So\nAdam because we have those interconnects,\n\n562\n00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:21.713\nso they're almost like interwoven,\nis that where that term fabric comes from?\n\n563\n00:27:21.713 --> 00:27:25.425\nWe see like usually redundancies, if we're\nsetting up an environment like this,\n\n564\n00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:26.917\nwe usually have multiple paths.\n\n565\n00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:30.240\nSo if one of those particular lines\nof communication were to break,\n\n566\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.058\nwe have additional lines of fabric.\n\n567\n00:27:32.058 --> 00:27:35.451\nIs that one way to think of it?\n\n568\n00:27:35.451 --> 00:27:39.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no, so you're mixing metaphors.\n\n569\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.300\nSo, the idea makes sense but\n\n570\n00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.430\nnot the way necessarily that\nyou're using it in this context.\n\n571\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.762\nThe idea of the fabric is really more all\nof the main areas by functional groups,\n\n572\n00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:53.227\nservers, meaning all the physical\ninfrastructure were met, well, physical or\n\n573\n00:27:53.227 --> 00:27:56.721\nvirtual cuz they don't have to\nphysical but the virtualized and\n\n574\n00:27:56.721 --> 00:28:00.700\nphysical infrastructure that\nprovides resources as a category.\n\n575\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.892\nNetworking, which is where we\nwould potentially get in to hey,\n\n576\n00:28:03.892 --> 00:28:06.250\nI have a single path versus a multi-path.\n\n577\n00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.040\nSo I would have logical networks,\nIP pools,\n\n578\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.720\nthings like that that we talked about.\n\n579\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.277\nAnd storage, which is our back-end\nrepository for all of our data, right,\n\n580\n00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:15.000\ngenerically.\n\n581\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.400\nWe certainly want to focus\non the reliability and\n\n582\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.020\nthe redundancy aspects\nof providing services.\n\n583\n00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.430\nAnd through networking and in other areas,\n\n584\n00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.060\nthrough servers with high availability and\nfault tolerance technology.\n\n585\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.860\nIn networking primarily with NIC teeming\nand as a result redundancy of path.\n\n586\n00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.814\nAnd in storage with things like clustering\nso that we have reliable environments that\n\n587\n00:28:39.814 --> 00:28:43.860\nif of one member was to fail,\nthe others would still provide services.\n\n588\n00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.770\nWe can look at and certainly think about\nredundancy and therefore survivability\n\n589\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.160\nacross the fabric but it's gonna be called\ndifferent things by different area.\n\n590\n00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.980\nIt is not just multipathing.\n\n591\n00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.750\nIt's not just the general\nidea of redundancy.\n\n592\n00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:03.310\nIt's specific technologies by vertical\nbecause each area of the fabric\n\n593\n00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:07.110\nprovides different capabilities\nto create that capability.\n\n594\n00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.350\nIt just depends on what\nwe're talking about.\n\n595\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.280\nSo you're absolutely right in\nthe sense that it's one of the pieces.\n\n596\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.634\nBut it's not the only way we think of it,\nif that makes sense.\n\n597\n00:29:14.634 --> 00:29:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n598\n00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:20.419\n&gt;&gt; If that, just to broaden it, make it\na little more easy to refer to by category\n\n599\n00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:25.103\nsince we're chunking things into servers,\nnetworking, and storage,\n\n600\n00:29:25.103 --> 00:29:28.750\nwhich are the classification\nareas within the console.\n\n601\n00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.137\nI'm trying to map it to what we\nalready break the product into.\n\n602\n00:29:31.137 --> 00:29:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can do that.\n\n603\n00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.650\n&gt;&gt; So if you think about it\nthat way it's definitely what,\n\n604\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.600\nCherokee said, it's 100% correct.\n\n605\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.590\nI don't want you to think it's\nnot It's just she only focused in\n\n606\n00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.990\ninadvertently on just\none of the three areas.\n\n607\n00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.380\nAnd said, so we would create it this\nway but it's broader than that.\n\n608\n00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.070\nIt's that way in that one, but\nthere's ways of doing it in\n\n609\n00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.584\nthe other two that we would also want\nto incorporate into that conversation.\n\n610\n00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:55.770\nAnd so overall, absolutely it's\nthe overlapping mutually reinforcing,\n\n611\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.920\ninterweaving, to use your\nanalogy of the strands or\n\n612\n00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.780\nthe threads of the various components\nthe pieces we provide, that allow us to\n\n613\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.350\nprovide services in a redundant and\nhighly available fashion that we think of.\n\n614\n00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.320\nAnd that's one of the reasons why\nit's referred to commonly as fabric.\n\n615\n00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.355\nAbsolutely correct, so that is good.\n\n616\n00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:16.800\n&gt;&gt; But\nextra redundancy wouldn't be like denim?\n\n617\n00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.460\nYou don't go to that extreme?\n\n618\n00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know that I would refer to\n\n619\n00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.270\nit that way.\n\n620\n00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm just joking.\n\n621\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think I'd use\nthe denim analogy to refer to that.\n\n622\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.540\nI'm not one to do that.\n\n623\n00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.130\nI'll go out on a limb, but\nI'm not going out on a denim limb.\n\n624\n00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:36.040\nAll right, so we do have, we do have, the\ngeneral ideas, hopefully, in your mind.\n\n625\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.861\n&gt;&gt; At a high level again.\n\n626\n00:30:36.861 --> 00:30:40.240\nThis is gonna take several episodes for\nus to get through and build knowledge on.\n\n627\n00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.230\nBe great if we could do it all in one\nepisode but as Cherokee hinted at and\n\n628\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.210\nalluded it to, it's a little bit\nmore than one as you could see.\n\n629\n00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.260\nWe just scratched the surface, and\n\n630\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.790\nall we did was just look at\nsome pretty pictures and icons.\n\n631\n00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.288\nWe've talked a little but\nabout functionality, and\n\n632\n00:30:53.288 --> 00:30:55.451\nlaid out the general road\nmap in the console and\n\n633\n00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:58.467\nthirty minutes went by [SOUND]\njust like that as they say, right.\n\n634\n00:30:58.467 --> 00:31:01.567\nSo that's the clue by the way for\nyou to say that I'm actually done and\n\n635\n00:31:01.567 --> 00:31:04.798\nwe're not gonna miss the fact that I\nam gonna wrap up here just a minute.\n\n636\n00:31:04.798 --> 00:31:06.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam,\ntime flies when you're having fun.\n\n637\n00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.320\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n638\n00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.600\n&gt;&gt; So what can I say here?\n\n639\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.770\nStay tuned though we do have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n640\n00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.880\nFor this show,\nwe will go ahead and sign out.\n\n641\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.100\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose,\n&gt;&gt; But I wasn't done done yet.\n\n642\n00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.295\nI was almost done.\n\n643\n00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:17.640\n&gt;&gt; That was just a sign to\nlet you know I was done.\n\n644\n00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.720\nI'm only kidding, I am done.\n\n645\n00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.660\nWe're gonna sign off.\n\n646\n00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.790\nBut do come back and join us,\n\n647\n00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.820\ncuz remember-\n&gt;&gt; We'll still be here, yeah.\n\n648\n00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.070\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's definitely gonna be here.\n\n649\n00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.500\nWe're gonna have a guest host\nwith Daniel coming in as well.\n\n650\n00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.830\nIt's gonna be really cool.\n\n651\n00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.180\nAnd in addition all kidding aside,\n\n652\n00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.180\nmultiple episodes coming\nup after this one.\n\n653\n00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.460\nThey're gonna help to build on this\nidea of how we create the things that\n\n654\n00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.760\nCherokee was talking about.\n\n655\n00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.280\nHow do we create those networks,\nhow do we create that redundancy?\n\n656\n00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.510\nHow do we set this all up, and\n\n657\n00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.410\nmost importantly,\nhow do you actually see it deployed?\n\n658\n00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.350\nIf you come back and take a look after we\ntalk about it we're gonna actually do it\n\n659\n00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.370\nfor you and show you how it gets done.\n\n660\n00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.130\nSo, make sure you come on back and see us.\n\n661\n00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.975\n&gt;&gt; All right, see ya, bye.\n\n662\n00:31:51.975 --> 00:31:59.244\n[MUSIC]\n\n663\n00:31:59.244 --> 00:32:01.527\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.271\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.394\nIn this episode, we'll continue to look at\nhow we can actually plan to deploy with\n\n7\n00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.030\nsystems that are virtual machine manager.\n\n8\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.708\nBack in studios today,\nwith us we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.950\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.140\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always fun to be\nhere continuing our conversation.\n\n11\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.258\nSo we'll continue discussing how\nwe set up, manage, configure and\n\n12\n00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:38.609\ndeploy the private cloud using SCVMM.\n\n13\n00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.442\nWe took it through the console at\na high level in our last episode,\n\n14\n00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:43.152\nencourage you to go back, take a look.\n\n15\n00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:46.129\nIf you're just joining us and\nhave not watched it,\n\n16\n00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.090\nwe just laid down some of\nthe navigational roadmap pointers there.\n\n17\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.480\nWhat's the fabric,\nwhat's the categories it's broken up into,\n\n18\n00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.660\nwhat's going on with that whole library\nthing, what's in the settings area.\n\n19\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.970\nJust some of those markers on the road\nthat help us to better understand\n\n20\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.900\nwhat we're doing.\n\n21\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.080\nWant to jump in and take a look at network\nvirtualization from an architecture\n\n22\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.970\nperspective as we turn back to\nour conversations on the console.\n\n23\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.812\nGive you a little bit of the theory and\n\n24\n00:01:09.812 --> 00:01:13.420\nthe vocabulary around virtualization\nof the networking stack.\n\n25\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.740\nSo we better understand some of\nthe things that are going on, in there.\n\n26\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.360\nSo we're gonna be talking about the idea\nof how we look at network virtualization.\n\n27\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.880\nSpecifically the idea of something,\nthe theory of something,\n\n28\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.520\nthat is fundamental to any\nvirtualization conversation.\n\n29\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.160\nWhen we talk about traffic management.\n\n30\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.080\nTalk about network virtualization.\n\n31\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.300\nWe talked about the idea of encapsulation,\nand specifically the idea of network\n\n32\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.440\nencapsulation is the idea\nof taking traffic flows.\n\n33\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.540\nIn this case probably our cloud traffic\nflow, and we're gonna look at it, and\n\n34\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.020\nisolate it, manage it,\nand somehow manipulate it.\n\n35\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.720\nAnd package it up in such a way\nthat we can have it traverse.\n\n36\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.240\nWe can have it move through common\nnetworks but still maintain its integrity,\n\n37\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.670\nits confidentiality, its availability\nto the owner and to the carrier.\n\n38\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.560\nWithout commingling or in some way\ngetting modified, mixed up, and\n\n39\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.620\nor somehow being taken away\nfrom us by other forces.\n\n40\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.958\nOther entities, other tenants,\nother flows in the system.\n\n41\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.570\nSo we're gonna look at how we segment or\nsegregate that traffic\n\n42\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.940\nas it traverses across the physical\nnetworks that are shared.\n\n43\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.850\nThink of the internet,\nthink of the world wide web.\n\n44\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.230\nThink of the exterior of your LAN,\nin other words,\n\n45\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.280\ngenerically we talk about that as the WAN.\n\n46\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.770\nAnd as we move across the WAN to\ncomplete communications where VMs and\n\n47\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.250\nwhen VMs are distributed\nacross multiple hosts.\n\n48\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.590\nIf they're remote,\nwe may have geo-stretched or\n\n49\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.270\ngeosynchronously distributed clustering.\n\n50\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720\nSo we may have hosts at different\nlocations that make up a data center\n\n51\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.820\ncluster for us, or an SCVMM clustered\nset of hosts, a host group.\n\n52\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.209\nWe may have them all in one data center,\nin one area geographically,\n\n53\n00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.260\nin the same physical location.\n\n54\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.066\nBut they may be on different\nportions of our network and\n\n55\n00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:59.640\nwe have to transit the LAN to be\nable to complete communication.\n\n56\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.520\nSo either way, the idea of network\nencapsulation is the idea of\n\n57\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.980\nprotecting that traffic as we move across\nthe physical cabling and the interfaces,\n\n58\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.410\nthe switches, the routers, the firewalls.\n\n59\n00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.530\nWhatever the case may be, and to allow\nus to control and secure that traffic in\n\n60\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.040\nsuch a way that as we distribute it across\nthe multiple hosts in our host group.\n\n61\n00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.995\nThat we keep it isolated and\nsecured from all the other people,\n\n62\n00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.740\nall the other tenants in our\nmulti-tenant environment.\n\n63\n00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.975\nThis becomes a very important\nfundamental thought process for us.\n\n64\n00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:31.520\nSoftware-defined networks help us to do\nthis and we're gonna define the various\n\n65\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.800\nelements of the network through the\nsoftware interfaces in the SCVMM console.\n\n66\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.215\nWe've already hinted at that and\nshown you some of those capabilities and\n\n67\n00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:40.600\nexplained the logical idea.\n\n68\n00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.477\nAt a high level of segmenting our\nfabric into networking, into storage,\n\n69\n00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:48.980\nand into the hosts area, the server's\narea is what we call it, specifically.\n\n70\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.490\nAnd then looking at resources and\ninfrastructure on all three of those and\n\n71\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.730\nusing those components to\nmake up our communication and\n\n72\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.950\nour ability to manage services.\n\n73\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.240\nSo we're gonna be looking at that.\n\n74\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.870\nBut software defining our networks\nalso gives us the ability to have\n\n75\n00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.710\nthe tenants bring in their\nown IP addresses, IPv4, IPv6.\n\n76\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.770\nThe tenant may own their own addresses.\n\n77\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.090\nAnd want to have their own address space,\nand we can make that possible for\n\n78\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.810\nthe tenants without conflicts.\n\n79\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.260\nMeaning, if Cherokee was a tenant,\nif I was a tenant, if we were both hosted.\n\n80\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.395\nIn the same general data center\nenvironment, with shared infrastructure,\n\n81\n00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:29.404\nin multi-tenant scenarios, we could both\nuse an IP Stack That was 192, 168, 0.\n\n82\n00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:33.400\nWhatever the host IP's would be,\nmaybe one through 200.\n\n83\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.856\nWe could both claim those IP addresses\nwithout any fear of conflict because we\n\n84\n00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:40.380\ncould isolate them and encapsulate them so\nthat they would not see each other.\n\n85\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.920\nSo this again is one of those things that\nbecomes very important for us to consider.\n\n86\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.340\nBecause, a lot of times, customers\ndo wanna use their own IP ranges.\n\n87\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.590\nAnd we often will be using private\nIP ranges that are repeated,\n\n88\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.950\ncustomer to customer, these days.\n\n89\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.630\nThis is very common.\n\n90\n00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.730\nIt has been for many, many years.\n\n91\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.790\nFor us to be doing that.\n\n92\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.770\nAnd as a result, we wanna be aware of that\nand just not only be sensitive to it, but\n\n93\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.670\nalso understand that we do\nfully support IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n94\n00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.625\nWhich is a newer thought process\ngoing from 32-bit to 128-bit in\n\n95\n00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.780\nterms of the IP address block.\n\n96\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.628\nAnd also as a result, quadrupling\nthe number of IP addresses available\n\n97\n00:05:15.628 --> 00:05:19.280\noverall from billions into hundreds\nof billions into many, many,\n\n98\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.930\nmany, many, IP addresses, right, overall.\n\n99\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.080\nSo we're not worried\nabout that urban myth and\n\n100\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.820\nlegend of us running out of IP addresses.\n\n101\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.870\nThat has made the rounds for\nso many years.\n\n102\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.870\nIt's amazing, cuz you hear, and\nstart to hear, about the fact that, hey,\n\n103\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.790\nwe're gonna run out of IP addresses,\nand that's gonna be horrible.\n\n104\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.760\nAnd that shouldn't happen, and we've\nbeen hearing about that for a long time.\n\n105\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.199\nBut yet, at the same time,\nwe haven't run out of IPv4 addresses.\n\n106\n00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.837\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's\n\n107\n00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:43.170\namazing how things threaten to happen but\nthey never actually do.\n\n108\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.132\nAnd we could keep going for\na long time, and\n\n109\n00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:48.030\nprobably never would run out of IP\naddresses, to be honest with you.\n\n110\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.787\nBut speaking of IP addresses,\nwe do have IPv4 and\n\n111\n00:05:50.787 --> 00:05:53.940\nIPv6 inside through\nsoftware-defined networks, and\n\n112\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.500\nthrough encapsulation we keep\nthe IP address conflicts at bay.\n\n113\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.040\nDon't have to worry about that.\n\n114\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.230\nBut when we move outside\nthe software-defined network out into\n\n115\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.620\nthe physical networks and out beyond\ninto things that are beyond our control.\n\n116\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.830\nWe must be using a gateway\nin order to do so.\n\n117\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.339\nYou know gateways commonly\nuse routers as firewalls,\n\n118\n00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.640\nas border devices that\ngive us that flexibility.\n\n119\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.909\nAnd we're gonna be able to bridge the\nphysical network with the virtual network\n\n120\n00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.060\nby using a gateway device.\n\n121\n00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.350\nVery important for us to do that.\n\n122\n00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Now those IP addresses cannot be\nredundant within that physical address.\n\n123\n00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.690\n&gt;&gt; On the physical plane those IP\naddresses must be instantiated uniquely.\n\n124\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.760\nThey cannot be redundant, as you said,\nor we will have problems.\n\n125\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.127\nThere will be conflicts, because they\nwill see each other at some point in\n\n126\n00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:37.900\nthe pathway or in multiple pathways as\nwe cross traffic from here to there.\n\n127\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.320\nAnd that will lead to a inability\nto be able to transmit traffic.\n\n128\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.000\nWe'll lose, through an IP conflict.\n\n129\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.480\nWe'll lose one or\nmore of those interfaces.\n\n130\n00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.630\nSo that's absolutely correct.\n\n131\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.290\nVery good for us to remember that and\nfor us to be thinking about that.\n\n132\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.225\nWe assign two different\nkinds of IP addresses.\n\n133\n00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.380\nVMs are assigned two different\nkinds of IP addresses.\n\n134\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.240\nYou may not know this, and\n\n135\n00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.040\nmost people don't realize this\nwhen we talk about networking.\n\n136\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.886\nAnd we set this up they say,\nI have my IP address,\n\n137\n00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.481\nI see it in my VM I go to\nmy virtual network card.\n\n138\n00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:06.867\nAnd I can pull it up and I do an IP\nconfig or the equivalent in Linux,\n\n139\n00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:09.340\nIF config or\nwhatever it is that you're doing.\n\n140\n00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.900\nCuz the Mac has that whole crazy thing\nthat nobody else understands and\n\n141\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.430\nthey do their own thing, but\nhowever you do it, right?\n\n142\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.100\nWe pull up the IP address configuration\nand we see we have an IP address.\n\n143\n00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.120\nLook, I have 192.168.0.5, that's me.\n\n144\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.080\nYeah, absolutely, you have that.\n\n145\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.820\nWe call that a customer address.\n\n146\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.630\nThat's what we call it.\n\n147\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.260\nWe actually call it in our stack a CA,\ncustomer address.\n\n148\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.900\nThis is the IP visible within the virtual\nmachine network, an IP address range that\n\n149\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.300\nis defined by the tenant traditionally,\nso it's controlled by them.\n\n150\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.810\nThis allows us to enable and\npermit communication.\n\n151\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.424\nBetween the VMs on premises within our\ninfrastructure stack and from the physical\n\n152\n00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:49.160\nout to the cloud space using a VPN\nif necessary to move back and forth.\n\n153\n00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.235\nBut the customer address is the one\nthat shows up in the virtual machine and\n\n154\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:55.390\nthe virtual network that we could see and\nthe tenant interacts with.\n\n155\n00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.970\nWe also have a secondary, a second\naddress, not secondary, I was gonna say.\n\n156\n00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.777\nSecondary comes in with VLANs and\nprivate VLANs as we stack them,\n\n157\n00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:03.110\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n158\n00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.405\nBut rather, a second address called\nthe Provider Address, the PA.\n\n159\n00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:09.912\nAs opposed to the customer address,\nthe CA, two distinct addresses,\n\n160\n00:08:09.912 --> 00:08:13.690\nprovider address is based on\nthe physical network infrastructure.\n\n161\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.421\nAnd this is used only on the physical\nnetwork as we were talking about,\n\n162\n00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.760\nnot presented to the VM.\n\n163\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.440\nVM doesn't see it,\ndoesn't have knowledge of it directly.\n\n164\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.060\nBut rather we use it to\ntransfer the number traffic\n\n165\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.948\nbetween devices that participate\nin the network virtualization.\n\n166\n00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:32.460\nAnd through Hyper-V in the abstraction\nof and the creation of those networks.\n\n167\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.420\nAnd so the provider address is\nused to move traffic back and\n\n168\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.900\nforth between the host and\nthe VM itself, moving it back and forth.\n\n169\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.380\nBut it's not exposed to the VM cuz it's\ncontrolled at the host level rather than\n\n170\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.300\nused by the VM inside the virtual\nnetwork to be able to move traffic and\n\n171\n00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.230\nexpose to that particular machines.\n\n172\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.260\nSo it's interesting, we have two\ndistinct addresses, customer address and\n\n173\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.650\nprovider address that is used.\n\n174\n00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.649\nWhen we send traffic between the Hyper-V\nhosts, we are utilizing the customer IP\n\n175\n00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:04.297\naddress by utilizing the PA, the provider\naddress of each machine as well.\n\n176\n00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:06.865\nWe use both as we're sending\ntraffic between the hosts.\n\n177\n00:09:06.865 --> 00:09:11.010\nAnd so both are in play, but we often are\nonly interacting with and thinking of one.\n\n178\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.800\nSo it's kind of interesting\nin terms of that and\n\n179\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.400\nthat's something not\neverybody understands or\n\n180\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.580\nis aware of, it's kind of an interesting\nlittle quirk of how we do things.\n\n181\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.060\nWhen we virtualize the network stack,\nthe virtual machine is presenting a fully\n\n182\n00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.580\nvirtualized network interface to\nbind itself to a virtual switch.\n\n183\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.050\nWe have a virtual port, we have\na virtual network card, virtual switch.\n\n184\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.820\nYou think about the lot that maintains\nitself in the physical plane.\n\n185\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.513\nIf we were talking about the actual\nphysicality of the network that we\n\n186\n00:09:37.513 --> 00:09:38.541\ntransmit data on.\n\n187\n00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:42.400\nWe would talk about a physical network\ncard, the back of any of our laptops.\n\n188\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.600\nOr if it's wireless, the connection that\nwe got through the wireless interface\n\n189\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.520\nover to the wireless access point.\n\n190\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.230\nEventually back to the cable that runs out\nof the back of one or more of those or\n\n191\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.840\nsomehow connects them up into a switch.\n\n192\n00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.432\nAnd then through one or more switches,\nultimately into a run and\n\n193\n00:09:57.432 --> 00:09:58.632\nthen ultimately to a router.\n\n194\n00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.941\nAnd out through a router\nacross the gateway,\n\n195\n00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:04.951\nout into other networks that are gonna\nlink us from wherever we are to just about\n\n196\n00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:06.960\nany place on the planet in theory.\n\n197\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.225\nThrough the internet, the world wide web,\nand other private and public and\n\n198\n00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:12.130\nsemi-private, semi-public networks.\n\n199\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.020\nWe could connect both over those systems.\n\n200\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.840\nWe can use virtual private networks and\n\n201\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.630\ntunnel through these systems\nsecurely to communicate.\n\n202\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.550\nBut ultimately, we have physicality\nthrough our networking in the real world.\n\n203\n00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.170\nWe just translate that in the virtual\nworld, the components are the same.\n\n204\n00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.600\nWe have a real network card\nin the physical world,\n\n205\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.440\nwe have a virtual network card, one or\nmore of them per VM in the virtual space.\n\n206\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.210\nWe have physical switches\nthat operate at layer two\n\n207\n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.520\nof the OSI model was a standard switch.\n\n208\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.930\nWe have virtual switches that are created\non a host, either through Hyper-V and or\n\n209\n00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.260\nthrough SCVMM.\n\n210\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.030\nAs we go through and create our logical\nnetworks, and we create our logical\n\n211\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.940\nswitches and all of the stuff\nassociated with it in the console.\n\n212\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.530\nAnd those are our standard layer 2 and\nor layer 3 switches,\n\n213\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.450\nif they are managed and\nhave higher level functionality.\n\n214\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.590\nAnd we see those, we have ports, we have\nphysical ports on a physical switch.\n\n215\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.430\nIn the real world,\n\n216\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.230\nwe have virtual ports connected to\nvirtual switches in the virtual world.\n\n217\n00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.530\nEverything that we know about\nour physical networking and\n\n218\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.000\nthe properties of networking in the\nphysical world translates identically into\n\n219\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.960\nthe virtual world.\n\n220\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.641\nWe don't break the laws of physics.\n\n221\n00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:19.240\nWe don't violate the rules\nof the universe.\n\n222\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.010\nNothing is gonna change.\n\n223\n00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.460\nYou've got an IPv4 or\nv6 address in the physical world,\n\n224\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.630\nyou've got the same thing\nin the virtual world.\n\n225\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.777\nI tell my students,\ntell my customers when I talk about this.\n\n226\n00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:33.418\nThat the hardest and yet at the same time\nthe simplest concept for you to get your\n\n227\n00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:37.870\nmind around when you talk about\nvirtualization is the idea of networking.\n\n228\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.200\nBecause when you understand\nthe fundamental concept of the fact that\n\n229\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.410\neverything we do in the physical world\nis identical in the virtual world.\n\n230\n00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.679\nThe names maybe different,\nmaybe we don't call a network a network.\n\n231\n00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.752\nMaybe it's called a virtual\nmachine port group,\n\n232\n00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:52.640\nmaybe it's called a logical\nnetwork instead of the network.\n\n233\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.502\nWe have unique names for certain things,\nbut that's vocabulary effect.\n\n234\n00:11:56.502 --> 00:11:59.130\nIt doesn't mean that we're\nchanging the way it works.\n\n235\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.580\nIt's been for\nchanging what we refer to it as.\n\n236\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.693\n&gt;&gt; I can see how it can be quite\na logical junk especially when it comes\n\n237\n00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:08.783\nto terminology, because Adam, if you think\nabout terms like our physical address.\n\n238\n00:12:08.783 --> 00:12:10.964\nSome people when we're talking\nabout our MAC addresses,\n\n239\n00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.740\nwe don't have a physical machine, but\nyes, we still have a MAC address.\n\n240\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.056\nSo I could see how people-\n&gt;&gt; Remember, and we have it,\n\n241\n00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:19.480\nnot because we don't have\na physical machine or we do.\n\n242\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.453\nWe have it because we have a network\ninterface that the MAC address is\n\n243\n00:12:21.453 --> 00:12:22.570\nbound to, and that hasn't changed.\n\n244\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.454\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n245\n00:12:23.454 --> 00:12:26.615\n&gt;&gt; And we have it in the physical world\nbecause we have a network interface\n\n246\n00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:28.360\nthe MAC address is bound to.\n\n247\n00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.370\nEven if you have a device that may not\nbe a machine traditional sense, right?\n\n248\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.326\nYour funky little watch you\ngot going on there, right?\n\n249\n00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.923\n&gt;&gt; Watch?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or whatever it is, right?\n\n250\n00:12:38.923 --> 00:12:42.340\nThat has a MAC address assigned to it,\nbecause it has a network interface.\n\n251\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.272\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's wireless, but\n\n252\n00:12:43.272 --> 00:12:44.460\nit has a network interface.\n\n253\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.370\nAnd anything that has a network stack,\nan IP address assigned to it that can\n\n254\n00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.050\ncommunicate wired to wirelessly is also\ngonna have a MAC address bound to it.\n\n255\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.290\nThat's why the rules are the same,\nthey do not change.\n\n256\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.700\nAnd that's what we gotta think about and\nunderstand.\n\n257\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.480\nAnd if you can wrap your head around that.\n\n258\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.944\nThen all you gotta do is just learn\nthe specific vocabulary by vendor for what\n\n259\n00:13:03.944 --> 00:13:08.776\nthey refer to their stuff as, whatever\ntheir networking components are called.\n\n260\n00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:12.980\nAnd if a physical adapter is\ncalled a physical adapter, great.\n\n261\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.810\nIf it's called an uplink or a VM NIC or\n\n262\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.110\na V NIC or whatever it's referred to\nby the vendor, it doesn't matter.\n\n263\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.350\nAll you need to learn is just the name,\nand\n\n264\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.210\nyou know the underlying\nfile process is the same.\n\n265\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.840\nAnd that's what you gotta figure out,\n\n266\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.930\nif you can understand that,\neverything else we'll talk about.\n\n267\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.890\nRegardless of what it is,\nwhere it is, how we approach it.\n\n268\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.290\nAll this is just icing on the cake.\n\n269\n00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.923\nIt's just the features you need to that\ninterface, you need to that vendor and\n\n270\n00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:38.092\nhow you implement them.\n\n271\n00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:42.020\nAnd that's all you have to focus on, and\nif you can get your head around that.\n\n272\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.950\nEverything else ultimately,\nis gonna be really simple, right?\n\n273\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.610\nOr at least in theory,\nthat's what they promise you.\n\n274\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.763\nIt never works out that way-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:50.910\n&gt;&gt; But that's what they say should happen.\n\n276\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.630\nIt is actually simple,\nI'm only kidding around.\n\n277\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.700\nIt's really not that\ncomplicated believe it or not.\n\n278\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.490\nReally, the hardest part as I said,\nis just learning where things are in\n\n279\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.850\nthe vendor and interface and\nwhat they're called.\n\n280\n00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.461\nSo that they roughly approximate\nthe things you're used to and\n\n281\n00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:05.278\nroughly approximate the functionality\nthat you're thinking of.\n\n282\n00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:08.007\nWhen we think about network\nvirtualization traffic flow,\n\n283\n00:14:08.007 --> 00:14:10.744\nwe're really thinking about\nthis idea of encapsulation.\n\n284\n00:14:10.744 --> 00:14:13.165\nAnd you can think of it, and\nI talk about this a little bit,\n\n285\n00:14:13.165 --> 00:14:15.550\ntypically with customers and\nstudent says an envelope.\n\n286\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.380\nIf we think about what we're putting in\nthe envelope to mail something, right?\n\n287\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.640\nFrom a traffic management perspective.\n\n288\n00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.400\nIf our data is packetized\nas we know it is,\n\n289\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.305\nchunked into byte sized little nuggets\nof data we can throw into a packet.\n\n290\n00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:31.947\nWe call that data packet, we call it\nrather a data packet, a data frame,\n\n291\n00:14:31.947 --> 00:14:32.621\na data gram.\n\n292\n00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:34.495\nThere's different names you\nhear it referring to it as\n\n293\n00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:36.645\ndepending on what you're doing and\nwho you're reading.\n\n294\n00:14:36.645 --> 00:14:40.165\nBut ultimately it's a chunked,\nfixed size amount of data, right?\n\n295\n00:14:40.165 --> 00:14:43.456\nAnd we just put it into a little bucket or\nbasket for Cherokee.\n\n296\n00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:44.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n297\n00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:46.457\nas a result with pretty flower on it and-\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n298\n00:14:46.457 --> 00:14:47.002\n&gt;&gt; Nice color, right?\nAnd\n\n299\n00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:51.647\nthen what we do is we take those baskets\nof data and we group them together and\n\n300\n00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:54.688\nwe slap a ship to label on\nthe front of it, right?\n\n301\n00:14:54.688 --> 00:14:57.603\nThat's the data packet header,\ntells us where we're coming from,\n\n302\n00:14:57.603 --> 00:15:00.833\nwho's sending it, and where we're\ngoing to, where we want it delivered.\n\n303\n00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.700\nAnd there's some other stuff\nin there along the way.\n\n304\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.080\nWe have TCP flags that specify whether\nwe're setting up a synax or synchronizing\n\n305\n00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.960\nhandshaking, are we finalizing\ncommunication, is it marked urgent?\n\n306\n00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.320\nIt's different functionality\nthese TCP flags have.\n\n307\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.450\nWe may have an IP set of flags, not maybe\nwe do, whether they're turned on or not.\n\n308\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.370\nAre we fragmenting the data or not?\n\n309\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.860\nThat's what IP deals with in the IP\nflags address fragmentation and\n\n310\n00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.090\nor management of data that is fragmented\nwith a unique fragmentation ID.\n\n311\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.199\nSo that we can link those\npackets back together.\n\n312\n00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:34.091\nI'm 1 of 20, I'm 2 of 20,\nI'm number 10 of 20.\n\n313\n00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:38.070\nSo we could stitch the data together\nas it's received on the other side.\n\n314\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.060\nWe may have a VLAN identifier, right?\n\n315\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.890\nThere's a VLAN ID in that packet header,\nif we choose to use VLANs.\n\n316\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.380\nWe've got a lot of stuff\ngoing on in there.\n\n317\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.132\nThere's MAC addresses, Cherokee was\nreminding us of and telling us about.\n\n318\n00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:51.910\nAnd IP addresses, and\nyou're typically gonna have both.\n\n319\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.150\nSo we're gonna see all that, so\n\n320\n00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.610\nwe're gonna have the CA,\nthe customer address, right?\n\n321\n00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.886\nSo think about the customer\naddress network or\n\n322\n00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:03.285\nthe network that the customer\ncommunicates on.\n\n323\n00:16:03.285 --> 00:16:07.913\nThe CA network, these packets,\nif we think of this as envelopes, right?\n\n324\n00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:11.379\nIf think of this as the place we're gonna\nstuff our data into and ship it around.\n\n325\n00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:14.822\nMessages are placed into those envelopes\nand they're addressed accordingly.\n\n326\n00:16:14.822 --> 00:16:18.727\nThe routing address on the outside of the\nenvelope that I talked about, the ship to,\n\n327\n00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:20.880\nsend and receive, to and from, address.\n\n328\n00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.360\nThe routing address on the outside is\nthe PA, the provider address whereas\n\n329\n00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.210\nthe envelope and the data itself is\nfrom the CA the customer address.\n\n330\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.420\nSo we're wrapping one around\nthe other encapsulating so\n\n331\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.420\nthat we know how to deliver the packet.\n\n332\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.180\nAnd then when we unwrap it\nwhen it gets to the host and\n\n333\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.080\nwe deliver it to the internal VM on\nthe host, It gets to the right place.\n\n334\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.689\nIf you think about the logic of saying,\nfor instance,\n\n335\n00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:47.204\nthat we're going to deliver all packages\nto a mailroom in a building, and\n\n336\n00:16:47.204 --> 00:16:51.457\nthen by floor, in theory, or by office,\neveryone, if it's a multi-story building,\n\n337\n00:16:51.457 --> 00:16:54.040\nthat everybody in the building\nhas a common address.\n\n338\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.710\nIt comes to, you know,\n\n339\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.210\n1200 Circle Lane, right, and everybody's\nmail gets delivered to the mailroom.\n\n340\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.370\nBut then in the mailroom, we have a mini\npost-office that will then redistribute\n\n341\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.330\nthat mail by looking at who it\ngoes to within the building.\n\n342\n00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:09.230\nSo we're taking the idea\nof the PA address,\n\n343\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.410\nthe provider address as the main\naddress of the building and\n\n344\n00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.800\ndelivering all mail there,\nthat's the external routable address.\n\n345\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.690\nThen when we get there, we rip that\nouter layer off, we look at the CA,\n\n346\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.920\nthe customer address, and\nit tells us take this to suite five,\n\n347\n00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.220\nCherokee is in suite five,\nthis goes to her.\n\n348\n00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.050\nWell Cherokee would be a VM on that host\n\n349\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.202\ngetting its mail delivered\nthrough the mailroom.\n\n350\n00:17:30.202 --> 00:17:33.670\nRight, Hyper-V manages\nthe mailroom on that host, and\n\n351\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.100\ndistributes the mail to all of the VMs.\n\n352\n00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.580\nI can't believe I just came\nup with a mailroom analogy\n\n353\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.260\nto explain virtualized\nnetworking with Hyper-V.\n\n354\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.920\n&gt;&gt; I think you did pretty well.\n\n355\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.160\nI'm sitting here listening to you and\n\n356\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.400\nI'm trying to wrap my head around this,\nand I also think that how you referenced\n\n357\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.530\nbefore having that background\nnetworking knowledge will really help.\n\n358\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.077\nBecause in my mind as you\nwere explaining that,\n\n359\n00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:52.087\nI was almost kind of mimicking\nthe OSI model as you were talking\n\n360\n00:17:52.087 --> 00:17:53.397\nabout the different [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n361\n00:17:53.397 --> 00:17:56.369\nI didn't actually say OSI cuz I didn't\nwanna really alienate people and\n\n362\n00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:58.625\nsay my God, and\nthey're gonna run away screaming.\n\n363\n00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:01.400\nI didn't wanna do that, right,\nwe don't wanna lose you.\n\n364\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.990\nSo I didn't actually come right out and\nsay it,\n\n365\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.970\nbut I hinted at it, as Cherokee said.\n\n366\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.040\nI talked about layer two and layer three,\nI just didn't come right out and say,\n\n367\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.680\nlayer two is where we get the MAC address.\n\n368\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.430\nLayer three is where we\nget the IP address, and\n\n369\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.540\nwe're gonna see all that stuff\ngoing on and on and on and on.\n\n370\n00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.330\nAnd layer four with TCP and\nUDP with our flags sitting up there right.\n\n371\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.280\nI mean that is the OSA model\nthat I was describing,\n\n372\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.880\nI just didn't call it out for what it was.\n\n373\n00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.100\nNow everybody ran away screaming\ncuz now I said the magic word.\n\n374\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.180\nIt's like mentioning Voldemort's name or\nBeetlejuice right,\n\n375\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.390\njust go running screaming.\n\n376\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.670\nSo just imagine that that's going on.\n\n377\n00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.370\nIf that gives you a better thought process\nhopefully that helps you a little bit to\n\n378\n00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.630\nbetter understand the idea here of\nhow we're gonna encapsulate and\n\n379\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.750\nvisualize networking.\n\n380\n00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.020\nIt's a little bit of a sticky\nconcept as you were saying.\n\n381\n00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.330\nI gotta walk it through kind of slowly and\nmull it over in my mind,\n\n382\n00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.850\nI can connect to it but, no pun intended\nby the way,I can connect to it, but\n\n383\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.510\nyou gotta take it slowly.\n\n384\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.240\nYou gotta think it through,\nit's gotta be logical, but\n\n385\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.650\nif that makes sense as you walk through\nit, referencing the OSI model may or\n\n386\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.620\nmay not work for you, totally up to you.\n\n387\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.750\nReferencing some of the networking\nknowledge I just threw out at you and\n\n388\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.760\ntalked about, if that makes sense to you.\n\n389\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.530\nBut if you can wrap your head around that,\n\n390\n00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.000\nthat's the theory in terms\nof describing what happens.\n\n391\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.050\nIt's a real practical application\ncuz we do have CA and\n\n392\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.240\nPA addresses that we actually refer to and\nuse, that's how our stack works.\n\n393\n00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.700\nBut if you can get the theory, then\nyou're right there where you need to be.\n\n394\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.880\nI mean that's exactly what\nwe want you to know about.\n\n395\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.610\nWe talked off the idea of multitenancy,\nthe need to stratify and segment our\n\n396\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.220\ntraffic supports the idea of multitenancy,\none supports the other in other words.\n\n397\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.740\nWe need to be able to do that to drive\nmultitenancy through our model and\n\n398\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.330\nbe able to host multiple tenants\nin our cloud infrastructure.\n\n399\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.320\nWe've talked about the ability to do that,\nand why that is so important.\n\n400\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.100\nAnd so just keep that in mind,\n\n401\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.790\nremember that as a result of having\nmultiple tenants, we are able to have our\n\n402\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.170\nown networking topologies\ntransplanted right into the cloud.\n\n403\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:58.200\nAll of the tenants needs, their IP ranges,\ntheir physical structure can be\n\n404\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.870\nreproduced in the Cloud, by Tenant, using\nthe resources that we're talking about\n\n405\n00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.730\nbecause we have the ability to be able\nto lock them down, and provide them, and\n\n406\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.600\nbe able to actually interact with them,\nusing this technology.\n\n407\n00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.940\nSpeaking of providing them, speaking of\ninteracting with them, why don't we go\n\n408\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.490\nin and why don't we start actually\ndoing exactly what I just described.\n\n409\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.750\nLet's go create some of that stuff, let's\ninteract with it, let's actually show you,\n\n410\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.930\nnow that we've talked about the theory,\nhow it actually works.\n\n411\n00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.790\nSo join me here if you will, and let's go\nthrough and let's talk about some of this.\n\n412\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:33.980\nI'm back in SCVMM as you saw when we did\nour walkthrough in our last episode.\n\n413\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.550\nI'm in the console,\nI'm in the fabric area,\n\n414\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.058\nwe're going to ignore some of the other\nareas for the moment, focus on the fabric.\n\n415\n00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:41.510\nI'm specifically in the networking\nportion of the fabric,\n\n416\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.800\nwe're going to pretend the storage and the\nservice areas don't exist for the moment.\n\n417\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.710\nWe're not going to focus on them for\nthe remainder of this conversation.\n\n418\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.750\nBut we are going to go through and\n\n419\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.050\nwe're going to start creating\nsome of the components here.\n\n420\n00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.420\nLet's start with a logical network,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n421\n00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.950\nAnd our logical network, we're gonna\nhighlight here under networking.\n\n422\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.392\nNow couple of ways that we\ncan do this in the console,\n\n423\n00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:03.090\nwe can come up here to the Home Ribbon.\n\n424\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.612\nYou can see Create Logical Network\nright there,\n\n425\n00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:10.850\nwe can go to Networking right here, right\nquick Create Logical Network, you can\n\n426\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.120\ncome right over here to Logical Network,\nright click, Create Logical Network.\n\n427\n00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.670\nThere's all this different ways to\ninteract here, we can get in and\n\n428\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.060\nout of the environment,\nas needed just to go create it.\n\n429\n00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.710\nBut the logical network, and\n\n430\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.040\nI'm gonna quote here,\nis defined in the VMM documentation.\n\n431\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.630\nThe logical network is and I quote\nspecifically from Microsoft right off\n\n432\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.120\nthe TechNet site right\nfrom their documentation.\n\n433\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.570\nA logical network is used to organize and\n\n434\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:38.250\nsimplify network assignments for\nhosts, virtual machines, and services.\n\n435\n00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.020\nHosts, VM's, and services.\n\n436\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.110\nAs part of logical network creation,\nwe're about to do that,\n\n437\n00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.830\nyou could create network sites to define\nVLANs, IP subnets and or IP subnet\n\n438\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.710\nVLAN pairs that are associated with the\nlogical network in each physical location.\n\n439\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.770\nIn other words, what the logical\nnetwork describes is the configuration\n\n440\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.710\nof the underlying associated physical\nnetwork, including everything with it,\n\n441\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.860\nthe VLANs, all that kind of stuff.\n\n442\n00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.760\nAnd whether they are going to be routable,\nand\n\n443\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.250\nif they are how we get from point A to\npoint B through point C or whatever.\n\n444\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.960\nAnd we can also define what the physical\nnetwork or if the physical network can or\n\n445\n00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.430\nshould be used to transport software\ndefined network information.\n\n446\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.350\nIn other words, we can use that to\nrepresent how we're going to communicate\n\n447\n00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.740\nand connect with the rest\nof our virtualized stack.\n\n448\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.220\nSo we're going to create a logical network\nthat helps us to do that right now,\n\n449\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.510\nthat's what this does.\n\n450\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.950\nSo let's go in, let's take a look\nat how we're gonna do this.\n\n451\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.740\nWe're gonna go in as you saw here,\nI'm gonna go to the fabric.\n\n452\n00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.970\nI'm gonna create a logical network,\n\n453\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.340\nlet me just get my name and\nthe information I need here.\n\n454\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.240\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna create a logical network,\n\n455\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.400\nwe'll click there.\n\n456\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.380\nGonna get a little wizard.\n\n457\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.660\nLet me move this over so\nthat we can just see that.\n\n458\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.840\nYou can see the edge of the screen there,\nstill see me,\n\n459\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.470\nwe can also see what's going on.\n\n460\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.810\nSo we're gonna give this a name,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n461\n00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.870\nlet's create our logical network.\n\n462\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:58.900\nAnd let me see, we'll call it\nVM Logical Network, very original name.\n\n463\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.160\nAll right, so, we'll call it\nVM Logical Network, give that a name.\n\n464\n00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.790\nDescription, you may want to write\na description there, up to you,\n\n465\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.175\nI'm not going to bother with one.\n\n466\n00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:12.360\nOn Select the option which\ndescribes this logical network,\n\n467\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.400\nare you going to do one\nconnecting network?\n\n468\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.680\nSays here if you do that, just so\n\n469\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.790\nyou could see, the network sites\nwithin the network are equivalent and\n\n470\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.660\nroutable to one another and\ncan be used as a single connected network.\n\n471\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.770\nDo we want to allow new VM networks\ncreated on this logical network to\n\n472\n00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.550\nuse network virtualization?\n\n473\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.530\nDo I want to virtualize\nall the networks created?\n\n474\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.050\nAnd do I want to create a VM\nnetwork with the same name,\n\n475\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.312\nto allow virtual machines to access\nthis logical network directly?\n\n476\n00:23:35.312 --> 00:23:38.126\nYou want to name the VM network\nthe same as a logical network,\n\n477\n00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.570\nthat way VMs can connect to it.\n\n478\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.309\nDo I want to do it with VLAN\nbased independent network, and or\n\n479\n00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:43.397\nprivate VLAN network?\n\n480\n00:23:43.397 --> 00:23:45.604\nMeaning a nested VLAN\ninside of other VLANs,\n\n481\n00:23:45.604 --> 00:23:49.551\nwhat you call sometimes secondary VLANs,\nand we'll have some stuff to say about\n\n482\n00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:52.790\nthat either in the end of this episode or\nan upcoming episode.\n\n483\n00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.710\nWe'll talk through the logic of what\nthose VLANs are and how they work.\n\n484\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.276\nBut remember, generically,\nVLAN, virtual LAN,\n\n485\n00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:04.220\nis a subdividing logically of a subnet or\nnetwork into a further isolated\n\n486\n00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.340\ngrouping within the network using a VMN ID\nin the header of the data packet.\n\n487\n00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.535\nAnd you don't have to be a member of\nthat VMN group to see the traffic.\n\n488\n00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:14.827\nSo it's a logical segmentation\nof a physical network.\n\n489\n00:24:14.827 --> 00:24:19.138\nUsing a unique network identifier,\nthe VLAN ID to tag all traffic.\n\n490\n00:24:19.138 --> 00:24:22.640\nAnd you must be a member of that group,\nhave that VLAN ID and\n\n491\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.866\nbe associated with it on the switch.\n\n492\n00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:28.402\nPlugged into a switch with a port that\ndefines you as being a member of the VLAN\n\n493\n00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:29.630\nfor you to see it.\n\n494\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.920\nWhether that port is virtual or\n\n495\n00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.770\nphysical is irrelevant the idea is still\nthe same it's how you access your VLAN.\n\n496\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.070\nSo just make sure you understand\nthe concept of a VLAN.\n\n497\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.229\nYou may or may not have heard of\nprivate VLAN's or stacked VLAN's or\n\n498\n00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:44.330\nsecondary VLAN's they're all\nreferred to the same way.\n\n499\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.750\nThey all mean the same thing.\n\n500\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.950\nThey are sometimes also\ncalled nested VLAN's.\n\n501\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.660\nThere VLAN's inside of VLAN's.\n\n502\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.607\nWe have what's called a parent or\na primary VLAN.\n\n503\n00:24:51.607 --> 00:24:55.821\nAnd then we have a secondary or\nchild VLAN within it, either isolated,\n\n504\n00:24:55.821 --> 00:25:00.329\nor promiscuous, or community, or\nthe three common categories we create.\n\n505\n00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:04.069\nAnd we are then able to sub divide\nthe VLAN into another group that further\n\n506\n00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:08.320\nisolates and supports traffic management\ndepending on how we choose to see that.\n\n507\n00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.747\nKind of interesting concept and\nwe use it very often but\n\n508\n00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:12.293\nwe'll talk more about it as we go.\n\n509\n00:25:12.293 --> 00:25:15.055\nAll right, so we're gonna choose\none connected network here,\n\n510\n00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.400\nwe're gonna click next.\n\n511\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.030\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nadd our network site.\n\n512\n00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.680\nOur network site's already defined,\nwe do have a general network site here.\n\n513\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.890\nWe're gonna put in all hosts and\nwe're gonna add them in.\n\n514\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:31.060\nOur network site is going to allow us to\nbe able to add in the logical network and\n\n515\n00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.620\nassociate the VLAN's and\nthe subnets there with the host group.\n\n516\n00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.880\nWe have a generic container called\nAll Hosts that we can use just to bind\n\n517\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.450\nall this to.\n\n518\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.680\nIf we have our own host groups made up\nwe would be able to add them in here but\n\n519\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.170\nyou can see we don't have any yet.\n\n520\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.770\nI showed you there were none there but\nwe will create them and\n\n521\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.170\ntalk about them in an upcoming episode.\n\n522\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.240\nAnd you'll see how we create them and\nadd them in.\n\n523\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.888\nBut for now we'll just use the all host\ncontainer which is there generically\n\n524\n00:25:53.888 --> 00:25:55.888\nwhether we create any host groups or not.\n\n525\n00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:59.222\nIt's just where all the hosts windup\ninitially until we subdivide them out and\n\n526\n00:25:59.222 --> 00:26:00.750\nput them into their own host group.\n\n527\n00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.060\nSo we're gonna add them in here.\n\n528\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.940\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna put in a VLAN and IP subnet,\n\n529\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.880\nso let me just get my VLAN ID and\nmy IP range here.\n\n530\n00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.580\nWe're gonna click Insert Row down here\non the bottom so we can program this in.\n\n531\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.431\nWe use a VLAN ID of five and\nwe'll use our IP subnet over here.\n\n532\n00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:22.257\nJust click here and put this in.\n\n533\n00:26:22.257 --> 00:26:26.053\nWe'll do,\nwe're doing a 192.168 network, so\n\n534\n00:26:26.053 --> 00:26:30.984\nwe'll do 0.0/24,\nmeaning the 192.168.0 network with\n\n535\n00:26:30.984 --> 00:26:35.080\nall three of those octets given\nover to the network side.\n\n536\n00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.603\nThat's what our /24 is gonna represent.\n\n537\n00:26:37.603 --> 00:26:42.030\nAnd then the last octet giving over our\nhost ID's right from one to 254 in theory\n\n538\n00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.990\nbeing unique within there.\n\n539\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.260\nAnd there you go boys and\ngirls networking 101, right?\n\n540\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.030\nThank you very much we're\nall done with that.\n\n541\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.270\nAll right, so\nwe've got all that we put that in.\n\n542\n00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:55.100\nNow all kidding aside in case you're not\nfamiliar with what's called slash notation\n\n543\n00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.788\nor shorthand notation on the subnet\nwhich is what I just did where I\n\n544\n00:26:58.788 --> 00:27:01.151\nwrote 192.168.0.0/24.\n\n545\n00:27:01.151 --> 00:27:02.840\nThank you Cisco, right?\n\n546\n00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.586\nSo what we have is instead of writing\na sub net address in the traditional form,\n\n547\n00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:12.907\n255 255 255.0- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We can shorthand it a bit.\n\n548\n00:27:12.907 --> 00:27:14.591\n&gt;&gt; We just shorthand it.\n\n549\n00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Class c.\n\n550\n00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.340\n&gt;&gt; And we know were gonna essentially\nwrite in the default class c sub net mask.\n\n551\n00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.108\nAnd it's just an easier way\nof writing the same thing.\n\n552\n00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:26.132\nThe 255 in the subnet mass represents all\neight bits of that octet being used for\n\n553\n00:27:26.132 --> 00:27:28.300\nnetwork or depending on what we're doing.\n\n554\n00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.270\nIf we have a different number\nin there 255, 255.240.\n\n555\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.100\nWe're borrowing some bits so\nthat we're not using the whole octet\n\n556\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.230\nwe're using three quarters of that or\nwhatever that is.\n\n557\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.760\nSome of it's been given to the host.\n\n558\n00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.068\nSo playing a little game there with\nclasses, Internet and domain routing.\n\n559\n00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:44.898\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We're you just giving me bits?\n\n560\n00:27:44.898 --> 00:27:46.033\n&gt;&gt; I was just giving you bits.\n\n561\n00:27:46.033 --> 00:27:47.247\n&gt;&gt; Since I'm the host?\n\n562\n00:27:47.247 --> 00:27:49.480\n&gt;&gt; Since you're the host exactly right?\n\n563\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.760\nBut I'm done.\n\n564\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.577\nWe need like that rim shot sound\neffect for when you do that right?\n\n565\n00:27:53.577 --> 00:27:58.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I have no sound effects bar which\nhello suggestion box for reduction team.\n\n566\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.238\n&gt;&gt; So we need something like that,\n\n567\n00:28:00.238 --> 00:28:02.671\nso be yes I was just talking\nabout the logic of that.\n\n568\n00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:06.460\nSo by short handing it using slash 24.\n\n569\n00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.920\nYou may have seen slash 16, slash 20.\n\n570\n00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.250\nAgain, if we're borrowing bits\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n571\n00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.300\nThe idea would be that we're simply\nrepresenting what the subnet mask is.\n\n572\n00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.373\nIn this case, the Slash 24 is first\nthree octets fully utilized so\n\n573\n00:28:18.373 --> 00:28:20.737\nyou'd see 255255255.0.\n\n574\n00:28:20.737 --> 00:28:23.675\nThat would be our equivalent as you\nsaid class c default subnet mask\n\n575\n00:28:23.675 --> 00:28:25.070\nabsolutely correct.\n\n576\n00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.060\nSo we have all that right and\nwe're putting that in there.\n\n577\n00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.541\nThen we're just going to go ahead and\nclick next.\n\n578\n00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.594\nWe're gonna finish up\ncreating our logical network.\n\n579\n00:28:31.594 --> 00:28:32.710\nWe've got that there.\n\n580\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.761\nNow I've talked about PowerShell before.\n\n581\n00:28:34.761 --> 00:28:36.530\nLet me just hit the view script item here.\n\n582\n00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.790\nYou can see as well look\nthere's a view script button\n\n583\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.210\non the interface here as\nwe go through the wizard.\n\n584\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:45.373\nYou can see that whenever I do this\nI mentioned that in most of our\n\n585\n00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:49.318\nprograms today in many of the wizards\nwe're gonna essentially translate what\n\n586\n00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:52.326\nwe're doing into an answer\nfile with a PowerShell script.\n\n587\n00:28:52.326 --> 00:28:54.846\nAnd just apply the script when\nwe get done behind the aee and\n\n588\n00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:57.305\nthat's what we're doing\nyou could see it here.\n\n589\n00:28:57.305 --> 00:29:01.345\nThis is the PowerShell script\nthat will run through and\n\n590\n00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:04.805\ncreate the logical network for\nit based on the choices we've made and\n\n591\n00:29:04.805 --> 00:29:07.535\nthe information we've provided\ninside of the wizard.\n\n592\n00:29:07.535 --> 00:29:11.745\nThere's my VLan ID parameter and\nmy value there.\n\n593\n00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:15.465\nThere's my subnet parameter\nwith my value there.\n\n594\n00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:19.407\nAnd you see new SC for\nsystem center subnet VLAN, right.\n\n595\n00:29:19.407 --> 00:29:21.030\nSo we're going through and doing all that.\n\n596\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.310\nIf you wanted to write out the PowerShell\nfor all this that's what you'd have\n\n597\n00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.050\nto write in order to be able to do\nthis in PowerShell, right there.\n\n598\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.889\nSo if you want to start boning up\non your PowerShell a little bit,\n\n599\n00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:33.465\ngetting more familiar with it specific\nto System Center Virtual Machine Manager\n\n600\n00:29:33.465 --> 00:29:35.794\nstart taking advantage of\nthat view script button.\n\n601\n00:29:35.794 --> 00:29:37.460\nCopy those scripts take a look at them and\n\n602\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.939\nstart figuring out by mapping back to what\nyou did what all those scripts represent,\n\n603\n00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:44.170\ncuz that's what you're essentially\ngonna be doing right there.\n\n604\n00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.620\nWe're gonna click finish.\n\n605\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.720\nNow remember I said\nthe jobs would come up?\n\n606\n00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.690\nNow it comes up in this kind of\nfunky way where it's all closed up.\n\n607\n00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.170\nIt's there, you just gotta know\nto open it up so you can see it.\n\n608\n00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.577\nBut then once you do that it comes up\nthat way by default going forward.\n\n609\n00:29:55.577 --> 00:29:59.610\nSo once you lower the little\ncharacter to drop the window down so\n\n610\n00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.990\nyou can see the jobs.\n\n611\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.780\nI don't know who the genius\nwas that set that up.\n\n612\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.410\nLet's bring it up and\n\n613\n00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:06.340\nshow them nothing cuz they're not gonna\nwanna know if their job runs or not.\n\n614\n00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.230\nThey're just gonna see a blank window.\n\n615\n00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.600\nThat's just bad UI design,\nthat's what that is.\n\n616\n00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.630\nBut having said that it's\neasy enough to open it up.\n\n617\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.790\nYou'll see there when we do our job,\nwe've run some obviously jobs beforehand.\n\n618\n00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:22.720\nBut you'll see our job there Is going\nto be right there and it is successful.\n\n619\n00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.520\nYou can see it right there it's completed.\n\n620\n00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.434\nAnd so we'll disclose that and\nwe could tell right just by clicking away.\n\n621\n00:30:28.434 --> 00:30:32.464\nAnd coming back or refreshing I remember\nmost of our interfaces don't always\n\n622\n00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:33.580\nrefresh right away.\n\n623\n00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.701\nSometimes even though something is\nthere may not quote unquote show up,\n\n624\n00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.650\nthat doesn't mean it's not\nthere you just have to refresh.\n\n625\n00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.100\nAnd just moving off and\ncoming back tends to do that.\n\n626\n00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.350\nAnd you can see our\nlogical network is there.\n\n627\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.950\nAnd we can click on it we can\nsee information about it.\n\n628\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.735\nWe can go in, we can create additional sub\nitems like IP pools and VM networks there.\n\n629\n00:30:51.735 --> 00:30:54.485\nWe'll be taking a look at that\nover the next couple of minutes.\n\n630\n00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:57.445\nWe could view any dependent resources\nthat may be relying to this.\n\n631\n00:30:57.445 --> 00:30:58.935\nWe can remove it of course.\n\n632\n00:30:58.935 --> 00:31:00.805\nAnd of course we can look at properties.\n\n633\n00:31:00.805 --> 00:31:03.372\nI'm looking at properties center\nto just reruns the wizard.\n\n634\n00:31:03.372 --> 00:31:05.542\nAnd allows us to see what's\ngoing on in there and\n\n635\n00:31:05.542 --> 00:31:07.482\nas a result to that we can\nmake changes if we need to.\n\n636\n00:31:07.482 --> 00:31:13.234\nSo we have our virtual or excuse me our\nlogical network created inside SCVM.\n\n637\n00:31:13.234 --> 00:31:17.056\nWhat we're gonna do now is create a port\nprofile and take a look at four profiles.\n\n638\n00:31:17.056 --> 00:31:17.966\nWe're gonna come down here.\n\n639\n00:31:17.966 --> 00:31:22.086\nI talked to you about four profiles\nas we went through the just\n\n640\n00:31:22.086 --> 00:31:25.206\na quick high level overview of\nthe console in the last episode,\n\n641\n00:31:25.206 --> 00:31:28.240\npointed out that they allow\nus to manage traffic.\n\n642\n00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.090\nAnd to preconfigure certain\nkinds of traffic or\n\n643\n00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.990\nfunctionality through the binding\nof that profile to the port.\n\n644\n00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.560\nAnd so\nwe're gonna create essentially here,\n\n645\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.620\nif we think about it, a port profile\nuplink that's gonna bind to the switch and\n\n646\n00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.100\nultimately allow us to manage this kind\nof traffic through a switch, right?\n\n647\n00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.320\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n648\n00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.627\nSo lets go in and let go and create\nourselves a port profile for hyper V.\n\n649\n00:31:50.627 --> 00:31:53.360\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe'll right click here.\n\n650\n00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.221\nCreate hyper v port profile, you'll see\nthat's our option as we right click.\n\n651\n00:31:57.221 --> 00:32:00.335\nWe'll move this over so\nyou can see that We gonna go ahead and\n\n652\n00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:01.970\nwe're gonna give this a name.\n\n653\n00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.810\nWe'll call this our uplink port profile.\n\n654\n00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:11.440\nSo we'll do test uplink port profile.\n\n655\n00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.482\nAnd again, your description\nyour discretion whether you\n\n656\n00:32:14.482 --> 00:32:16.975\nyou wanna put one in there or\nnot it's up to you.\n\n657\n00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:19.697\nThen for type of Hyper-V port profile,\n\n658\n00:32:19.697 --> 00:32:23.310\nsee virtual network adapter\nport profile or uplink.\n\n659\n00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.270\nWe have to decide what\nwe're gonna do here.\n\n660\n00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.431\nIf we decide to do uplink port profile,\nwhich is what we're gonna do,\n\n661\n00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.827\nyou'll see that we then have\nload balancing algorithm.\n\n662\n00:32:33.827 --> 00:32:35.950\nWe choose our choice here.\n\n663\n00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.900\nWe have a whole bunch of different ways\nwe do software based load balancing and\n\n664\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.738\nthe algorithm associated with it.\n\n665\n00:32:41.738 --> 00:32:46.219\nHost, you could see Default, Dynamic,\nHyper-V Port, MAC Address, IP Address,\n\n666\n00:32:46.219 --> 00:32:47.300\nAddress Hash.\n\n667\n00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.360\nThis is the way we calculate\nthe load balancing and\n\n668\n00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.060\nthe binding for\nthe actual traffic to the port.\n\n669\n00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.998\nDo we round robin using an address hash,\nan IP address, a MAC address?\n\n670\n00:32:58.998 --> 00:33:00.250\nThere's different options here.\n\n671\n00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.650\nAnd this is what we're choosing.\n\n672\n00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.200\nWe're gonna go with host default rather.\n\n673\n00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.450\nAnd the teaming mode,\nyou'll see here Switch Independent.\n\n674\n00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.410\nAgain, we have some options,\nStatic Teaming or\n\n675\n00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.310\nLACP, Link Aggregation Control Protocol.\n\n676\n00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.171\nWe can pass this out into the physical\nfabric of the switches beyond the virtual\n\n677\n00:33:16.171 --> 00:33:16.943\nenvironment.\n\n678\n00:33:16.943 --> 00:33:19.590\nAnd bind this traffic so\nit understands it.\n\n679\n00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:25.570\nWe can actually have the ability to pass\nthat traffic and move it into like a fiber\n\n680\n00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.780\nfabric solution with fiber switching,\nfor instance, if we choose to do that.\n\n681\n00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.670\nThings of that nature.\n\n682\n00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.780\nSo we're gonna leave it\nat switch independent.\n\n683\n00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.890\nWe’re just gonna accept the defaults here,\nin other words, for\n\n684\n00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.210\npurposes of our demonstration.\n\n685\n00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.320\nBut we're gonna leave those alone.\n\n686\n00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.560\nGonna click Next.\n\n687\n00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.970\nWe are then gonna choose our network site.\n\n688\n00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.159\nOur network site, again,\n\n689\n00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:45.480\npre-programmed in the sense that we\nhave a default one that we can use.\n\n690\n00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.890\nWe have not created any.\n\n691\n00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.890\nWe may do that at some\npoint in the future.\n\n692\n00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.640\nBut for now, we're just gonna\nchoose our VMM logical network.\n\n693\n00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.210\nOur default network is created.\n\n694\n00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.160\nWe know it's our default one cuz it's _0.\n\n695\n00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.110\nRemember 0 is always the first\nitem that we see created.\n\n696\n00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.290\nSo we have our VM logical\nnetwork that was created.\n\n697\n00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.016\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to, before I hit Next,\n\n698\n00:34:05.016 --> 00:34:08.240\njust let me point out,\nEnable Hyper-V Network Virtualization.\n\n699\n00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.754\nNow, we talked about\nnetwork virtualization.\n\n700\n00:34:09.754 --> 00:34:10.547\nJust went through and\n\n701\n00:34:10.547 --> 00:34:13.720\nhad this whole discussion with you before\nwe came in to start to do the demos.\n\n702\n00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.100\nWhat I didn't tell you, cuz I wanted\nto show you here, is that network\n\n703\n00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:22.530\nvirtualization is enabled by default\nin hosts that are 2012 R2 and later.\n\n704\n00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.520\nBut in a 2012 host, you have to check\nthis box off here to enable it.\n\n705\n00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.610\nSo you'd wanna know by version whether or\nnot it's turned on or\n\n706\n00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.480\nyou have to enable it.\n\n707\n00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.758\nAnd if you read here, this setting enables\nthe Hyper-V Network Virtualization filter\n\n708\n00:34:34.758 --> 00:34:37.010\non hosts running server 12 only.\n\n709\n00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.365\nHyper-V Network Virtualization is\nalways enabled on hosts running 12R2.\n\n710\n00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:43.966\nSo you just wanna know that if\nit's 12R2 host, you do not,\n\n711\n00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:45.970\ndo not need to check this off.\n\n712\n00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.540\nBut if it's 12 host, you do because\nthat will not be enabled by default.\n\n713\n00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.410\nSo we're gonna leave it off\ncuz our hosts are all 12R2.\n\n714\n00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:55.070\nClick Next, we have our Finish here.\n\n715\n00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.630\nAgain, our job runs.\n\n716\n00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.090\nRight there,\nwe see the job was successful.\n\n717\n00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.760\nAnd once we've done that,\nwe then would be able to go through here.\n\n718\n00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.880\nAnd if we just click here to alphabetize,\n\n719\n00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.450\njust makes it a little bit\neasier to find things.\n\n720\n00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:15.380\nWe can go down and then we'll see test\nuplink right at the bottom there.\n\n721\n00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.360\nPort profile,\nremember I labeled it test uplink.\n\n722\n00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.250\nSo we could see it down at the bottom,\nwe know what it is.\n\n723\n00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.080\nAnd so we have all of that done.\n\n724\n00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.810\nAnd we now have our port profile as well.\n\n725\n00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.568\nLet's also go in and take a look at\nhow to create IP address pools for\n\n726\n00:35:27.568 --> 00:35:28.911\nthe logical network in the VMM.\n\n727\n00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:30.885\nAnd also we'll take a look\nat MAC address pools.\n\n728\n00:35:30.885 --> 00:35:33.050\nThey're both real quick and\neasy to deal with.\n\n729\n00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:38.720\nSo let's go ahead and let's [COUGH]\ngo back to our logical network.\n\n730\n00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.190\nAnd you could see up here, we have our\nCreate IP Pool, Create, MAC Address Pool,\n\n731\n00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.810\nCreate VIP Template among many\nother things as you can see there.\n\n732\n00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.221\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna go ahead and we're going to either\n\n733\n00:35:49.221 --> 00:35:52.120\nright-click here in Create IP Pool or\ncreate IP pool from here.\n\n734\n00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.157\nIt doesn't matter how we do it,\nit's all the same.\n\n735\n00:35:54.157 --> 00:35:56.670\nGonna create an IP pool right there.\n\n736\n00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.610\nWe got our little wizard.\n\n737\n00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.850\nLet's go ahead and give this a name.\n\n738\n00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:04.852\nWe'll call this,\nif I could type, of course,\n\n739\n00:36:04.852 --> 00:36:08.988\nwe'll call this Test Logical IP Pool.\n\n740\n00:36:08.988 --> 00:36:12.207\nAnd logical network,\nwe already highlighted our network.\n\n741\n00:36:12.207 --> 00:36:14.640\nSo it's the obvious choice there and\nit's gonna be there.\n\n742\n00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.460\nIf we had multiple networks,\nwe'd have a choice.\n\n743\n00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.440\nWe can choose which\nlogical network to use.\n\n744\n00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.050\nWe only have one.\n\n745\n00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.440\nThat's the one we're gonna use.\n\n746\n00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.600\nBut you get the idea here.\n\n747\n00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.119\nI shortcutted that by\nhighlighting the network.\n\n748\n00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:26.255\nSo when I right-clicked and\nchose IP pool off the network selection,\n\n749\n00:36:26.255 --> 00:36:29.510\nit prepopulates that list and\ntells me that's the one I wanna work with.\n\n750\n00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.507\nSo just makes it easier.\n\n751\n00:36:30.507 --> 00:36:31.617\nI don't have to worry about selecting it.\n\n752\n00:36:31.617 --> 00:36:34.009\nI don't have to worry about whether\nI made the right choice or not.\n\n753\n00:36:34.009 --> 00:36:37.210\nAll right,\nare we using an existing network site?\n\n754\n00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:37.930\nYes, we are.\n\n755\n00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.280\nWe can create a brand new site.\n\n756\n00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:39.920\nIt's up to us.\n\n757\n00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.700\nWe’re gonna use our existing network site.\n\n758\n00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.737\nThat's the VM logical network _0,\n\n759\n00:36:43.737 --> 00:36:46.481\nthe first site that was\ncreated as we talked about.\n\n760\n00:36:46.481 --> 00:36:49.379\nWe already have our IP subnet there,\n192.168.0.0/24.\n\n761\n00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:50.618\nWe have our VLAN ID.\n\n762\n00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:52.740\nRemember, we put all that in already.\n\n763\n00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.520\nIt's all bound to the network\nsite that we created.\n\n764\n00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.000\nSo all of that is there.\n\n765\n00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.960\nSo we have that.\n\n766\n00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.410\nThe host groups that can\nuse this network site.\n\n767\n00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.250\nWe have our all hosts that was, remember,\npart of the profile we created already.\n\n768\n00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.120\nSo that's all there.\n\n769\n00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.298\nWe have our IP address range.\n\n770\n00:37:09.298 --> 00:37:12.590\nNotice our range is within\n192.168.0.1 to 254.\n\n771\n00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.090\nNow that's the full block.\n\n772\n00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.148\nAnd we could say, yeah,\nall that for the hosts.\n\n773\n00:37:16.148 --> 00:37:20.710\nOr we can carve out and say, you know\nwhat, I don't wanna run all of that.\n\n774\n00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:25.800\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna reserve VIPs,\nvirtual IPs and reserved IP addresses.\n\n775\n00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.930\nMaybe I'm gonna put in some\nIP addresses down here.\n\n776\n00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.480\nReserved for our load balancer and/or IP\naddresses reserved for other services or\n\n777\n00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.380\nother uses.\n\n778\n00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.980\nI can carve out or cut off from that\noverall block maybe the last 20 IPs.\n\n779\n00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.044\nMaybe instead of 254, I go to 234.\n\n780\n00:37:42.044 --> 00:37:45.840\nAnd I take 20 IPs and\nI reserve them for other stuff.\n\n781\n00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.230\nI can do that if I want to.\n\n782\n00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.253\nAnd it can be the front 20.\n\n783\n00:37:48.253 --> 00:37:49.234\nIt doesn’t have to be the back 20.\n\n784\n00:37:49.234 --> 00:37:50.410\nIt can be anywhere in between.\n\n785\n00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.210\nIt's a matter of us carving out those\nIPs and deciding what we wanna do.\n\n786\n00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.220\nBut notice that we do have\nthe full block there.\n\n787\n00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.081\nAnd we would then be able to reserve\nIP addresses if we chose to.\n\n788\n00:37:59.081 --> 00:38:00.470\nIt's up to us.\n\n789\n00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.520\nWe're gonna leave those there.\n\n790\n00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.860\nWe’re not gonna reserve any.\n\n791\n00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.470\nSpecify the default gateway address.\n\n792\n00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:10.390\nRemember, our default gateway is going to\nbe the address that allows us to be able\n\n793\n00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.560\nto get out of somewhere and\ngo through, typically a router,\n\n794\n00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.160\nwhatever the gateway is to be able to\naccess whatsoever on the other side.\n\n795\n00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.870\nSo we're gonna go here.\n\n796\n00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.950\nWe're gonna enter our\ndefault gateway address.\n\n797\n00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:27.424\n192.168.0.5 is what we're gonna use there.\n\n798\n00:38:27.424 --> 00:38:29.105\nFor metric,\nwe'll leave that set to automatic.\n\n799\n00:38:29.105 --> 00:38:32.555\nWe'll let it manage the metric for us.\n\n800\n00:38:32.555 --> 00:38:35.302\nWe got 0.5, we'll click Next.\n\n801\n00:38:35.302 --> 00:38:37.902\nAre we gonna specify one or\nmore DNS servers?\n\n802\n00:38:37.902 --> 00:38:43.032\nAlso here WINS if we have a need to do\nthat and/or the DNS search suffixes.\n\n803\n00:38:43.032 --> 00:38:44.202\nWe can do that here.\n\n804\n00:38:44.202 --> 00:38:45.762\nThese are considered optional steps.\n\n805\n00:38:45.762 --> 00:38:48.702\nYou may or may not need this,\nmay or may not have to assign them.\n\n806\n00:38:48.702 --> 00:38:51.912\nIf we are gonna be doing assignments for\n\n807\n00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:55.872\nmachines that are in the domain,\nwe probably want to assign the DNS suffix\n\n808\n00:38:55.872 --> 00:39:00.470\nsearch order here through Group Policy\nas opposed in this area right here.\n\n809\n00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.830\nSo that way, we know it's bound and made\nit to all the hosts and all the systems,\n\n810\n00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.060\nall the VMs, etc.\n\n811\n00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.660\nWe know that it's put properly\nthere based on Group Policy.\n\n812\n00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.720\nAnd then we don't have to worry\nabout whether we got it right here.\n\n813\n00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.984\nSo that is just a little gotcha in\nthe real world that may make sense for\n\n814\n00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.706\nyou to think about, may make sense for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n815\n00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:17.970\nYou may or may not do that.\n\n816\n00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.529\nIt's up to you.\n\n817\n00:39:18.529 --> 00:39:22.235\nBut in the real world, if you wanted to do\nthis and they were domain joined, I would\n\n818\n00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:25.910\nsuggest using Group Policy to deploy that\nparticular part and not doing it here.\n\n819\n00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.620\nBut that'll be up to you to decide.\n\n820\n00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.464\nWe're gonna leave DNS and WINS alone.\n\n821\n00:39:29.464 --> 00:39:32.060\nWe're not gonna specify any options here.\n\n822\n00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.300\nBut you could see they are there.\n\n823\n00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.603\nAll right,\nthen we have our summary screen.\n\n824\n00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:39.170\nWe’ll do Finish here, give that a moment.\n\n825\n00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.810\nStatic IP address pool has been created.\n\n826\n00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:45.900\nNow remember, the static IP address\npool right there is gonna be the pool\n\n827\n00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.290\nrange that we're then gonna be\nable to give IP addresses out from\n\n828\n00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.420\nto our VMs as they come on and\nthey start providing resources.\n\n829\n00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.060\nOr at least we can use that for\nthat among other things, I should say.\n\n830\n00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.170\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n831\n00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:58.720\nWe have that capability there.\n\n832\n00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.948\nWe have to bind that or\npair that with a MAC address pool.\n\n833\n00:40:00.948 --> 00:40:03.248\nSo we have to create our\nMAC address pool right now.\n\n834\n00:40:03.248 --> 00:40:05.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that also.\n\n835\n00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.940\nLet me come over here.\n\n836\n00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.189\nLet's do a MAC address pool.\n\n837\n00:40:08.189 --> 00:40:09.137\nLet me just highlight up here.\n\n838\n00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:13.033\nLet me go over here.\n\n839\n00:40:13.033 --> 00:40:20.570\nLogical networks and\nlet's do our MAC address pool.\n\n840\n00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.490\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\ngive this a name.\n\n841\n00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.690\nAnd what's this one going to be?\n\n842\n00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.480\nThis is going to be called our MAC pool so\nwe'll do custom MAC Pool.\n\n843\n00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.550\nAnd we've got our host group there so\nwe'll select all hosts so\n\n844\n00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.280\nthat they can benefit from that.\n\n845\n00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.330\nNow we have to put in our mac addresses,\nright.\n\n846\n00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.210\nInteresting thing about mac addresses\nwhile I'm typing maybe you can help\n\n847\n00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.120\nme out cuz I gotta type these so\nI gotta focus on this for a minute.\n\n848\n00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.300\nExplain to our nice folks the difference\nbetween the first three parts or\n\n849\n00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.030\nthe first bundle in the mac address and\n\n850\n00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.890\nthe second bundle while I'm typing just to\ndistract them so I don't make a mistake.\n\n851\n00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.260\n&gt;&gt; So the first portion if we go ahead and\ncrack our mac address in half is called\n\n852\n00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:06.350\nthe first portion is the first three is\nwhat 48 bytes So that first portion there\n\n853\n00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:11.400\nis going to be your OUI,\nyour organizationally unique identifier.\n\n854\n00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.460\nAnd it's kind of interesting\nwhenever we look, so\n\n855\n00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.690\nlet's say you're using Cisco equipment.\n\n856\n00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:19.320\nThere, you could even do a Google\nsearch I'm sure and find the OUI for\n\n857\n00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.490\nCisco equipment.\n\n858\n00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:26.390\nWell in Microsoft virtual land,\nhere you're gonna have a Pre-populated,\n\n859\n00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:31.300\nso the system is gonna be generating\nthat OUI for you if you don't specify.\n\n860\n00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.410\nSo what Adam is doing right\nnow is he is saying look,\n\n861\n00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.900\nI appreciate the fact that you guys\nwill generate an OUI for me, but\n\n862\n00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.290\nI'm gonna customize it,\nif he want it, he has that ability.\n\n863\n00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.190\nNow, the second portion of that\nMAC address is going to be unique\n\n864\n00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.900\nto the individual node or host.\n\n865\n00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.020\nAnd that should be also unique in\nthe sense that there should not\n\n866\n00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:59.840\nbe two devices within the same environment\nthat has the same MAC address actually in\n\n867\n00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.529\nproduction manufacturing environments.\n\n868\n00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.680\nWe label them sequentially, so\n\n869\n00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.590\nthat we don't have marketers as\nconflicting throughout the world.\n\n870\n00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.140\nSo, you have the option to customize\nthem,if you are sure why you would\n\n871\n00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.150\nwant a customer to customize\nyour MAC addresses?\n\n872\n00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:18.990\nThen l would suggest not to maximize with\nthem, ecause If you get into a pinch and\n\n873\n00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:22.390\nyou need to use some kind of\nnetwork analyzing utility,\n\n874\n00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.660\nyou can simply research that\nfirst portion, that OUI,\n\n875\n00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.680\nto say, okay, I know those are my\nMicrosoft virtual machines.\n\n876\n00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.000\nOr those are my VOIP phones.\n\n877\n00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.290\nIf all of your devices have the same OUI.\n\n878\n00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.550\nAdam I've been talking for\na while, how are you doing?\n\n879\n00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.269\n&gt;&gt; I'm just been kicking back.\n\n880\n00:42:38.269 --> 00:42:40.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like I'm done, I let my hair down,\n\n881\n00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.210\nI'm like I have a sip of water, I run out,\nI made a phone call, this is awesome,\n\n882\n00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.100\nI got to take a break.\n\n883\n00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.890\nNo, we're good actually,\nthank you very much.\n\n884\n00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, let's just take a look here,\n\n885\n00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.350\nif we go to it real quick.\n\n886\n00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.020\nSo I just.\nI and you probably can't really see it.\n\n887\n00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.410\nIt's kind of hard to see the detail.\n\n888\n00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.870\nBut I did type in a range, an ending and\nor a starting rather or an ending Mac\n\n889\n00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.552\naddressed based on the great description\nthat Cherokee just shared with us.\n\n890\n00:43:01.552 --> 00:43:03.382\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Well I said look if you don't\n\n891\n00:43:03.382 --> 00:43:06.665\nhave a real good understanding of why you\nwould want to change your MAC address,\n\n892\n00:43:06.665 --> 00:43:08.590\nthen probably don't mess with it.\n\n893\n00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:13.150\nBut can you think of an instance where\nyou just had an urge to change those MAC\n\n894\n00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.890\naddresses or what would be a use case?\n\n895\n00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.410\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n\n896\n00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:16.970\nA couple.\nSo\n\n897\n00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.430\nlet's talk about what we're\ndoing here specifically and\n\n898\n00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.870\nwhere we may or\nwhy we may want to provide or change them.\n\n899\n00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.650\nSo, what we're doing here is providing a\nMAC address that will come out of the pool\n\n900\n00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:34.240\nas you can see here 1497, almost 1500\nMAC addresses in our range that would be\n\n901\n00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.320\navailable for assignment based on spinning\nup infrastructure and perhaps using them.\n\n902\n00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.690\nIf you look closely I know you can't\ntell but the organization ID or\n\n903\n00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:46.910\nthe first block of the MAC address\nis unique to the vendor is the same.\n\n904\n00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.090\nSo, in other words we're using a block\nthat's assign to a vendor in this case\n\n905\n00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:52.490\nto Microsoft.\n\n906\n00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:57.770\nWe are then going to be able to provide\ndifferent starting and ending points for\n\n907\n00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.980\nthe secondary block or\nthe individual unique instantiated ID for\n\n908\n00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.620\neach interface within the vendor block.\n\n909\n00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.750\nAnd, why may we wanna do this.\n\n910\n00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.920\nWell, there are several reasons.\n\n911\n00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.600\nNumber one, remember that when we\ndo a p to v, a physical to virtual\n\n912\n00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.350\nconversion which is one of the things\nwe may have to grapple with and\n\n913\n00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.840\ndo within our infrastructure or\ncontent with as we go into the cloud.\n\n914\n00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.310\nAnd as we look at our architecture and\n\n915\n00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.950\nsay, you know I have physical structure\nthat I wanna put over to the cloud.\n\n916\n00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.660\nI wanna take that SQL\nserver that's running.\n\n917\n00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.460\nI wanna take that.\n\n918\n00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.750\nDomain controller that web server and\n\n919\n00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:35.090\nI wanna reproduce it without\nrebuilding it from scratch.\n\n920\n00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.340\nAnd I wanna convert it to\nmake it a virtual machine.\n\n921\n00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:42.370\nWhen I do that, I am literally taking and\nI'm gonna use this term with air quotes,\n\n922\n00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.200\na snapshot.\n\n923\n00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.920\nIt is not a snapshot In\nthe traditional sense\n\n924\n00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.500\nthat we talked about snapshots with VMs.\n\n925\n00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.920\nWhen I mean a snapshot,\n\n926\n00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.410\nwhat I'm saying is I'm taking a picture\nof that machine it's current state.\n\n927\n00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:58.320\nAnd I am literally, bit by bit,\ntransferring that into the configuration,\n\n928\n00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.990\nthe memory state, the whole nine\nyards of that machine into a VM and\n\n929\n00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:07.410\na set of associated configuration of\nmanagement files including a flat VMDK\n\n930\n00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:11.170\nfile or a VHDX file or whatever the hard\ndrive will be called depending on vendor.\n\n931\n00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:12.900\nAll that is being reproduced.\n\n932\n00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.525\nThe one thing that is not identically\nreproduced is the network interface.\n\n933\n00:45:17.525 --> 00:45:22.395\nBecause you have a physical adapter, one\nor more of them in your physical machine.\n\n934\n00:45:22.395 --> 00:45:25.985\nIt's made, as you pointed out so\neloquently in your explanation, made by\n\n935\n00:45:25.985 --> 00:45:31.360\na very specific vendor has some C, D-Link,\nCisco, whoever that vendor is, right?\n\n936\n00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.460\nWhen you bought that card even if\nit's an on board built interface in\n\n937\n00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.160\nthe motherboard, it's still manufactured\nby Dell of whoever made the component.\n\n938\n00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.450\nThere they have their own unique\nassociated for their MAC address bulk or\n\n939\n00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.800\nmultiples cuz multiples cuz\nvendors have more than one.\n\n940\n00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.780\nYou don't reproduce that network\ninterface when you do a P to V,\n\n941\n00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.030\nyou get a reset network\nadapter that is virtualized\n\n942\n00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:57.400\nowned by the vendor of the virtualization\nstack, Microsoft, VMware, Citrix, whoever.\n\n943\n00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.210\nThat will have a different MAC address\nthan the MAC address that you had on\n\n944\n00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.200\nthat machine.\n\n945\n00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.630\nSo, we have to provide MAC addresses\nbecause we are giving them out to you as\n\n946\n00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:10.480\nyou create virtual infrastructure based\non the use of virtual network cards.\n\n947\n00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.850\nAnd or if you need to go back and\nbind a secondary MAC address to reproduce\n\n948\n00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:20.380\nthat original one that was part of\nthe physical machine, maybe for licensing.\n\n949\n00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.290\nA lot of times, certain vendors will\nlicense their software to the MAC address\n\n950\n00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:28.560\nof the installed machine as a unique\nidentifier, one way for them to do that.\n\n951\n00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.070\nIf you think about it,\nit makes a lot of sense.\n\n952\n00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of vendors do that.\n\n953\n00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:35.940\nCAD CAM software for engineering, medical\nsoftware, a lot of times the medical\n\n954\n00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.220\nBiopharma fields, etc,\ntends to get licensed that way.\n\n955\n00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.750\n&gt;&gt; Short answer would\nbe not to break things.\n\n956\n00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.300\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\nIt's not so much not to break things,\n\n957\n00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.980\nI mean, ultimately it's about being able\nto reproduce the licensing if necessary\n\n958\n00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.900\nwithout having to rebuy that software\nbecause you may be forced by the vendor\n\n959\n00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.920\nto pay for a new install if you can't\nvalidate that it's running on the original\n\n960\n00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.830\ninstance, and this is one of the reasons\nwe bind MAC addresses to do that.\n\n961\n00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.280\nSo there's lots of reasons.\n\n962\n00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.230\nThat's probably the most prevalent one\nin our industry is that licensing issue.\n\n963\n00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.330\nBut it's also to accommodate the fact that\nwhen you p to v, we're assigning secondary\n\n964\n00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.220\nor indeed primary now MAC\naddresses from a different pool.\n\n965\n00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.040\nAnd that's what we're doing so\nthere you go.\n\n966\n00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.040\nThat's the answer., All right, so\nwe're going to finish up here.\n\n967\n00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.210\nIf you could join me back\nin the wizard please.\n\n968\n00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:19.740\nLet's go ahead.\n\n969\n00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.960\nLet's click Next.\n\n970\n00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.550\nLet's click Finish.\n\n971\n00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.130\nWe're going to get our pool there.\n\n972\n00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:26.825\nYou can see Create it very quickly.\n\n973\n00:47:26.825 --> 00:47:29.015\nOnce we got to it of\ncourse very quickly and\n\n974\n00:47:29.015 --> 00:47:31.745\nwe could see now let's\njust go right down here.\n\n975\n00:47:31.745 --> 00:47:34.095\nYou could see we have our MAC\naddress pool right there.\n\n976\n00:47:34.095 --> 00:47:36.475\nOur custom MAC address pool we have\na couple that are there already.\n\n977\n00:47:36.475 --> 00:47:40.030\nBut now instead of using the default pool,\nwe could use the one that we're using or\n\n978\n00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.610\nthat we've created when\nwe do our assessments so\n\n979\n00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.230\nthat they match specifically,\nagain, in this scenario.\n\n980\n00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:48.640\nMaybe with a vendor that we wanna keep\nall of our network cards associated with,\n\n981\n00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.020\nmaybe during a P2V event.\n\n982\n00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.900\nMaybe we're reassigning those\nMAC addresses out of that\n\n983\n00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.320\ncustom pool that we've created.\n\n984\n00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.860\nThat's most likely the scenario.\n\n985\n00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:56.818\nWe'd be dealing with here.\n\n986\n00:47:56.818 --> 00:47:57.617\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n987\n00:47:57.617 --> 00:48:00.417\nwe've gotta create our VIP template for\nload balancing just one or\n\n988\n00:48:00.417 --> 00:48:01.870\ntwo more things to finish up with.\n\n989\n00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.843\nI told you there's a lot of stuff to\nlook here that we've gotta configure for\n\n990\n00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:05.411\nnetworking.\n\n991\n00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:07.735\nThe VIP, virtual IP templates for\nnetwork load balancing.\n\n992\n00:48:07.735 --> 00:48:11.372\nThis let's us bring in, and\nassign a load balancer.\n\n993\n00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:12.900\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n\n994\n00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:13.930\nLet's just take a look at this.\n\n995\n00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:16.864\nNow, the VIP template,\nyou'll see there's nothing there.\n\n996\n00:48:16.864 --> 00:48:18.362\nWe're gonna go ahead and create one.\n\n997\n00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:19.581\nSo we'll go in here.\n\n998\n00:48:19.581 --> 00:48:22.124\nAnd we're gonna go to VIP template,\nand we'll right-click,\n\n999\n00:48:22.124 --> 00:48:23.450\nwe'll create new VIP template.\n\n1000\n00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:29.173\nCall this the NOB template for\nnetwork load balancing VIP.\n\n1001\n00:48:29.173 --> 00:48:32.020\nYou could call this anything\nyou would like, of course.\n\n1002\n00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.960\nNow, we are gonna choose the load\nbalancer that's already there.\n\n1003\n00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.832\nI think I showed you in\nthe other walk through,\n\n1004\n00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:39.424\nwhen I clicked on it quickly there\nis a Microsoft load balancer,\n\n1005\n00:48:39.424 --> 00:48:43.240\nalready loaded by default, it's already\nthere, that's all what we have by defaut.\n\n1006\n00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.400\nWe could add other vendors.\n\n1007\n00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.292\nWe would have to bring their\nload balancers in, and\n\n1008\n00:48:46.292 --> 00:48:47.397\nprovide their information.\n\n1009\n00:48:47.397 --> 00:48:50.430\nAnd then load them essentially\ninto the console to use.\n\n1010\n00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.270\nBut, this one is there by default.\n\n1011\n00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.647\nIt's our standard software-based load\nbalancer in the Microsoft provides.\n\n1012\n00:48:55.647 --> 00:48:57.710\nSo we are gonna go ahead, and\nwe are going to use this.\n\n1013\n00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:02.072\nWe'll use our virtual port of 443, so\nwe'll put our port in there for that.\n\n1014\n00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:04.670\nWe have to specify,\nin this case, not generic, but\n\n1015\n00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.576\nspecifically we wanna use\na very specific load balancer.\n\n1016\n00:49:07.576 --> 00:49:10.546\nAnd as I said, the Microsoft\ntemplate will be the one we'll use,\n\n1017\n00:49:10.546 --> 00:49:12.960\njust drag this there over so\nyou can see it.\n\n1018\n00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.960\nManufacturer Microsoft.\n\n1019\n00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.247\nAnd, model is the only model available,\nthe network load balancing, the NLB.\n\n1020\n00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:22.500\nThis is a software based NLB service\nthat we provide through Microsoft.\n\n1021\n00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.018\nThat's what we're using here.\n\n1022\n00:49:24.018 --> 00:49:28.090\nAre we gonna load balance only TCP,\nonly UDP or both, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n1023\n00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.150\nsay both protocols, both connection\noriented and connectionless.\n\n1024\n00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.665\nWe'll choose both here.\n\n1025\n00:49:33.325 --> 00:49:35.110\nAre we gonna enable persistence?\n\n1026\n00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:36.870\nNow, persistence is interesting.\n\n1027\n00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.500\nIf we choose to enable persistence, what\nwe're essentially doing is, we are, and\n\n1028\n00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.420\nif you read through,\n\n1029\n00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.714\nlet me just check the box off so I don't\nforget to do it while we're talking.\n\n1030\n00:49:44.714 --> 00:49:49.355\nYou'll see if we enable persistence, load\nbalancer always tries direct the traffic\n\n1031\n00:49:49.355 --> 00:49:53.100\nbetween the client and the virtual\nmachine back to the right source.\n\n1032\n00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.232\nSo in other words,\nwe're gonna connect back and\n\n1033\n00:49:55.232 --> 00:49:58.300\nkeep streaming that traffic back to\nthe right place where it belongs,\n\n1034\n00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.920\nso it goes back the same virtual machine\nthat is behind the load balancer.\n\n1035\n00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.138\nSo, we gonna say persistence type and then\nwill specify here are the source IP which\n\n1036\n00:50:06.138 --> 00:50:09.409\nthe only choice we have based\non the Microsoft implementation.\n\n1037\n00:50:09.409 --> 00:50:13.769\nOther vendors may have other choices here,\nand then subnet mask to apply, right,\n\n1038\n00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:16.368\nwe'll do single as opposed to network.\n\n1039\n00:50:16.368 --> 00:50:19.870\nSo I'm gonna choose that,\nwe're gonna finish up, click Finish here,\n\n1040\n00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:22.140\nwe'll give that just a minute,\ndoesn't take very long.\n\n1041\n00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.800\nThere's our VIP template created.\n\n1042\n00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.194\nSo we now have our VIP\ntemplate that we can leverage.\n\n1043\n00:50:28.194 --> 00:50:31.363\nAnd what we're gonna be able to do is,\nwe'll be able to go in, and\n\n1044\n00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:35.414\nwe're not gonna do this now, because it's\ngonna wrap up our demonstration here.\n\n1045\n00:50:35.414 --> 00:50:38.931\nBut, in future discussions, we'll be\nable to use these building blocks to,\n\n1046\n00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:42.288\nthen, be able, now that we have all\nthe networking components released,\n\n1047\n00:50:42.288 --> 00:50:45.250\nyou'll see representations of\nthem in future demonstrations.\n\n1048\n00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:49.230\nWe'll be able to go in, and we'll be able\nto spin up the rest of our infrastructure.\n\n1049\n00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.720\nWe'll be able to deal with creating\na cloud, because remember,\n\n1050\n00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.660\nall these pieces are parts of the nine\nthings that go into making up a cloud.\n\n1051\n00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.050\nAll the networking components are part\nof that master list we gave you.\n\n1052\n00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.980\nSince we provisioned out and\nsetup all the networking fabric, or\n\n1053\n00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.640\nmost of it anyway, we'll now be able to\nwork with the other areas to, ultimately,\n\n1054\n00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.570\ncreate a complete environment, and\nthen have our private cloud setup.\n\n1055\n00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.234\nAnd that's where we're moving towards,\nultimately.\n\n1056\n00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, we do have a lot to cover\nstill, so ladies and gentlemen stay tuned.\n\n1057\n00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.715\nBut for this show, we are out of time,\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n1058\n00:51:18.715 --> 00:51:20.574\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n1059\n00:51:20.574 --> 00:51:21.735\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n1060\n00:51:21.735 --> 00:51:23.418\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n1061\n00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:30.837\n[MUSIC]\n\n1062\n00:51:30.837 -->

00:00:06.379\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.168\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:11.978\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.186\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying of private cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:17.091\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.171\nSo we've actually made it to a part three,\nand we are going to continue looking in\n\n9\n00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.240\nSCVMM to see how we can configure and\ndeploy private clouds.\n\n10\n00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.010\nBack in studios with us,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.650\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.420\nSo Part Three, magical number,\nbigger than two, smaller then four and\n\n14\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.220\nwhat we're gonna focus on right now.\n\n15\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.850\nSo we're gonna continue our conversations.\n\n16\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.770\nYou notice how I got that\nright in the middle there?\n\n17\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.690\nThat's the extent of the math I\ncan do on the fly, by the way.\n\n18\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.950\nI know where to put three between two and\nfour.\n\n19\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.420\nSo, we're gonna just do a quick review.\n\n20\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.904\nCherokee and I were chatting\nbetween episodes and she said,\n\n21\n00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.998\nwow ,you went through a lot\nof stuff in that demo and\n\n22\n00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:53.110\nit's hard to keep up with\nall the stuff that we did.\n\n23\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.907\nSo, can we go back through real quick and\nmaybe just one or\n\n24\n00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:59.300\ntwo sentence high level definitions\nof all the things we saw.\n\n25\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.160\nGreat rate review just\nthink about what we did.\n\n26\n00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.965\nSo, buckle your seat belts and\nfasten appear we go.\n\n27\n00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:09.134\nHave you seen products by the way is gonna\nmake absolutely zero sense to you cuz you\n\n28\n00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:10.063\nsee we do anyway.\n\n29\n00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:11.988\nYou probably wanna go back,\ntake a look really quick.\n\n30\n00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.808\nWe did a pretty extensive walk through\nin the SUVMM fabric interface under\n\n31\n00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:19.750\nnetworking and created all of the\ncomponents we're about to talk about, or\n\n32\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.830\nalmost all of them anyway, and talk about\nwhat they are and how they interact.\n\n33\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.330\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n34\n00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.640\nWe talked about logical networks.\n\n35\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.040\nRemember, logical networks describe the\nconfiguration of the associated physical\n\n36\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.200\nnetwork, VLANs all that kind of stuff,\nand whether they are isolated or routed.\n\n37\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.080\nThat's what we did.\n\n38\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.180\nWe started off by creating a logical\nnetwork, and we set that up.\n\n39\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.860\nWe then went ahead and\ntook a look at uplink port profiles.\n\n40\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.660\nWe created a hyper V port\nprofile specifically.\n\n41\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.380\nThis is gonna tell us how the behavior of\nthe virtual network adapters are gonna be\n\n42\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.170\nconstructed and/or what\ncapabilities they provide,\n\n43\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.810\nas we use them through the switch.\n\n44\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.428\nWe enable things like single root\nI/O virtualization, IPsec offline,\n\n45\n00:02:00.428 --> 00:02:04.459\nHyper-V Traffic management,\nvirtual machine queues, etc.\n\n46\n00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.760\nThey're applied per\nvirtual network interface.\n\n47\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.060\nSo, we created those, we bind those.\n\n48\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750\nThe reason they say port profile is\nwe bind a single network interface to\n\n49\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.400\na single port on the switch,\njust like in the real world.\n\n50\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.420\nSo, we plug in and that gets applied\nto that individual interface.\n\n51\n00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.620\nWe do that virtually but you get the idea.\n\n52\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.790\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n53\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540\nWe have port classifications,\nthese are gonna allow us down below\n\n54\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.130\nin the environment in networking, down\ntowards the bottom of the fabric here.\n\n55\n00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.270\nI'm just looking at the console\nwhile I'm talking to you.\n\n56\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.160\nThey are right below Port profiles,\nbetween port profiles and\n\n57\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.340\nnetwork services.\n\n58\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.460\nYou'll see them right here,\nport classifications.\n\n59\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.980\nThese allow us to be able to go in and\n\n60\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.975\nto specify that we are gonna configure and\nessentially control and either hide.\n\n61\n00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:53.590\nAnd/or set up the settings and the details\nassociated with configurations for\n\n62\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.020\nthe network adapter port.\n\n63\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.650\nWe hide those from the end user or you see\nthem we just pretty configured them and\n\n64\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.450\nthat's what it's used.\n\n65\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.270\nWhen we connect the virtual machines\nto the network, the tenant will see\n\n66\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.490\na list of port classifications\nthat they can select from but\n\n67\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.830\nthey don't have any visibility\ninto what goes on with them.\n\n68\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.980\nIn other words, they don't really\nknow the settings, the priority,\n\n69\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.690\nthe bandwidth settings,\nthings like that, that are set.\n\n70\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.230\nThey just see the name.\n\n71\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.770\nHigh priority traffic,\nif that's what we called it.\n\n72\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.120\nAnd they choose that but\nthey don't really know what that means.\n\n73\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.880\nThat's right, we're abstracting that and\nhiding it from them.\n\n74\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.620\nAnd then, we actually use those settings\nto control how the VM communicates.\n\n75\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.870\nSo, that's what port classifications are.\n\n76\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.740\nWe didn't do those in our walk through but\njust so you know what they are.\n\n77\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.550\nWe did do IP and Mac address pools.\n\n78\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.430\nWe saw those and configured those.\n\n79\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.550\nThey're sitting there\nin the networking area.\n\n80\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.180\nWe're just are not\nhighlighting them right now.\n\n81\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.690\nBut remember, these allow us to allocate\nstatic IP addresses to the target resource\n\n82\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.450\nfrom the pool and or static mac addresses\nto the target resource from the pool.\n\n83\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.320\nWe talked about the importance of those.\n\n84\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.110\nWe talked about why we\nmay assign mac addresses.\n\n85\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.460\nCherokee walked us through the logic of\nwhat a mac address is and helped us to\n\n86\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.590\nunderstand what the business case may\nbe for signing mac addresses ourselves.\n\n87\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.590\nSo we did that.\n\n88\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.710\nThe logical switch is gonna be where\nwe combine all these elements together.\n\n89\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.670\nIncludes the logical network, the port\nprofiles The port classifications.\n\n90\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.340\nWe didn't create a logical switch,\nbut, you can see here,\n\n91\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.520\nthe logical switch can be created,\nright here, in the interface.\n\n92\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.630\nSo, we can bring in all of those things,\n\n93\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.655\nand, once we deploy the logical switch\ndefinition supplied to our hosts.\n\n94\n00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:25.835\nWe select the physical interface\non the host we want to bind to it.\n\n95\n00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.715\nWe tag them with the corresponding\nuplink port profiles.\n\n96\n00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:30.695\nSo we're binding the physical adaptors and\n\n97\n00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:34.270\nproviding the capabilities that we want\nthem to be able to use through the switch.\n\n98\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.700\nAnd this is then ultimately how we\ndefine our virtual network interfaces,\n\n99\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.830\nif necessary.\n\n100\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.200\nAnd ultimately apply all that stuff and\nthen VMM goes out and\n\n101\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.730\nreconfigures the hosts in the host\ngroup to match that configuration.\n\n102\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.320\nReconfiguring them so\nthat they operate on the virtual network\n\n103\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.980\nthrough the virtual switch that we are\ncreating and defining and binding them to.\n\n104\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.380\nThis is how in other words,\n\n105\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.130\nwe in the real world,\nwould plug a physical host into a switch.\n\n106\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.440\nAnd then through\nthe configuration on the switch.\n\n107\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.540\nThe VLANs, the profiles on the ports\nif it's a managed switch, it it's a,\n\n108\n00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.450\nlet's say a higher level switch in the OSI\nmodel that has the smarts to do this.\n\n109\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.240\nOr if it's essentially a layer two switch,\n\n110\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.080\nan unmanaged switch,\nthan just simple connectivity.\n\n111\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.630\nThis would allow the host to operate on\nthat network and become a member of that\n\n112\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.940\nnetwork and have the benefit of\nthe connectivity the switch provides.\n\n113\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.050\nThat's what we're doing and\nwhat we're doing here is the same thing.\n\n114\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.310\nWe're just doing it in stages because\nthere is no physicality here.\n\n115\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.420\nWe only have a switch, creating\na virtual representation of the switch.\n\n116\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.790\nAnd so we're gonna bind all\nthe components to the switch and\n\n117\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.100\nreconfigure the host as a result\nof that and that's what we do.\n\n118\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.500\nSo we have all that, and then we have our\nVM networks, our virtual machine networks.\n\n119\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.130\nWe require, VMM does, that every VM, or\n\n120\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.330\nexcuse me every virtual network interface\nI should say, is connected to a network,\n\n121\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.260\nif it is connected to a network has\nto be connected to a VM network.\n\n122\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.940\nIn other words, a virtual network adaptor\nhas been connected to a VM network through\n\n123\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.980\na logical switch or logical network in a\nlogical switch that is created in order to\n\n124\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.100\npass virtual traffic from the environment\nthrough the host out the business\n\n125\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.690\nend of the host, the physical adapter out\ninto the physical world and back again.\n\n126\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.680\nWe require that connectivity in order\nto control and monitor how that works.\n\n127\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.430\nThe VM network just represents a logical\nabstraction of the logical network or\n\n128\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.660\na layer of abstraction for the logical\nnetwork that we use to represent\n\n129\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.380\nthe connectivity that we provide.\n\n130\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.710\nSo, we force that or\n\n131\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.990\nrepresent that, it gives us the ability\nto provide different behaviors and\n\n132\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.200\ncontrol elements and specify what kind\nof connectivity we will be receiving.\n\n133\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.070\nWe apply the characteristics\nof the logical network\n\n134\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.670\nbased on how the VM network is layered\ncuz it's layered on top of that.\n\n135\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.260\nSo, it sees it and\nthat's how we actually control the VM and\n\n136\n00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.600\nall the traffic associated with it.\n\n137\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.590\nSo, we go through and we define and\n\n138\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.710\npublish this entire conglomeration of\nall these moving parts and pieces.\n\n139\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.350\nAnd we configure most\nof it you already saw.\n\n140\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.110\nWe configure all in SCVMM.\n\n141\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.520\nAnd we configure the logical networks.\n\n142\n00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.280\nWe used in the fabric area,\nthe management,\n\n143\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.610\nthe cluster live migration settings for\nthe host area or\n\n144\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.560\nthe service area, the networking area, the\nstorage area to provide various resources.\n\n145\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.460\nWe specify the customer\nnetworks code with isolation\n\n146\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.890\nwith software define networking isolation\nwith different options depending on what.\n\n147\n00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.010\nThe customer is looking to achieve.\n\n148\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.980\nWe create our IP pools\nfrom the logical networks.\n\n149\n00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.490\nWe talked about how to do that.\n\n150\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.540\nWe defined port profiles and\nclassifications.\n\n151\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.760\nWe've been through that.\n\n152\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240\nWe created our logical switch.\n\n153\n00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.210\nWe didn't do that, but\nI showed you where we would go and\n\n154\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.630\nhow we would do that right here.\n\n155\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.530\nGive you the general idea behind it,\nwe create our VM networks.\n\n156\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.210\nWe haven't seen that.\n\n157\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.520\nWill be doing that later.\n\n158\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.610\nConfigure the gateway hosts,\nwe haven't done that part yet\n\n159\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.240\ncuz that gets into my bringing in\nthe hosts and creating host groups and\n\n160\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.820\nall the other stuff associated with that.\n\n161\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.880\nWe haven't gone that\nfar down the road yet.\n\n162\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.673\nWe have upcoming episodes and\n\n163\n00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.111\nupcoming shows that will\nhelp us to understand that.\n\n164\n00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:47.369\n&gt;&gt; Something to look forward to.\n\n165\n00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:48.413\n&gt;&gt; Something to look forward to.\n\n166\n00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:50.996\nBut we will configure the gateway host,\ndeploy and\n\n167\n00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:54.254\nconfigure multitenant gateways if\nwe need to be able to do that.\n\n168\n00:07:54.254 --> 00:07:55.693\nIf we have a multitenant environment.\n\n169\n00:07:55.693 --> 00:07:58.410\nWe'd have to deal with the multi-tending\ngateway to support that.\n\n170\n00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.113\nRegister the multi-tending gateway in VMM.\n\n171\n00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.150\nAgain we haven't done that that\nwould be a future conversation.\n\n172\n00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.532\nAnd create VM network using the VM1M\ngateway to assign per tenant so\n\n173\n00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:09.501\nwe can isolate each of those networks.\n\n174\n00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.435\nThat would be the, hey let's scale this to\nthe enterprise part of the conversation.\n\n175\n00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.695\nBut we would be able to do\nall those things and or\n\n176\n00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:19.975\nalmost all of them right from\nwithin the interface where we are.\n\n177\n00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:23.120\nOr within a couple of clicks\ninside that interface in SCVNM.\n\n178\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.590\nWe'd be able to go in and do all that.\n\n179\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.310\nSo we have the capability to be able to\nprovide all of those resources right here.\n\n180\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.590\nAll rather,\nin the environment I should say.\n\n181\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.410\nAll we would have to do would be to\ngo in and load up the various server,\n\n182\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.770\nnetworking, and storage components and\nthen make them available.\n\n183\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.850\nWe did talk about\nthe Generic Routing Encapsulation,\n\n184\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.240\nthe idea of network virtualization before.\n\n185\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.284\nJust want to return to that for a minute,\nremind you of the fact that we use routing\n\n186\n00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:55.647\nencapsulation, specifically when we talk\nabout Hyper-V Network Virtualization.\n\n187\n00:08:55.647 --> 00:09:00.400\nWe talk about the fact that we support\nnetwork virtualization using what's\n\n188\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.092\ncalled Generic Routing Encapsulation,\nor NVGRE, that's the acronym.\n\n189\n00:09:05.092 --> 00:09:08.802\nThat we use and we hear about in Microsoft\ntalks about in their documentation.\n\n190\n00:09:08.802 --> 00:09:10.618\nThis is how we virtualize IP addresses.\n\n191\n00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:13.835\nThis is what\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation does.\n\n192\n00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.650\nLet's us virtualize our IPs.\n\n193\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.380\nThe virtual machine packet,\n\n194\n00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.820\nright the virtual machine's data is\nencapsulated inside of another packet.\n\n195\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.300\nWe talked about this wrapping\nof one inside the other.\n\n196\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.300\nWe talked about the customer address and\nthe provider address.\n\n197\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.390\nIt's another way of referring to this and\nthinking about it.\n\n198\n00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.310\nSo the encapsulation idea is\nwe take one piece of data and\n\n199\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.460\nwe wrap it with another either\ncontainer or wrapper on the outside.\n\n200\n00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.482\nSo we have one thing inside the other,\nand each one of them has a label or\n\n201\n00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:42.095\na unique identity that could be\nused to solve part of the hey,\n\n202\n00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:45.063\nwhere am I coming from,\nwhere am I going to conversation.\n\n203\n00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:48.790\nThat's essentially what routing and\nthe idea of encapsulation does.\n\n204\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:53.870\nThe header of this new NVGRE formatted\npacket has all the appropriate source and\n\n205\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.420\ndestination information.\n\n206\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.460\nSpecifically, this is where we\napply the provider address.\n\n207\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.420\nSo this is the outer label that tells\nus what the provider information is.\n\n208\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.150\nIf we go back to that analogy I used\nin the prior episode, about the big\n\n209\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.800\noffice tower where all the mail comes into\nthe mail room right at the ground floor,\n\n210\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.730\neverything is delivered to one address,\n123 Circle Lane.\n\n211\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.225\nAnd everybody inside the building gets\ntheir mail distributed from that master\n\n212\n00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:22.875\nmail room inside the building after\nit all shows up and UPS or FedEx or\n\n213\n00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:25.525\nwhatever dumps it on the loading dock,\nright?\n\n214\n00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:26.595\nAnd gives it to the mail room.\n\n215\n00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:30.805\nSo, if the master address,\nright, is 123 Circle Lane,\n\n216\n00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:33.185\nthat's the provider address\nbecause that's unique address.\n\n217\n00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:35.130\nIt's given for everybody there.\n\n218\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.150\nThe customer address, the internal\naddress, unique to every virtual machine,\n\n219\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.780\nor tenant, or customer,\nwould then be delivered to you by using\n\n220\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.610\nthe redistribution of the mail from\nthe mailroom inside the building, right?\n\n221\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Those suite numbers or unit numbers.\n\n222\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.360\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, whatever it is.\n\n223\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.240\nAnd that's the customer address.\n\n224\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.720\nThat's on the internal original packet.\n\n225\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.618\nThe NVGRE encapsulates that packet\nwith an outer wrapped that has the PA,\n\n226\n00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:01.516\nthe provider address on it.\n\n227\n00:11:01.516 --> 00:11:05.864\nAnd that's how we're able to then send and\nreceive this data between and\n\n228\n00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:10.209\namong hosts to then deliver to\nan individual VM hosted on that particular\n\n229\n00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:13.078\nhost being managed by\nSCVMM through Hyper-V.\n\n230\n00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:14.193\nThis is where you go wow.\n\n231\n00:11:14.193 --> 00:11:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so how do we manage all that,\nis there a tool for that, Adam?\n\n232\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.375\n&gt;&gt; No, it's all magic.\n\n233\n00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:22.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Close your eyes and imagine, right?\n\n234\n00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:24.420\n[LAUGH] No, of course, we have tools.\n\n235\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.260\nIt's a great question.\n\n236\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.090\nHow do we manage all that?\n\n237\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.720\nHow do we all that?\n\n238\n00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.700\nWell, we've already showed you\nmost of what we do with it.\n\n239\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.250\nWell, actually I should go,\nwe've shown it to you right there, right,\n\n240\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.390\nbecause it's all sitting in SCVMM in\nthe fabric area inside the networking that\n\n241\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.340\nthe component parts and\npieces that we were talking about and or\n\n242\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.550\ncreated are all going\nto play a part in that.\n\n243\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.510\nBut ultimately, all that's being\nhandled through system center virtual\n\n244\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.320\nmachine manager and through\nthe networking fabric that we create,\n\n245\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.150\nthat's exactly where we go and\nexactly what we do, right?\n\n246\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.030\nSo we do have the HNV, the Hyper-V\nNetwork Virtualization gateway server\n\n247\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.303\nservices that do support part of\nthis when we do site to site VPNs.\n\n248\n00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:03.196\nThis is when we get into communicating\nacross virtual private networks and\n\n249\n00:12:03.196 --> 00:12:05.920\ntunnels between sites\nto link hosts together.\n\n250\n00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.840\nWe do that.\n\n251\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.900\nWe could support matting\nacross these interfaces.\n\n252\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.534\nWe could support forwarding\nbetween physical locations.\n\n253\n00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:14.603\nSo we could actually move data back and\nforth.\n\n254\n00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:18.220\nBetween what we would call Geo Clusters.\n\n255\n00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.140\nClusters of hosts that are separated\nby physical distance but\n\n256\n00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.130\nthey are joined logically\nin the same association.\n\n257\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.050\nRemember we said we gotta be in the same\ndomain, gotta be on the same AD site and\n\n258\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.780\nsubnet.\n\n259\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.962\nWe never said anything about being\nin the same physical location.\n\n260\n00:12:31.962 --> 00:12:35.715\nWhen we talked about setting up SCVMM and\nsetting up these host groups and\n\n261\n00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:39.750\neverything else we just said,\nyou have to be in the same logical space.\n\n262\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.140\nCould we have half of our machines\nin one physical location,\n\n263\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.127\nthe other half in another physical\nlocation but be on the same AD site and\n\n264\n00:12:47.127 --> 00:12:49.798\nsame IP subnets and\nsame domain and name space?\n\n265\n00:12:49.798 --> 00:12:51.607\nAbsolutely, it's done all the time.\n\n266\n00:12:51.607 --> 00:12:54.444\nPeople split their host between\ndifferent data centers for\n\n267\n00:12:54.444 --> 00:12:55.869\nvariety of reasons, right.\n\n268\n00:12:55.869 --> 00:12:57.921\nSo we could do that with no trouble.\n\n269\n00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:01.604\nAnd so we do have the capability,\nwe'll extend this out into the broader,\n\n270\n00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:04.714\nphysical world where we have\nadditional tools to manage that.\n\n271\n00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:05.820\nThat would be out beyond,\n\n272\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.080\njust what we've already seen we give\nsome additional capabilities there.\n\n273\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.009\nBut one of the tools I wanted to bring\nin and talk about with you which is why\n\n274\n00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:14.814\nI've been sitting here with console\nwith just opened up to show you.\n\n275\n00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:17.787\nI want to show you something called IPAM,\nIP address management.\n\n276\n00:13:17.787 --> 00:13:21.948\nOne of the capabilities in Windows server,\nand one of the things that we can do to\n\n277\n00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:25.510\ncreate our all up management\ncapability run IP address blocks.\n\n278\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.150\nThe tracking assignment and the center\nreporting and management of them.\n\n279\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.760\nAnd we could integrate this here.\n\n280\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.572\nWe add it as a service.\n\n281\n00:13:31.572 --> 00:13:35.150\nWe could do it from the Add Service area,\nunder Network Services.\n\n282\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.050\nYou could see we have\nNetwork Services here in the fabric.\n\n283\n00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.350\nWe just go over there, right click and\nadd a new network service.\n\n284\n00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.820\nIt's all the same.\n\n285\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.480\nWe go to Network Service,\nwe specify the name here.\n\n286\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.520\nI'm just gonna call it iPam, just so we\ncan do this for purposes of demonstration.\n\n287\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.349\nAnd then we go in here,\nwe specify the manufacturer and\n\n288\n00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:52.696\nmodel of the network service.\n\n289\n00:13:52.696 --> 00:13:57.622\nWe want Microsoft and we want the network\nswitch profile, service gateway,\n\n290\n00:13:57.622 --> 00:13:59.760\nand/or IP address management.\n\n291\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.690\nIn this case, we're going to\ndo IP address management for\n\n292\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.000\nWindows IPAM,\nthe service that is provided.\n\n293\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.580\nSo we're gonna go in,\nwe're going to do this here.\n\n294\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.250\nWe're then gonna go ahead,\ngonna click Next.\n\n295\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.050\nWe have to specify our Run As account.\n\n296\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.040\nEither we have one or\nwe'll have a chance to go in and\n\n297\n00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.800\ncreate one using the Create Run As\naccount right here.\n\n298\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.620\nRemember, Run As accounts are proxy\naccounts that are created, stored.\n\n299\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.100\nWe have the security or settings area down\nthere at the bottom of the console here\n\n300\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.100\nin the work space where we have\nUser accounts and Profiles and\n\n301\n00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.350\nRun As accounts we can create\nto do things on our behalf.\n\n302\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.720\nThey are accounts that\nare assigned certain rights and\n\n303\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.360\nwe can use them to carry\nout certain activities.\n\n304\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.440\nFor purposes of our demonstration,\n\n305\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.340\nwe're just gonna use one\nof the built in accounts.\n\n306\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.903\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe use the system account.\n\n307\n00:14:41.903 --> 00:14:44.000\nYou can obviously create\na run as account here.\n\n308\n00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.560\nIn the real world if you need to.\n\n309\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.130\nWe're then gonna have to\nprovide a connection string.\n\n310\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.447\nThe connection string would be the FQDN,\nor fully qualified domain name for\n\n311\n00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:55.762\nthe IPAM server,\nwhatever server we're connecting to.\n\n312\n00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:59.484\nNow I'm not gonna be able to go any\nfurther here because I'd have to have\n\n313\n00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:03.470\na real IPAM server out there to connect\nto because it checks the string.\n\n314\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.980\nBut you'll see down here it says for\n\n315\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.400\nMicrosoft providers network switch\nusing network switch profile.\n\n316\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.720\nTells you what it is, for\n\n317\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.010\nMicrosoft Server 12 configures\nthe gateway, tells you what it is.\n\n318\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.990\nFor Microsoft IP address management\nfeatures, ipamserver.contoso.com,\n\n319\n00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.380\nmeaning just the fully qualified domain\nname of the machine, whatever it is.\n\n320\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.080\nWe may put a port number in there.\n\n321\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.430\nFreezing a certain port.\n\n322\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.480\nSo something like Adam 01,\nthat ITPro.tv:port 225 would\n\n323\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.290\nbe the string that connects me to\nthat machine at that port number.\n\n324\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.032\nSo we go through there.\n\n325\n00:15:36.032 --> 00:15:38.470\nWe would then go ahead and\nwe would be able to test and\n\n326\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.640\nvalidate the connection\nto the IPAM server.\n\n327\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.740\nThat's why am not doing it.\n\n328\n00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.180\nFor real, I'm just showing it to you.\n\n329\n00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.410\nBecause it actually does check\nthe IPAM server is out there.\n\n330\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.430\nYou don't have one set up.\n\n331\n00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.110\nSo we are not going to be\nable to connect to it, but\n\n332\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.166\nin the real world you would do this and\nit would validate your connection string.\n\n333\n00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.198\nYeah?\n&gt;&gt; So we would have some kind of\n\n334\n00:15:53.198 --> 00:15:54.747\nnotification to know if it was successful?\n\n335\n00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:58.128\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you didn't have a real server\non the other end that didn't answer that,\n\n336\n00:15:58.128 --> 00:15:59.414\nPing when it goes out to check.\n\n337\n00:15:59.414 --> 00:16:01.327\nIt'll come back and fail and\nsay hey, it's not there.\n\n338\n00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.770\nSo you do have to have\na real IPAM server there.\n\n339\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.830\nBut then we would go through, we would\nspecify the host group that can use this,\n\n340\n00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.480\njust like we do in all the other wizards.\n\n341\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.250\nHey, what group of hosts are gonna be\nable to leverage this service, and\n\n342\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.540\nwe'll specify them there.\n\n343\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.300\nWe'll finish up, and that's how we\nactually bring in the IPAM server.\n\n344\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.040\nAnd I put the steps involved with this\nin the show notes for you just so\n\n345\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.080\nyou can walk through and see the logic of\nit, so we actually know how to do that.\n\n346\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.670\nBut we can set that up and bring that in.\n\n347\n00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.320\nAnd then we can use the IPAM\nservice to provide additional IP\n\n348\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.160\naddress management and support here and\nintegrate that directly into SCVMM if\n\n349\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.460\nwe want to which is a nice feature add for\nus in a nice way to leverage that.\n\n350\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.320\nWe could also set up and we'll talk about\nsetting up our logical networks and\n\n351\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.600\nhow they mirror and are gonna look\nlike our physical networks based on\n\n352\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.650\nour ability to provide\nall of these resources.\n\n353\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.820\nWe've been through the logical\nidea here of what we can do.\n\n354\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.940\nTalk about the idea of\nhow VMM manages this.\n\n355\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.910\nWe've seen all the different components,\nwe've talked about the need for the VM\n\n356\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.270\nnetwork that VMM forces us to use to be\nable to connect all of our VMs up to.\n\n357\n00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.530\nNow one thing I did wanna\npoint out to you here.\n\n358\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.850\nWhen we implemented our design in virtual\nmachine manager we have to understand\n\n359\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.410\nthat we should probably think about\ndisabling and configuration setting.\n\n360\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.710\nThe setting is called create\nlogical networks automatically.\n\n361\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.140\nAutomatically what VMM does is, as we're\ngoing through and setting this up.\n\n362\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.900\nIt will find a list of\nlogical networks that exist,\n\n363\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.060\nthat are most likely to be used, and\nthrow them in there and name it for us.\n\n364\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.920\nWe may not want that to happen.\n\n365\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.520\nBecause if it does, this may actually\nbe an issue for us cuz we may get our\n\n366\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.490\nnetworks named incorrectly or be\nchoosing things that we don't wanna use.\n\n367\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.610\nRemember, the goal here is flexibility for\nthe tenant.\n\n368\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.990\nThe goal here is flexibility for\nthe customer.\n\n369\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.560\nAnd the customer may wanna\nbe able to create and\n\n370\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.800\nname their own networks, not have\nthe premade ones that we've provided.\n\n371\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.540\nSo I wanna just talk about\nthis let's go back and\n\n372\n00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.450\ntake a look quickly cuz you\nmay wanna see how to do this.\n\n373\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.560\nWe go in here to Settings.\n\n374\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.350\nThis is gonna be a little\ndifferent area we have go to.\n\n375\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.850\nWe're gonna go to Settings.\n\n376\n00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.420\nWe're gonna go to our\nunder Settings up here.\n\n377\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.940\nGo up, I'm just gonna clean this up so\nwe can see this.\n\n378\n00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.610\nGo up under General right here, right.\n\n379\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.310\nUp under General, you'll see we have\n\n380\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.950\nthe ability to be able to look at database\nconnections, library, remote, etc.\n\n381\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.050\nWe have Network Settings.\n\n382\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.210\nLet's just double-click\non Network Settings here.\n\n383\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.880\nAnd you'll see this check mark or\n\n384\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.370\ncheck box, Create logical networks\nautomatically, for us, right?\n\n385\n00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.900\nWe're gonna uncheck that because that's\ngonna prevent the creation of logical\n\n386\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.260\nnetworks, but\nrather allow us to name them ourselves.\n\n387\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.790\nSo this is a setting we may want to\ngo in and we may want to modify or\n\n388\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.410\nmanipulate because if we do that then\nwe can create our own logical networks,\n\n389\n00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.650\nname them ourselves.\n\n390\n00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.940\nAnd then we have the ability to control\nthat or provide that on behalf of our\n\n391\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.420\nclients, it'll be up to us\nto decide what we wanna do.\n\n392\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.230\nBut this is a setting that will\nprobably be something you may wanna go\n\n393\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.850\nin and modify.\n\n394\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.720\nSo it's good to know where this is.\n\n395\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.290\nIt's good to know that\nyou can change this,\n\n396\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.350\njust move this over so\nyou could see that fully.\n\n397\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.650\nIt is just a checkbox.\n\n398\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.520\nYou just uncheck it or\nrecheck it if you wanna re-enable it.\n\n399\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.840\nIt's no big deal.\n\n400\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.290\nBut, this will allow us to be able to\n\n401\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.070\ncreate our own as opposed to\nhaving them automatically created.\n\n402\n00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.961\n&gt;&gt; Those things that you probably will\nhave to do out in the real world, so\n\n403\n00:19:01.961 --> 00:19:03.047\nthen we have a reference.\n\n404\n00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:06.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good to know,\nalways important to know those things and\n\n405\n00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:06.926\nknow where they are.\n\n406\n00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:09.614\nBecause, again, in the real world\nyou may want to do this and\n\n407\n00:19:09.614 --> 00:19:12.936\nthat tends to be one of those little\nthings that you never know may show up and\n\n408\n00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:16.125\nyou may get asked about somewhere\nelse before the real world intrudes.\n\n409\n00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:20.032\nAnd you may want to know how to do that\njust in case somebody comes along and\n\n410\n00:19:20.032 --> 00:19:23.050\nsays hey for\nfive points how could you do that?\n\n411\n00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.270\nOr whatever question is worth on an exam,\nI don't know what's worth these things.\n\n412\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.832\n&gt;&gt; What about our isolation modes?\n\n413\n00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.561\nAre we gonna talk about that in this show?\n\n414\n00:19:27.561 --> 00:19:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, you kinda twisted my arm and\nsaid that we're gonna talk about them.\n\n415\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.240\nSo I guess we have to.\n\n416\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.390\nSo yeah, we are quickly gonna talk about\nthose just before we wrap up, absolutely.\n\n417\n00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.620\n&gt;&gt; Because that's another customization\nthat we could also include, right?\n\n418\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is something we want to think\nabout or at least be aware of that we want\n\n419\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.640\nto use in relation to our logical\nnetworks, let's put it that way.\n\n420\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.440\nSo it's an option we have to\nthink about how to specify.\n\n421\n00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.350\nSo absolutely correct, so yeah,\nlet's think about about the logic of this,\n\n422\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.520\nright, we're going and\ncreating a logical network.\n\n423\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.190\nNow, creating logical networks typically,\nright, as we said VMM users,\n\n424\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.090\neither tenants, customers, whatever,\nthey're gonna go in and do this,\n\n425\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.650\nright, and they're gonna do it assuming\nthey have the permission to manage\n\n426\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.920\nresources on the fabric.\n\n427\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.510\nThey're gonna go in and\n\n428\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.960\ncreate their networks cuz\nthat's what they're gonna use.\n\n429\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.120\nSo when we go in, right,\nlet's just go back here.\n\n430\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:13.070\nWhen we go in and we're thinking\nabout this idea of creating, right,\n\n431\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.230\nthis logical network, and\nyou saw me do this already.\n\n432\n00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.990\nI'm gonna just click here so\nyou can see this.\n\n433\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.870\nWe went in and we created this, and\nI talked about this when we were there.\n\n434\n00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.410\nBut let's just go back through the wizard\nand point this out real quick and\n\n435\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.740\ndefine in a little more\ndetail what those are,\n\n436\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.030\nbecause we didn't really\nspend a lot of time on it.\n\n437\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.740\nWe only just kind of went through and\nsaid, okay,\n\n438\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.450\nthis is what we're doing, right?\n\n439\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:35.570\nSo we talked about PVLAN,\nVLAN based and/or one connecting network,\n\n440\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.860\nessentially no isolation.\n\n441\n00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.735\nLet's really what these three options\nare so let me just move these over here so\n\n442\n00:20:40.735 --> 00:20:41.566\nwe can see this.\n\n443\n00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:44.521\nAnd I spoke a little about this but\nsince we wanna talk about them,\n\n444\n00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:48.570\nlet's just go through and define a little\nmore precisely what's happening here.\n\n445\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.300\nNo isolation, the idea here is that we're\nnot gonna have a multi-tenant environment.\n\n446\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.670\nWe're essentially gonna have one network.\n\n447\n00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.790\nAnd we don't call it no isolation.\n\n448\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.930\nWe refer to it as no isolation or\ndocumentation, but\n\n449\n00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.680\nyou can see in the wizard we\ndon't call it no isolation.\n\n450\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.370\nWe simply say one connected network.\n\n451\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.800\nBecause one connected network\nmeans one tenant essentially, or\n\n452\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.910\none group of tenants that are all\nagreeing to use common infrastructure,\n\n453\n00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.970\nthere's no reason to\nisolate them in any way.\n\n454\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.160\nEverybody's gonna see whatever's\nthere in the logical network.\n\n455\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.790\nAnd in this network there's no isolation,\nthat's what one network means or\n\n456\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.490\nwhat we would commonly refer to as no\nisolation, right, that's what that is.\n\n457\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.840\nMultiple customers or tenants use\nthe logical network or a single tenant.\n\n458\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.990\nI mean either way but everybody's agreed\nthey're gonna be down by one network.\n\n459\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.240\nWe're not gonna isolate or hide anything.\n\n460\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.660\nThat's what that option means.\n\n461\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.980\nThat's what I did in my walk through where\nI created the logical network we used for\n\n462\n00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.420\nour demo in the last episode, right?\n\n463\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.150\nWe did that.\n\n464\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.450\nThat was our default.\n\n465\n00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.580\nI briefly touched on the VLAN-based or\nprivate VLAN-based.\n\n466\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.850\nI went into the discussion of what\na private VLAN was, a secondary VLAN or\n\n467\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.700\nstacked VLAN, but I didn't really talk\nabout isolation from this perspective.\n\n468\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.496\nSo let's just quickly talk about this.\n\n469\n00:21:52.496 --> 00:21:57.310\nVLAN-based independent network, what's\ncommonly called in our documentation\n\n470\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.590\nVLAN isolation, this allows us to have\na single network created and configured\n\n471\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.190\nsuch that each Vlan is independent\nof every other one if we chose this.\n\n472\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.597\nEach VLAN is then defined as\na non-connected site within the setting of\n\n473\n00:22:08.597 --> 00:22:09.689\nthe logical network.\n\n474\n00:22:09.689 --> 00:22:12.389\nAnd by doing this,\nwe can specify different VLANs, and\n\n475\n00:22:12.389 --> 00:22:15.838\nthen we can isolate each VLAN saying\nthat each VLAN essentially is gonna\n\n476\n00:22:15.838 --> 00:22:17.965\nbe independent of every other one.\n\n477\n00:22:17.965 --> 00:22:20.235\nSo that's what that would do for us.\n\n478\n00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:24.850\n&gt;&gt; Now, Adam, would this suffice\nin regulatory compliance\n\n479\n00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.120\nissues that I may be concerned with as far\nas looking at it from a security aspect.\n\n480\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.730\n&gt;&gt; So good question it would depend\non the level of regulation or\n\n481\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.510\nstatutory compliance\nwe're looking to achieve.\n\n482\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.998\n&gt;&gt; Sure makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; For most regulations,\n\n483\n00:22:37.998 --> 00:22:42.106\nmost statuary compliance regimes where we\nsay hey and by the way we need VLANs to\n\n484\n00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:46.092\nfurther obfuscate and isolate that\ntraffic, verifying at the switch level\n\n485\n00:22:46.092 --> 00:22:50.013\nthey are configured the right way so\nwe can have an audit trail that says yeah\n\n486\n00:22:50.013 --> 00:22:54.150\ncustomers in this VLAN see this traffic\nother customers in theory should not.\n\n487\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.660\nWe randomly sample that.\n\n488\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.030\nThat should suffice.\n\n489\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.740\nWe may choose to use private VLANs for\nessentially secondary VLANs,\n\n490\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.740\nsometimes called nested VLANs as a I\nsuggested, that bottom option right here.\n\n491\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.090\nYour private VLAN or\nwhat's called a PVLAN network.\n\n492\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.780\nWe may choose to do that if there's\nan additional requirement for\n\n493\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.390\nparent child isolation and\n\n494\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:18.480\nfurther isolation within the master VLAN\nto specific types of traffic, community.\n\n495\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.330\nI think I mentioned the three types\nwhen we did in the last session,\n\n496\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.540\nthe last episode.\n\n497\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.530\nWe have the promiscuous, the community,\nand the isolated within there so\n\n498\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.860\nwe have different ways of configuring the\nsecondary VLANs, so it would just depend.\n\n499\n00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.090\nBut network administrators make up\nthe VLANs into further isolated subdivided\n\n500\n00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.320\nVLANs or sub networks within\nthe master VLAN by using private VLANs.\n\n501\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.415\nWe assign them to specific tenants,\nso in multi tenant environments.\n\n502\n00:23:42.415 --> 00:23:45.967\nThis is traditionally how we\ncreate an overarching solution and\n\n503\n00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.885\nthen hang a bunch of tenants of it.\n\n504\n00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:51.111\nEach tenant would then be subdivided\nin their own private VLAN with\n\n505\n00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:51.983\nthe master VLAN.\n\n506\n00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:53.272\nOr a parent VLAN.\n\n507\n00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:58.797\nThe private VLAN or parent VLAN shares\nthe IP sum that with the child so\n\n508\n00:23:58.797 --> 00:24:02.620\nwe can then assign the IP\naddresses as a result.\n\n509\n00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:09.559\nAnd so if we did that Helps when you\n\n510\n00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:13.418\nput a name in there before you actually\ntry to move off the wizard, right?\n\n511\n00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.313\nI love the error, it says,\nhey, you gotta have,\n\n512\n00:24:15.313 --> 00:24:18.690\nit gives you a crazy error almost like it\nsaid, wow, you use wildcard characters?\n\n513\n00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.100\nBut what it's really saying\nis you have no name there.\n\n514\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.180\nWould have just been nice if they said,\nhey, stupid, just put a name in the thing\n\n515\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.840\nthere before we try to assign something,\nbut it doesn't do that.\n\n516\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.690\nSo, anyway.\n\n517\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.850\nBut you see here it looks\nessentially the same.\n\n518\n00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.800\nThe Wizard doesn't change,\nright, when we do this.\n\n519\n00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.190\nIt all essentially it's the same.\n\n520\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.200\nWhat it comes down to is how we're\ngonna assign our associated VLANs and\n\n521\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.840\nsubnets there, right?\n\n522\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.100\nCuz that's really what it is.\n\n523\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.870\nAnd if you notice right here,\nbecause I chose private VLAN,\n\n524\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.160\nin the wizard we did in the last\nwalk through in the prior episode,\n\n525\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.610\nI just had the VLAN and\nthe IP subnet, if you remember.\n\n526\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.030\nI put like VLAN ID 5 and\n192.168.000/24, right?\n\n527\n00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.977\nThat was our information.\n\n528\n00:24:56.977 --> 00:25:00.377\nI didn't have the secondary VLAN\nwhich is the second column here.\n\n529\n00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:03.791\nAnd when I insert,\nI have to put in the primary VLAN ID,\n\n530\n00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:07.250\nand then I have to put\nin a secondary VLAN ID.\n\n531\n00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.320\nAnd then I have to put in my subnet,\nor my IP range with my subnet,\n\n532\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.410\nin order to provide this.\n\n533\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.480\nAnd I keep adding rows and\nI put in multiples.\n\n534\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.540\nThis is how I start programming in my\nmulti-tenant environment by saying,\n\n535\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.150\nokay, this VLAN with these sub-VLAN,\nwith these subnets, and\n\n536\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.150\nI'm gonna be able to assign them as\nI then start spinning tenants up.\n\n537\n00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.040\nSo this is where it changes.\n\n538\n00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.850\nWe pivot on this wizard and\nthis particular screen,\n\n539\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.140\ndepending on the choice we make on\nthe prior one in other words, right?\n\n540\n00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.610\nWe didn't see this in\nthe other walk through,\n\n541\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.300\nbut we're seeing it here just\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n542\n00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.440\nAnd this is then how we then set\nup our different isolation modes,\n\n543\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.810\nas you refer to them as.\n\n544\n00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.580\nAnd remember with PV LANs,\nas I said, promiscuous, isolated,\n\n545\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.900\nand community are my three\ntypes of secondary VLANs.\n\n546\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.010\nPromiscuous, if you're familiar\nwith it as the name implies,\n\n547\n00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.600\nessentially communicate with any\ninterface physical or virtual.\n\n548\n00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.040\nWe see all traffic,\nincluding isolated and community PVLANs,\n\n549\n00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.950\nmeaning essentially we see everything,\ntalk to everything.\n\n550\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.580\nThis would be where you'd stick your\nmonitoring IDS, IPS, devices, right?\n\n551\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.130\nSo you could see all traffic,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n552\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.760\nIsolated PVLANs,\nany virtual machine on an isolated\n\n553\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.230\nis essentially on their own complete\nlayer 2 environment from everything else.\n\n554\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.470\nThey're totally isolated at layer 2\nfrom physical or virtual interfaces.\n\n555\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.720\nThe PVLANs prevent any and\n\n556\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.310\nall traffic to an isolated port\nexcept from the promiscuous VLAN.\n\n557\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.150\nSo in other words, promiscuous sees\neverything, isolated sees nothing but\n\n558\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.120\npromiscuous, if you think of it that way,\nright?\n\n559\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.220\nAnd then community.\n\n560\n00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.530\nAny virtual machine or environment that's\nconnected to a community VLAN communicates\n\n561\n00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.720\nwith VMs that are in their VLAN,\nin their community, their group, right?\n\n562\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.250\nWe're all members of the same community so\nwe see each other.\n\n563\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.870\nObviously, they also can be seen by, well,\nwe have a boundary based on the community,\n\n564\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.915\nbut we can see-\n\n565\n00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:53.780\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n566\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.458\n&gt;&gt; But not internally?\n\n567\n00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:56.466\nBecause we just-\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean by not internally?\n\n568\n00:26:56.466 --> 00:26:56.990\nWhat do you mean?\n\n569\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.070\n&gt;&gt; Just the one community.\n\n570\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.994\nWithout the isolation.\n\n571\n00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:07.171\n&gt;&gt; Well, all right, so remember,\nwe are creating a parent VLAN and\n\n572\n00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:09.790\nthen child VLANs within the parent VLAN.\n\n573\n00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.800\nSo there is a parent container\nof that is essentially\n\n574\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.330\nisolating all of the secondary\nVLANs first of all.\n\n575\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we've just got to be careful about\n\n576\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.850\nwhat we-\n&gt;&gt; The terms.\n\n577\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.540\n&gt;&gt; Choose to use as our terminology.\n\n578\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.250\nCorrect.\n\n579\n00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.150\nBut within the community,\nwe are not isolated inside the community.\n\n580\n00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.250\nBut the community is a boundary.\n\n581\n00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:30.140\nIt does isolate everybody else outside\nthe community from us in the sense that\n\n582\n00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.110\npromiscuous VLANs, promiscuous PVLANs,\n\n583\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.480\ncan see community PVLANs\ncuz they see everything.\n\n584\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.150\nCommunity can see everything inside\ncommunity and see promiscuous.\n\n585\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.560\nBut community community,\nwe're isolated from other communities.\n\n586\n00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.370\nAnd isolated is isolated from\neverything but promiscuous.\n\n587\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n588\n00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n589\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.058\nOkay, more importantly,\n\n590\n00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:50.470\nmake sure you have it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n591\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm concerned about her getting it.\n\n592\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.830\nI'm not so\nconcerned about you getting it, right?\n\n593\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.503\nAll right, so just make sure you\nunderstand the logic of that, right?\n\n594\n00:27:56.503 --> 00:27:57.510\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n595\n00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.360\nAnd with the idea of creating\nthese private secondary VLANs, or\n\n596\n00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.010\nPVLANs, as an isolation mode, we can\nfurther subdivide and manage our traffic,\n\n597\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.500\nas you can see,\nas we created our logical networks.\n\n598\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.810\nThis is all about how we divide up\nthe traffic we assign to that network, and\n\n599\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.760\nwhat that network traffic path looks like\nbased on the different isolation modes.\n\n600\n00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.520\nWe've demoed no isolation for\nyou, demoed PVLAN for you.\n\n601\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.880\nCuz we did show you both types.\n\n602\n00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.550\nWhen we do VLAN, it looks the same\nas you can see here, right?\n\n603\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.060\nThis is what I demoed also.\n\n604\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.710\nYou can see I just reset the wizard\nreally quickly and just chose VLAN.\n\n605\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.280\nYou see we removed that middle\ncolumn where it says secondary VLAN.\n\n606\n00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.330\nAgain, our pivot point for\nthe wizard is right here, right?\n\n607\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.370\nThis is essentially what we're doing,\nright?\n\n608\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.160\nSo that's what you can see there.\n\n609\n00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.580\nAnd that's how we set up\nour three isolation modes.\n\n610\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a good deal.\n\n611\n00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.810\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n612\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:48.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go.\n\n613\n00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.907\nDisembodied high-five.\n\n614\n00:28:49.907 --> 00:28:51.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n615\n00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.670\nI think that's probably enough of\na discussion for this particular topic.\n\n616\n00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.135\nToo much of this stuff and your brain\nstarts to hurt, and we've still got,\n\n617\n00:28:58.135 --> 00:29:00.015\nas you pointed out, a little ways to go.\n\n618\n00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:02.738\nWe've got to talk a little bit\nabout software defined networking,\n\n619\n00:29:02.738 --> 00:29:04.708\nsomething that will come\nup in another episode.\n\n620\n00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:09.108\nTalk a bit about how to set that up, and\nsome other odds and ends, along with,\n\n621\n00:29:09.108 --> 00:29:13.470\nbelieve it or not, a quick reminder of\nhow we can do our install and upgrade.\n\n622\n00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.740\nWe've already covered that, but just a\nreminder about upgrades and some things to\n\n623\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.840\ntalk about there real quick before we\nwrap up this particular section as well.\n\n624\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.340\nBut that'll be in an upcoming episode.\n\n625\n00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, so go grab a snack, stretch\nyour legs, do whatever you have to do\n\n626\n00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.840\nbecause, like Adam said,\nwe do have more information to cover.\n\n627\n00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.590\nSo go ahead and get ready for that.\n\n628\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.560\nBut for this show, we are out of time so\nWe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n629\n00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.400\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n630\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:33.966\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n631\n00:29:33.966 --> 00:29:40.617\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.081\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying Private Cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.152\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:21.217\nIn this episode, we'll continue looking at\nsystems in our virtual machine manager,\n\n7\n00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.170\nwe're actually in part four,\nso woohoo, we made it.\n\n8\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.480\nWith us, back in studios today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.068\nThank you for joining us Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:29.762\n&gt;&gt; Whose hand was that?\n\n11\n00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.020\n&gt;&gt; I don't know those, so strange.\n\n12\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.612\n&gt;&gt; That was weird.\nWhere did that come from?\n\n13\n00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:34.380\nThat was so odd,\nthat was just floating in space.\n\n14\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.460\nI am good, hopefully you're good as well.\n\n15\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.310\nAnd as Cherokee said,\nwe're here for a part four,\n\n16\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.110\nwhich means we've talked about three\nparts of really critical important stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.980\nReminds you of that.\n\n18\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.110\nAlways good to go back,\ntake a look at what we've done.\n\n19\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.070\nBefore you join us to continue,\nwe're actually gonna be wrapping up our\n\n20\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.170\nconversations in this particular\narea in this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.030\nAlmost call it in odds and ends episode.\n\n22\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.300\nJust have a few things we wanna go back,\ncover, review with you end or\n\n23\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.550\nbring back in to the conversation.\n\n24\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270\nA little bit of a discussion on\nsoftware defined networking,\n\n25\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.990\na little bit of a discussion on user\nrules, take a quick look at them before,\n\n26\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.950\nwe'll go back into the console,\ntake a look at where they are,\n\n27\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.702\nsee our options there for creating user\nroles, show you the wizard to do that.\n\n28\n00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:15.140\nWe're also take a look at how\nto deal with host groups.\n\n29\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.416\nWe've hinted at those,\n\n30\n00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:19.949\ndemoed the idea behind them when we\ndid our discussion on the fabric.\n\n31\n00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:23.321\nWe're gonna go and actually take a look,\nand we're gonna create a host group and\n\n32\n00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:24.460\ndo some work with that, and\n\n33\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.250\nultimately see how that comes\ntogether around the private cloud.\n\n34\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.550\nSo, we're gonna be going through\nall that as we get started.\n\n35\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.800\nLet's just talk about software\ndefined networking for a minute.\n\n36\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.710\nWe talked about the idea of network\nvirtualization gone in depth into it with\n\n37\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.080\nyou in prior episodes, explained the ideas\nbehind hyper V network virtualization.\n\n38\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.510\nNetwork virtualization generic routing\nencapsulation and VGRE technology,\n\n39\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.280\nthat's important for you to understand.\n\n40\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.690\nWe've been through the idea of\nthe customer address, provider address.\n\n41\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.290\nHow the discussion of that all that,\nhow that works.\n\n42\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.060\nWell, we haven't really discuss formally,\nalthough we talk through the logic of it,\n\n43\n00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.190\nis what software defined\nnetworking in this case or\n\n44\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.830\nany kind of software\ndefinition actually mean.\n\n45\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.080\nSo when we talk about software defining\nsomething, the way I like to think of it.\n\n46\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620\nAnd I'm gonna ask Cherokee to chime\nin here in a minute and tell me if,\n\n47\n00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.700\nas she always does, if this is the kind\nof thing that makes sense to her,\n\n48\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.150\nif it resonates, or if maybe we could\nrefine that explanation a little bit.\n\n49\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.440\nAnd make it a little simpler\ndepending on whether or\n\n50\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.018\nnot I put on my complicated pants\nthis morning or my easy pants.\n\n51\n00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:26.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will see how that goes.\n\n52\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.760\nSo when I think of software\ndefined networking,\n\n53\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.800\nI often talk about it with customers and\nstudents.\n\n54\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.070\nAnd I explain it as the idea of\nremoving the human from the mix.\n\n55\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.660\nWhat I mean by that is, we wanna\nsimplify the idea of deployment and\n\n56\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.560\nmanagement of resources by automating,\nwhen and where possible, that deployment,\n\n57\n00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.730\nthat management, that monitoring,\nyou could throw a bunch of stuff into that\n\n58\n00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.315\nbucket or that basket,\nbecause Cherokee likes baskets.\n\n59\n00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:56.096\nAnd when we think about that, what we're\nthinking about is how do we use automation\n\n60\n00:02:56.096 --> 00:03:00.671\ntechnology to be able to configure, and\nset up a template more often than not for\n\n61\n00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.160\nthat configuration once, get it right,\nvet it, insure it's proper.\n\n62\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.560\nAnd then through automation technology,\n\n63\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.940\nuse that to drive our\nongoing use of that resource.\n\n64\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.200\nSo that way we don't have to worry about\ndoing repetitive tasks as individuals\n\n65\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.250\nthat may, just because of our\nability to focus, or lack there of,\n\n66\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.820\nwind up not being consistent and\nstandardized every time we do them.\n\n67\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.540\nBut rather standardize and\ncreate consistency around that task\n\n68\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.840\nthrough the use of this thought\nprocess of software defining.\n\n69\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.510\nAbstracting the layers of management,\n\n70\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.390\nof administration, of interaction,\nand really just using a- and\n\n71\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.020\nwe could almost think of this as the old\ntraditional style of an unattend.txt or,\n\n72\n00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.750\nthese days, unattend.html file to drive\nan automated deployment of OS, for\n\n73\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.510\ninstance, or you calmly called this\nanswer files by the way, right.\n\n74\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.550\nSo, an answer file of some kind, and using\nthat to simply automate that deployment\n\n75\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.510\nof an operating system time and again, by\nanswering those questions in the wizard.\n\n76\n00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.860\nAnd having those answers available\nhard code and standardized.\n\n77\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.560\nNo room for error, no room for thought\nprocess or deviation that may change it.\n\n78\n00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.310\nThat doesn't mean we can't go and\nchange it.\n\n79\n00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.370\nIt just means unless we\nchoose too consciously,\n\n80\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.290\nit's gonna come out the same every time.\n\n81\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.480\nSo, when we think about software defining,\n\n82\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.690\nwe're thinking about trying to reach\nthat level of standardization,\n\n83\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.630\nrepetition through automation\nthat ensures consistency.\n\n84\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.550\nThat's what at least I think of software\ndefining something as, we can do that\n\n85\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.650\nat the network layer which we're you\nknow kind of reminding you up here.\n\n86\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.420\nWe can define through software up and\ndown the stack.\n\n87\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.097\nThe entire data center, these days can\nbe defined through software definition,\n\n88\n00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:42.704\nnetworking, storage, any of the component\nparts of virtualization in Cloud,\n\n89\n00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:46.770\nincluding the entire overarching\nthought process has a role to play and\n\n90\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.256\ncan indeed be managed through\nsoftware definitions today.\n\n91\n00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.190\nHow did I do?\n\n92\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.230\n&gt;&gt; I think that you did a really\ngreat job explaining it.\n\n93\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.450\nThe first sentence that\nyou said when you said.\n\n94\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Moving the human, right?\n\n95\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.270\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly the first\nsentence that I would have said, but\n\n96\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.490\nI normally instead of the word human,\nI normally think of the word intelligence.\n\n97\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.540\nBecause we're just taking\nthat intelligence.\n\n98\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.870\nAnd then I also think about being\nat a really fancy restaurant and\n\n99\n00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.870\nyou might have ordered a meal where\nthey have those deconstructed dishes.\n\n100\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.400\nAnd that's kind of how\nI think about it also.\n\n101\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.340\nSo you're taking all these components and\ndeconstructing them and\n\n102\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.600\nmoving them to where it makes sense for\nyour organization.\n\n103\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that.\n\n104\n00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.638\nIt's actually kind of a neat way to think\nabout it, I hadn't thought about the whole\n\n105\n00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:27.745\nfood analogy before but that's-\n&gt;&gt; I like to eat Adam.\n\n106\n00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:28.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda, That's good.\n\n107\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.610\nThat's what we do.\n\n108\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.330\nWe like to do that.\n\n109\n00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.220\nThat's important.\n\n110\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.660\nActually I liked that analogy a lot.\n\n111\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.570\nI think that makes a lot of sense also.\n\n112\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.300\nSo, good.\n\n113\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.440\nAll right.\nHopefully it made sense for you as well.\n\n114\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.340\nRemember, the idea behind software\ndefining as we're talking\n\n115\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.000\nthrough the logic of this.\n\n116\n00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.310\nLet's just bring in this back\ninto our conversations here.\n\n117\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.920\nIs the idea that we wanna be able to\nnarrow the physical network design\n\n118\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.750\ninto the virtual environment\nthrough the logical network.\n\n119\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.910\nThrough the logical switch,\nthe port profiles,\n\n120\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.110\nall the things we went through\nwith you in the fabric.\n\n121\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.370\nIf you remember we've talked through those\nin prior episodes, done a lot of show and\n\n122\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.050\ntell, hands on demonstrations,\nwalking you through.\n\n123\n00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.552\nHow to create the majority of those\nelements and linking them together.\n\n124\n00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:10.860\nWe're gonna bring some more of those\nthings back in here in a few minutes as we\n\n125\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.690\ntalk about host groups and just walk\nthrough the logic of how they're used.\n\n126\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.538\nBut we wanna be able to take\nthat physical network design,\n\n127\n00:06:18.538 --> 00:06:23.656\nthe physical stage or the physical\narea IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n128\n00:06:23.656 --> 00:06:28.653\nThe tenants in multi-tenant environments\nor single-tenant environments have,\n\n129\n00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:32.097\nwe wanna bring those in,\nuse them and interact with them so\n\n130\n00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:36.529\nthat we can create consistency from\nthe inside of the virtual interface and\n\n131\n00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.600\nenvironment out into our fabric.\n\n132\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.910\nWe defined the concept of fabric and\n\n133\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.440\nthen through the fabric\nout into the beyond world.\n\n134\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.080\nRight, the world that we don't control\ndirectly, but it is out in the wan and\n\n135\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.830\nthen whatever we're doing there and back.\n\n136\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.970\nWe wanna try to be able to as much\nas possible have a consistent view\n\n137\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.170\nof the network, because if we can do that\nand we can mirror those configurations on\n\n138\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.680\nthat thought process into the virtual\nenvironment to a certain extent, not 100%.\n\n139\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.350\nBut for most cases we can do that.\n\n140\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.550\nRemember we talked for\ninstance about creating the IP pools and\n\n141\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.720\nthe MAC address pools and the fact that we\nmay wanna create custom MAC addresses is.\n\n142\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.740\nWe talked about and Cherokee helped us\nto understand what the business rules or\n\n143\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.520\nthe logic would be there and\nwhy would we wanna do that.\n\n144\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.590\nMaybe because we have to rename, or\n\n145\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.392\nrecreate those MAC addresses from original\nones due to fidevia physical to virtual\n\n146\n00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:30.250\nconversion that we have to reproduce them\nis because of licensing considerations.\n\n147\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.960\nSince I explained when here she\nasked the obvious question.\n\n148\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.210\nHey, great idea but\nwhy on earth would we do this.\n\n149\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.148\nWhat's the value, what's\nthe proposition here that makes sense.\n\n150\n00:07:38.148 --> 00:07:41.216\nSo there are reasons why\nwe do these things, but\n\n151\n00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:46.665\nbeing able to software define allows us\nas the administrators, the tenant admins,\n\n152\n00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:52.113\nthe CSVMM admins, the private cloud admins\nto be able to control those variables and\n\n153\n00:07:52.113 --> 00:07:54.744\ndecide how they're gonna be deployed.\n\n154\n00:07:54.744 --> 00:07:58.673\nIn a way that standardizes and\nlogically helps us to ensure consistency.\n\n155\n00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:00.030\nAnd this is the most important thing.\n\n156\n00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.600\nWe want to think about and\njust be aware that we have to be\n\n157\n00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.356\nthinking through the logic and the thought\nprocess of this as we go through.\n\n158\n00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:10.420\nWe've walked you through,\nin our prior discussions,\n\n159\n00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.670\nas I mentioned, the interface in SCVMM,\nin the fabric space, as we create this.\n\n160\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.640\nIf we could go in here for just a second,\nwe'll just take a look real quick\n\n161\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.240\nat the machine just to remind\nyou what we were talking about.\n\n162\n00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.990\nWe have the fabric workspace here,\nwe're going to jump in and\n\n163\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.170\ndeal with the server area and\nthe host groups.\n\n164\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.140\nIn just a moment,\nwe'll be going through there.\n\n165\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.950\nWe're also gonna go take a look at\nsettings that deal with user roles.\n\n166\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.320\nWe'll talk about those two areas.\n\n167\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.080\nBut just to remind you, if I start the\nfabric workspace starts looking like this,\n\n168\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.490\nwhich is how it looks when\nyou open it up initially.\n\n169\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.390\nWe have three distinct categorical areas.\n\n170\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.860\nWe've identified them for you.\n\n171\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.455\nServers, where we find our hosts.\n\n172\n00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:47.707\nWe find all the different\nroles it may bring in.\n\n173\n00:08:47.707 --> 00:08:50.629\nThe PXE server, the WCSS server for\ndeployments of host and\n\n174\n00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:54.436\nmanagement of patching, and things in\nthat nature, all that will be there.\n\n175\n00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:58.218\nWe have networking, the place we'll\nbe focusing on and talking about,\n\n176\n00:08:58.218 --> 00:09:02.249\nwhere our logical networks, our port\nprofiles, our port configurations,\n\n177\n00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:05.859\nour IP pools, our MAC address pools,\nall that's gonna be created.\n\n178\n00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:07.324\nOur network services,\n\n179\n00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:12.085\nwe showed you how to integrate IPAM as\na Windows services into SCVMM by walking\n\n180\n00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:16.870\nthrough the configuration of the IPAM\nwizard to bring in an IPAM gateway.\n\n181\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.210\nSo we've talked about a lot of the areas\nand focal points in networking and\n\n182\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.350\nstorage, which is where clearly our\nstorage related resources will be.\n\n183\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.530\nWe haven't spent much time there yet,\n\n184\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.400\nwe'll have some things to\nsay about that as we go.\n\n185\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.260\nAnd we'll take a little bit of a peek\nunder the hood there as we talk about\n\n186\n00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.920\nhost groups.\n\n187\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.950\nWe'll do a little bit more\nin some other areas, but\n\n188\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.390\nthat's where we integrate our storage,\nright?\n\n189\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.027\nWe're gonna be bringing in\nour storage pools and our,\n\n190\n00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:40.983\nprobably more often than not, our\nnetwork-based storage resources, our SAN,\n\n191\n00:09:40.983 --> 00:09:43.120\nour NAS devices, and\nbe able to mount them.\n\n192\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.290\nAnd so we've been through and talked\nabout the idea of using the fiber channel\n\n193\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.920\nfabric if we're gonna be doing that, our\nfile servers, our providers, our arrays.\n\n194\n00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.440\nIn networking, we've been through,\nand as I mentioned,\n\n195\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.800\ntalked about our load balancers, our MAC\naddress pools, our port classifications.\n\n196\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.280\nWe talked about network service, we talked\nabout the gateways that may exist there.\n\n197\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.108\nI showed you how to integrate one\nof them with the IPAM solution.\n\n198\n00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:09.483\nWe talked about servers, as I mentioned.\n\n199\n00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:10.797\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about it quite a bit,\nhaven't we?\n\n200\n00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:12.409\n&gt;&gt; We have talked about it quite a bit.\n\n201\n00:10:12.409 --> 00:10:15.334\nAnd as I mentioned up in the server area,\n\n202\n00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:19.350\nwe have two things that we\nreally want to focus on here.\n\n203\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.620\nThink about we have the ability to be able\nto go in, look at our infrastructure area,\n\n204\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.670\nalthough we haven't spent much time there,\nyet.\n\n205\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.249\nWe've hinted at what's there, we've talked\nabout some of the roles that are there.\n\n206\n00:10:28.249 --> 00:10:32.496\nIn terms of the PXE Server,\nthe update server bringing in vCenter,\n\n207\n00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:36.087\nbeing able to manage the VMM server or\nserver instances.\n\n208\n00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:39.996\nAnd we're creating a highly available\nstructure, our library servers,\n\n209\n00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:43.283\nthe representation of them are here,\nin terms of the machine or\n\n210\n00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:45.096\nmachines that fulfill that role.\n\n211\n00:10:45.096 --> 00:10:48.957\nBeing able to go in, and being able to\nadd library servers, as we talked about,\n\n212\n00:10:48.957 --> 00:10:51.800\nif we wanna scale out and\ncreate high availability.\n\n213\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.861\nAll that's done here.\n\n214\n00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.100\nAnd this is where we interact.\n\n215\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.980\nSo the fabric as I suggested to you,\none of our prior conversations,\n\n216\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.340\nis really the central part of\nthe management console, the SVCMM.\n\n217\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.170\nIt's where we actively take on and\nfigure out how to provide for and\n\n218\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.500\nconfigure the resources necessary\nto build out private clouds and\n\n219\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.060\nprovide them to tenants.\n\n220\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.490\nAnd then make them available so\nthat they can be consumed.\n\n221\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.200\nThe supporting cast of characters and\n\n222\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.810\nthe elements that help us to do that\nare found in the Library works space.\n\n223\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.540\nWe've spent a little time in there looking\nat the library, the file share that's\n\n224\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.150\ncreated on the library server,\nthe resources that are put there.\n\n225\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.785\nRemember, ISOs, our VM templates, things\nof that nature that are used to deploy, or\n\n226\n00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:38.287\nwill be used to build deployments\nwill typically be found there.\n\n227\n00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:40.631\nWe've talked about VMs and services.\n\n228\n00:11:40.631 --> 00:11:43.408\nThis is where we can\ncreate our private cloud.\n\n229\n00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:46.262\nWe'll be taking a look at how to do that,\nfrom all our building blocks.\n\n230\n00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:49.143\nIt's where we see our storage,\nwhere we see our networks,\n\n231\n00:11:49.143 --> 00:11:51.861\nproduced from the fabric area,\njust reproduced here.\n\n232\n00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:53.603\nSo they could be managed\nin a different way.\n\n233\n00:11:53.603 --> 00:11:56.704\nWe see our tenants,\nwe've defined the concept of the tenant.\n\n234\n00:11:56.704 --> 00:12:00.585\nAnd remember the multi-tenant environment\nthis is where we see those tenants listed,\n\n235\n00:12:00.585 --> 00:12:03.166\nand we'll see the cloud or\nclouds that are linked to that.\n\n236\n00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:05.203\nAnd when we talk about the jobs area,\n\n237\n00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:09.946\nthis is just simply a historical record of\nwhat's gone on, terms of configuration.\n\n238\n00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:12.396\nYou could almost think of it as\na log that we're looking at,\n\n239\n00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:15.251\nit's just a slightly different way\nof looking at that information.\n\n240\n00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:19.534\nBut it's a running historical record of\nall the activities we've engaged in and/or\n\n241\n00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:23.415\nare engaging in currently, cuz remember,\nactive jobs show up in that list.\n\n242\n00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:26.849\nYou've seen that several times, as we\nhave done the walk-throughs in areas.\n\n243\n00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:28.560\nAnd then once we're done,\nwe close the window.\n\n244\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.781\nAnd they're just archived there\nhistorically for a period of time,\n\n245\n00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:34.332\ncan always go back, take a look,\nsee what did happen,\n\n246\n00:12:34.332 --> 00:12:38.184\ndouble check our configurations and\nensure we know what is going on there.\n\n247\n00:12:38.184 --> 00:12:41.871\nAnd then in the Settings area, we talked\na bit about the fact that these are all\n\n248\n00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:45.929\nthe levers we pull to configure behind the\nscenes things that may be important to us.\n\n249\n00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:49.044\nSo we have the ability to be able to go\nand to look at system center settings.\n\n250\n00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:51.651\nIt's where we see\nthe integration with SCOM.\n\n251\n00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:54.853\nWe'll be looking more at that and\ntalking about that in upcoming episodes.\n\n252\n00:12:54.853 --> 00:12:58.539\nWe could see the Servicing Windows,\nthese I've talked about with you,\n\n253\n00:12:58.539 --> 00:13:01.632\nare what commonly refer to as\nmaintenance windows and SLAs.\n\n254\n00:13:01.632 --> 00:13:03.810\nIt's just what Microsoft calls them.\n\n255\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.930\nWe have our runouts accounts.\n\n256\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.880\nWe've talked about the importance of\nrunouts accounts and the user roles.\n\n257\n00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.605\nWe're gonna jump in,\n\n258\n00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:11.920\ntake a look at the user roles\nin just a minute under security.\n\n259\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.307\nAnd we have under General,\nas we took a look at,\n\n260\n00:13:14.307 --> 00:13:17.310\nthe ability to be able to go in and\nmodify certain settings.\n\n261\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.690\nWe spoke to you about\nthe network settings area, and\n\n262\n00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.550\nremoving the check box from the auto\ncreation item that's there, right.\n\n263\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.390\nTo be able to create or\nto decide how you're gonna deal with\n\n264\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.930\nthe idea of creating logical\nnetworks automatically.\n\n265\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.893\nWe showed you this in one of\nthe prior discussions and\n\n266\n00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.130\nexplained why that may be important for\nyou to think about.\n\n267\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.627\nSo we've gone in and we've talked\nabout a lot of the things in here.\n\n268\n00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:38.645\nHaven't looked at database connections.\n\n269\n00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:42.490\nBut if you need to go in and see what's\ngoing on with your database, where it is,\n\n270\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.500\nhow you connect to it,\nyou could see it right here.\n\n271\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.340\nIf you remember, when we did\nthe walk-through on the hands on\n\n272\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.420\ninstall of SCVMM, how we stand it up,\nwe talked about configuring the database.\n\n273\n00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.990\nWe went out,\nwe found it based on the IP address,\n\n274\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.600\nspecified the standard port\nnumber of 1433 for SQL, and\n\n275\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.750\nspecified the database name,\nin this case, VirtualManagerDB.\n\n276\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.660\nSo we're just double-checking those\nsettings here, but we can see all of them,\n\n277\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.850\nand interact with them.\n\n278\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.274\nSo it's important for\nyou to get into the console, poke around,\n\n279\n00:14:09.274 --> 00:14:12.511\nspend some time navigating there and\nlearn where things are,\n\n280\n00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:16.822\nbecause you're obviously gonna have to\nuse these areas to be able to administer.\n\n281\n00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:20.757\nBut the bulk of your time will be\nspent in fabric and in the VMs and\n\n282\n00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:24.703\nservers area once you get\neverything stood up and configured.\n\n283\n00:14:24.703 --> 00:14:28.307\nBecause that's where the majority of\nthe time is spent to configure and\n\n284\n00:14:28.307 --> 00:14:31.802\nto manage infrastructure that you\nwant to provide and make available\n\n285\n00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.608\n&gt;&gt; So Adam, in this chapter so far,\n\n286\n00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:37.736\nnot only have you had several\ndemonstrations, but you've also provided,\n\n287\n00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:40.962\nin the show notes,\nadditional step by step information for\n\n288\n00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:44.399\ntutorials that people might wanna\ntake a look at for homework?\n\n289\n00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.594\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n290\n00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:46.441\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good?\n\n291\n00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:47.278\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n292\n00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:49.867\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That is true,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n293\n00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:51.130\nIt's true.\n\n294\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.099\n&gt;&gt; It is, l just don't prefer to call\nit homework, just because, well,\n\n295\n00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:55.690\nyou won't do it if it's homework.\n\n296\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.761\nBut l do think, and to Cherokee's point,\nreally try to go out of our way to provide\n\n297\n00:14:59.761 --> 00:15:01.870\nsome in-depth step by step guidance for\nyou.\n\n298\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.520\nAnd a variety of topical\nactivities you may or\n\n299\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.000\nmay not engage in depending\non what you're doing.\n\n300\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.566\nA, because it's important\nto know how to do them.\n\n301\n00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:12.538\nB, because we can't demonstrate\nevery opportunity to\n\n302\n00:15:12.538 --> 00:15:14.698\ndemonstrate something in the console.\n\n303\n00:15:14.698 --> 00:15:18.093\nIt has to be weighed against what we\ncan accomplish within the time frame of\n\n304\n00:15:18.093 --> 00:15:20.370\nthe shows that we wanna\nget through with you.\n\n305\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.330\nIf we were to demo every nook and cranny\nof that console, we'd have to spend 50 or\n\n306\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.350\n60 hours of time just doing demos.\n\n307\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.380\nAnd so we wanna give you some\nself-paced guidance you can use\n\n308\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.620\nas you further explore.\n\n309\n00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.050\nThat's why those build out,\n\n310\n00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.210\nkind of step by step instructions\nwind up in the show notes for you.\n\n311\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.387\nWe've done the most important\ncritical linking elements.\n\n312\n00:15:38.387 --> 00:15:40.825\nThese are just some additional\nthings you would do within those.\n\n313\n00:15:40.825 --> 00:15:43.897\nI'm just giving you some idea of how to\ndo those things is what we're looking\n\n314\n00:15:43.897 --> 00:15:44.580\nto accomplish.\n\n315\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.830\nWe can go back to the console\nto continue discussing with you,\n\n316\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.990\nthe idea of user roles.\n\n317\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.017\nAnd when we talk about user roles\nsince we're in the Settings area.\n\n318\n00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:53.804\nYou'll see that under user roles,\n\n319\n00:15:53.804 --> 00:15:56.911\nby default, we only have\nthe administrator role initially.\n\n320\n00:15:56.911 --> 00:15:58.709\nAnd that's obviously\na self-explanatory role.\n\n321\n00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.115\nThat's the one that everybody uses.\n\n322\n00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:02.848\nBe able to accomplish essentially any and\nall activities.\n\n323\n00:16:02.848 --> 00:16:06.784\nBut we may wanna constrain user activity\nand give them a pre-assigned or\n\n324\n00:16:06.784 --> 00:16:10.130\npre-configured role that\ndoesn't give them full rights.\n\n325\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.600\nAnd I mentioned this at least once or\n\n326\n00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.930\ntwice in some areas where we're doing\nwalkthroughs or discussing things instead.\n\n327\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.700\nYou'd be able to go in and\n\n328\n00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.240\ndo this, depending on the kind of user\nrole you're assigned in the console.\n\n329\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.950\nYou may be able to\nprovision these networks or\n\n330\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.540\nmay be able to add this template or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n331\n00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.670\nAnd so to create a user role,\n\n332\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.140\nwe come up here under user roles\nin security in the settings area.\n\n333\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.010\nCome up here to where it\nsays Create User Roles.\n\n334\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.370\nWe also create Run as Accounts\nfrom the same area right here.\n\n335\n00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.810\nWe've talked about the importance\nof Run as Accounts.\n\n336\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.570\nCreate User Role, we give it a name.\n\n337\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:48.356\nWe'll just call ours ITPROTV U1,\nright, for U1 role, user one role.\n\n338\n00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:50.280\nYou can name it anything you'd like.\n\n339\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.680\nAnd then just move the wizard over here\na little bit, so you could see that.\n\n340\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.030\nWe're doing our box in box.\n\n341\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.740\nAnd then you can see here that we have\na pre-made list of four different\n\n342\n00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.090\nroles that are assigned or available for\nassignment depending on what we are doing.\n\n343\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.050\nWe have fabric administrator, which is\ncalled the delegated administrator.\n\n344\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.820\nThis is an admin that can go in and\n\n345\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.980\nis constrained to be able use\nthe fabric resources to configure them.\n\n346\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.550\nBut it's not gonna have rights to edit\nthe console out fully, modify settings,\n\n347\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.310\nthings of that nature.\n\n348\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.150\nSo, a restricted role, but\na very important one that's often given to\n\n349\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.340\nconsole admins that gonna operate\n[INAUDIBLE] day to day and oversee and\n\n350\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.030\nadminister the fabric.\n\n351\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.140\nRead only admin,\n\n352\n00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.670\nthat's what essentially is gonna be given\nmost likely to senior level managers.\n\n353\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.570\nWho wanna be able to see what's going on,\nbut\n\n354\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.810\nare not gonna engage in\nday to day activities.\n\n355\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.190\nI often refer to this as being able to\nwindow shop, right, you can look but\n\n356\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.100\nyou can't buy.\n\n357\n00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.255\nSo hopefully you're not gonna get into\ntrouble by making changes in things you\n\n358\n00:17:44.255 --> 00:17:45.985\nmay or may not understand.\n\n359\n00:17:45.985 --> 00:17:49.715\nTenant admin, this is gonna be\nan administrator or administrative role.\n\n360\n00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:54.495\nAgain, delegated constrained in some way\nthat is focused on once we have configured\n\n361\n00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:57.890\neverything [INAUDIBLE] able to maintain\nthe tenant, so that's what that does.\n\n362\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.530\nAnd then application administrator,\n\n363\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.504\nnotice it says self service\nuser there in parenthesis.\n\n364\n00:18:02.504 --> 00:18:05.130\nThis role again, constrained,\nright, filtered out for\n\n365\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.930\ncertain activities to be\nallowed others to be denied.\n\n366\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.550\nIs breaking down and\nallowing you to assign two users\n\n367\n00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:17.200\nthat are gonna maintain and oversee the\nself service provisioning aspects of SCVMM\n\n368\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.100\nusing the app controller and\nthe Windows Azure pack.\n\n369\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.220\nAnd we'll be talking about some of those\nfunctions in upcoming episodes later on.\n\n370\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.110\nThis is where we would give a constrained\nrole to a user that's gonna be able to\n\n371\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.980\ndo this.\n\n372\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.230\nSo we would specify whatever\nuser role we would like.\n\n373\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.305\nYou'll see here for instance,\nfabric administrator.\n\n374\n00:18:33.305 --> 00:18:35.660\nThat's what we choose to do, no big deal.\n\n375\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.840\nWe then we'd go in,\n\n376\n00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.370\nwe'd specify the Active Directory base\nmembers that we wanna add in here.\n\n377\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.200\nSo let's just say for a minute that\nwe go get ourselves the guest group,\n\n378\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.760\nthat's always a good one to use for\ndemo purposes.\n\n379\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.740\nNever in the real world, but for the demo\npurposes, we tend to use just an account\n\n380\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.170\nor a group that can be used to be able to\nrepresent that [INAUDIBLE] play soldiers.\n\n381\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.410\nYou could see I could put them in there.\n\n382\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.545\nI would remind you of the fact that you\nobviously have to preplan this thought\n\n383\n00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:02.750\nprocess a little bit, right?\n\n384\n00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.003\nBecause you have to go in and you have to\nfigure out hey, I wanna be able to use or\n\n385\n00:19:07.003 --> 00:19:11.010\nassign to this user or group these rights,\nso they have to be available.\n\n386\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.870\nYou have to know what they are and\nyou obviously have to have them\n\n387\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.620\nahead of time in the Active Directory\nfeed to choose them on that screen.\n\n388\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.880\nSo, just remember that and\nthink about that.\n\n389\n00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.520\nWe have the host we're gonna assign for\nthe scope here.\n\n390\n00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.570\nSo we'll specify all hosts, so that we can\nmake this role available for all hosts.\n\n391\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.950\nWhat library server or\nservers are we gonna add?\n\n392\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.740\nWe have our standard one,\nwe may have more than one.\n\n393\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.030\nIf we do, we would choose which ones\nwe would want to incorporate here,\n\n394\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.440\nput that in there.\n\n395\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.780\nWhat run as accounts are we\ngoing to make available.\n\n396\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.725\nAgain, we would choose from the list that\nis available and or create our own here.\n\n397\n00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:45.888\nIf we wanna create a new one,\n\n398\n00:19:45.888 --> 00:19:48.712\nwe haven't taken advantage of\nthe wizard to create a run as account.\n\n399\n00:19:48.712 --> 00:19:51.603\nGo and wait, I need that run as\naccount while we can do it right here,\n\n400\n00:19:51.603 --> 00:19:54.560\nwe integrated right in to the console,\nso that's good to know.\n\n401\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.780\nAgain, we'll just use a placeholder for\npurposes of demonstration right now.\n\n402\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.700\nWe'll just go ahead and\nuse a system account, specify that, and\n\n403\n00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.280\nthen when we're done, remember we do have\nthe option to view the PowerShell script,\n\n404\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.050\ntalked about that before.\n\n405\n00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.634\nClick Finish, give that just a moment.\n\n406\n00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:12.944\nAnd then we'll get a user role\nthere that eventually will, and\n\n407\n00:20:12.944 --> 00:20:14.700\nremember this is our job window.\n\n408\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.700\nYou've seen that thought process,\n\n409\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.818\nI talked about why we just have that\ncome up that way and don't have it open.\n\n410\n00:20:20.818 --> 00:20:24.645\nSo you could see it completed,\nand once we get rid of that,\n\n411\n00:20:24.645 --> 00:20:26.926\nyou'll see our new role is there.\n\n412\n00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:28.973\nIt's been instantiated,\nset up, ready to go.\n\n413\n00:20:28.973 --> 00:20:32.050\nCreate a new user role,\nnot much more difficult than that, right?\n\n414\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.649\nSo, it's gonna be very simple and\neasy for us to do.\n\n415\n00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:37.664\n&gt;&gt; Adam, I think the most difficult part\nwould really just be organizing those\n\n416\n00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:39.950\ndifferent groups and having those ready.\n\n417\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.470\nAnd knowing who should and\nshould not be a long term access.\n\n418\n00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.030\n&gt;&gt; It would be a bit of challenging\nthought process in the sense as I was\n\n419\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.410\ndescribing and you called out as well.\n\n420\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.030\nIt requires a little pre-planning, right?\n\n421\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.930\nYou got to think through\nas Cherokee's implying.\n\n422\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.540\nThe idea of which users would\nbe appropriate or groups,\n\n423\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.606\ncuz remember we can do either\none as we're suggesting.\n\n424\n00:20:57.606 --> 00:21:00.770\nAnd which user or group would\nbe in the appropriate fit there,\n\n425\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.990\nmaybe we have a group or maybe we're\nnot sure of the group membership,\n\n426\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.760\nprobably we wanna vet that ahead of time.\n\n427\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.710\nAlthough you could certainly vet it after\nthe facts, it's no big deal either way.\n\n428\n00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.490\nRemember, you're not modifying\nthe group membership in here,\n\n429\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.700\nyou're just going back to AD in adding and\nremoving.\n\n430\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.390\nIt automatically just reflects that in the\nsense that whoever's in that group gets\n\n431\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.000\nthese rights when they log on.\n\n432\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.420\nBut specific to this console, so\n\n433\n00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.440\nit doesn't really matter if\nyou do it before or after.\n\n434\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.080\nBut it is an important ongoing thought\nprocess from a security standpoint\n\n435\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.050\nto have a sense of that.\n\n436\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.217\nAnd that will be probably\nnot challenging but\n\n437\n00:21:29.217 --> 00:21:33.216\nsimply just one of those checklist items,\nas you were suggesting before we got on.\n\n438\n00:21:33.216 --> 00:21:34.840\nYou were talking about checklists.\n\n439\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.520\nIt's probably one of those checklist items\nthat if we do plan for ahead of time,\n\n440\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.000\nit makes it a lot easier for\nus when we get in here, right?\n\n441\n00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.410\nSo that's just something to consider.\n\n442\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.340\nProbably a good way to think about that.\n\n443\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.640\nAll right, so, we've talked about\nthe idea of software defined networking,\n\n444\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.620\ntalked about the idea of user roles.\n\n445\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.460\nWhat we need to do is also go in and\njust preview this idea of host\n\n446\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.630\ngroups a little bit, what are they,\nwhy are they important.\n\n447\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.460\nI wanted to walkthrough with you, how to\nadd hosts in and how to configure them.\n\n448\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.220\nBut I'm thinking we may not have enough\ntime to do all that before we end\n\n449\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.870\nthis episode.\n\n450\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.330\nSo I'm thinking maybe-\n&gt;&gt; A part five?\n\n451\n00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.400\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a part five as\ncrazy as that sounds.\n\n452\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.540\nBecause I promised we'd wrap up at\nthe beginning of this conversation\n\n453\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.130\nin part four.\n\n454\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.787\nBut just looking at the time and\ntrying to be sensitive to that,\n\n455\n00:22:16.787 --> 00:22:20.060\nI realize we probably can't fit all that\nin in the next three or four minutes.\n\n456\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.530\n&gt;&gt; No worries, Adam.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a part five.\n\n457\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.253\n&gt;&gt; It's better that we take our time and\nfinesse these host groups.\n\n458\n00:22:25.253 --> 00:22:28.648\nSo let's go ahead and decide on part five.\n\n459\n00:22:28.648 --> 00:22:31.028\nLadies and gentlemen, you heard it\nyourselves, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n460\n00:22:31.028 --> 00:22:32.480\nto sign out for this show though.\n\n461\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.180\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n462\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.340\n&gt;&gt; I'm the distracted [INAUDIBLE] who\nwas supposed to be paying attention.\n\n463\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.900\nI was resetting my lab time, so\n\n464\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.570\nwe can do part five without\nlosing our infrastructure.\n\n465\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:47.573\nI'm Adam Gordon, and I should pay better\nattention next time, see you soon.\n\n466\n00:22:47.573 --> 00:22:53.473\n[MUSIC]\n\n467\n00:22:53.473 --> 00:22:56.638\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

and\n\n6\n00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:15.801\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.730\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.303\nIn the previous episode,\nwe really did a lot of review and\n\n9\n00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:22.510\nintroduced a few more concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.020\nBut in this episode we're really\ngonna be focusing on host groups.\n\n11\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.440\nAnd back with us today in\nstudios we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.940\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.610\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, thank you,\nalways a pleasure to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.880\nSo we're gonna continue our\ndiscussions and we'll just wrap up,\n\n15\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.710\nas Cherokee was suggesting,\nwith a focus on host groups.\n\n16\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.030\nTalked about what they are a little bit.\n\n17\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.150\nShown you where we create them.\n\n18\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.800\nWe're gonna walk through a little hands-on\nactivity to drive our conversation around\n\n19\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.290\nenabling them and setting up some of\nthe supporting elements that go with them.\n\n20\n00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.300\nBut really just a high level\n\n21\n00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.610\nthought process of what host\ngroups are to get us started.\n\n22\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.070\nA host group is really just gonna allow\nus to bundle or create an operational\n\n23\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.230\nmanagerial container that allows us\nto put multiple hosts in there and\n\n24\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.200\napply configuration settings and profiles,\nthings like that to all the hosts at once.\n\n25\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400\nSo it's really almost like an OU\nlet's say in the Active Directory.\n\n26\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.060\nIf you think about the logic of it, allows\nus to group together multiple users and\n\n27\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.690\nor groups, or computers or\nobjects of a variety of types and\n\n28\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.460\napply group policies and settings to them.\n\n29\n00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.070\nIn a way that allows us to keep\nthem organized but also allows us\n\n30\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.740\nto be able to gain the benefit of\nidentifying multiple objects in one place,\n\n31\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.970\nand then managing them consistently\nas a result of that, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.570\nSo, just think about that.\n\n33\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.400\nAlso, host groups are hierarchical.\n\n34\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.330\nWe could have child or nested host\ngroups inside a parent host group.\n\n35\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.100\nAnd because of that, we do have\nthe ability to be able to see logically\n\n36\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.010\nas we always see the thought process\nof inheritance, so we see from\n\n37\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.570\na parent to a child host group,\nthe properties of inheritance working.\n\n38\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.030\nWhen a child host group is\ngonna be able to have or\n\n39\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.920\nadd new members,\nthey're going to inherit those settings.\n\n40\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.110\nJust wanna keep that in mind,\nthink about that as well.\n\n41\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.980\nBut we do have the ability to be\nable to apply those changes or not.\n\n42\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.670\nSo even if it's like in\na normal environment,\n\n43\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.230\nwe can think through the logic of,\ndo we want those changes?\n\n44\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.310\nDo we want to inherit them?\n\n45\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.520\nOr do we perhaps wanna go our own way?\n\n46\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.970\nAnd we can think about\nthat just through normal\n\n47\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.440\nthought processes that we're\nalready familiar with.\n\n48\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.760\nNo, I'm not going to let you\nsay anything or ask a question.\n\n49\n00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.362\nStop bothering me while\nI'm trying to work.\n\n50\n00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:21.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a good question.\n\n51\n00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.575\n&gt;&gt; It's always a good question.\n\n52\n00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:23.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, go ahead.\n\n53\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.325\nCherokee wants to say something,\nso go ahead, Cherokee.\n\n54\n00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Adam, earlier you told us that with\nour virtual machine manager, we were able\n\n55\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.120\nto traverse different platforms and\ndifferent types of virtualization.\n\n56\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.339\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about managing things\nlike vCenter and Zen, for instance, right?\n\n57\n00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.622\nBringing them all together, right.\n\n58\n00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:40.722\nHosts, specifically the hosts, right.\n\n59\n00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:43.937\n&gt;&gt; So here we're not having any conflicts\nwhen we're creating those host groups,\n\n60\n00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:46.920\nit can spread across to\nthe different platforms?\n\n61\n00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.200\n&gt;&gt; No, the host groups are just gonna\nbe able to aggregate up and collect for\n\n62\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.738\nus those hosts that we're gonna manage.\n\n63\n00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.754\nSo they were in a container that\nessentially we could just work with, so\n\n64\n00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:56.379\nno there's no issue with that at all.\n\n65\n00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.737\nNothing to worry about,\nhello, how are you?\n\n66\n00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:01.303\nNothing to worry about and\nwe're not gonna have any conflicts or\n\n67\n00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:03.980\nanything like that at all, so no,\nthat's not gonna be a problem.\n\n68\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.663\nBut it's a good point to remember,\nCherokee brought up,\n\n69\n00:03:06.663 --> 00:03:08.426\nthat we do actually have the ability.\n\n70\n00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:12.216\nAnd so, I think I mentioned in one of the\nearlier episodes that we have the ability\n\n71\n00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:15.953\nto be able to manage across all the major\nvirtualization vendor platforms as you\n\n72\n00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:16.867\nheard me just say.\n\n73\n00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:22.194\nvCenter, VMWare, ESXI hosts,\nXen, XenCenter, XenServer.\n\n74\n00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:25.954\nSo the Citrix solution and of course,\nour own Microsoft's Hyper-V and\n\n75\n00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:28.840\nusing System Center virtual\nmachine manager to do so.\n\n76\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.410\nSo, we definitely have that ability.\n\n77\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.260\nSo having said that, let's go take a look\nat how we're actually gonna do this.\n\n78\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.530\nWe're to go in, create ourselves\na host group and get started.\n\n79\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.860\nSo let's create a host group.\n\n80\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.320\nWe've open up our console,\nwe've gonna ahead.\n\n81\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.350\nI've already just kinda done that.\n\n82\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.650\nWe're in the fabric area.\n\n83\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.140\nWe're gonna go to all hosts, as you\ncan see, right here, up under Servers.\n\n84\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.020\nWe've been here before, and we do\nhave the all hosts group, by default.\n\n85\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.800\nThat is the only default\nhost group that's there.\n\n86\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.360\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nadd another one in.\n\n87\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.230\nRight click and you'll see here we could\nadd and to Cherokee's point a moment ago,\n\n88\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.590\nyou'll notice we can add in,\ncan we go full screen image?\n\n89\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.080\nIt'll be a little bit hard for\nyou to see that.\n\n90\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.360\nBut you can see we can add\nthe Hyper-V hosts and clusters,\n\n91\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.120\nthe Citrix, Xen and VMWare hosts and\nclusters right there.\n\n92\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.730\nSo we could bring in those hosts to\nbe able to manage them as you were\n\n93\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.280\nsuggesting.\n\n94\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.770\nBut you'll notice we could also\ncreate a host group right from here.\n\n95\n00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.680\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate a host group.\n\n96\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.900\nAnd you'll see we've just added in a host\ngroup nothing more involved than that\n\n97\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.820\nas you could see.\n\n98\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.990\nRight, we can go ahead and\nwe can give it a name.\n\n99\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.598\nAnd so if we wanna rename this\nwe'll call this ITProTV host.\n\n100\n00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:38.660\nHost G1 for group one.\n\n101\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.680\nYou hopefully will come up with\na slightly better name than that\n\n102\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.300\nwhen you're doing it.\n\n103\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.080\nBut we're just gonna keep it simple for\npurposes of our demonstration there.\n\n104\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.410\nAnd then if you wanna be able\nto nest inside here, again,\n\n105\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.850\nremember we talked about\nparent child concept.\n\n106\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.970\nCreate another host group and you'll see\nwe could simply create another one let's\n\n107\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.110\njust do that so that we can see that\nwe do have the ability to nest there.\n\n108\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.410\nLet me just click there so\nI can rename that.\n\n109\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:14.190\nAnd we'll just give it a name\nITProTV Host G2 for group 2.\n\n110\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.510\nAnd you can see we just created\na nested set of host groups right?\n\n111\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.090\nSo it's very straight forward there.\n\n112\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.280\nAnd we could, keep going if we\nneeded to and create two or\n\n113\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.320\nthree host groups down as we keep going.\n\n114\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.792\nI'm not gonna bother to nest all that but\nyou get the general idea, right.\n\n115\n00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.096\nAnd so once we've done that,\nthen we can go in.\n\n116\n00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:33.850\nAnd let's just say we chose\nthis particular one up here.\n\n117\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.460\nAnd once we've done that,\n\n118\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.530\nlet's just take a look at properties here\nreal quick before we do anything else.\n\n119\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.800\nLet me move this over just so\nwe can see that.\n\n120\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.740\nAnd there we go.\n\n121\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.900\nAnd so you can see, when we look at the\nproperties of one of the host groups, so\n\n122\n00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.720\nwhether it's the parent or the child or\nanything that's there in the nested\n\n123\n00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.600\nenvironment, we can\ncertainly see the name.\n\n124\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600\nWe can always rename it, no big deal.\n\n125\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.100\nWe could change the location\nif we wanna move it around.\n\n126\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.390\nSo we can do that.\n\n127\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.460\nBut then we have placement rules and\nwe have the ability to be able to drive\n\n128\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.970\nthrough placement rules here in discuss or\nthink in our mind,\n\n129\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.380\nwhat are the rules that are gonna be\nused to be able to drive placement here?\n\n130\n00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.518\nAnd you'll see use the placement settings\nfrom the parent host group which are up\n\n131\n00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:12.314\nabove in all hosts.\n\n132\n00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:16.475\nBecause, remember, everything nested up\nunderneath all hosts becomes essentially\n\n133\n00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:17.622\na child of the default.\n\n134\n00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:19.770\nSo we have to choose to override.\n\n135\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.450\nWe talked about this,\nwe could decide to inherit what we want,\n\n136\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.240\nand you're seeing that here.\n\n137\n00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.330\nOr we could override and then have\nour ability to create our own here.\n\n138\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.877\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like with Active Directory\nwhen they say, RSOP or\n\n139\n00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:34.350\nresultant set of that policy.\n\n140\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.500\n&gt;&gt; You're talking for group policy, the\nRSOP tool, the Resultant set of policies.\n\n141\n00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Like this whole concept\nwith that inheritance and\n\n142\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.890\nbeing able to block it there.\n\n143\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.888\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely, and in any area of\nWindows where we see inheritance working\n\n144\n00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:48.380\nin a parent-child relationship,\nthe thought process is the same.\n\n145\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.110\nIt doesn't really matter where we are.\n\n146\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.820\nParents get to set the rules essentially,\nso they get the initial grant of rights or\n\n147\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.820\npermission or policies,\nwhatever we're talking about.\n\n148\n00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.400\nAnd then child objects will\ntypically inherit them.\n\n149\n00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.710\nBut almost without exception,\n\n150\n00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.000\nwe have the ability to override\nthat inheritance if necessary.\n\n151\n00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.150\nAnd so we're just reminding ourselves\nof what that looks like here\n\n152\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.180\nas we're going through.\n\n153\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.320\nAnd so we can go in and we can decide,\nas I was suggesting to be able to do this.\n\n154\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.349\nNow because the all host container\nis the ultimate parent container,\n\n155\n00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:22.222\nwe could go up there and\nwe could edit rules there.\n\n156\n00:07:22.222 --> 00:07:26.766\nBut if we do that, they're now gonna flow\ndown to every, they're gonna flow down or\n\n157\n00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:29.523\npropagate to every child\nthat is up underneath us.\n\n158\n00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:34.138\nEven though we've identified\nthe fact that ITProTV host G1,\n\n159\n00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:39.187\nis gonna be a parent to our host G2\nnested solution and that is true but\n\n160\n00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:43.300\nthey're all children of the master or\nroot host group.\n\n161\n00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.286\nAnd so in effect, we're talking\nabout children and grand children,\n\n162\n00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:48.041\nthink about the logic of the hierarchy.\n\n163\n00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.174\nSo we have to decide where to break\nthe inheritance is really what we have to\n\n164\n00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:51.790\nthink about.\n\n165\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.763\nIf I break it here then what's\ngonna happen is ITPro host G1\n\n166\n00:07:56.763 --> 00:07:58.961\nwill now set those rules.\n\n167\n00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:02.674\nAnd those rules will now propagate\ndown to a child below in this case\n\n168\n00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:03.743\nITProTV Host G2.\n\n169\n00:08:03.743 --> 00:08:07.435\nSo we just have to think,\nexcuse me, think about that,\n\n170\n00:08:07.435 --> 00:08:12.009\nif we do that notice that we then get\nthe ability to use the add button.\n\n171\n00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.970\nAnd we have the ability here to\ncreate customer requirements.\n\n172\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.970\nLet's just center that so\nyou can see that, and\n\n173\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.800\nwe can specify any one of up\nto ten custom property fields.\n\n174\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.695\nTen is one of these magic numbers\nin an area like this that you see\n\n175\n00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:30.679\nin many of our products in SCCM,\nsystem center config manager.\n\n176\n00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:35.698\nIn SCOM, S-C-O-M, here in SCVMM,\nacross many of our platforms and\n\n177\n00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:39.380\nproducts, when we have\nthe ability to customize and\n\n178\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.030\nhave freeform fields that we can use and\nenter.\n\n179\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.860\nWe tend to have a list of ten\nthat we normally start out with.\n\n180\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.004\nThat's just the default setting that most\nMicrosoft infrastructure it's gonna use.\n\n181\n00:08:50.004 --> 00:08:52.618\nIt's not to say that every field,\neverywhere,\n\n182\n00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:56.720\nunder every customization solution\nwill always have ten free form fields.\n\n183\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.260\nBut the majority of these wizards\nwhere we run things like this and\n\n184\n00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.870\nwe see these fields, you tend to see\nten of them as the default standard.\n\n185\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.630\nJust so you have a sense of that, so it\ndoesn't matter which custom field we use,\n\n186\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.290\none is not better than 12, 5, 2, or 3.\n\n187\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.284\nJust a matter of choosing which\none you wanna assign this to.\n\n188\n00:09:14.284 --> 00:09:17.400\nSo I'm gonna do Custom 1,\nand then virtual machine.\n\n189\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.577\nYou'll see here we have some items or what\nwe call requirements we can assign here.\n\n190\n00:09:21.577 --> 00:09:25.907\nVirtual machine must match host,\nvirtual machine should match.\n\n191\n00:09:25.907 --> 00:09:29.200\nVirtual machine must not, and\nor virtual machine should not.\n\n192\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.672\nSo we have a couple of different options\nhere, depending on what we wanna do.\n\n193\n00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:37.379\nBut we could specify one or more of\nthese requirements, when we do this.\n\n194\n00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:40.600\nLet's just say must match,\nand click OK, right?\n\n195\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.817\nSo now we are going to be able to\nblock the deployment if this does\n\n196\n00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:46.078\nnot meet the requirement or requirements.\n\n197\n00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:48.930\nSo we could stack them up,\nhowever many we have.\n\n198\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.890\nWe could then go to Host Reserves.\n\n199\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.660\nHost Reserves, you'll see here,\n\n200\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.810\nagain we're using the defaults from up\nabove in the parent, the all host group.\n\n201\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.151\nSo again, we can break inheritance here.\n\n202\n00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:01.392\nIt's up to us to decide how to do that.\n\n203\n00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:04.300\nBut you'll see, using the Host Reserve\nsettings from the parenthood script.\n\n204\n00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.569\nLet's just uncheck that, so we can\nactually modify and see what's in there.\n\n205\n00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:12.744\nYou'll see we have CPU, memory,\ndata IO, disk space, network IO.\n\n206\n00:10:12.744 --> 00:10:17.365\nThese are the settings that the host\nis going to be able to have and\n\n207\n00:10:17.365 --> 00:10:20.113\nprovide and give and make available.\n\n208\n00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:22.872\nAnd it says your host reserves\nother resources set aside for\n\n209\n00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.870\nthe host operating system, right?\n\n210\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.976\nRemember what we often forget about\nin the drive to virtualize is\n\n211\n00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:33.844\nthe fact that the underlying host that\nprovides the resources through one or\n\n212\n00:10:33.844 --> 00:10:37.511\nmore hypervisors,\ndepending on how many hosts we have.\n\n213\n00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.309\nWe'll have multiple hypervisors,\none per host, right?\n\n214\n00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:44.957\nProviding resources to all the VMs or\nguest operating systems running there,\n\n215\n00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:49.550\nthat every host with its corresponding\nhypervisor has an operating system.\n\n216\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.885\nWe talked about this when we talked about\ntype 1 and type 2 hypervisors, right?\n\n217\n00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:57.820\nBare-metal hypervisors have to be\ninstalled through the operating system,\n\n218\n00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.930\nwhatever that is.\n\n219\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:05.841\nIn our case, it's the Windows Server 12,\n12 R2 2008, 2008 R2 OS, whatever it is.\n\n220\n00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:09.822\nBut it's a Windows Server OS that\nthen allow us to provide for\n\n221\n00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:16.010\nthe opportunity to install the Hyper-V\nroles, which is the hypervisor in Windows.\n\n222\n00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.594\nIf we talk about VMware we're\ninstalling VMware's ESXI.\n\n223\n00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:23.432\nvSphere ESXI operating system,\nand part of that is we get and\n\n224\n00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:26.907\ninstall the VMware hypervisor\ncalled the VM colonel.\n\n225\n00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.910\nSame thing in Zen where\nwe're doing this for Citrix.\n\n226\n00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.290\nYou install the Linux based Zen server and\n\n227\n00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.430\nyou get the Xen hypervisor\nas a result of that.\n\n228\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.120\nSo regardless of what we\ndo we're installing an OS.\n\n229\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.800\nAnd what people often forget,\nand with these settings or\n\n230\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.840\ndesign to remind us about is.\n\n231\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.420\nThat operating system on that host needs a\nguaranteed set of resources that is gonna\n\n232\n00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.910\ncurve out and keep for itself, separate\nfrom everything that gives to the VMs.\n\n233\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.180\nBecause that doesn't reserve a certain\namount of capacity in these areas for\n\n234\n00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.570\nit's own operations.\n\n235\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.560\nThe host won't be able to function and\nall the guest OSs or\n\n236\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.330\nVMs essentially will crash.\n\n237\n00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.470\nBecause we bleed all\nthe resources away from the host.\n\n238\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.620\nAnd it has nothing left to run itself to\nbe able to then provide the Hypervisor\n\n239\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.390\nwhich abstracts and\ncreates the opportunity for\n\n240\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.660\nvirtualized resources to be provided\nto the VMs, right through the host.\n\n241\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.500\nSo this is important because this is\ntaking care of the host and giving it\n\n242\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.178\nthe minimum requirements or whatever these\nrequirements are if you think about them.\n\n243\n00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:30.115\nBut the allocated resources required for\nit to survive, and thrive and be healthy.\n\n244\n00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:31.192\nIt's very important, right?\n\n245\n00:12:31.192 --> 00:12:33.345\nYeah, we often talk\nabout in the real world.\n\n246\n00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.305\nHey, if you're a parent make\nsure you take care of your kids.\n\n247\n00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:38.293\nYou gotta take care of yourself\nto take care of your kids, right?\n\n248\n00:12:38.293 --> 00:12:39.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You gotta get enough rest,\n\n249\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.643\nyou gotta eat well,\nyou gotta do all that stuff.\n\n250\n00:12:41.643 --> 00:12:44.815\nBecause you're no good to them if\nyou're sick and can't function, right?\n\n251\n00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:48.031\nI mean that's-\n&gt;&gt; Deficit and depleted of resources.\n\n252\n00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:50.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you know parents have never had\n\n253\n00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:51.029\nthat happens, right?\n\n254\n00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:53.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kids don't suck the life out of you,\n\n255\n00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.840\nthat never happens, right?\n\n256\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.769\n&gt;&gt; It sounds so morbid, Adam.\n\n257\n00:12:55.769 --> 00:12:56.907\n&gt;&gt; I'm not bitter by the way.\n\n258\n00:12:56.907 --> 00:12:58.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have kids, I love my kids, but\n\n259\n00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.493\nif you are parent you know, right?\n\n260\n00:13:00.493 --> 00:13:02.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They could be trying good times,\n\n261\n00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:03.441\nthat's the way it is.\n\n262\n00:13:03.441 --> 00:13:05.540\nSo let's go back to what\nwe were looking at here.\n\n263\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.572\nSo we wanna make sure we understand what\nwe are talking about and you will see some\n\n264\n00:13:09.572 --> 00:13:13.200\nof this are percentages in units,\nsome are megabytes, some are IOPS.\n\n265\n00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.020\nIt depends on what we're talking about,\nyou have a unit area here, and\n\n266\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.780\nwe have an amount.\n\n267\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.926\nThat's just an interface you add and\nremove here by typing in, and so\n\n268\n00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:22.507\nyou can see that the unit.\n\n269\n00:13:22.507 --> 00:13:26.577\nAnd in this case the amount\nunder CPU could be specified.\n\n270\n00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:30.075\nAnd we just go in and say okay 10%\nof CPU on the host is reserved for\n\n271\n00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:33.970\nhost functionality of that kind of\nthing and we modify the settings here.\n\n272\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.020\nSo you can go in and do all this.\n\n273\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.160\nWe then have dynamic optimization,\nwhat's called or rather, excuse me,\n\n274\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.790\nwhat dynamic optimization is referred\nto is the idea of really automatically\n\n275\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:51.260\nbalancing the virtual machine loads\nacross or within this host cluster.\n\n276\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.440\nDynamic optimization is the idea of\nbeing able to do this load balancing\n\n277\n00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.370\nthat we often hear about,\nit's software based load balancing.\n\n278\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.993\nOn the VMware platform this is\nreferred to as DRS technology,\n\n279\n00:14:02.993 --> 00:14:07.943\ndynamic resource scheduling, dynamic\noptimization is just Microsoft's name for\n\n280\n00:14:07.943 --> 00:14:09.978\nthat industry standard concept.\n\n281\n00:14:09.978 --> 00:14:13.690\nOracle calls it DRS in their\nvirtualization stack as well.\n\n282\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.180\nThere's different vendors have\ndifferent names for things.\n\n283\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.950\nAnd we talked about this idea early on in\nsome of the very first episodes as we're\n\n284\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.510\ntalking about planning for\nthe cloud that you really need to\n\n285\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.750\nunderstand virtualization in\nthe cloud as much as anything.\n\n286\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:31.080\nIt's about wrapping your head around the\nvocabulary, the syntax of what the vendor\n\n287\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.390\nspecific solution refers to, because\na lot of the concepts are identical.\n\n288\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.996\nThey don't really change vendor to vendor,\ncuz we figured out over the 20 something\n\n289\n00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:43.987\nyears this technology's been around how\nto do this and do it the right way.\n\n290\n00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:48.123\nIt's sort of just what we call it because\nnot every vendor's gonna call the solution\n\n291\n00:14:48.123 --> 00:14:49.650\nthe same exact thing, right?\n\n292\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.010\nKeep the idea in mind of vMotion\nversus live migration, right?\n\n293\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.238\nWindows versus VMware's name for\nthe same technology.\n\n294\n00:14:56.238 --> 00:14:59.665\nIf everybody said it was live migration or\neverybody said it was vMotion,\n\n295\n00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.280\nthat would make a lot of sense\nit would be standardized.\n\n296\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.018\nBut you can't use the same\nname when people or\n\n297\n00:15:05.018 --> 00:15:09.484\ncompanies tend to create that as part\nof their stack and their own stuff and\n\n298\n00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:14.090\ntheir own way of referring to it and\nthey trademark and everything else.\n\n299\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.588\nYou'd be battling it out in court everyday\nto figure out who gets the rights to it.\n\n300\n00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:19.516\nInstead we just simply change the names,\nbut\n\n301\n00:15:19.516 --> 00:15:21.650\nsince we're referring to the same idea.\n\n302\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.210\nAnd so dynamic optimization is this\nidea of software based load balancing\n\n303\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.480\nacross the host clusters, to be able\nto optimize the VMs running there.\n\n304\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.560\nSo we don't overload one\nhost with all these VMs\n\n305\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:41.545\nmaxed out at 90% capacity minus\nwhatever the host reserve is.\n\n306\n00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:44.283\nWhatever the resource we just\ntalked about on the prior screen,\n\n307\n00:15:44.283 --> 00:15:45.559\nwould be that we reserve out.\n\n308\n00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:49.669\nWe don't wanna max out one host and\nhave two or three hosts running at 20 or\n\n309\n00:15:49.669 --> 00:15:51.701\n30% capacity with only a few VMs.\n\n310\n00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.538\nBecause that host is gonna get overworked,\nthose VMs may suffer and\n\n311\n00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:57.093\nthey're probably not gonna be\noptimized and managed well.\n\n312\n00:15:57.093 --> 00:16:01.030\nInstead it would make a lot more sense\nin a three host cluster like I was just\n\n313\n00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.461\ndescribing To load balance those\nVMs through live migration and\n\n314\n00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:08.783\ninitial power on placement to optimize\nthe selection of where they're gonna run\n\n315\n00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:10.720\ninitially as they start up.\n\n316\n00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.340\nAnd also then throughout\ntheir life cycle running,\n\n317\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.430\nconstantly monitor usage on the host.\n\n318\n00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.410\nAnd if we see we're getting\nimbalanced at some level,\n\n319\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.960\nthat's where that slider for high,\nmedium, low aggressiveness comes in.\n\n320\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.510\nThen depending on how we set that, we're\nless or more likely to live migrate or\n\n321\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.760\nmove VMs that are running in real\ntime from one host to another.\n\n322\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.760\nTrying to balance the optimized\nload on the host in the process.\n\n323\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.000\nRemember we don't shut the VMs\noff when we do this right?\n\n324\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.050\nThey just move in real time, no laws\nof continuity, no laws of connectivity,\n\n325\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.150\neverything stays the same,\nit's all good in other words, right?\n\n326\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.784\nBut this allows us to further tweak and\noptimize that host and those VMs response\n\n327\n00:16:49.784 --> 00:16:54.140\nin this, also hopefully if we do it\nthe right way, it potentially averting\n\n328\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.658\nthe situation where we may run into\na problem where the host gets overloaded.\n\n329\n00:16:58.658 --> 00:17:01.490\nAnd because of the sudden spike\nin resource usage on one or\n\n330\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.384\nmore VMs, the host could actually crash\nand as a result those VMs could crash.\n\n331\n00:17:05.384 --> 00:17:08.948\nAnd although we can restore them, we now\nrun into an issue where we potentially\n\n332\n00:17:08.948 --> 00:17:12.674\ncould have averted that and prevented the\nVMs from turning off in the first place,\n\n333\n00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:14.729\nhad we just been a little\nsmarter with those.\n\n334\n00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:16.022\n&gt;&gt; Preemptive triage, basically.\n\n335\n00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:18.295\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, so\nthis is what this technology does.\n\n336\n00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:20.020\nReally, really valuable.\n\n337\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.760\nTechnology across all\nthe vendors platforms,\n\n338\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.610\ncuz remember all the major\nvirtualization vendors have\n\n339\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:28.090\nthis technology there's may\nrefer to it differently.\n\n340\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.180\nBut we all do the same thing and so\nthis technology's really important.\n\n341\n00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.650\nSo we could see how this\nwill get set here, again\n\n342\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.460\npointing out we can override from the host\ngroup if needed, the parent group.\n\n343\n00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.410\nYou could see I just unchecked the box.\n\n344\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.490\nAnd then all of a sudden I can go and\nspecify my settings here.\n\n345\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.120\nAgain, look at the resource list here,\nCPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O.\n\n346\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.990\nSo again the same thought process\nthat we would have seen just up\n\n347\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.550\nabove under host reserves.\n\n348\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.940\nInstead this time we're taking a look\nat this and saying okay based on these\n\n349\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.750\nthresholds I wanna then say the host is\noptimized when I'm running at this level.\n\n350\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.090\nSo we're then gonna start moving\nVMs around to accommodate that\n\n351\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.790\nacross the host cluster.\n\n352\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.020\nSo just be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n353\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.460\nWe also have power optimization\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n354\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.030\nPower optimization is\nagain a different name.\n\n355\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.100\nIt's on different platforms.\n\n356\n00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.220\nVMware calls this DPM,\nDynamic power management.\n\n357\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.550\nIt's part of the host cluster, DRS,\n\n358\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.030\nHA high availability solution that we\nput together in the host cluster there.\n\n359\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.010\nWe call this dynamic optimization,\nand, as a result,\n\n360\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.200\njust power optimization is part of that.\n\n361\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.250\nThis allows us to power down hosts,\nputting them into sleep mode, if you're\n\n362\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.225\nfamiliar with something like drac or\nI low or way con LAN WOL technology,\n\n363\n00:18:43.225 --> 00:18:47.200\nwere we have a controller in the host,\na network card essentially.\n\n364\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.760\nThat allows us to be able to wake the host\nup with a wakeup packet a WOL way\n\n365\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.970\ncon LAN packet.\n\n366\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.860\nAnd depending on the vendor you use for\nyour hosts, they use different names for\n\n367\n00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.450\nthis technology.\n\n368\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:57.950\n&gt;&gt; Like a magic packet?\n\n369\n00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:01.593\nFor way con LAN?\n\n370\n00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:02.865\nI've heard that.\n\n371\n00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:03.479\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:04.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm serious.\n\n373\n00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:07.534\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're just gonna keep going.\n\n374\n00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:08.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n375\n00:19:08.394 --> 00:19:10.490\nyou're gonna take a sip\nfrom your magic cup.\n\n376\n00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.360\nAnd we're gonna all be good.\n\n377\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.230\nAll right, so it is sometimes,\nI'm kidding aside.\n\n378\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.170\nIt is sometimes referred\nto as a magic package.\n\n379\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.880\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n380\n00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.870\nBecause that is informally and\nactually in some vendors documentation,\n\n381\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.680\nI've seen it in writing a few times.\n\n382\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.260\nIt is referred to as a magic packet,\nbut commonly more commonly for it's\n\n383\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.070\na way con LAN or a wake up packet, which\nis what you often hear it referred to as.\n\n384\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.250\nBut it's just,\nit's almost like a ping or heartbeat.\n\n385\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.480\nHey, are you there and you know literally\nit would be like I would be tapping\n\n386\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.760\nCherokee on the shoulder going hey,\n\n387\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.870\nCherokee wake up much more effective\nwhen you actually see me doing that but\n\n388\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.790\nshe's there I really am tapping\nher on the shoulder, right?\n\n389\n00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.230\nShe's getting annoyed\ncause I keep doing it.\n\n390\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.070\nSo I'd be like wake up Cherokee and,\nif Cherokee was paying attention\n\n391\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.120\nshe would wake up right, and we would\nthen be able to use Cherokee and have her\n\n392\n00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.300\nengage here in the conversation, but\nif we didn't want Cherokee to be active.\n\n393\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.280\nBurning a lot of resources during the time\nwe don't need her to pay attention,\n\n394\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.660\nthen we would put her into-\n&gt;&gt; I don't wanna waste my resources.\n\n395\n00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.550\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, you wanna be fresh and\nready to go when we need you.\n\n396\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.387\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So, we will put you into like a,\n\n397\n00:20:08.387 --> 00:20:09.659\na sleep environment.\n\n398\n00:20:09.659 --> 00:20:11.786\n&gt;&gt; I could deal with that.\n\n399\n00:20:11.786 --> 00:20:14.375\n&gt;&gt; We would shut you down but\nnot totally shut you off.\n\n400\n00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:17.524\nWe would just say hey why\ndon't you take a nap, right,\n\n401\n00:20:17.524 --> 00:20:21.430\nand then when we need you we'll come and\nget you and wake you up.\n\n402\n00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.970\nAnd this is way con LAN or\npower optimization technology does.\n\n403\n00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.930\nIt allows us to power down servers\nto a sleep mode which is almost\n\n404\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.730\nno power consumption at all.\n\n405\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.694\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen when we need them we wake them up.\n\n406\n00:20:32.694 --> 00:20:36.245\nAnd there's a small delay while they\nessentially come out of sleep mode.\n\n407\n00:20:36.245 --> 00:20:38.603\nYou may have done this with your\ndesktops or laptops or tablets.\n\n408\n00:20:38.603 --> 00:20:40.866\nIt's pretty common technology today.\n\n409\n00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:42.748\nAPM, Advanced Power Management,\n\n410\n00:20:42.748 --> 00:20:46.036\ngenerically is what Microsoft\nused to call this technology.\n\n411\n00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.530\nOn the nonserver side,\n\n412\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.380\nbefore we implemented it in the server\nside here is power optimization in SCVMM.\n\n413\n00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.370\nBut advance power map is just an idea\nof putting the system to sleep,\n\n414\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.140\nbringing it back up out of sleep mode.\n\n415\n00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.495\nAnd because of that, where we're\nmanaging multiple host clusters,\n\n416\n00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:03.875\nwe can actually bring those hosts up,\n\n417\n00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:07.715\nlive migrate VMs onto them during\npeak periods of utilization.\n\n418\n00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:12.155\nAnd then, live migrate them off onto other\nmembers of the cluster to consolidate\n\n419\n00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:16.200\nthe other way, and shut down\nthe host during low period of usage.\n\n420\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.091\nThis allows us to really focus on the idea\nof optimizing the carbon footprint and\n\n421\n00:21:20.091 --> 00:21:23.806\noptimizing the power consumption and\nyou again think about the idea of being\n\n422\n00:21:23.806 --> 00:21:27.488\na service provider in a multi tenant\nenvironment, think of being Google.\n\n423\n00:21:27.488 --> 00:21:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n424\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.765\n&gt;&gt; Think of being Amazon, think of being\nMicrosoft running those data centers,\n\n425\n00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:34.074\nservicing the Azure Fabric or\n\n426\n00:21:34.074 --> 00:21:37.130\nthe AWS Fabric,\n&gt;&gt; And how many thousands, tens\n\n427\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.970\nof thousands of hosts they have to run to\nservice the millions of tenants they have?\n\n428\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.760\n&gt;&gt; And, Adam, when you can equate that to\ndollars and show how much you're saving,\n\n429\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.510\nyou're gonna be getting a bonus.\n\n430\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.575\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou're gonna certainly be doing that.\n\n431\n00:21:51.575 --> 00:21:53.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're also gonna be\n\n432\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.050\nsaving the environment.\n\n433\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.185\nIn terms of the carbon footprint.\n\n434\n00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:57.482\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be cutting down on green\n\n435\n00:21:57.482 --> 00:22:00.754\nhouse emission,\nwe're gonna be cutting down on power and\n\n436\n00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:04.642\nall those are all gonna be very\nimportant there's no doubt about it.\n\n437\n00:22:04.642 --> 00:22:05.721\nSo all good things right, all good things.\n\n438\n00:22:05.721 --> 00:22:06.770\nSo just keep in mind and\nunderstand the logic of this step.\n\n439\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.120\nNow here, so let's go back.\n\n440\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.670\nSo we've seen how this works, right?\n\n441\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.190\nWe know what we'll be doing here.\n\n442\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.890\nWe could go to network and\n\n443\n00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.750\nagain inherit network logical\nresources from the parent host groups.\n\n444\n00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.560\n&gt;&gt; Again we would break the inheritance\nhere if we choose to do this and\n\n445\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.250\nwe could then specify our own types.\n\n446\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.650\nYou'll see we have load balancers here,\nright?\n\n447\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.820\nYou'll see we have our logical networks.\n\n448\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.940\nI haven't created any logical networks,\nthere's nothing coming in right now,\n\n449\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.110\ncuz we did those in prior demos but\nwe've reset the environment just so\n\n450\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.420\nyou in case you've seen those episodes,\nand going hey, wait a second.\n\n451\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.430\nHe created a logical network.\n\n452\n00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.100\nWhere is it?\n\n453\n00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.220\nWhy don't we see the IP pool?\n\n454\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.130\nHe created that.\n\n455\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.910\nYou're right I did, but\nwe reset the environment in the meantime.\n\n456\n00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.740\nSo they are not gonna be there now, but\nyou would get from our prior walkthrough\n\n457\n00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.440\nthe idea of being able to go into the\nfabric resources of the networking area.\n\n458\n00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.910\nHaving all those things\nalready configured.\n\n459\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.150\nAnd then, remember,\nbeing able to add them here, right?\n\n460\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.620\nBecause the host groups\ngonna give us the ability\n\n461\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.230\nto reply all those to groups\nof hosts simultaneously.\n\n462\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.680\nAnd so there would be a lot of value\nin having them set up ahead of time and\n\n463\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.990\nthen being able to bring them in here.\n\n464\n00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.260\nSo that's what we would see here, right?\n\n465\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.480\nThat's what we're gonna get.\n\n466\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.510\nWe would have the ability here\non the storage to be able to add\n\n467\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.080\nin our storage and\na sign in storage capacity for\n\n468\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.320\nhost in this host group and\nallocate out how that's gonna work and\n\n469\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.230\nallocate storage for this host group so\nthat we can bring storage in and sign it.\n\n470\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.000\nTo this host group.\n\n471\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.740\nYou'll see right now we don't\nhave any storage assigned, but\n\n472\n00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.280\ncould allocate storage pools\nand/or allocate logical units.\n\n473\n00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.840\nSo we can bring in the entire\ngroup of storage of solutions.\n\n474\n00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.910\nYou know, the backend cluster,\nwhatever we're running.\n\n475\n00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.270\nAnd then we can allocate out\nthe storage as a result of that.\n\n476\n00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.310\nAnd then when we're done,\nif we have any custom properties,\n\n477\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.970\nwe can manage any custom\nproperties that may exist here.\n\n478\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.890\nWe could add those in.\n\n479\n00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.416\nAnd by doing all this we've gone ahead and\nwe've been able to profile in or\n\n480\n00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:51.117\ncreate the profile around\nour host group and\n\n481\n00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:54.190\nall the settings that will\nbe associated with it.\n\n482\n00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.331\nWhatever they are,\nhowever they are configured,\n\n483\n00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:57.887\nwhatever it is that we may want to do.\n\n484\n00:23:57.887 --> 00:24:00.710\nAnd once we've done this,\nwe've applied all those settings.\n\n485\n00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.367\nTo the hosts,\nall the members of the host group.\n\n486\n00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:07.379\nAnd once we've done all that,\nwe then would be able to reconfigure or\n\n487\n00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:09.396\nconfigure those hosts as needed.\n\n488\n00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:11.928\nAnd remember,\nwe talked about the ability to add hosts,\n\n489\n00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:14.157\njust to bring this back full circle,\nremind you.\n\n490\n00:24:14.157 --> 00:24:17.890\nCuz the logical question becomes well\nokay, great, how do we put hosts in there?\n\n491\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.441\nWell we showed you that already.\n\n492\n00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:23.239\nWe created the host group first, but\nI showed you we could add the host\n\n493\n00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:27.630\ngroup before we did this and remember we\nwould just bring in the Hyper-V hosts,\n\n494\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.905\nthe ESXI hosts, and/or the zen hosts.\n\n495\n00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:32.434\nWhatever, the three that\nwe're gonna be using here.\n\n496\n00:24:32.434 --> 00:24:36.465\nWe would add them in and then those hosts\nwould have those settings applied to them,\n\n497\n00:24:36.465 --> 00:24:40.350\nessentially like a template or set of\npolicies as Cherokee was suggesting.\n\n498\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.713\nThey get applied there and then they're\ngonna be able to be reconfigured.\n\n499\n00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:47.809\nAnd then those hosts will be managed\naccording to those policies or whatever\n\n500\n00:24:47.809 --> 00:24:51.910\nthose settings are that we've specified\nin the host group once we add them.\n\n501\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.788\nAnd then we're able to\nbenefit from that and\n\n502\n00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:56.547\nultimately we're able to use\nthat to drive our configuration.\n\n503\n00:24:56.547 --> 00:25:00.604\nSo it is nice because we can go in and\nwe can actually use the hosts in the host\n\n504\n00:25:00.604 --> 00:25:04.481\ngroup, preconfigure the host group,\nand apply all those settings.\n\n505\n00:25:04.481 --> 00:25:06.710\nSo it gives us a lot of flexibility.\n\n506\n00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.848\nBut remember the building blocks, right,\n\n507\n00:25:08.848 --> 00:25:11.340\nhave to all be there as you\nsaw from the networking.\n\n508\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.610\nThe fabric resources\nhave to be configured,\n\n509\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.254\notherwise we just don't have a lot\nto apply there because, by default,\n\n510\n00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:20.190\nthere aren't many of those\nthings preconfigured.\n\n511\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.860\nWe'd have to go in and create them all\nin order to ensure that we're going to,\n\n512\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.452\nultimately, be able to do this.\n\n513\n00:25:25.452 --> 00:25:27.760\nAnd just to show you, in theory,\nwhat adding a host would look like.\n\n514\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.634\nI'm not gonna run all the way through\nthe wizard, but just to give you a sense,\n\n515\n00:25:31.634 --> 00:25:35.550\nwe run our resource location,\nour discovery wizard essentially, here.\n\n516\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.403\nYou'll see indicate the Windows computer\nlocation, are they in a trusted AD domain,\n\n517\n00:25:39.403 --> 00:25:41.110\nso you could see what this looks like.\n\n518\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.330\nAre they in an untrusted\nActive Directory domain?\n\n519\n00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.610\nSo we would go through, and\nlet's just move that over just a touch so\n\n520\n00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.830\nyou could see that.\n\n521\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.470\nWe would go through and\ndecide where we're gonna put them.\n\n522\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.010\nAre they in a perimeter network?\n\n523\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.900\nLet me just get rid of our taskbar down\nhere real quick while we're doing that so\n\n524\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.240\nwe can see, little button and\nwe can continue.\n\n525\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.230\nSo, yeah, we'll specify where they are.\n\n526\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.560\nPhysical computers to be provisioned\nas virtual machine hosts,\n\n527\n00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.372\nwe can actually bring in physical\ncomputers that are gonna be converted and\n\n528\n00:26:09.372 --> 00:26:13.138\nused to provide hosting, they may not\nhave been configured that way yet.\n\n529\n00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.136\nSo we have different options.\n\n530\n00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:16.609\nLet's just say they're in\nthe trusted AD domain, for\n\n531\n00:26:16.609 --> 00:26:18.700\npurposes of our demo here real quick.\n\n532\n00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.019\nUse an existing Run As account or manually\nenter credentials for the system, or\n\n533\n00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:26.178\nthe credential that will be used,\nto be able to add this and\n\n534\n00:26:26.178 --> 00:26:29.677\ninstall the Hyper-V role on that host,\nand make it available.\n\n535\n00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:33.100\nSo, we may have a Run As account, or we\nmay provide an account that will do that.\n\n536\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.960\nSo, we would specify here what they are.\n\n537\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.044\nSo I'll just go through,\nI'll specify the system account for\n\n538\n00:26:39.044 --> 00:26:41.546\nthe moment, just for\npurposes of demonstration,\n\n539\n00:26:41.546 --> 00:26:45.700\nspecify the Windows server computers by\nname and/or specify an AD query to search.\n\n540\n00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.192\nAnd this is what I wanted to show you.\n\n541\n00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:50.567\nThe Discovery wizard can go through and\nactually search for\n\n542\n00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:54.955\ncomputers by querying the Active Directory\nbased on a WMI base query so a WQL,\n\n543\n00:26:54.955 --> 00:26:58.736\nWMI query language query that will\ngo in to the Active Directory and\n\n544\n00:26:58.736 --> 00:27:03.290\nwill actually pull out computers based\non the specification that you provide.\n\n545\n00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.180\nSo we could go in and\ndo that if we choose to.\n\n546\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.190\nNotice here, when I change that,\nwe generate an AD query.\n\n547\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.765\nSo it gives us the ability\nto generate that query.\n\n548\n00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:15.370\nAnd/or I would just have to specify\nthe names, whatever they are.\n\n549\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.464\nAnd you'll see, down at the bottom here,\nI can just put the host name in,\n\n550\n00:27:19.464 --> 00:27:23.515\nuser friendly name, fully qualified\ndomain name and IP address.\n\n551\n00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:27.540\nAnd/or, I should say IPV 4\naddress and/or an IPV 6 address.\n\n552\n00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.524\nSo we actually support all four mechanisms\nfor going out and finding those host.\n\n553\n00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:34.920\nIt'll be just up to us to\ndecide how to do that.\n\n554\n00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.460\nSo, we would figure that out.\n\n555\n00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.820\nThey do-\n&gt;&gt; And I can appreciate the value here.\n\n556\n00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.387\n&gt;&gt; They do have to be\nentered on a separate line,\n\n557\n00:27:40.387 --> 00:27:42.798\nI just wanted make sure we're clear\non that just before we continue.\n\n558\n00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:46.340\nBut it says right here, each one has\nto be entered on a separate line, so\n\n559\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.597\nline delimited,\njust to make sure you know.\n\n560\n00:27:48.597 --> 00:27:50.640\nMeaning, put the name in, hit enter.\n\n561\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.820\nOne name at a time listed down as we go.\n\n562\n00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.129\nThat's an important one cuz otherwise\nit doesn't read the values and\n\n563\n00:27:56.129 --> 00:27:56.980\nyou get an error.\n\n564\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.116\nThat's always something that's\nusually testable by the way.\n\n565\n00:28:00.116 --> 00:28:00.673\n&gt;&gt; The good to knows, okay.\n\n566\n00:28:00.673 --> 00:28:02.180\n&gt;&gt; The good to knows, right.\n\n567\n00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.744\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Adam.\n&gt;&gt; That's the code that we're using I\n\n568\n00:28:03.744 --> 00:28:04.770\nthink for that, right?\n\n569\n00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.000\nAll right, so if we wanna generate\nan AB query, what do we do here?\n\n570\n00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.540\nWell, you'll see we just have\na little find computer builder.\n\n571\n00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.940\nWe're gonna go in and say, hey,\nfind me this, find me that.\n\n572\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.672\nAnd then based on that, it'll put together\nthe language, right, whatever we choose.\n\n573\n00:28:15.672 --> 00:28:17.260\nSo we can do that.\n\n574\n00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.410\nWe can also skip AB verification\nif we choose to, right.\n\n575\n00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.640\nSo be up to us to decide whether or\nnot we wanna go look.\n\n576\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.410\nBut let's just say plabdc01 is\nthe other machine that we're gonna use.\n\n577\n00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.308\nI'm not gonna really install this on my\ndomain controller, but you get the idea.\n\n578\n00:28:33.308 --> 00:28:36.390\nI'm not gonna hit enter when I'm done\nat the final step of the wizard.\n\n579\n00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.340\nAnd go out and zap my domain\ncontroller and install Hyper-V on it.\n\n580\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.370\nBut I just want you to\nsee how we would do this.\n\n581\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.038\nNotice that when I put in a machine name,\n\n582\n00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:45.060\nyou'll see I do get\nthe ability to move forward.\n\n583\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.481\nIf I skip verification it's not gonna\nthrow an error if I don't have the right\n\n584\n00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:49.290\nname there.\n\n585\n00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.620\nJust so we can continue right?\n\n586\n00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.670\nAll right, now you'll see here, right.\n\n587\n00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.838\nNo computer discovered based on my input.\n\n588\n00:28:56.838 --> 00:28:57.721\nPlease verify.\n\n589\n00:28:57.721 --> 00:28:59.847\nAnd it's gonna say,\nhey that doesn't seem to make sense.\n\n590\n00:28:59.847 --> 00:29:02.740\nI don't think I have the right name for\nthe host.\n\n591\n00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.270\nSo let me just forget about that for\nthe moment.\n\n592\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.685\nNot a big deal,\njust wanted to show you here.\n\n593\n00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:10.453\nBut it would show us the discover\ncomputers because I didn't really put in\n\n594\n00:29:10.453 --> 00:29:12.235\nthe name of a machine that exists.\n\n595\n00:29:12.235 --> 00:29:15.271\nI'm just putting in the name of my domain\ncontroller that I thought it was named\n\n596\n00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.105\nthat, but it's obviously not named that.\n\n597\n00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:18.615\nI'll have to go back and\ntake a look real quick.\n\n598\n00:29:18.615 --> 00:29:20.600\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou know what I can do?\n\n599\n00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.905\nIt'll be just one second.\n\n600\n00:29:21.905 --> 00:29:25.730\nPlabdc01.practice labs.com.\n\n601\n00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.623\n&gt;&gt; But this is a really great\nlike a seriously valuable tool.\n\n602\n00:29:28.623 --> 00:29:29.679\nWhen you're trying to-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n603\n00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:30.704\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n604\n00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Organize based on certain\nrequirements like hardware.\n\n605\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.301\nBefore this tool was available you would\nhave to go around and actually survey and\n\n606\n00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:40.480\nperform all this information manually.\n\n607\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.020\nSo a pretty cool tool here, Adam.\n\n608\n00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.887\n&gt;&gt; Yep, let me just put in the full name\n\n609\n00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:48.720\nhere just to see if it will\nfind it the right way.\n\n610\n00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.733\nI think I just might have, nope I didn't.\n\n611\n00:29:50.733 --> 00:29:52.571\nOkay I'm not spelling it\ncorrectly probably, or\n\n612\n00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:53.980\nit's not named that one or the other.\n\n613\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.443\nBut anyway you got the idea,\nwill be target resources listed here.\n\n614\n00:29:57.443 --> 00:29:59.890\nSo I'd be able to go in and\nsay okay great.\n\n615\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.335\nAnd then the last one\nwill be host settings and\n\n616\n00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:02.790\njust be able to configure\nthe host settings.\n\n617\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:07.041\nAnd then it will actually go out and\nconfigure the host and run through and\n\n618\n00:30:07.041 --> 00:30:11.850\ninstall rather I should say Hyper-V and\nthen configure it and set it all up.\n\n619\n00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:15.735\nIf we did the same thing here,\nlet's just get out of here real quick.\n\n620\n00:30:15.735 --> 00:30:19.273\nAnd if we did this just to show you\nwhat it would look like if you went and\n\n621\n00:30:19.273 --> 00:30:21.240\nadded a VMware host you'll see here.\n\n622\n00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.464\nIf we go to do this,\n\n623\n00:30:22.464 --> 00:30:27.134\nthe first thing we have to do is we have\nto add a VMware vCenter, so we would\n\n624\n00:30:27.134 --> 00:30:32.050\nhave to use the other area up in the\nservers area here under infrastructure.\n\n625\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.550\nWe'd have to add in a vCenter\nserver right down here, right, and\n\n626\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.620\nhave the vCenter available\nbefore we can add the host in.\n\n627\n00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.425\nThat's what I wanted to show you.\n\n628\n00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:40.990\nSame thing with Zen.\n\n629\n00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.451\nWe'd have to have the infrastructure on\nthe vendor side that Microsoft's added in\n\n630\n00:30:45.451 --> 00:30:49.032\nfor management before I can add\nthe hosts here through discovery.\n\n631\n00:30:49.032 --> 00:30:52.397\nBecause it's not the same wizard that\nwe go out and we query the AD to find,\n\n632\n00:30:52.397 --> 00:30:54.045\nthose hosts are not gonna be there.\n\n633\n00:30:54.045 --> 00:30:58.224\nBut what is gonna happen is we'll\ngo out and we'll query vCenter or\n\n634\n00:30:58.224 --> 00:30:59.575\nZen will be queried.\n\n635\n00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:02.435\nAnd we'll then bring those hosts\nin based on knowledge of that.\n\n636\n00:31:02.435 --> 00:31:03.406\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n637\n00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:07.046\nAnd you have a sense that if you're\nlooking at cross platform support here and\n\n638\n00:31:07.046 --> 00:31:09.958\nyou wanna be able to go in and\ndo that, it would be important for\n\n639\n00:31:09.958 --> 00:31:12.465\nyou to know that that's gonna happen.\n\n640\n00:31:12.465 --> 00:31:13.885\nAll right, so we've done all this,\nright, we've got all this in.\n\n641\n00:31:13.885 --> 00:31:18.060\nThe other thing I just wanted to quickly\ngo through with you or at least show you\n\n642\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.491\nhere, let me just scroll down real quick,\nis I wanted to show you, we talked about\n\n643\n00:31:22.491 --> 00:31:26.310\nstorage, but we could go in, and\nI showed you we could add storage in.\n\n644\n00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.270\nAnd once we're gonna add the storage in I\njust wanted to show you how we would set\n\n645\n00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.180\nup, or at least walk you through the logic\nof configuring the private cloud.\n\n646\n00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.769\nSo we're gonna go in and we're gonna go to\nVMs and services here real quick now that\n\n647\n00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:40.770\nwe have our host groups and\nin theory would've added our hosts in.\n\n648\n00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.219\nI just wanna show you here,\nthat up under Cloud, right?\n\n649\n00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:46.620\nWe can right-click,\nyou see Create a Cloud.\n\n650\n00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.960\nWe can go up here, create a cloud,\nright, either way.\n\n651\n00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.200\nSo when we create a cloud,\nwe give it a name.\n\n652\n00:31:56.198 --> 00:31:59.143\nCall it ITProTV Cloud 1.\n\n653\n00:31:59.143 --> 00:32:02.770\nAnd you'll see here based on the resources\nlogical network load balancers,\n\n654\n00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.278\nI'm not gonna go all the way\nthrough the wizard here,\n\n655\n00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:08.789\nI just wanted to show you the logic of\nthis, that all the building blocks and\n\n656\n00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:12.860\nall the things we've talked about in other\nareas of the fabric are brought together.\n\n657\n00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.810\nAnd if you remember in one\nof our prior episodes,\n\n658\n00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.910\nI talked about the resources\nnecessary to build the cloud,\n\n659\n00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.880\nwe talked about all the different\nparts you would add in.\n\n660\n00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.250\nAnd I went through this list with you and\nsaid we need all these things,\n\n661\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.035\nthey were nine of them.\n\n662\n00:32:24.035 --> 00:32:28.310\nWe need the resources, the logical\nnetworks, potentially the load balancers,\n\n663\n00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.760\nthe VIP templates for virtual IPs.\n\n664\n00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.980\nWe need the port classifications,\nstorage to library capacity,\n\n665\n00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.080\nthe capability programs.\n\n666\n00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.070\nSo we need all those things.\n\n667\n00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.670\nSo we talked about all of them and\nwe identified what they were and said hey,\n\n668\n00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.710\nall nine of these things\nare the building blocks for\n\n669\n00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.240\nthe private cloud when we set it up.\n\n670\n00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.950\nI just wanted to show you\nhow that gets used and\n\n671\n00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.460\nwhat the wizard looks like\nto create the private cloud.\n\n672\n00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.060\nCuz once we've programmed in all that\nstuff through the use of the fabric and\n\n673\n00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.100\nin the case of the library\nbased resources, right,\n\n674\n00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.270\nhaving the library available\nas we install SCVMM.\n\n675\n00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:04.090\nWe may add out and scale out through\nadding additional library servers.\n\n676\n00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.430\nSo there may be some things\nwe do prior to getting here.\n\n677\n00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.080\nBut once all that stuff's built and\nready to go, we run the wizard.\n\n678\n00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.685\nWe essentially are just clicking\non the resources we wanna add.\n\n679\n00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:15.570\nBut what we're doing is we're\naggregating them together into\n\n680\n00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.980\nthis administrative unit called the Cloud.\n\n681\n00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.350\nAnd then we're using that Cloud and giving\nthe tenant or tenant's rights to that\n\n682\n00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:27.470\nCloud to have this bundle of resources\nallocated and managed in one area\n\n683\n00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.960\non their behalf so they can access them,\nand that's what the cloud represents.\n\n684\n00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.910\nSo this really closes the circle for us on\nall the things we've been talking about\n\n685\n00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.870\nbecause this is how we bring in the cloud\nby building it from all the constituent\n\n686\n00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.670\nparts or resources that we've been\ntalking about using and or configuring,\n\n687\n00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.930\nas we've been going through and\nlooking at the various layers of fabric.\n\n688\n00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.260\n&gt;&gt; Seems like we've covered a lot so\n\n689\n00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:51.660\nfar in this particular section but we're\nkind of just beginning our journey here,\n\n690\n00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.920\nso ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned for\nthat additional information.\n\n691\n00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.140\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n692\n00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.980\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n693\n00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.460\n&gt;&gt; Well just to be clear,\nbefore we sign out.\n\n694\n00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.360\nWe're actually done with talking about\nthis particular section in this private\n\n695\n00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.120\ncloud with SCVMM topic,\n\n696\n00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.350\nbut we are going to have other topics and\nother things we're going to come back and\n\n697\n00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:11.160\ntalk about, but we're going to be\ntalking about a lot of other stuff.\n\n698\n00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.510\nAnd we're also going to be\nbranching out a little further.\n\n699\n00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.380\nWe're going to take it\nout just from SCVMM,\n\n700\n00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.120\nwhich we've been focusing on\nin this group of episodes.\n\n701\n00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.250\nAnd we're gonna broaden our thought\nprocess out into system center ops\n\n702\n00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.990\nmanager, how we monitor and\noptimize the private cloud, so\n\n703\n00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.860\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n704\n00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.260\nWe're gonna take a look at service level\nmanager, how we actually are service\n\n705\n00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.780\nmanager, specifically, how we deal with\nservice capabilities and SLA's and\n\n706\n00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.990\nmetrics around cloud capabilities and\ncloud health.\n\n707\n00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:39.900\nAnd we're also gonna be talking about\nhigh availability, disaster recovery, and\n\n708\n00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.480\nWindows Azure.\n\n709\n00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.250\nSo we're gonna be talking about a lot\nof other topics, but no part six.\n\n710\n00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.350\n&gt;&gt; So we're not finished.\n\n711\n00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.715\n&gt;&gt; No part six,\nI just wanna make sure we know.\n\n712\n00:34:45.715 --> 00:34:46.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No part six on this.\n\n713\n00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All right, good.\n\n714\n00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you Adam so much,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n715\n00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.380\njoining us but we're gonna go ahead and\nsign out for real this time.\n\n716\n00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.107\nAnd remember I'm your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n717\n00:34:55.107 --> 00:34:55.745\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n718\n00:34:55.745 --> 00:34:57.481\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n719\n00:35:00.563 -->

and\n\n6\n00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.410\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.320\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.980\nIn this episode we're gonna introduce\nyou to the concept of well extending and\n\n9\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.480\nmaintaining that cloud infrastructure.\n\n10\n00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.060\nWith us today back in studios\nwe have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.549\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.521\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome,\ngood afternoon, good day,\n\n13\n00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:32.930\ngood morning wherever you\nare whatever you're doing.\n\n14\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.338\nHopefully we're gonna make\nit a better experience for\n\n15\n00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:38.492\nyou by talking about how to extend and\nmaintain cloud infrastructure.\n\n16\n00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:42.800\nOne of the most important things we can\ndo, after we plan the club deployment and\n\n17\n00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.855\narchitecture after we set up and\noptimize and configure our networking and\n\n18\n00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:51.164\nour fabric and we've been through how to\ndo all those things in prior episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:55.130\nis to then ensure the health and\nwell being of our infrastructure.\n\n20\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.290\nThrough the ability to be able to\ncontrol the deployment of servers.\n\n21\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.830\nWe'll talk about how to do that?\n\n22\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.560\nAlong with the patch management solution\nthat is necessary and has to be integrated\n\n23\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.250\nto ensure that long term,\nwe're keeping our operating systems and\n\n24\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.080\nunderly, the cloud on\nthe cloud infrastructure our\n\n25\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.740\nserver related operating systems\nhosting are virtual machines healthy?\n\n26\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.712\nWe're gonna do that by integrating\nthe WSUS functionality and also for\n\n27\n00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.220\nthe deployment piece I just mention\nthe integrating the WDS and\n\n28\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060\nPXE server boot functionality is\nthat we can actually leverage those\n\n29\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.361\ntechnologies that do exist and exist\nacross our stack in various places, but\n\n30\n00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:33.776\ntypically are centralized and deployed.\n\n31\n00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:36.077\nWe're gonna take those,\nleverage those, and\n\n32\n00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:39.310\nlink to some of the other components\nin the system center suites.\n\n33\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.520\nSpecifically SCCM System\nCenter Configuration Manager,\n\n34\n00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.880\nwhere those solutions already live and\nexist traditionally.\n\n35\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.520\nWe're gonna borrow them essentially and\nlatch on to them and\n\n36\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.115\nleverage them by connecting\nthem back into SCVMM.\n\n37\n00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:56.345\nIn order to achieve the end result\nof integrating WDS capabilities for\n\n38\n00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.905\ndeployment using our pixi sever to do so.\n\n39\n00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:01.795\nAnd being able to use\nthe WSUS functionality\n\n40\n00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:05.235\nWindows Software Update Services,\nto be able to do patch management.\n\n41\n00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:07.905\nNow, the interesting thing\nabout WSUS is that we\n\n42\n00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:11.585\nsplit this idea of how we do\npatch management with SCVMM.\n\n43\n00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.720\nWe use a WSUS server integrated into SC,\n\n44\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.480\nwe integrate the WSUS server I'm tripping\nover my tongue with all these acronyms.\n\n45\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.290\nWe integrate the WSUS server into SCVMM\nin order to be able to patch manage, but\n\n46\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.430\nspecifically patch manage our hosts.\n\n47\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.147\nThe virtual machines are actually\npatch managed through\n\n48\n00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:32.248\nthe System Center Configuration Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:35.806\nSo it's gonna be interesting to see that\nbecause remember we're gonna be able to\n\n50\n00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.560\nhave our infrastructure running.\n\n51\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680\nWe keep track of it traditionally.\n\n52\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.900\nAnd we manage it, but\n\n53\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.860\nwe split that management among different\nareas of the system center product line.\n\n54\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.940\nAnd so\nwe're gonna be able to patch manage, but\n\n55\n00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.600\nindividual components from\ndifferent places, cuz we do run\n\n56\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.340\na w server traditionally integrated into\nSCCM in order to be able to manage and\n\n57\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.950\ndeal with the aspects of patch management\nintegrated and associated there.\n\n58\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.100\nSo we're gonna see a little split on that\nand a thought process associated with it.\n\n59\n00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.090\nLet's go take a look just real quick\ncuz we're beginning our conversations.\n\n60\n00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870\nAnd let's see where we are in the console\nand what interesting stuff we have to\n\n61\n00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.728\ncontend with as we envision and kind of\nlook at ahead as to what we're gonna do?\n\n62\n00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:18.378\nWe're gonna come back to the library here\nin just a minute and have a word to say\n\n63\n00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:22.270\nabout profiles, and how we use them, but\nlet's start with our fabric area here.\n\n64\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.510\nIn our fabric and infrastructure,\nyou can see we're up\n\n65\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.570\ninside the infrastructure piece in\nthe server area, we've been here before,\n\n66\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.050\nyou will see that we have two\nservers that are of interest to us.\n\n67\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.045\nA PXE server and update server PXE\nrepresenting our pre-boot execution\n\n68\n00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:42.750\nenvironment or the ability to be able to\nhave a server that's concentrated on.\n\n69\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.410\nDoing what's commonly referred\nto us as network boot.\n\n70\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.370\nBooting a white box or\n\n71\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.270\nmachine that most likely does not\nhave an operating system install.\n\n72\n00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.970\nBooting it using a boot PROM or\n\n73\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.610\na little instruction set contain to the\nnetwork card that's capable of booting it.\n\n74\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.825\nAnd listening for\na boot response from a TFTP server.\n\n75\n00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:05.231\nThat will be our WDS server,\nWindows Deployment Server, and\n\n76\n00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:08.470\nthen or in outside of Windows,\noutside of Microsoft.\n\n77\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.150\nIt would be our Ghost server,\nour our Key Lab Server,\n\n78\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.050\nour any kind of imaging platform server,\nwhatever you use,\n\n79\n00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.080\nwhatever imaging solution is, but\nwe would boot to that over the network.\n\n80\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.782\nWe would not have an operating system\ninstalled on the host initially,\n\n81\n00:04:23.782 --> 00:04:27.061\nhence the concept of the white box or\nan empty bare metal shell.\n\n82\n00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:29.000\nYou hear of it referred to different ways.\n\n83\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.240\nAnd when we boot up, we look for\nthat server we can latch on to and\n\n84\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.540\nthen we run a win PE.\n\n85\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.310\nA Windows Preboot eXecution Environment,\nwhich lets us connect to the network,\n\n86\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.950\ninterrogate it interact\nwith the service provider.\n\n87\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.390\nIn this case our WDS server.\n\n88\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.150\nAnd as a result of that we're\nthen gonna be given an option to\n\n89\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.800\npull down an operating system.\n\n90\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.996\nMost likely preconfigured for hosting in\nthis case with Hyper-V low, enable these\n\n91\n00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:57.014\nbuilder we store on, enable the hyper view\nrow is part of that part appointment,\n\n92\n00:04:57.014 --> 00:05:00.705\nmost likely scripted out with an entry\nfolder that will help us to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:04.506\nAnd when we are done, and if all goes\nwell, we should have a host that\n\n94\n00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:08.560\nis installed with Server 12,\nServer 16, whatever the OS is.\n\n95\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.300\nAnd the Hyper-V role associated\nwith that installed.\n\n96\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.245\nAnd that host, or that server, will now\nbe configured as a host available for\n\n97\n00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:19.450\nus to then load up and run our virtual\nmachines with guest operating system's on.\n\n98\n00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.302\nSo, when we think about being able to use\nthe PXE boot functionality of the PXE\n\n99\n00:05:24.302 --> 00:05:27.959\nserver here, it's really to configure,\nand set up, and\n\n100\n00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:32.030\nmanage the integration of new\nhosts into our environment.\n\n101\n00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.930\nAnd this is something that Cherokee and I\nwere actually talking about before we got\n\n102\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.500\nstarted because we wanted to make sure\nthat we were clear and then, ultimately,\n\n103\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.950\nthat you were clear on the idea of\nwhat we can use PXE booting and\n\n104\n00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.150\nthe PXE servers for, and\nwhere do we focus that deployment?\n\n105\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.070\nAnd it's really on the host area whereas\nthe deployment of VMs as we were\n\n106\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.050\nchatting about right is typically done\nthrough a template of deployment.\n\n107\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.260\nWe have VMs that we can\ncreate used templates.\n\n108\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.032\nBefore we've talked about this before,\nthis part,\n\n109\n00:05:59.032 --> 00:06:01.100\nthe VM part once our host stood up.\n\n110\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.710\nWould be under VMs and\nservers traditionally, right?\n\n111\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.190\nWe can come in here, create a new\nvirtual machine, as you can see, and\n\n112\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.730\nwe can create that virtual machine\nusing a walk through wizard here,\n\n113\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.420\nan answer file we've pre-configured.\n\n114\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.640\nWe could deploy that.\n\n115\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.760\nBut we wouldn't traditionally do that\nthrough the PXE server environment,\n\n116\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.660\nrather we're gonna focus on the hosts and\nbe able to configure them.\n\n117\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.260\nSo just want to make sure we're clear\non the difference between the roles and\n\n118\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.522\nwhat we're doing and\nwhy they're important.\n\n119\n00:06:25.522 --> 00:06:28.678\nAnd when we talk about adding a PXE\nserver it's not really difficult,\n\n120\n00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:30.830\nwe just have a little\nscreen we go through here.\n\n121\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.162\nYou have to specify the computer name,\nspecify an existing run as account or\n\n122\n00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.184\ncreate a new one.\n\n123\n00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:38.957\nWe will go out and find that machine,\nthat PXE server, and\n\n124\n00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:42.380\nthen assuming it's available to\nus we have the right credential.\n\n125\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.626\nWe'd add it in here, and then we can\ngo through and configure and manage it.\n\n126\n00:06:45.626 --> 00:06:47.130\nAnd we're not gonna deal\nwith that right now.\n\n127\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.403\nWe have some walk through's we're gonna be\ndoing in upcoming episodes that'll help us\n\n128\n00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:51.786\nsee how all of this gets integrated.\n\n129\n00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:55.290\nJust wanna give you an overview a general\nidea of the technology explain a little\n\n130\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.570\nbit about each area.\n\n131\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.078\nHow the functionality works, and\ngive you a sense of the steps involved.\n\n132\n00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:03.964\nWe do have more precise, very specific\nwalkthrough steps buried in the show notes\n\n133\n00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:06.952\nfor all the different capabilities\nwe're talking about, and\n\n134\n00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:10.188\nyou can certainly see how those\nthings will be accomplished there.\n\n135\n00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:11.755\nAnd through the following walkthroughs or\n\n136\n00:07:11.755 --> 00:07:14.310\nthe upcoming walkthroughs rather\nthat we'll be engaging in.\n\n137\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.220\nThe regards to the update server\nintegrating the WSUS functionality add\n\n138\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.870\nan update server here, you'll see again\none screen was really not very involved.\n\n139\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.920\nThe back-end worked that goes\ninto the settings of header time,\n\n140\n00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.470\nis very involved if you listened\nwalk through that in depth.\n\n141\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.370\nWe do have to build out of WSUS server.\n\n142\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.480\nHave it available before we do this here.\n\n143\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.720\nHave it fully stood up configured and\nready.\n\n144\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.290\nAnd then you'd say we're able to bind\nto it and bring it in to manage it.\n\n145\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.300\nBut we do have to set\nthat up ahead of time.\n\n146\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.755\nWe'd have our computer name our TCP/IP\nport, again, a run as credentials and\n\n147\n00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:49.011\nspecify whether we're gonna use SSL to\ncommunicate with the WSUS server and\n\n148\n00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:49.826\nthe clients.\n\n149\n00:07:49.826 --> 00:07:52.318\nAnd that would be an option,\ntraditionally we would do that.\n\n150\n00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:55.180\nWe'd wanna encrypt that traffic and\nsecure it and protect it.\n\n151\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.099\nSo we would set that up here.\n\n152\n00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:01.407\nAnd then of course assuming we have WSUS\nsupport with SSL capable servers set up\n\n153\n00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:05.210\nalready, we would bind to it,\nadd it in, and it would be ready to go.\n\n154\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.440\nIt does tell us here,\n\n155\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.790\ninitial synchronization of building out\nthat catalog is gonna take a while.\n\n156\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.490\nWe're building an entirely separate\nWSUS synchronization catalog here,\n\n157\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.760\nseparate from the one that's\nalready on the SUS server.\n\n158\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.430\nSeparate from the one that may be in SECM\nthat we've already configured and built.\n\n159\n00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.870\nBecause we're pairing\nwith that WSUS server and\n\n160\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.460\ncreating a localized catalog\nthat we can then use.\n\n161\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.570\nSo, you do wanna keep in mind\nsynchronization initially\n\n162\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.360\ndepending on the number of operation\nsystems you're supporting,\n\n163\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.970\nthe number of language\nsets you're supporting.\n\n164\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.300\nWe haven't really talked up until this\npoint about single versus multi lingual\n\n165\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.470\nlanguage support, but if you have multiple\nclien`ts running different language sets.\n\n166\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.730\nAnd you need to load and sync those\nupdates with those language support packs\n\n167\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.880\nthat will add to the time\nit takes to synchronize.\n\n168\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.300\nSo, just wanna be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n169\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.250\nSo, it tell us that we have to be\npatient in other words, right?\n\n170\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.380\nAnd think through the logic of that.\n\n171\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.370\nNow, once we have our pixy server and\nour update servers installed.\n\n172\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.020\nThe other piece that will be important for\n\n173\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.920\nus to consider Is how are we actually\ngoing to run and deploy the host OS that\n\n174\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.150\nwe were talking about through the pixie\nserver, and what's that gonna look like?\n\n175\n00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.790\nIs it just gonna generically\nbe any OS we create?\n\n176\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.720\nIs there some sort of race we\ncreate a profile that helps us to\n\n177\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720\nknow what that is?\n\n178\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.030\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n179\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.890\nWe go into our library area,\nwe come to profiles.\n\n180\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.190\nWe can see them right here.\n\n181\n00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.930\nWe go to physical computer profiles,\nwhich is where we program in or\n\n182\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.290\ncreate the profiles by operating\nsystem that we wanna deploy.\n\n183\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.920\nSo maybe it's Server 12 are two or\nserver 160s or\n\n184\n00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.220\nwhatever that server-side OS going to\nbe that we want to run the host on.\n\n185\n00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.980\nAnd so, we're going to go in\nright click on this create\n\n186\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.570\na physical computer profile.\n\n187\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.490\nAgain, a little wizard little more\ninvolved as a few more screens associated\n\n188\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.280\nwith this than there is to\nbring in the server roles.\n\n189\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.150\nLet's just move this over so\nwe can see that while we're talking.\n\n190\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.240\nWe will give this a name.\n\n191\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.110\nSo let's call this ITProTV Host P1,\nfor profile 1.\n\n192\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.540\nIn the real world what\nwould I want to name this?\n\n193\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.670\nWindows Server 12 R2 Data Center.\n\n194\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.790\nWindows 16 Core, right?\n\n195\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.150\nCuz we'd wanna know what OS is\nassociated with this profile.\n\n196\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.760\nAnd we're gonna be doing that\nin one of the screens here\n\n197\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.470\nwhere we choose the OS configuration and\nOS image.\n\n198\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.030\nRight, so we're gonna just wanna\nmake sure we think about that.\n\n199\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.060\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Something else we might wanna\n\n200\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.640\nthink about Adam when we're\nusing this deployment method.\n\n201\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.630\nWe probably, well we definitely want\nto know the type of hardware so\n\n202\n00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.220\nlike you had mentioned before we can\nprestage and set those drivers and\n\n203\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.030\nwe're not just blindly pushing out these\noperating systems with incorrect drivers.\n\n204\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.620\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; We are definitely gonna wanna do\n\n205\n00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.250\nthat it's a great point\nthat you're making.\n\n206\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.830\nAnd we're gonna talk about just\nwhere that happens here in a minute,\n\n207\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.749\nthat's the third item down.\n\n208\n00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:42.440\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Hardware and configuration.\n\n209\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.410\nAnd the point Cherokee's making about hey\nif I wanna add either legacy drivers or\n\n210\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.890\nmaybe specialty drivers for\nlet's say a SCUZZY hard drive or\n\n211\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.900\na certain kind of network card you\nnever know what those things may be.\n\n212\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.290\nAnd by vendor and by specific need\nthere may be a need to add those.\n\n213\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.160\nWe'll take a look at how to\nadd them in just a minute and\n\n214\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.590\nwhere we would get them from.\n\n215\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.690\nWould be from the library cuz we wanna\nhave them available in pre stage.\n\n216\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.260\nSo we'd have them available as part\nof the resources in the library.\n\n217\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.530\nBut then,\nwe'd be able to pull them in here.\n\n218\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.270\nSo we're gonna take a look at how\nto do that here in just a second.\n\n219\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.860\nSo we would maybe tack onto the end of\nthis, right, something like win2012r2,\n\n220\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.990\nright, just so\nwe know what OS we're actually deploying.\n\n221\n00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.870\nAnd that would be a good idea for\nyou to think about.\n\n222\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.540\nNow notice you're under role, we have\nVM host into our Windows File Server.\n\n223\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.810\nSo we're creating two distinct types of\nprofiles depending on the thought process\n\n224\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.460\nbut we know cuz we're talking about this\nfrom the perspective of using this with\n\n225\n00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.430\nthe Pixie server functionality to provide\nthis profile and deploy VM hosts that we\n\n226\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.250\nwanna be able to use this to deploy a host\nthat's gonna host virtual machines, right?\n\n227\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.060\nSo we're gonna deploy a hyper v host,\na host that's capable of deploying VMs or\n\n228\n00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.130\nmanaging VMs.\n\n229\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.760\nSo we're gonna choose VM host.\n\n230\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.800\nClick Next, we have to specify the virtual\nhard disk file that's gonna be used here.\n\n231\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.730\nNow virtual hard drive file that we choose\nhere we're gonna choose one of the default\n\n232\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.650\njust blank hard drives that's available\nin SCVMM, it's already there.\n\n233\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.900\nWe haven't loaded up additional hard\ndrives that would have been configured\n\n234\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:12.200\nwith our OS already set up and\nhave the OS installed and configured.\n\n235\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.920\nSo you're not gonna see an option to say\nServer 12 R2 even though we named it that.\n\n236\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.040\nCuz I don't have one of\nthose hard drives loaded.\n\n237\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.160\nBut in the real world you would go\nahead and configure that system,\n\n238\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.450\nhave that VHD or VHDX available, and then\nthat's how you would actually be able to\n\n239\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.350\nbring in that guest operating\nsystem if you want to do that.\n\n240\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.830\nSo it says OS image here, right?\n\n241\n00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.580\nIt says the hard drive you must choose.\n\n242\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.960\nWill have an image of Windows server\nversion that can boot from VHT, for\n\n243\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.570\nexample 2008 or two, whatever it may be.\n\n244\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.940\nSo you're gonna support that\nthought process by loading up VHTs\n\n245\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.510\nthat are capable of booting,\nright, into that environment.\n\n246\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.820\nThe OS that will boot into\na virtual hard drive.\n\n247\n00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.870\nSo you know, Server 12 does this,\nServer 2008 does it,\n\n248\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.460\nServer 16 is capable of doing it.\n\n249\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.180\nWe're drawing the line for\nsaying earlier versions don't.\n\n250\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.490\nSo I just want to be aware of that.\n\n251\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.810\nSo we will go out and\nfind our VHD or VHDX file as I said.\n\n252\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.320\nSCVN has four VHD,\nVHDX hard drives loaded.\n\n253\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.070\nTwo of it's kind, two VHD older type.\n\n254\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.270\nTwo VHDX newer type.\n\n255\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.570\nOne is a base or blank distance large.\n\n256\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.690\nOne is a base or blank distance small.\n\n257\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.820\nAnd you could see the same category for\neach.\n\n258\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.080\nSo, we'll just choose in a blank\nsmall VH The X, it doesn't\n\n259\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.600\nmatter what I choose here, in the sense\nfor the demo, it's perfectly fine.\n\n260\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.360\nWe're really not going to do anything with\nit, but in the real world it does matter.\n\n261\n00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.690\nLet's just take a look.\n\n262\n00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.750\nI chose the small one, right,\nand so you'll see virtual hard,\n\n263\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.030\njust type dynamic, expanded size 16 gigs,\n\n264\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.220\ncurrent size 4 mgs, minimum partition\nside needed, size needed 16 gigs.\n\n265\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.300\nSo I chose small so it's very small.\n\n266\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.260\nPartition, only 16 gigs.\n\n267\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.900\nProbably not really a good idea for\n\n268\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.830\nmost modern OSs that we need\nof things we wanna do, right.\n\n269\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.930\nWe may want something that's a little\nbit bigger than that, right?\n\n270\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.500\nSo we may go in here, choose Large.\n\n271\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.580\nYou'll see Large is 60 gigs, little bit\nbigger, gives us a little more room.\n\n272\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.900\nNow these are the default template ones.\n\n273\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.150\nDo we have others that we\ncan provide ourselves?\n\n274\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.120\nAbsolutely.\nYou want one that's bigger.\n\n275\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.280\nI need a hundred gigs or,\nI don't know, whatever it may be,\n\n276\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.850\nwhatever you want, Then, just make\nsure you load up those hard drives and\n\n277\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.860\nput them in the library so we have\naccess to them and they're available.\n\n278\n00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.760\nAnd we can certainly do that as part\nof the resource management that we\n\n279\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.690\ndo elsewhere.\n\n280\n00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.200\nWe've talked about elsewhere\nin our discussions.\n\n281\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.590\nSo we have that capability here, right,\nso we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n282\n00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.660\nSo we'll just leave one chosen,\n\n283\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.970\nit doesn't really matter which one\nwe choose hardware configuration.\n\n284\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.230\nThis is the screen that Cherokee\nwas just asking about and\n\n285\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.940\nshe was reminding us that it's really\nimportant to pay attention to.\n\n286\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.250\nWe have our default configuration here.\n\n287\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.950\nNetwork adaptor, right,\nwe have our management nick,\n\n288\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.200\nour physical nick Connectivity, right,\nfor our consistent device names.\n\n289\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.500\nWe can specify what our\nnaming convention will be.\n\n290\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.070\nIP, excuse me,\nIP Configuration DHCP, and or\n\n291\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.420\nmaybe we'll use a static thought process.\n\n292\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.990\nWe have our disk here, so we have our\nMaster Boot Record, and our grid or\n\n293\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.680\nGPT partition table.\n\n294\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.840\nDepending whether they're gonna use old\ntraditional old school bios or EFI.\n\n295\n00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.790\nNewer, updated UEFI thought process for\nnewer bio support.\n\n296\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.130\nSo, we have options here.\n\n297\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.930\nRight, so we have to make sure\nthinking about the logic.\n\n298\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.390\nThere's our OS right there\nour primary partition.\n\n299\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.760\nPartition type ends CFS cuz\nremember this is all hard coded.\n\n300\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.770\nI can go in and say, I wanna use\na certain amount of space here.\n\n301\n00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.810\nAnd then we have our\ndriver filtering option\n\n302\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:33.450\nwhere we can specify how drivers\nwill be shown to us, right?\n\n303\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.569\nSo that we have the ability to be able to\nuse those drivers, either with a PNP ID,\n\n304\n00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:40.102\nevery driver has a unique plug and\nplay, PNP ID.\n\n305\n00:15:40.102 --> 00:15:44.534\nSo it's gonna have a unique alphanumeric\nstring that's gonna support it or\n\n306\n00:15:44.534 --> 00:15:48.219\nwe could filter drivers based on metadata,\nor matching tags.\n\n307\n00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:52.279\nSo if we have described certain\ndrivers when we add them in and say.\n\n308\n00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:56.920\nSCSI, SAS, SATA support or whatever it is,\nwe could use that and say hey,\n\n309\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.850\nI want to filter based on that.\n\n310\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.600\nAnd then we'd have to specify our tags.\n\n311\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.030\nWe'd have to have tags available.\n\n312\n00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.730\nNotice I don't have any, cuz I don't have\nany drivers with metadata in the system,\n\n313\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.100\nbut if I did,\nI'd have a list of tags here.\n\n314\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.260\nI could specify those as attributes\nI want to filter for and\n\n315\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.720\nthen just drivers that match\nthose requirements will show up.\n\n316\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.910\nSo I would be able to use drivers based\non a couple of different options here and\n\n317\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.390\nspecify which drivers will be available\nto me when I deploy the image.\n\n318\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.430\nSo part one of the conversation we were\nhaving was hey how do I add Drivers in.\n\n319\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.340\nI'm gonna show you,\ngo up there and click Add but\n\n320\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.110\nthen it's question what I see when\nI add them based on filtering?\n\n321\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.310\nSo, it's kind of a duality\nthought process here.\n\n322\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.970\nSo if we go Add, like physical network\nadapter, virtual network adapter,\n\n323\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.430\ndisk partition.\n\n324\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.700\nThis is where I'd add in the drivers or\n\n325\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.410\nthe adapters that support\nthe devices that I need.\n\n326\n00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.520\nSpecifically, remember in this case we're\nonly really looking at network adapters or\n\n327\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.420\nthe hard drive cuz that's all we're\npartitioning out thinking about using and\n\n328\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.380\nadding here.\n\n329\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.960\nIt's just the bare bones requirements\nto get this image compiled and stood up\n\n330\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.810\nas a profile so we can attach it and\nthen deploy it through the PIXI server.\n\n331\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.870\nSo that's why we don't see\na master list of video cards and\n\n332\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.370\nall sorts of crazy stuff here.\n\n333\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.710\nCuz that stuff comes later, it's not\npart of what we do right now, right?\n\n334\n00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and\n\n335\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.840\nsay if we want a physical network adapter.\n\n336\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.390\nWe can add another one in, and then we\ncould go ahead and program this in and\n\n337\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.760\nspecify connectivity and whatever we need.\n\n338\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.430\nIf we decide, hey what,\nwe don't wanna have that in there,\n\n339\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.490\njust remove it after all.\n\n340\n00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.718\nSo we could add those in based on what\nwe would be making choices about here.\n\n341\n00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:30.272\nThis is the part kind of the back part of\nthe conversation that Cherokee was asking\n\n342\n00:17:30.272 --> 00:17:32.266\nus to consider and\nmaking sure we focused on.\n\n343\n00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:33.930\nSo it's good that we see that.\n\n344\n00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.420\nWe can do that right here.\n\n345\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.380\nThen let's just say we did all that.\n\n346\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.680\nWe then have General Settings.\n\n347\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.210\nWe have our Domain, our Admin Password,\nwe have the Product Key so\n\n348\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.960\nits important license, we have our Time\nZone, we have an Answer File if we wanna\n\n349\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.690\ngo in and we want to specify some unique\nsettings or script out certain things.\n\n350\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.883\nWe have Gooey runs, run one's commands.\n\n351\n00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:56.465\nWe can specify those.\n\n352\n00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:59.410\nSo we have pretty robust\ncapabilities here,\n\n353\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.210\nwe'd have to specify what\ndomain we want to join, right?\n\n354\n00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.360\nSo we'd put in our domain there.\n\n355\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.120\nWe'd have to specify a Run As account,\nright?\n\n356\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.410\nSo we go in, specify a Run As account.\n\n357\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.480\nIf we wanna put in an admin password,\nwe can specify that here.\n\n358\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.363\nJust going through and\nprogramming in things as I go rather,\n\n359\n00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:24.860\nidentity information.\n\n360\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.976\nThis is where you put in, hey,\nthis is Adam from ITProTV or\n\n361\n00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:30.997\nCherokee from Company ABC.\n\n362\n00:18:30.997 --> 00:18:33.734\nJust so that we have that\nownership information, right?\n\n363\n00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:40.073\nSo we'll just do Adam and\nwe'll do ITPro TV, right?\n\n364\n00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:44.996\nAnd then our product key we'd obviously\nenter our license key here, our Time Zone,\n\n365\n00:18:44.996 --> 00:18:48.005\nspecify whatever Time Zone\nyou want to put in.\n\n366\n00:18:48.005 --> 00:18:51.265\nIf there's an answer file,\nyou go grab that it's a script, so\n\n367\n00:18:51.265 --> 00:18:53.455\nit's an unattend.xml file.\n\n368\n00:18:53.455 --> 00:18:56.425\nNow remember the old version\nwould have been in .txt.\n\n369\n00:18:56.425 --> 00:18:59.445\nBut we switched to xml in\nrecent versions of the OS.\n\n370\n00:18:59.445 --> 00:19:03.495\nSo now it's on a 10.xml so you would\nadd that in if you have that here.\n\n371\n00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:06.900\nAnd or if we have any commands\nwe want to add as a run once.\n\n372\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.110\nWe'd specify them.\n\n373\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.740\nImportant to note here that\nthey do get listed in order.\n\n374\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.360\nSo if we have three commands, we're\ngoing down the list, one, two, three.\n\n375\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.260\nSo if you wanna add a printer and\n\n376\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.630\nthen you wanna print a test page,\nlogic says add printer first.\n\n377\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.997\nPrint has page second, right?\n\n378\n00:19:21.997 --> 00:19:25.080\nSo just keep in mind that we do\npay attention to that order.\n\n379\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.000\nThat's why although it's grayed out, we do\nhave move up, move down buttons here so\n\n380\n00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.260\nwe can prioritize and\n\n381\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.700\nreorder them if necessary if they get\nadded incorrectly for some reason.\n\n382\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.170\nSo we go through all that,\n\n383\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.240\nthen Host settings specify the Virtual\nMachine placement paths on the Host.\n\n384\n00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.110\nWhere do we wanna be able to\nadd Virtual Machines in and\n\n385\n00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.210\nput them on the Host once\nHyper V is up and running.\n\n386\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.690\nAnd we can program in that\nparticular path if we need to.\n\n387\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.640\nAnd then when we're done\nwe hit essentially Next and\n\n388\n00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.290\nFinish and we get our profile, right?\n\n389\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.220\nSo we could do that.\n\n390\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.861\nJust get our little finish there.\n\n391\n00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:02.710\nGot that there,\nit is already done as a matter of fact.\n\n392\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.980\nAnd you can see there that\nwe now have our profile.\n\n393\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.670\nAnd so you can see we just essentially\ncan go in and right click and\n\n394\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.790\nhave properties or delete it there's\nreally not much to it after that.\n\n395\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.907\nWe just stack them up and\nthen we actually are able to use those and\n\n396\n00:20:14.907 --> 00:20:16.544\ndrive deployment based on that.\n\n397\n00:20:16.544 --> 00:20:21.151\nSo this is just a very high level\noverview of what we're doing in the SUVMM\n\n398\n00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:25.548\nproduct to be able to go in and\ncreate all these moving parts, right?\n\n399\n00:20:25.548 --> 00:20:29.183\nThat allow us to then be able\nto build the functionality for\n\n400\n00:20:29.183 --> 00:20:31.262\ndoing host-based deployment or\n\n401\n00:20:31.262 --> 00:20:35.954\nwhat we call bare metal deployment out\nto the host, bringing them online.\n\n402\n00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:37.147\nNow think about the logic of this.\n\n403\n00:20:37.147 --> 00:20:41.841\nHow often do you think Cherokee, its just\na general system where we are managing and\n\n404\n00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:42.589\nscaling up.\n\n405\n00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:45.903\nDo you think we're gonna add Hosts as\noften as we create Virtual Machines,\n\n406\n00:20:45.903 --> 00:20:49.374\ndo you think you want to create more\nvirtual machines than having the Add Host,\n\n407\n00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.056\nwhich one do you think would\nprobably take place more often,\n\n408\n00:20:52.056 --> 00:20:53.496\nl guess this is what l am asking?\n\n409\n00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:56.580\n&gt;&gt; Creating a virtual machine as\nwe have a voice that comes and go,\n\n410\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.180\nwe have different projects or\nservices we wanna set up.\n\n411\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.350\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna add, right?\n\n412\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.150\nTraditionally a lot more VMs based\non user need or customer need or\n\n413\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.912\ntenant need whatever you\nwanna single that as.\n\n414\n00:21:06.912 --> 00:21:07.460\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n415\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.490\n&gt;&gt; And, although do just stand up and\nstage servers we're not gonna do that very\n\n416\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.510\noften because once we stand up with a host\nwe may be able to throw 30-40 a hundred\n\n417\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.230\nand more VMs on that host\nfunny how big it is and\n\n418\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.370\nhow much resource capability it possesses\nbefore we have to add another one.\n\n419\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.280\nAnd we tend to front load activities like\nloading Hosts at the beginning of our\n\n420\n00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.160\ndeployment and are setting up in\nthe system cuz we, we'll batch load up and\n\n421\n00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.050\nbatch install a bunch,\nto spin up, initially.\n\n422\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.010\nNot suggesting that we don't add Hosts\nalong the way, as we grow, cuz we,\n\n423\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.500\ndepending on how big we are and how busy\nwe are, may do that on a regular basis.\n\n424\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.730\nBut what I'm suggesting is in small and\nmedium-size enterprises,\n\n425\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.590\nyou tend to add all those hosts or\nalmost all of them upfront.\n\n426\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.630\nAnd then not do a lot of\nthat normally very often.\n\n427\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.590\nYou're typically in here in other\nwords creating and managing VMs.\n\n428\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.590\nAlmost without exception,\na lot more than you would be adding hosts.\n\n429\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.350\nSo although this is an important skill,\nsomething we wanna think about,\n\n430\n00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.490\nwe're not gonna do that at very often\njust compared to the other stuff.\n\n431\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.240\nNow, are we gonna have to patch and\nmanage those hosts and\n\n432\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.290\nmaintain them fairly often?\n\n433\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.170\nYeah, probably given Microsoft's history\nin a monthly basis at least, almost for\n\n434\n00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.180\nthat exception every month,\n\n435\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.560\nit's very rare that we go past a month\nwhere we don't have some sort of update\n\n436\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.840\nthat needs to be applied to\na Server OS somewhere in some form.\n\n437\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.970\nI mean that's pretty standard.\n\n438\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.150\nSo we would get patches\ntypically on patch Tuesday.\n\n439\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.550\nWe would get those downloaded into WSUS.\n\n440\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.420\nWe'd obviously do our\ndue diligence hopefully.\n\n441\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.330\nWe would exercise our due care\nright important words and terms for\n\n442\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.880\nus as IT professionals.\n\n443\n00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.733\nWanna think about good oversight.\n\n444\n00:22:36.733 --> 00:22:40.552\nAre we checking those patches,\ndo they apply to us, are they patent,\n\n445\n00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:42.249\ndo we just believe the vendor?\n\n446\n00:22:42.249 --> 00:22:45.510\nDo we do our due diligence and\ncheck to make sure we need them?\n\n447\n00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.670\nAnd then do we care?\n\n448\n00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.360\nAre we exercising our viability testing,\nour backwards compatibility testing\n\n449\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.250\nto ensure the patch doesn't\nbreak existing functionality?\n\n450\n00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.770\nTo make sure we can deploy it\nsafely into our environment.\n\n451\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.950\nYou wanna think about those things.\n\n452\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.820\nSo, hopefully you're just\nnot gonna get a patch and\n\n453\n00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.760\nimmediately turn it right back around and\ndeploy it.\n\n454\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.530\nYou're gonna do a little testing to ensure\nit's not gonna screw everything up, right,\n\n455\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.650\nbefore we do that.\n\n456\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.720\nAnd then once you're pretty comfortable\nwith the fact the patch should do its job?\n\n457\n00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.560\nThere's no guarantee.\n\n458\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.580\nYou never know, right?\n\n459\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.252\nWe know that nine times out of 10,\n\n460\n00:23:14.252 --> 00:23:17.480\nmaybe even 10 times out of 10,, we'll\ndeploy the patch and everything's fine.\n\n461\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.085\nMicrosoft or whatever vendor it is, does\ntheir due care and due diligence exercise.\n\n462\n00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:24.315\nWhen they create the patches and\n\n463\n00:23:24.315 --> 00:23:28.365\ndo extensive testing to ensure that they\nare hopefully gonna work the right way.\n\n464\n00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:32.355\nBut, every so often one slips by and if\nyou don't catch it and you may not either.\n\n465\n00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:36.333\nIt may get into the wild, you may put it\nout there and two, three, four weeks,\n\n466\n00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:39.780\na day, a month, a year or\nlater who knows something may break.\n\n467\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.010\nSo you never know for sure.\n\n468\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.234\nBut almost to that exemption,\n\n469\n00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:45.420\nit's pretty safe that you can deploy\nthese patches once you test them.\n\n470\n00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.780\nAnd so you'll get them out there.\n\n471\n00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.370\nAnd then you gonna be doing that\nin a repetitious way because,\n\n472\n00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.990\nas I've said probably every month\nyou gonna have at least one or\n\n473\n00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.040\nmore patches that you may need to\ndeploy to these hosts and also to VMs,\n\n474\n00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.790\ndepending on what we're doing and\ntalking about.\n\n475\n00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.329\nSo keep in mind that this will\nbe something to consider.\n\n476\n00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:03.988\nAnd it is something that we're\ngonna have to spend time on.\n\n477\n00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:07.557\nAnd it's something that we're gonna have\nto obviously make sure we are thinking\n\n478\n00:24:07.557 --> 00:24:11.220\nabout and considering in our mind\nhow we're gonna do this, right?\n\n479\n00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.170\nThoughts, questions, observations,\nyou always got something you wanna add so?\n\n480\n00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Always, man, that's-\n&gt;&gt; Well usually, no pressure but\n\n481\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.550\nlot of the times you did.\n\n482\n00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.610\n&gt;&gt; I know and you have me in a loss for\nwords here which is pretty rare Adam.\n\n483\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.896\nI just, i know we have a lot to get\ninto here so I'm looking forward to\n\n484\n00:24:25.896 --> 00:24:29.310\nlot of demonstration because Adam\nyou're explaining a lot of these.\n\n485\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.948\nBut I really just can't\nwait to see it in action.\n\n486\n00:24:31.948 --> 00:24:34.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well that's good and that's fair.\n\n487\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.360\nJust the other thing to think about and\n\n488\n00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.700\nI'm just scrolling through\nthe catalog to show you.\n\n489\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.560\nCatalog, I'm sorry.\n\n490\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.720\nScrolling through the interface to show\nyou where the catalog will show up,\n\n491\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.760\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n492\n00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.350\nUp in the library.\nThis is where we wrap this up and\n\n493\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.010\nthen we'll go in.\n\n494\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.310\nWe'll start showing you how to put\nall this together and build it.\n\n495\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.010\nBut once in our library, I remember we\nwere just doing our profiles up above,\n\n496\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.880\nI was just getting\nthe console to scroll down.\n\n497\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.820\nIt was just taking a moment to do that.\n\n498\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.180\nIf you come right down\nhere to update catalog and\n\n499\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.970\nbaselines, when we open this up, I'm\ngoing to scroll down so you can see this.\n\n500\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.560\nWe don't have anything in right here now.\n\n501\n00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.340\nThese are blank as you see me clicking.\n\n502\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.870\nYou could see there's nothing there.\n\n503\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.610\nBut once we integrate\nthe WSUS functionality,\n\n504\n00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:14.060\nwe attach to that existing WSUS server,\nbring it in, do our initial sync.\n\n505\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.860\nOur baselines in our catalog will show up\nhere, and this is where we then manage\n\n506\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.789\nthe patch capabilities or the patch\ndeployment capabilities in the SCVMM side.\n\n507\n00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:25.415\nSo it is gonna give us that same\ninterface that same look and\n\n508\n00:25:25.415 --> 00:25:29.718\nfeel that would see in SCCM,\nSystem Center Config Manager via WSUS.\n\n509\n00:25:29.718 --> 00:25:31.779\nBut it's gonna exist here in the console.\n\n510\n00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:34.250\nAnd we're gonna be able to see it here,\nand interact with it here.\n\n511\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.190\nThis is the other piece that\nis part of that functionality.\n\n512\n00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.230\nSo, we're gonna come back and show you\nhow to start building all this out.\n\n513\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.430\nPlease do come back and join us.\n\n514\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.260\nIt should, hopefully, be a great set of\nwalk-throughs and a great opportunity for\n\n515\n00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.920\nyou to see a very important\npiece of how we build out and\n\n516\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.590\nmaintain our infrastructure to keep\neverything healthy in the cloud.\n\n517\n00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, thank you for\nproviding us that nice overview.\n\n518\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.590\nBut, like he said, we have more\ninformation headed your way so stay tuned,\n\n519\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.670\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n520\n00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.940\nTradition will go ahead and sign out,\nremember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n521\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n522\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.312\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here ITPRO.TV.\n\n523\n00:26:05.312 --> 00:26:10.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n524\n00:26:10.710 -->

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.370\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.335\nIn the previous episode, we got introduced\nto a lot of the concepts surrounding\n\n8\n00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:27.390\ntopics on how to maintain and how to build\nout our private cloud infrastructure.\n\n9\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.020\nBack with us today in studios,\nwe have Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.610\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.160\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome,\nalways glad to be here, glad to be back.\n\n12\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.242\nTalking about part two of how\nwe're going to extend and\n\n13\n00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:39.410\nconfigure our infrastructure.\n\n14\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.282\nSpecifically, we're focusing on\nthe health and maintenance of our Hyper-V\n\n15\n00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:48.705\nhost within that CVMM, how are we gonna\ndeal with being able to set up and\n\n16\n00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:53.020\ninteract with and ultimately integrate\ninto a CVMM, a W SAS server.\n\n17\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.993\nWe're gonna walk you through the process\nof how to do that in this and\n\n18\n00:00:55.993 --> 00:01:00.030\na couple of additional episodes so that we\ncan get the whole thing stood up for you.\n\n19\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.252\nAnd we're gonna show you how to then use\nWSUS to be able to do a configuration\n\n20\n00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:08.610\nbaseline, do a compliance scan to make\nsure we are going to have everything we\n\n21\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.630\nneed on the host.\n\n22\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.529\nAnd if we have an issue, then obviously,\nwe can re-mediate as necessary, so\n\n23\n00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.610\nwe're gonna walk through that process.\n\n24\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.790\nIt's an important process and one that\nsometimes we tend to take for granted.\n\n25\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.680\nWe have a WSUS server\nalready installed somewhere.\n\n26\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.090\nWe can probably just leverage that.\n\n27\n00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.367\nWell, the reality is we may be able to,\nif it's interacting and\n\n28\n00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:31.648\nconfigured through SCCM,\nSystems Center Config Manager, but\n\n29\n00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:36.796\nwe may wanna take control of it, bring\nit in, leverage that through SCVMM and\n\n30\n00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:41.022\nwe're gonna talk through the logic\nof why that may make sense.\n\n31\n00:01:41.022 --> 00:01:45.528\nAnd I've talked about this in a prior\nepisode in the sense of focusing in SCVMM\n\n32\n00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:47.885\nwith WSUS on patch managing our hosts and\n\n33\n00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.390\nall the infrastructure\nassociated with the hosts.\n\n34\n00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.870\nThe servers, in other words,\nthat are gonna provide the platform,\n\n35\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.150\nthe underlying capabilities\nto run our VMs.\n\n36\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.913\nAnd that SCCM, System Center Config\nManager, and WSUS integration there is\n\n37\n00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:06.455\nthe right place to deal with patch\nmanaging the guest operating systems or\n\n38\n00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:10.360\nthe VMs and running them through\nthat area makes a lot of sense.\n\n39\n00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.040\nAnd so, we see this split that we wanna\nbe thinking about and focusing on that.\n\n40\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.820\nThis will begin our conversations here\nbecause it is important to consider\n\n41\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.980\nthe fact that we're\ngonna have to set up and\n\n42\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.700\ninteract with WSUS in two distinct\nplaces to ensure complete coverage and\n\n43\n00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.520\ncomplete oversight with\nregards to patch management.\n\n44\n00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.110\nSo just some things to\nconsider as we get started.\n\n45\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.615\nAll right, what we've done just to\ngive you a heads up ahead of time.\n\n46\n00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:37.914\nJust to make this a little bit quicker and\nlet us get out of the gate as quick as\n\n47\n00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:41.275\npossible is I've done the initial\ninstallation of WSUS.\n\n48\n00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:44.135\nI'm gonna explain what I mean by\nthat if you'll join me here on\n\n49\n00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:45.992\nthe console as we get started.\n\n50\n00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:49.094\nI've just gone ahead on one\nof my two Hyper-V hosts and\n\n51\n00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:53.282\nin this set of demonstration I have\ntwo Hyper-V hosts set up and running.\n\n52\n00:02:53.282 --> 00:02:56.978\nI've got my system center virtual machine\nmanager already set up, configured and\n\n53\n00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:57.572\ninstalled.\n\n54\n00:02:57.572 --> 00:02:59.656\nWe've shown you how to do that and\nprior episodes.\n\n55\n00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:01.616\nWe're not going to walk\nback through that again.\n\n56\n00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:07.286\nI've joined my two hosts into the SCVM\nsolution, so I've added them in.\n\n57\n00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:09.125\nWe've talked about how to do that before,\n\n58\n00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.288\nand we do have some step by step nuisances\nfor you in the show notes about all\n\n59\n00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:16.396\nthe different things we're doing including\nhow you would add the host into SCVM.\n\n60\n00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:20.336\nI did that PowerShell, but you could do\nit through the console just as easily.\n\n61\n00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:23.070\nAnd I've gone ahead you can\nsee on the screen there.\n\n62\n00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.048\nAnd I've just gone ahead and\nasked power shell to install and\n\n63\n00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:32.050\ninitially stand up the WSUS instance on\nthe host that I'm going to run it on.\n\n64\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.960\nSo I've gone ahead and\njust done that through PowerShell.\n\n65\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.390\nYou could see the commands I used there.\n\n66\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.080\nAdd Windows feature, update services\nis the name of the feature.\n\n67\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.650\nUpdate services WIDDB for\nthe Windows update database.\n\n68\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.030\nUpdate services service\nupdates services RSAT.\n\n69\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.340\nPut in the remote administration tools and\nother included management tools.\n\n70\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.330\nHave that run successfully.\n\n71\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.860\nIt takes about five minutes to\nget that done behind the scenes.\n\n72\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.690\nWe just ran so\nthat's teed up and ready to go.\n\n73\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.870\nAnd then, what we do at that point, which\nis where I'm gonna jump in and start.\n\n74\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.882\nSo we go into our server manager, and we\nsee our little yellow caution flag there,\n\n75\n00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:11.896\nwhich says,hey, by the way, probably\na pending install, something going on,\n\n76\n00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:15.120\nsomething you may need to think\nabout managing and configuring.\n\n77\n00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.460\nAnd we can see that WSUS is\ninitially configured there.\n\n78\n00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.840\nWhat we're gonna do is ignore\nthis caution flag here.\n\n79\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.270\nI'm gonna show you what it says.\n\n80\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.885\nSays post deployment configuration,\nlaunch post installed task.\n\n81\n00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:29.670\nWe’re not gonna configure\nthat we use us from there.\n\n82\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.525\nWe are gonna configure\nto finish the install.\n\n83\n00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:35.570\nWe’re gonna do it going direct to the\ntools menu, and we're gonna pull down or\n\n84\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.268\npull up depending on your perspective,\nI suppose,\n\n85\n00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:40.930\nWindows server update services,\nit's below me.\n\n86\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.120\nCan we go full screen cuz you\ncan't really see what's there.\n\n87\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.750\nI'm kind of blocking it with my box there.\n\n88\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.335\nIt's so rude of me to put\nmyself on top of the screen and\n\n89\n00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:49.240\nnot let you see what's going on there.\n\n90\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.453\nSo, you could see W server\nupdates services or\n\n91\n00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:54.480\nWindows server updates service\ndown at the bottom in the list.\n\n92\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.580\nWe're gonna bring this up.\n\n93\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.540\nThis is gonna launch a two stage process\nand a little dialogue box that says hey,\n\n94\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.070\nwhere do you want to or\ncomplete WSUS installation.\n\n95\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.409\nWhere do you wanna create the local share,\n\n96\n00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.040\nthat we're gonna put all\nof our updates into?\n\n97\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.440\nWe're gonna put that or\nstand that up here in just a moment.\n\n98\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.130\nI'm gonna create a directory on\nthe D drive called updates or\n\n99\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.510\nany drive you want to put it on.\n\n100\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.550\nIt doesn't really matter where.\n\n101\n00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.320\nOnce we are done with that, it will\ntake a minute or two to finish that.\n\n102\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.964\nWe will then get the ability to be\nable to go ahead and click run.\n\n103\n00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:29.625\nAnd then we are going to be able to go in,\nand we will get the wizard that actually\n\n104\n00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:33.010\nlets us configure WSUS the first time,\nso that we answer all the steps and\n\n105\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.340\nstages and provide all the necessary\ndetails to stand the product up and\n\n106\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.920\nactually start working with it.\n\n107\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.610\nAnd then once we're done with all that,\nwe will set up and sync the catalog.\n\n108\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.420\nWe're gonna do a bunch of\nstuff in WSUS initially.\n\n109\n00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.850\nNow, one of the other things\nyou have to think about.\n\n110\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.658\nNow let me, just while I'm talking to you,\nlet me just get this part done so\n\n111\n00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:50.430\nwe can let this run while\nI'm talking to you.\n\n112\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.220\nSo you'll see here store updates locally.\n\n113\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.300\nWhere do we wanna put them?\n\n114\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.170\nThis was the first part\nI was talking about.\n\n115\n00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.900\nI'm just gonna go in and create\na directory on the D drive in this case.\n\n116\n00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.230\nBut again,\nyou can put it anywhere you'd like.\n\n117\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.044\nI'm gonna put it in as updates so\n\n118\n00:06:03.044 --> 00:06:06.390\njust an updates directory in\nthis case on the D drive.\n\n119\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.130\nWe'll click Run,\ngive that a moment or two.\n\n120\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.860\nIt takes about a minute or two to finish.\n\n121\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.226\nWhile we're waiting on that,\nkeep in mind that once we configure WSUS\n\n122\n00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:18.750\ninitially locally, we're not gonna\nmanage WSUS through the console.\n\n123\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.441\nOnce we configure it and\nconnect it up to SCVMM,\n\n124\n00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:26.250\nwe're gonna use SCVMM to create our\nbaselines, do our scans and remediation.\n\n125\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.283\nBecause that's where we're gonna have\nthe ability to be able to configure it so\n\n126\n00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:32.945\nthat it works with SCVMM.\n\n127\n00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:36.952\nSo, what you're gonna have to figure out\nhow to do and remember how to do is stay\n\n128\n00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:41.630\nout of the WSUS console once we configure\nWSUS which we're gonna do here initially.\n\n129\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.990\nAnd we sync it to SCVMM,\nwe're gonna manage it.\n\n130\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.200\nAnd this is, by the way, the same thing\nas SCCM, System Center Config Manager.\n\n131\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.112\nOnce we stand up, the WSUS server and\nlink it in through the,\n\n132\n00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:57.256\nin this case the server role in SCCM for\nthe server update point,\n\n133\n00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:00.631\nonce we do that, and\nthen we have it all configured,\n\n134\n00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:04.670\nwe don't go back to the WSUS console and\nmanage WSUS locally.\n\n135\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.420\nWe manage it through SCCM, through\nthe interaction in the SCCM console.\n\n136\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.620\nSo, on both products, on both sides with\nboth servers, we stay away from the local\n\n137\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.120\nconfiguration, and\nwe no longer manage the product locally.\n\n138\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.620\nIt's really important for\nyou to know that and to be aware that.\n\n139\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.080\nYou will break WSUS, you will screw it up.\n\n140\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.820\nLet me be unequivocal and clear.\n\n141\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.460\nIt will stop working the right way, and\nyou will not be able to use this product\n\n142\n00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.360\ncorrectly if you continue\nto manage it locally.\n\n143\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.620\nReally important to know that.\n\n144\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.419\nAll right, so we've got that set up\ninitially, our directory has been created\n\n145\n00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.840\nand we can just go here,\njust while we're doing this real quick.\n\n146\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.080\nLet's go to the D drive,\nwe could see it here.\n\n147\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.240\nYou could see updates, you could see\nupdate service packages, WSASS contents.\n\n148\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.756\nWe've got some stuff that's been\nconfigured in terms of directories that\n\n149\n00:07:47.756 --> 00:07:51.630\nare set up for us that we'll be able to\nleverage as we continue our configuration.\n\n150\n00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.259\nYou're gonna click Close.\n\n151\n00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:57.070\nWhen we click Close, this will launch\nthe WSUS Configuration Wizard.\n\n152\n00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.968\nFor part two of the configuration.\n\n153\n00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:00.498\nYou could see it right there.\n\n154\n00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:04.616\nAnd this is now gonna allow to go in,\ndoing our post-completion, or\n\n155\n00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:10.080\nour post-install completion tasks in\nstandup WSUS and configure it correctly.\n\n156\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.400\nSo let me just move this over here.\n\n157\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.700\nSo we can kinda see what's going on.\n\n158\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.500\nSo we got a fairly lengthy set of things,\nwe gotta go through here.\n\n159\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.520\nWe gonna move through them one at a time.\n\n160\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.230\nThey ask us some questions here before\nwe begin hey have you taken care of\n\n161\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.120\nthe firewall if you have it configured.\n\n162\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.723\nAre you allowing the firewall to\nbe programmed the right way or\n\n163\n00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:30.387\nhave you prepopulated rules\nthat would allow communication?\n\n164\n00:08:30.387 --> 00:08:31.629\nYou've gotta think about that.\n\n165\n00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:34.130\nCan this computer connect\nto an upstream server?\n\n166\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.010\nFor instance what I mean by\nthat in parentheses there\n\n167\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.670\nthey're really saying is hay do\nyou have an Internet access, or\n\n168\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.020\ndo you have an Internet connection port\non this server, and can you get out, and\n\n169\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.890\ncan you get to Microsoft to download\nthe updates to build the catalogue?\n\n170\n00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.730\nSo you gotta make sure you're aware of\nthat and that's what they're asking.\n\n171\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.480\nNow by the way, we don't necessarily\nneed to be able to do that.\n\n172\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.050\nWe can keep this server isolated.\n\n173\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.010\nWe can use an up stream server to\nDMZ to do the download for us.\n\n174\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.630\nBring those patches internally and\nsync them behind the firewall.\n\n175\n00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.500\nWe can upload patches locally into\nthe server without syncing it.\n\n176\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.185\nSo we do have options if you're familiar\nwith WSUS you may be familiar with some of\n\n177\n00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:14.070\nthe things I'm talking about and\nthe capabilities to do that.\n\n178\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.310\nThat's a little bit beyond just\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n179\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.320\nBut I just wanna give you the idea that,\nthis is not a hey you must connect to\n\n180\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.420\nMicrosoft to download or\nelse we can't configure screen.\n\n181\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.445\nThis is, just make sure you're\nthinking about it kinda screen,\n\n182\n00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:28.590\nto give you some prompts\nabout things you may,\n\n183\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.455\nin a standardized deployment\nmore often than not, wanna do.\n\n184\n00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:34.798\nAnd we're just giving you a heads up, that\nit's probably a good idea to make those\n\n185\n00:09:34.798 --> 00:09:37.462\nthings are done ahead of time to\navoid confusion and concern, but\n\n186\n00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:38.300\nnot a requirement.\n\n187\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.460\nWe can stand up WSUS with no Internet\ncapabilities and configure it, and\n\n188\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.010\nthen after the fact, do a sync, or\nwe can as I said, import those patches\n\n189\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.630\nthrough a different process where\nwe import them to the server and\n\n190\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.230\nset them up after they've been\ndownloaded somewhere else.\n\n191\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.650\nSo we do have capabilities that will\nextend beyond the discussion on this\n\n192\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.640\nscreen just so\nyou're comfortable with that.\n\n193\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.750\nAnd do you have your user credential for\nthe proxy if needed?\n\n194\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.260\nThat's what a lot of people\nforget in corporate environments.\n\n195\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.650\nWe very often, not all the time, but very\noften do tend to connect through one or\n\n196\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.870\nmore proxies to get to the outside world.\n\n197\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.760\nAnd as a result we may\nneed a credential and\n\n198\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.730\ncertainly an address and a capability to\nbe able to connect and authenticate there.\n\n199\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.860\nAnd if we don't have that we'll go\nto connect and try to download.\n\n200\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.720\nWe'll get an error and\nthat's gonna cause delays.\n\n201\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.230\nSo we're just Is ask\nyou to be thorough and\n\n202\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.550\nplan to be successful, are reminding\nyou of these facts on the screen.\n\n203\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.280\nBut their not show stoppers\nwith the exception of the proxy\n\n204\n00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.850\nwhich would be if you can connect through.\n\n205\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.700\nBut we're always gonna bypass that if\nnecessary, just keep that in mind.\n\n206\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.150\nI wanna click Next here.\n\n207\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.290\nThen, what you'll see is\nwe have essentially just a,\n\n208\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.570\ndo you wanna participate in one of\nour improvement program screens?\n\n209\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.640\nRemember, we talked about\nthe customer experience,\n\n210\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.270\nimprovement program a great deal.\n\n211\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.082\nThis is another one, I always remind\nyou as I have said in many of\n\n212\n00:10:53.082 --> 00:10:55.218\nthese screens when we get\nto this in the wizard.\n\n213\n00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:58.464\nIn the real world, so it's gonna data\nopt in, give Microsoft the benefit of\n\n214\n00:10:58.464 --> 00:11:01.270\nthe experiences you have to make\nproducts better for everybody.\n\n215\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.380\nBut if you decide you want to opt out,\njust uncheck the box, no big deal right.\n\n216\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.230\nSo we can do that if we want, we'll just\nuncheck it here in the demo environment.\n\n217\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.020\nThen are we synchronizing from\nMicrosoft Update as I said,\n\n218\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.930\nor synchronizing from somewhere else,\nmeaning an upstream server\n\n219\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.530\nin our environment that we control\nthat may sync directly to Microsoft.\n\n220\n00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.500\nWe can do that, it's up to us to decide,\nwe'd have to provide the port number and\n\n221\n00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.220\nof course the sever name\nto be able to do that.\n\n222\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.940\nIt would be up to us to figure\nout what it is we want to do and\n\n223\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.210\nhow we wanna configure it.\n\n224\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.680\n&gt;&gt; And that's because there's\nno auto syncing afterwards,\n\n225\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.560\nwe'd have to specifically\ncall that out here.\n\n226\n00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.781\n&gt;&gt; That there's no auto syncing\nafterwards, what do you mean?\n\n227\n00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.910\n&gt;&gt; Like it doesn't auto generate, yeah it\ndoesn't connect at any kind of specified,\n\n228\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.070\npredetermined interval to go ahead and\nsync up.\n\n229\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.470\n&gt;&gt; No, not the case, it does go out and\ndoes do that on a regular basis.\n\n230\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.050\nWSUS will typically,\ndepending on the schedule you provide,\n\n231\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.540\nyou will provide a schedule for that.\n\n232\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.780\nBut we usually will say,\nonce every 24 hours, once a week.\n\n233\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.380\nThere's different reasons why we may\ndo these at different intervals,\n\n234\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.830\nbut we will go out and we will sync up.\n\n235\n00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.910\nWhat we are doing here is saying whether\nor not we want to go directly to Microsoft\n\n236\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.260\nto the Windows Update sites that Microsoft\nmaintains to download patches essentially.\n\n237\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.590\nThe corporate, or not the corporate,\n\n238\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.210\nthe Microsoft standard update site where\nwe all get our patches from generically,\n\n239\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.550\nif we automatically download\nusing any desktop or server OS.\n\n240\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.890\nOr, in certain situations, especially\nwhen we're dealing with security and\n\n241\n00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.010\nconcerns about exposing\na server through the Internet\n\n242\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.315\nperhaps because we don't wanna do that for\na variety of reasons.\n\n243\n00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:36.765\nA lot of times we will place one of these\nservers configured to download directly\n\n244\n00:12:36.765 --> 00:12:41.525\nfrom Microsoft in a DMZ or\nin a VLAN somewhere, isolated,\n\n245\n00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:43.750\nperhaps, from the rest of\nthe production network.\n\n246\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.380\nUsing as a picket server,\n\n247\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.180\nessentially just stand alone on its own\nkind of server to bring in those update.\n\n248\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.990\nWe then will attach to that server\nthrough either a firewall or\n\n249\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.860\nthrough whatever configurations\nwe've specified that isolate it and\n\n250\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.970\nbring those updates in off that server.\n\n251\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.820\nThat in that case would be\nthe second option here,\n\n252\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.950\nwhich is our another Windows Server Update\nserver that's considered to be upstream.\n\n253\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.820\nMeaning we're gonna download there,\nlet the patches stay there.\n\n254\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.520\nThen we'll pull them in from that\nserver and it's like a two hop process.\n\n255\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.180\n&gt;&gt; They've been validated, they're\nhealthy, just having an extra layer there.\n\n256\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.310\n&gt;&gt; Essentially an extra layer\nto abstract and hide it.\n\n257\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.069\nYou can almost think of it like a NAT or\na proxy in the sense that it obscures us\n\n258\n00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:26.234\nfrom the outside world directly and\nprovides us a standalone or\n\n259\n00:13:26.234 --> 00:13:30.556\nstandoff capability to bring those patches\nin without exposing our primary server.\n\n260\n00:13:30.556 --> 00:13:35.093\nBecause remember we're linking this\nserver to SCVMM, potentially to SCCM and\n\n261\n00:13:35.093 --> 00:13:38.460\nwe don't want to necessarily\nput that in harm's way.\n\n262\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.268\nSo it gives us a cutout or an extra\nserver that we can put between us and\n\n263\n00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:42.118\nthe outside world.\n\n264\n00:13:42.118 --> 00:13:42.760\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n265\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.805\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're doing here.\n\n266\n00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:45.825\nWe'll make those choices, right?\n\n267\n00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.885\nWe have to decide what we wanna do.\n\n268\n00:13:48.885 --> 00:13:52.045\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to, at this point,\n\n269\n00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:54.135\nleave it as synchronized for\nMicrosoft Update.\n\n270\n00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:57.842\nWe're not setting up that multi-tiered\narchitecture we just described but\n\n271\n00:13:57.842 --> 00:14:00.282\nIf you did just to show you\nwhat the options would be.\n\n272\n00:14:00.282 --> 00:14:03.352\nSee this opens up pretty\neasy configuration here,\n\n273\n00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:06.357\nserver name, port number.\n\n274\n00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:08.442\nI'll use SSL for doing that.\n\n275\n00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:10.642\nWe have the option to opt in for SSL.\n\n276\n00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.572\nAnd then we can decide just\nhow to configure that.\n\n277\n00:14:13.572 --> 00:14:16.542\nWe'll leave that at synchronized for\nMicrosoft Update meeting.\n\n278\n00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:19.092\nWe're gonna go direct to the source and\n\n279\n00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:22.072\nnot download from a secondary machine\nthat's gotten it from the source.\n\n280\n00:14:22.072 --> 00:14:24.360\nSo that's what we're doing here.\n\n281\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.480\nWe do have the ability\nto specify a proxy here.\n\n282\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.770\nAgain, in the real world,\nyou very well may be using a proxy server.\n\n283\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.680\nIn our lab environment,\nwe do have a need to configure that.\n\n284\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.170\nSo we're just gonna set that up, so that\nway it feels a little bit more like it may\n\n285\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.180\nlook like in your corporate environment,\nso we're just gonna program this in.\n\n286\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.900\nKeep in mind that the settings\nhere are specific and\n\n287\n00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.640\nunique to every corporate instance.\n\n288\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.030\nMeaning no necessarily standardized\nconfiguration for the proxy.\n\n289\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.160\nEverybody's proxies are typically\ngonna be named something.\n\n290\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.060\nBut they may not all be called proxy.\n\n291\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.102\nAnd they may or may not operate on\nwhatever port we choose to use here.\n\n292\n00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:06.080\nOurs traditionally and\nin most cases, will be port 8080.\n\n293\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.260\nBut that's gonna be up to you to decide\nbased on how you configure your proxies.\n\n294\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.560\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n295\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.350\nI'm gonna put in the configuration.\n\n296\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.850\nInformation we need for\nour lab environment here.\n\n297\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.130\nSo that's how we're configuring ours,\nyou can see that.\n\n298\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.330\nIf we need a separate credential as we\ntalked about on the prior screens there we\n\n299\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.050\nwould simply provide it here.\n\n300\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.140\nJust check off the box, add it in,\nit's very straightforward.\n\n301\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.090\nAll right so we're gonna go ahead and\nview that, we'll click Next.\n\n302\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.850\nThen you'll see here\ndownload update information.\n\n303\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.930\nAnd connect essentially upstream to\nwhatever server we're gonna download from,\n\n304\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.250\nand start the connection and\nstart the sync.\n\n305\n00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.760\nSo we're gonna click that button.\n\n306\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.060\nThis is the moment of truth.\n\n307\n00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.780\nNow just to prepare you cuz\nI haven't dry ran this.\n\n308\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.036\nI don't know what the configuration or not\nthe configuration, rather the connection\n\n309\n00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:51.587\nwill be in the lab environments\nsince we're going through a proxy.\n\n310\n00:15:51.587 --> 00:15:55.310\nThere is sometimes a possibility that\nwhen you connect through a proxy,\n\n311\n00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.606\nthe first connection attempt or\nseveral attempts may fail and so\n\n312\n00:15:58.606 --> 00:16:01.902\nyou're establishing a connection,\ngetting all the way out and\n\n313\n00:16:01.902 --> 00:16:05.219\nback Before the timeout value on\nthe proxy cuts the connection.\n\n314\n00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:09.244\nSo, what I'm trying to say nicely is,\nif I click on this button in a minute, and\n\n315\n00:16:09.244 --> 00:16:11.648\nwe get a timeout error and\nit doesn't connect,\n\n316\n00:16:11.648 --> 00:16:13.770\nit's not because we have a problem.\n\n317\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.945\nIt's because we just may not be able to\npunch a hold through the proxy initially\n\n318\n00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:20.215\nwithin the time value allotted for\nestablishment of an active connection.\n\n319\n00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:23.195\nSo, just keep that in mind,\ndon't expect there to be a problem.\n\n320\n00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:26.105\nAnd in the real world,\nwe don't expect there would be one either.\n\n321\n00:16:26.105 --> 00:16:28.740\nBut every so often it can do that and\nin the real world,\n\n322\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.090\nwhile you're using a proxy\nthis can happen as well.\n\n323\n00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.770\nProxy may be too busy.\n\n324\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.160\nProxy may just not be\npaying any attention.\n\n325\n00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.929\nThere may be communication concerns.\n\n326\n00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:39.050\nThere's a lot of reasons why\nyou may get an error here.\n\n327\n00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.710\nSo, we're gonna let that run.\n\n328\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.990\nAnd we're gonna wait for\nthat to go out and do its business.\n\n329\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.480\nYou're gonna come back and\njoin us as soon as this is successful,\n\n330\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.988\nand we're gonna pick up right\nfrom here and continue on.\n\n331\n00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:52.760\nAs you could see,\nwe're about halfway through the wizard,\n\n332\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.720\nand we're gonna continue on as soon as\nwe've established our connection and\n\n333\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.510\nbegun our synchronization.\n\n334\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.574\n&gt;&gt; All right, so looks like with TV magic,\n\n335\n00:16:59.574 --> 00:17:03.473\nAdam was able to save your some time here\nand it looks like we're ready to go.\n\n336\n00:17:03.473 --> 00:17:04.816\n&gt;&gt; Yey, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, time saving, awesome.\n\n338\n00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:08.740\nAll right, so\nlet's get back to where we were.\n\n339\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.100\nYou could see our wizard's\nfinished doing the initial sync.\n\n340\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.100\nJust wanted to point out to you,\n\n341\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.350\nthings we're pulling down initially,\nfrom Microsoft.\n\n342\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.450\nYou could see them right\nhere they're listed.\n\n343\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.230\nThings like the available updates based\non, what kind of OS we're running?\n\n344\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.027\nIf we're running Server 12R2.\n\n345\n00:17:22.027 --> 00:17:23.870\nWe're not interested on the 2008 updates.\n\n346\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.040\nSo, we filter all that stuff out, and\nmake available the ones that make sense.\n\n347\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.400\nProducts that can be updated,\nare we running SQL Server, right,\n\n348\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.540\ndo we have Microsoft Office, we have to\nfigure out what those things look like.\n\n349\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.200\nAnd of course, our language selections.\n\n350\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.000\nWhat OS language have we installed in?\n\n351\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.690\nWe're gonna download\nthe appropriate updates in one or\n\n352\n00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.790\nmore multiple languages based\non the kind of support we need.\n\n353\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.297\nSo, all that stuff's being thought\nthrough, synced up, and configured, and\n\n354\n00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:54.490\ncommunicated back and forth between us and\nMicrosoft to profile this box.\n\n355\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.968\nAnd make available the appropriate choice\nduring that period that we were fast\n\n356\n00:17:57.968 --> 00:18:01.350\nforwarding through, so we didn't have\nto subject you to waiting for that.\n\n357\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.340\nIf you've done this in the real world,\n\n358\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.320\nyou certainly know it's not a two second\nprocess when I tell you about hours.\n\n359\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.940\nBut, depending on the nature of the box,\nand\n\n360\n00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.560\nwhere it's at from a patch level already.\n\n361\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.560\nKeeping in mind, if it's a brand new\ninstall, no security patches on there.\n\n362\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.690\nIt's gonna take a lot longer to\ndo this part of the process,\n\n363\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.740\nthen if that box already has\na bunch of patches on it, and\n\n364\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.610\nit's up to date we're just looking\nforward with whatever else may be there.\n\n365\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.070\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n366\n00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.160\nBut we've got all that stuff,\nso we're ready to go.\n\n367\n00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.080\nWe're gonna click Next here.\n\n368\n00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.340\nAnd then,\nwe're gonna specify what language or\n\n369\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.150\nlanguage sets we may wanna be able to\nbring down and work with, obviously,\n\n370\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.100\nmaking sure in our case,\nEnglish is selected here.\n\n371\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.127\nBut in the real world,\n\n372\n00:18:43.127 --> 00:18:46.751\nwe would have other language sets very\npossible that we would have installed and\n\n373\n00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:50.340\nbe running this in a different language,\ndepending where we are in the world.\n\n374\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.790\nYou would choose the appropriate\nlanguage for you.\n\n375\n00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.340\nThe one thing I always thought about,\nand I see this [LAUGH] and it's funny.\n\n376\n00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.067\nBecause you think about this, and you say\nto yourself, well how does that work?\n\n377\n00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:02.240\nAnd then you think, okay,\nno it must work this way.\n\n378\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.880\nAnd I know you have no idea\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n379\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.190\nI'm about to explain myself.\n\n380\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.960\nThis is my stream of consciousness\ncoming out before I explain.\n\n381\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.959\nBut what I was pointing out was, we think\nabout this and look at this and say, well,\n\n382\n00:19:11.959 --> 00:19:15.818\nI've installed in English, so clearly,\nall the information's in English.\n\n383\n00:19:15.818 --> 00:19:20.010\nAnd I could see everything in English,\nso if I choose Hungarian, or Greek, or\n\n384\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.040\nGerman, or whatever the language might be\nthere, it's all written in English, it's\n\n385\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.675\nnot Written in the language rather written\nout in the language that we're supporting.\n\n386\n00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:29.725\nCuz we wouldn't necessarily\nhave the ability to do that.\n\n387\n00:19:29.725 --> 00:19:33.205\nCuz our default install is English,\nyou may not have a language path for that.\n\n388\n00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:36.877\nAnd so, when you have it installed in\nyour local language, all that of course\n\n389\n00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:39.297\nit's translated into whatever language,\nyou're looking at it now.\n\n390\n00:19:39.297 --> 00:19:42.887\nSo, if you're running a system that's in\nGerman, all of the system are in German\n\n391\n00:19:42.887 --> 00:19:46.567\nincluding the entire language set to tell\nyou what other languages are available.\n\n392\n00:19:46.567 --> 00:19:48.627\nSo, it is localized to each language, and\n\n393\n00:19:48.627 --> 00:19:50.412\nthat's just something\nyou wanna be aware of.\n\n394\n00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:52.480\nWill be kinda cool if they\nput in a parenthesis and\n\n395\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.360\nhad it in each of the languages there,\nbut most people probably won't be able to\n\n396\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.150\nunderstand unless you spoke\nmultiple languages either way.\n\n397\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.980\nSo we always wanna check, make sure we\ndon't have any additional languages\n\n398\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.070\nselected, that way, we're not downloading\nadditional updates unless we need them.\n\n399\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.040\nSo you could see English\nis selected there.\n\n400\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.670\nThe good news is, we do default\nto the local install language and\n\n401\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.830\nmake that our primary choice, so the\nwizard is smart enough to pick that up and\n\n402\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.770\nfigure that out.\n\n403\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.580\nSo we're gonna say,\ndownload only updates for this language.\n\n404\n00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.600\nWe have English there.\n\n405\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.030\nWe'll go ahead and we'll choose that.\n\n406\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.990\nWe then have our product lists, so\nwe're gonna be able to go in, and\n\n407\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.750\nwe are going to be able to specify what\nproduct or products we may wanna choose.\n\n408\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.000\nIf we do all products,\nwe obviously are selecting everything.\n\n409\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.042\nIf we don't,\nthen we're able to go in and clear that,\n\n410\n00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:36.985\nand then decide what we\ndo want as a subset.\n\n411\n00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:40.205\nNow, one of the little shortcuts and\nsecrets here would be to do an all-product\n\n412\n00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:43.665\nselection, making sure\neverything is selected.\n\n413\n00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:47.305\nClear it, that wipes out any subselections\nthat may have been made that you're not\n\n414\n00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:50.795\nseeing, because they're buried three or\nfour layers down in the menu somewhere.\n\n415\n00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:53.695\nAnd there are some that are selected\nby default when you go in here.\n\n416\n00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:55.625\nSo, you may wanna do that.\n\n417\n00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:58.674\nThen after we've cleared that,\nwe can go in and\n\n418\n00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:03.260\npick up the products that we may want\nto choose to download updates for.\n\n419\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.448\nIn our example here,\njust gonna scroll down towards the bottom,\n\n420\n00:21:07.448 --> 00:21:11.558\nand you could see we have all,\nthis is going on all sorts of things\n\n421\n00:21:11.558 --> 00:21:16.280\nrelated to Microsoft products,\nlinks server, health vaults, right,\n\n422\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.030\nMicrosoft Streaming Site,\nOffice, Office Live.\n\n423\n00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.120\nOffice Communication Server,\ngoing all the way back to 2007,\n\n424\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.120\nas supposed to Lync,\nare now, Skype for Business.\n\n425\n00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.467\nSo, we have multiple versions\nof products going back,\n\n426\n00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:33.337\nin some cases to Office 2002 XP.\n\n427\n00:21:33.337 --> 00:21:34.703\nThat's a pretty old one, you can see.\n\n428\n00:21:34.703 --> 00:21:37.280\n&gt;&gt; I hope we're not still using it,\nbut who knows.\n\n429\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.780\n&gt;&gt; You never know,\nthat's the thing, right?\n\n430\n00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.150\nSo, we're just gonna go through.\n\n431\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.940\nWe have SQL Server there, of course,\nand all the different things,\n\n432\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.220\nSystem Center is there as well.\n\n433\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.820\nWe're looking for Windows, so\nwe're gonna scroll down looking for\n\n434\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.670\nthe operating system here.\n\n435\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.128\nWe've got right here, as you could see,\nWindows, Windows 10 and later,\n\n436\n00:21:55.128 --> 00:21:58.020\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, etc.\n\n437\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.210\nWe're gonna look for Windows 8.1.\n\n438\n00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.275\nJust check that off right there.\n\n439\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.540\nAnd then, that's gonna allow us to just\ndownload the updates for Windows 8.1.\n\n440\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.714\nSo that way, if we need those updates, if\nwe wanna use them, that may be the client\n\n441\n00:22:12.714 --> 00:22:16.030\nOS that we wanna be able to work with or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n442\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.210\nSo in our little demo, that's just what\nwe're gonna use but you get the idea,\n\n443\n00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.590\nwe could do anything here.\n\n444\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.800\nSo we'll select that, we'll click Next.\n\n445\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.620\nWe, then, have to specify what kind of\nclassifications for downloads we want to.\n\n446\n00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.340\nWe just want critical updates,\ndefinition updates, drivers.\n\n447\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.420\nDo we want all that stuff?\n\n448\n00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.910\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n449\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.250\nWhat it is that we want?\n\n450\n00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.260\nWe're gonna again just do this, clear\neverything and then just choose security\n\n451\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.350\nupdates, cuz that's really gonna\nbe what we wanna focus on.\n\n452\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.620\nWe're not gonna download anything else\njust for brevity and the sake of making\n\n453\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.210\na relatively quick solution here so\nwe get out of the game and get this going.\n\n454\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:53.154\nSo security updates, click Next then\nsynchronize manually and or in Cherokee,\n\n455\n00:22:53.154 --> 00:22:57.049\nthis is where we were talking earlier\nabout, hey, how often are we gonna sync?\n\n456\n00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:00.606\nLet say, we have the options specify this,\nset up the calendar,\n\n457\n00:23:00.606 --> 00:23:03.340\nessentially in a frequency and\nsee what we can do.\n\n458\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.620\nWe could set it to manual like you\nwere suggesting and just leave it.\n\n459\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.550\nSo, we, as the administrators\ndecide when to do it.\n\n460\n00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.450\nBut I also indicated,\n\n461\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.130\nwe could do this automatically,\nand specify a sync day and time.\n\n462\n00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.590\nEssentially number of times per day,\nand or what time we're gonna do.\n\n463\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.730\nBe up to us to decide\nhow we wanna do this.\n\n464\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.440\nWe're gonna set this to manual just cuz\nwe'll control it in the demo environment,\n\n465\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.030\njust to show you how it works.\n\n466\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.300\nWe'll click Next.\n\n467\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.550\nWe are finished here.\n\n468\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.790\nNotice we have the option to begin\nthe initial synchronization,\n\n469\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.870\nthat will let us say, hey, go out and\nstart downloading, again, from Microsoft,\n\n470\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.260\nbring down those updates.\n\n471\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.581\nBut if we choose not to do that,\nand we set it to manual,\n\n472\n00:23:39.581 --> 00:23:42.863\nas we did in the prior screen, then we\nwould be able to go in, in any point, and\n\n473\n00:23:42.863 --> 00:23:44.450\nsay, c reate that initial catalog.\n\n474\n00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.230\nBut we're gonna get that kicked off.\n\n475\n00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.830\nWe're gonna let that go now.\n\n476\n00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.240\nThis can take some time\nas it indicates here.\n\n477\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.986\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna let that go, do its thing.\n\n478\n00:23:52.986 --> 00:23:57.157\nWe'll finish up, and\nthen we'll kind of just minimize this, and\n\n479\n00:23:57.157 --> 00:23:58.500\nwe'll let this run.\n\n480\n00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.210\nSo let me just click Next here.\n\n481\n00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.434\nWe'll see we now have the ability\nto be able to see some next steps.\n\n482\n00:24:03.434 --> 00:24:05.670\nWe can decide what we want to with that.\n\n483\n00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.920\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Finish.\n\n484\n00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.050\nWe'll let that do its thing,\nthe WSUS server interface opens up.\n\n485\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.880\nThis is the console on the local machine.\n\n486\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.990\nJust move this over so you can see this.\n\n487\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.840\nNow, keep in mind, I did say, hey,\nremember we're gonna stay out of this\n\n488\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.350\nconsole once we get\nthe initial configuration done.\n\n489\n00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.670\nBut, initially, we do need to make\nsure that we are doing that here.\n\n490\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.410\nNow, we do need to work with this\nconsole initially to set up and\n\n491\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.740\nconfigure everything before\nwe integrate this into\n\n492\n00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.990\nSCVMM cuz we have not\nintegrated this into SCVMM yet.\n\n493\n00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.650\nWe haven't linked this by adding in\nthe WSUS server and then managing it.\n\n494\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.920\nSo, for now, we're still gonna be working\nhere and we're gonna go in and we're gonna\n\n495\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.610\ncheck on the status, the synchronization,\nand whatever else we need to do.\n\n496\n00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.760\nSo we're gonna open up our console,\nyou could see it here.\n\n497\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.010\nWe can go to synchronizations and\n\n498\n00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.390\nwe can see that we are in\nthe middle of synchronizing.\n\n499\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.760\nThere's our initial synchronization.\n\n500\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.080\nThat was the first one we did where we\nwent out, waited for it to come back,\n\n501\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.500\ngive us the initial catalog.\n\n502\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.170\nWe see the current one right\nnow where it says, NA running.\n\n503\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.460\nThat means that's the one we just kicked\noff as we finished up the wizard and\n\n504\n00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.460\nwe said, okay, go out and\nmanually synchronize,\n\n505\n00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.280\nspecifically pull down the Windows\n8.1 security updates for us.\n\n506\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.600\nAnd that's' running currently.\n\n507\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.920\nAnd that's gonna take\na little while to finish up.\n\n508\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.140\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna let that run.\n\n509\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.550\nWe obviously have to wait for\nthat to finish.\n\n510\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.450\nWe're not gonna be able to\ndo anything until it does.\n\n511\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.340\nWhen that's done, we'll then be\nable to move to the next step, or\n\n512\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.930\nwe'll see the details of\nthe results of the sync.\n\n513\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.330\nWe'll able to highlight this and\ndepending on the information we download,\n\n514\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.170\nthere'll be a little bit more with the new\none we're doing than the first one.\n\n515\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.960\nCuz we didn't really download any updates\nwe just built an initial list, but\n\n516\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.360\nwe have when it gets to basic\ninformation we'll see it succeeded.\n\n517\n00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.440\nAs you could see down\nhere at on the bottom,\n\n518\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.040\nwe'd be able to see\nthe information about new updates.\n\n519\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040\nRevised updates,\nexpired updates, whatever,\n\n520\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.340\nand we'll be able to see the updates\ncoming in and starting to populate.\n\n521\n00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.740\nSo we will be able to take a look at that,\nand we certainly will go in and\n\n522\n00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.890\nshow you that once we're done.\n\n523\n00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.760\nBut once we get done with that, we're then\ngonna focus on adding the update server,\n\n524\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.900\nthe WSUS server into The SCVMM console.\n\n525\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.090\nAnd that'll be the next set\nof steps we'll engage in.\n\n526\n00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.425\nBut that's gonna be in\nanother episode part two.\n\n527\n00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:11.623\nPart three.\n&gt;&gt; Part three, part four,\n\n528\n00:26:11.623 --> 00:26:12.496\nI don't know what part.\n\n529\n00:26:12.496 --> 00:26:14.250\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Gonna be another part whatever it is.\n\n530\n00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.340\nWe're gonna come back and do that for you\nin another episode in just a few minutes.\n\n531\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Adam.\n\n532\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.940\nLadies and gentlemen, stay tuned for\nwhatever part is up next.\n\n533\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.330\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nlook at that WSUS server installation.\n\n534\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.240\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and sign out for\nthis particular part, whatever part it is.\n\n535\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Part 2, look at that, right there.\n\n536\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Look at that, so\nremember I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n537\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n538\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.241\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n539\n00:26:40.617 --> 00:26:45.357\n[MUSIC]\n\n540\n00:26:45.357 --> 00:26:48.914\nThank you for watching

00:00:08.055\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.871\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.540\nSo here we are we just finished\nreally installing our WSUS server and\n\n8\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.160\nsetting up that initial synchronization,\nbut now we're gonna be integrating with\n\n9\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.520\nSCVMM and\nwho better to help us with that than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.159\nAdam Gordon in person\nhimself live in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.880\n&gt;&gt; Those glasses are on\na little too tight I think.\n\n12\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.530\nYou got to loosen those frames up.\n\n13\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.600\nAll right, so\nwe're going to get back to business and\n\n14\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.170\nCherokee's going to take a sedative so\nshe can calm down.\n\n15\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.220\nSo we're going to pick\nup where we left off.\n\n16\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.098\nIf you saw the prior episode you know\nwe were just about as Cherokee said.\n\n17\n00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:52.237\nWe were literally done, we're just waiting\non final synchronization from the catalog,\n\n18\n00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:55.568\ninitially, from the Windows Update\nservers at Microsoft to come down.\n\n19\n00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:57.501\nTo show us how many\nupdates were available.\n\n20\n00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.677\nWhat our options are that's finished,\nwe're gonna show you that real quick.\n\n21\n00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:04.306\nThen as soon as we're done, taking a look\nat that, switch over to the SCVMM host\n\n22\n00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:07.772\nwhich will be our other host, the one\nwe haven't been working on until now,\n\n23\n00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:10.070\nanother Hyper V host where\nwe're running SCVMM.\n\n24\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.575\nAnd we're gonna then go ahead and show you\nhow through SCVMM we start integrating\n\n25\n00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.565\nthe WSUS server by adding it in as\nan infrastructure role in the fabric.\n\n26\n00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.825\nWe'll bring that in, add the update server\nand then we'll start configuring and\n\n27\n00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:24.115\nmanaging it from there.\n\n28\n00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:25.715\nSo join me if you will in the console.\n\n29\n00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:28.660\nWe'll just see that our\nsynchronization was successful.\n\n30\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.270\nYou see I highlighted it right up there.\n\n31\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.440\nLast time you saw this in\nthe prior episode it was pending.\n\n32\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.910\nWe had no information there.\n\n33\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.150\nIt's been fully populated now.\n\n34\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.978\nYou'll see was a manual sink,\nit did succeed.\n\n35\n00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:40.778\n651 potential updates are available.\n\n36\n00:01:40.778 --> 00:01:42.700\nLet me scroll down so you could see that.\n\n37\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.610\nRight down here at the bottom.\n\n38\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.390\nExpired updates 28, meaning updates\nthat are no longer prevalent and or\n\n39\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.880\nnecessary would potentially be 28.\n\n40\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.830\nWe have 651 total that are available for\nus.\n\n41\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.072\nWe'll start making some\ndecisions about that as we go.\n\n42\n00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:00.216\nAll right, so we're gonna leave that\nalone for the moment, just minimize that.\n\n43\n00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:04.096\nLet's go ahead and\ngrab our other console, our other VM.\n\n44\n00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:06.241\nYou can see we have SCVMM up and running.\n\n45\n00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:08.060\nYou should be familiar\nwith this console by now.\n\n46\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.670\nYou've been seeing it quite a bit.\n\n47\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.050\nWe're in our infrastructure area\nin the fabric under servers.\n\n48\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.810\nWe have our update server\nhere as we talked about.\n\n49\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.490\nWe're gonna right click add update server.\n\n50\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.900\nI showed you this console window in\none of our prior explanations and\n\n51\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230\nrun throughs in episode one as we were\njust getting ready to do the overview.\n\n52\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.480\nGive you a sense of what we were\ngonna do and how we're gonna do that.\n\n53\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.540\nWe're gonna put our host name in here for\nthe machine that we are going to be\n\n54\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.828\ntargeting that has our,\nin this case our WSUS server on it.\n\n55\n00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:39.888\nSo that's gonna be our\nplab hyper v 02 host.\n\n56\n00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:47.390\nSo let's just type that in,\nhyperv02.practicelabs.com.\n\n57\n00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.170\nSo we're gonna put in our host name there,\nwhatever host it will be.\n\n58\n00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.290\nFor port we're gonna use port 8530.\n\n59\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.640\nThat is our default port for\nSUS server installed on server 12, 12 r2.\n\n60\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.334\nSo we're gonna be doing that,\nusing an existing runout account and,\n\n61\n00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:03.790\nor a new runout account.\n\n62\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.220\nWe're using an existing ones,\nwe're gonna browse.\n\n63\n00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.540\nAnd we're gonna go find the SCVMM\nadmin account, that has been set up,\n\n64\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.590\nthat we're gonna use our runout account.\n\n65\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.500\nSo let me go ahead and do this.\n\n66\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.840\nWe'll go out browse real quick,\n\n67\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.950\nwe'll see right at the top of\nthe list we have SCVMM admin.\n\n68\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.940\nNow keep in mind that account's not there\nby default, out of the box the three\n\n69\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.130\nrun as accounts that you've seen me use in\nother walk through just to extend that so\n\n70\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.160\nyou can see it.\n\n71\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.910\nThe NT authority system,\nlocal service network service accounts.\n\n72\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.860\nI've created that SCVMM admin account\nprior to starting a walk through with you\n\n73\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.940\nso we have it.\n\n74\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.870\nJust so full disclosure you\nknow where it's coming from,\n\n75\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.680\nwhy it's showing up out of the blue.\n\n76\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.110\nSo we have that there but notice its been\ngiven the user role of administrator.\n\n77\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.080\nWe talked about user\nroles in prior episodes.\n\n78\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.290\nIf you haven't seen that, maybe good for\nyou to go back, take a look,\n\n79\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.130\nand remind yourself of that.\n\n80\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.876\nBut remember we do have four user role\ntemplates we can delegate through and\n\n81\n00:03:53.876 --> 00:03:56.650\nthe fifth one that's\nassigned automatically.\n\n82\n00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.185\nThat one is signed automatically out of\nthe box is the admin role, and that's what\n\n83\n00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:04.570\nwe've assigned to this user account so\nthat it has a run as account, it has full\n\n84\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.925\nrights to SCVMM and can add in a server\nconfigured to do what we needed to do.\n\n85\n00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:10.575\nIf we need to create our runout account,\n\n86\n00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:12.435\nwe will always have the option to do so\nright here.\n\n87\n00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:16.565\nWe've pointed that out before\nthose runouts accounts\n\n88\n00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:18.652\nare found along with user roles.\n\n89\n00:04:18.652 --> 00:04:22.250\nThose runouts accounts and user roles\nthat could be used to delegate for\n\n90\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.430\nthem are found under settings there right?\n\n91\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.900\nAnd so we have all those different\noptions up under settings.\n\n92\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.072\nWe've talked about, I actually\ndemonstrated user roles for you.\n\n93\n00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:31.098\nNot runouts accounts, but\n\n94\n00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:33.602\nwe did talk about both and\nI showed you where you would create both.\n\n95\n00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:35.452\nBut we've talked about how\nto create them before, so\n\n96\n00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:36.778\njust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n97\n00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:39.931\nWe're gonna highlight that,\nwe're gonna go ahead and click okay.\n\n98\n00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.777\nPut that in there and then we have to\ndecide whether we're going to use SSL to\n\n99\n00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:46.050\ncommunicate as I've talked about before.\n\n100\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.950\nWe have to make a decision\nhere as to whether or\n\n101\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.280\nnot we are going to use SSL to\ncommunicate and we can if we want to.\n\n102\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.800\nPort 8531 would actually be the SSL port,\n8530 is the non secure port.\n\n103\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.300\nSo we just have to put\nthe appropriate port in there.\n\n104\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.940\nYou'll think port 80,\nport 443 on a standard web solution,\n\n105\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.810\nwe have these same exact\nthought process here.\n\n106\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.460\nBut it's questionable which\nport we choose to use.\n\n107\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.800\nSo if we choose to do that\nwe would check that off.\n\n108\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.170\nIf we don't, we wouldn't so\nwe'll go ahead.\n\n109\n00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.620\nAnd remember also view script we can\nalways see the PowerShell script for this.\n\n110\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.760\nWe'll click add.\n\n111\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.160\nJust give that a minute, we got our\njobs things going on right there.\n\n112\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.930\nNotice it's adding the update server.\n\n113\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.930\nIt's about 50% right now.\n\n114\n00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.800\nIt actually says,\nsync results exceeded in the back there.\n\n115\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.140\nYou may have seen that pop in.\n\n116\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.450\nSo it's starting\nthe communication process.\n\n117\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.410\nIt does take a little bit.\n\n118\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.190\nYou see it just jumps from 50 to about 78.\n\n119\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.310\nIt pauses there for about 30 seconds.\n\n120\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.830\nPerfectly normal by the way.\n\n121\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.430\nIt's just communicating going back and\nforth, doing some stuff.\n\n122\n00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.510\nAnd then you see it starts\nincrementally finishing up and\n\n123\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.700\nit's pretty quick at that point.\n\n124\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.420\nSo doesn't really require too much time,\nmaybe a minute at the most.\n\n125\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.660\nAnd you see it's completed.\n\n126\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.070\nSo it is pretty quick there.\n\n127\n00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.100\nLet's go ahead,\nwe'll close that job item out, and\n\n128\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.420\nyou could see there that we do\nnow have the server integrated.\n\n129\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.540\nIt is status responding, role has been\nspecified, WSUS version is there.\n\n130\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.180\nOur sync, successful.\n\n131\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.510\nLast sync recorded is there as well.\n\n132\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.210\nAnd so now we can see we that we\nhave integrated the update server.\n\n133\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.626\nAnd this is how we then are able to\nbring this in and to start managing it.\n\n134\n00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:22.534\nAnd once we've done that, what we're gonna\ndo now, because we do have a lot more left\n\n135\n00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:26.913\nto do, is we're gonna go ahead and\nperform a manual sync from WSUS with VMM.\n\n136\n00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:32.970\nRemember we did our sync down to WSUS, but\nVMM has no knowledge of what's on WSUS.\n\n137\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.430\nAll we did was add the WSUS server\n\n138\n00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.190\nas an infrastructure item\nthat can now be managed.\n\n139\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.410\nBut we said going forward,\nwe start integrating and\n\n140\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.680\nonce we integrate we start managing and\ninteracting through the SCVMM console.\n\n141\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.050\nSo now what we're gonna do\nis we have to go ahead and\n\n142\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.870\nstart using the SCVMM console to be able\nto interact here, and so what we're going\n\n143\n00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.680\nto do is on our update server right here,\nwe're going to be able to go in.\n\n144\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.780\nAnd we can either right click and\nyou'll see that we can go ahead and\n\n145\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.360\nsynchronize or you'll see right\nup here we can synchronize.\n\n146\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.280\nIt doesn't really matter where we go to\ndo it, but the point is we're going to\n\n147\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.610\ngo ahead and we're going to synchronize\nthis now bringing this information in.\n\n148\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.970\nSo that way once we have it available\nwe'll be able to build up that catalog and\n\n149\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.160\nthat information inside SCVMM and\nhave knowledge of it.\n\n150\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.660\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna synchronize.\n\n151\n00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.830\nWe'll click on that rather,\nkick that off is what I meant to say.\n\n152\n00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.950\nYou'll watch that you'll see it's gonna\ntake a little bit of time to go in and\n\n153\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.010\nsynchronize.\n\n154\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.270\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll wait for that to finish up.\n\n155\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.510\nThis will take, there we go,\nI was gonna say it wouldn't take too long,\n\n156\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.760\ntake about 30 seconds or so,\nthat's what I was gonna say.\n\n157\n00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360\nBut you can see it already finished up.\n\n158\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.830\nSo now that we're done let's just do that.\n\n159\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.600\nOkay, we've got that\nsynchronization result,\n\n160\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.910\nyou'll see has been set to succeeded.\n\n161\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.390\nAnd so now that we have that,\nwe can go in and we can take a look here.\n\n162\n00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.554\nAnd so let's just take a look.\n\n163\n00:07:52.554 --> 00:07:58.670\nWe can see down here that we have our\nsuccess, our status, our time stamp.\n\n164\n00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.469\nWe can go in we'll just right\nclick here for just one second.\n\n165\n00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:05.033\nLet's just go to properties real\nquick to show you something.\n\n166\n00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:08.783\nSo before we do anything else, if for\nany reason we have an error here, and\n\n167\n00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:12.790\nthis is sometimes gonna happen if you\ndon't configure the right port number.\n\n168\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.330\nIf you have an issue where maybe\ncommunication is suppose to be\n\n169\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.470\nat one port is not going at the right\nportal, right protocol is being used.\n\n170\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.100\nYou can go back in here,\nyou'll see you could specify and\n\n171\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.370\nsee what the properties are.\n\n172\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.650\nIf we have a proxy server issue,\nwe can go in, you can change that\n\n173\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.260\nif you have the wrong proxy information,\nbased on product configuration.\n\n174\n00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.650\nWe see our update classifications.\n\n175\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.110\nWe could add or remove them.\n\n176\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.860\nSo if we have to make a change, in other\nwords, this is what I'm getting at here.\n\n177\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.470\nLike this is what we're gonna\ngo to start to do those things.\n\n178\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.788\nWe can see the products here,\n\n179\n00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:43.670\nagain we can specify what\nproducts we wanna start grabbing.\n\n180\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.050\nWe can see languages here, right?\n\n181\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.690\nSo we can see all of this stuff and\n\n182\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.410\nthe information about how to manage,\nand to be able to interact.\n\n183\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.300\nSo when I say we are gonna start managing\nthe WSUS functionality through SCVM.\n\n184\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.390\nThis is what I'm talking about.\n\n185\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.950\nThis is where we're going to go to start\nto make changes, if we need to obviously.\n\n186\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.880\nNot always but if we do need to.\n\n187\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.750\nNow we did this and\nthe job was successful.\n\n188\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.490\nWe didn't really look at what happened.\n\n189\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.030\nSo let's just go back to the job item for\na minute.\n\n190\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.770\nRemember we talked about the fact\nwe have both running in history.\n\n191\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.900\nWe could see here under history,\nsynchronize update server.\n\n192\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.800\nWhat I wanted to show you was,\ncuz we haven't really looked at a job and\n\n193\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.400\nseen the properties of the job,\nwe just say, look it ran and\n\n194\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.480\nit's successful we just keep going to the\nnext thing every time we interact with it.\n\n195\n00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.535\nSometime it'll be worthwhile for\na minute to see what's in the job.\n\n196\n00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.320\nIf we go full screen, just so\n\n197\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.320\nwe can see that,\ncuz I'm hiding half the screen there.\n\n198\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.410\nThank you.\nAnd you'll see that we get information,\n\n199\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.430\nwe see we have a status completed.\n\n200\n00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.580\nWe see the result name.\n\n201\n00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.145\nWe see the information on the timestamp,\nthat's all pretty straightforward.\n\n202\n00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:41.485\nWe could see the details here.\n\n203\n00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:45.325\nWe could drill through,\nwe see changed tracking.\n\n204\n00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:48.865\nIt tells us if there was an issue and\nor what maybe be associated with it.\n\n205\n00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.225\nAnd as you see,\nas we do each one of these,\n\n206\n00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:53.720\nsome have more information\nin them than others.\n\n207\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.220\nYou could see this one\nunder change tracking for\n\n208\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.580\nadding the update server, this does have\na lot more information because it tells us\n\n209\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.860\nwhat was added under what conditions.\n\n210\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.950\nHow many potential new updates\nare available,what language sets right or\n\n211\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.954\navailable all that kind of stuff.\n\n212\n00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:09.810\nThere's a lot of information there-\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam,\n\n213\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.650\nwould this be our main source for our\nlogin information or would you suggest?\n\n214\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.700\n&gt;&gt; We have logs associated\nwith this separately.\n\n215\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.230\nThis is just a job, task, detail, for\nlack of a better way of describing it.\n\n216\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.390\nIt's just a historical\nrecord of the jobs that ran.\n\n217\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.557\nWe do have logs that are available\nseparately in the product folders and\n\n218\n00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:29.532\nwe can go look at them for\nmore detailed information if necessary.\n\n219\n00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:33.520\nBut in the console, this is where we're\ngonna go to see success or failure.\n\n220\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.334\nAnd our initial place to\nstart troubleshooting or\n\n221\n00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:38.240\ndiagnosing if there is an issue.\n\n222\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.430\nSo it is good to be aware of the fact that\nwe can drill in and find these things.\n\n223\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.250\nAll right, so we've done this.\n\n224\n00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.790\nNow what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n225\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.210\nwe're gonna go into the library space.\n\n226\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.110\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nstart to setup or at least build up and\n\n227\n00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.900\nlook at our baseline.\n\n228\n00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.720\nNow that we've done the sync, we can look\nat part two of the WSUS functionality.\n\n229\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.930\nWe've added the server.\n\n230\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.430\nNow we have to go in and\nsee what adding that server means, and\n\n231\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.670\nwhat resources are made available to us,\nwe'll go to library.\n\n232\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.720\nAnd I showed you this when\nwe did in episode one,\n\n233\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.320\nwe did the high level run through.\n\n234\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.830\nTalked about the pieces and\nthe moving parts and what we get in here.\n\n235\n00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.900\nLet me just clean this up, so\n\n236\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.200\nwe just don't have all this other\nstuff open in the meantime.\n\n237\n00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.720\nAnd we took a look at the fact that in\nlibrary at the bottom here under update\n\n238\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.560\ncatalogs and baselines.\n\n239\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.750\nThat we would then populate our\nbaselines just like in WSUS.\n\n240\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.040\nAnd you see them here.\n\n241\n00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.310\nOur sample baseline for critical and\nsecurity updates is now there.\n\n242\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.390\nWhere before we didn't have one, because\nwe hadn't integrated to WSUS server.\n\n243\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.740\nAnd underneath our update catalog, let's\njust open this up so you can see this.\n\n244\n00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.840\nYou'll see that we do have\na list of our updates.\n\n245\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.140\nThey're 679 of them.\n\n246\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.956\nNow remember we did not download 679\nupdates when we did the initial sync,\n\n247\n00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:54.033\nwhat we did is we downloaded centrally the\nheaders if you want to think it this way.\n\n248\n00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:57.819\nIf you're familiar with an email where\nwe preview the message header versus\n\n249\n00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:59.545\ndownloading the entire message.\n\n250\n00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:04.203\nWe just downloaded the metadata descriptor\nfrom the XML Master list at Microsoft's\n\n251\n00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:07.484\nupdate servers,\nabout every update that was ticked off and\n\n252\n00:12:07.484 --> 00:12:12.155\nflagged as being appropriate, based on\nour choices, as we configured WSUS.\n\n253\n00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:15.087\nAnd we've got that metadata\ninformation sitting here, but\n\n254\n00:12:15.087 --> 00:12:17.165\nit's a very small amount of information.\n\n255\n00:12:17.165 --> 00:12:21.535\nWe didn't download the gigabytes,\npotentially terabytes, who knows how much.\n\n256\n00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:24.836\nBut we didn't download all that stuff,\nwe would have to go out and\n\n257\n00:12:24.836 --> 00:12:28.990\nget those updates to actually use them\nif we're gonna start deploying them.\n\n258\n00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.380\nWe're just looking at the high level\ndescriptors that tell us what they are to\n\n259\n00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.080\ngive us an indication of whether or\nnot these are gonna be important.\n\n260\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.800\nSo that sync was really quick, because\nwe didn't download almost 700 updates.\n\n261\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.790\nWe downloaded 700 descriptive\nitems about updates,\n\n262\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.680\nwhich comes down much,\nmuch quicker, just to be clear.\n\n263\n00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.580\nBut anyone of these updates you can see as\nwe highlight them, we are able to look at\n\n264\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.645\nthe MSRC number, so the master update\nnumber in the catalog, the title,\n\n265\n00:12:55.645 --> 00:13:00.495\nclassification, KB article reference,\nrelease date, all that information.\n\n266\n00:13:00.495 --> 00:13:04.045\nSo as we click and drill down,\nyou could see more detail here.\n\n267\n00:13:04.045 --> 00:13:08.140\nWe have a descriptor, we do have\ninformation this update whichever\n\n268\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.090\none it is, this is from October 2013,\nwe do have a reference to it.\n\n269\n00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.720\nWe could see the URL here, where we can\ngo out to Microsoft and actually find\n\n270\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.420\ninformation in the KB, in the techno\nknowledge base about this update.\n\n271\n00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.180\nWe could see real information about it,\ndoes it require a restart?\n\n272\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.370\nAny kind of information\nwhat product is related to.\n\n273\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.888\nWhat updates will supersede,\nupdates superseding this update,\n\n274\n00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:36.480\nthat kind of thing, we have\nthe dependency chain information etc.\n\n275\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.730\nWhat language support, if any is\nrestricted will be listed here, so\n\n276\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.465\nwe know what language is supported for\nthis update.\n\n277\n00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:43.535\nWe see all this stuff.\n\n278\n00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:47.045\nSo we can profile and\nlook at every one of these updates.\n\n279\n00:13:47.045 --> 00:13:51.295\nAnd we can see all,\nin this case our security updates.\n\n280\n00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:53.215\nAll 679 are related to security.\n\n281\n00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:55.180\nIf you remember, I made two choices.\n\n282\n00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.100\nWindows update specifically\nhas said category 8.1 or\n\n283\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.224\nclassification right OS category 8.1.\n\n284\n00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:05.250\nAnd then I went ahead and\nsaid yes, security update.\n\n285\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.310\nSo it makes sense that\nevery update that came down\n\n286\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.870\nis classified as a security update.\n\n287\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.120\nIf I had done critical updates or other\nthings that have different categories here\n\n288\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.890\nunderneath update catalog, and I would see\nthem broken out and filtered, essentially,\n\n289\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.560\nso I could break them out and say, look,\nout of 1000 updates, 300 are critical and\n\n290\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.970\n600 are security, and whatever.\n\n291\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.060\nWe'd have all that different stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.580\nSo we could see all of that.\n\n293\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.350\nBut we also have our update baselines,\nour sample baseline for critical updates,\n\n294\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.030\nnotice updates, zero.\n\n295\n00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.144\nThere are no updates attached to that,\ncuz we didn't download any critical ones,\n\n296\n00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:40.580\nwe only did security ones and\nsample baseline for security updates.\n\n297\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.895\nAll 679 updates are attached\nto that baseline right now,\n\n298\n00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:47.280\nbecause potentially they're\nall part of that baseline.\n\n299\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.890\nWe may have to go in and further\nsubdivide that, figure that out, but\n\n300\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.460\nfor now they are there.\n\n301\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.320\nWhat we're going to do is create our own\nbaseline, cuz we have the two sample ones.\n\n302\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.410\nThose are important.\n\n303\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.170\nMicrosoft provides those, but\nlike anything else that we do\n\n304\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.140\nwe may start with those but we may want\nto have a one size fit one solution,\n\n305\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.890\nessentially customize so\nwe're going to do that on our own.\n\n306\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.800\nSo we're going to go ahead.\n\n307\n00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.160\nUpdate baseline, you'll see we could\nsynchronize the server if need be.\n\n308\n00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.680\nBut we could also create the baseline.\n\n309\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.030\nWe're gonna create a brand new baseline.\n\n310\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.660\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n311\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.470\nWe have a little wizard here.\n\n312\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.010\nNow I love the fact that somebody at\nMicrosoft said, hey, you know what?\n\n313\n00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.580\nThe minute we bring up the wizard, let's\nput a big red rectangle on the window\n\n314\n00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.220\nthere to indicate to somebody who's not\npay attention if they made a mistake.\n\n315\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.510\n&gt;&gt; Where I should type that information.\n\n316\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.670\n&gt;&gt; Before they even start.\n\n317\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.230\nWhat that really indicates is simply, hey,\nit's required, right, but nothing more.\n\n318\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.728\nAgain poor choice of color given\nthe fact that reading only indicates\n\n319\n00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:37.700\nan error, right?\n\n320\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.880\nBut there's no error there\nwe have put it in yet.\n\n321\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.057\nSo what we're gonna do, is we're gonna go\nahead where to put in some information.\n\n322\n00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:49.620\nSo we'll type in here I'm going\nto call this our baseline,\n\n323\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:55.640\nso let's just do ITPRO.TV\nbase 100 baseline.\n\n324\n00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.825\nYou would obviously come up with whatever\nyou wanna call that description.\n\n325\n00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:03.064\nYou can put whatever you would like there,\n\n326\n00:16:03.064 --> 00:16:07.201\nI'll just put in first update baseline.\n\n327\n00:16:07.201 --> 00:16:09.374\nIf I could spell correctly, there we go.\n\n328\n00:16:09.374 --> 00:16:12.943\n&gt;&gt; Adam, what kind of information would\nbe what kind of prerequisites, or\n\n329\n00:16:12.943 --> 00:16:16.347\nI guess central components are we\nlooking for with these baselines?\n\n330\n00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:20.532\nAre we talking any kind of malware,\nor are we talking update versions,\n\n331\n00:16:20.532 --> 00:16:24.744\nbeing sure we have all those security\nsettings that we've specified?\n\n332\n00:16:24.744 --> 00:16:27.196\nAnd if you get behind on\nthese particular updates,\n\n333\n00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:29.886\nthen you're gonna be put\ninto that remediation group?\n\n334\n00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:34.382\n&gt;&gt; So if you get behind, you're gonna be\nput into a remediation group based on\n\n335\n00:16:34.382 --> 00:16:35.916\na compliance scan, absolutely correct.\n\n336\n00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:36.762\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's what we're setting right here?\n\n337\n00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:39.535\n&gt;&gt; Correct, what we're setting\nthe baseline that will be used to derive\n\n338\n00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:40.757\nthe compliance scan, right.\n\n339\n00:16:40.757 --> 00:16:41.464\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So in other words-.\n\n340\n00:16:41.464 --> 00:16:41.988\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n341\n00:16:41.988 --> 00:16:45.216\n&gt;&gt; What we're building will be that\nbaseline that we'll scan the systems\n\n342\n00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:46.999\nagainst and say you are not compliant.\n\n343\n00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:48.459\nAnd then you if you are, great.\n\n344\n00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:51.310\nNo big deal we'll just send to\nsee you when I can again but\n\n345\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.344\nif you're not,\nthen that's one remediation would become\n\n346\n00:16:54.344 --> 00:16:56.661\nan option we would have\nto then with me today.\n\n347\n00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:01.216\nEssentially means we would apply\nthe missing baseline patches or\n\n348\n00:17:01.216 --> 00:17:06.859\nwhatever are in the baseline that we can\nand don't find, not apply everything.\n\n349\n00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.781\nOnly apply the deltas,\n\n350\n00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:10.649\nthe ones that are not there based on\nwhat the baseline says they should be.\n\n351\n00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:13.052\nAnd that's what we ultimately\nwind up doing through mediation.\n\n352\n00:17:13.052 --> 00:17:14.396\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n353\n00:17:14.396 --> 00:17:17.613\nAll right, so on the updates page here\nas you can see, we're gonna click ad so\n\n354\n00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:20.488\nto Cherokee's point this is where\nwe're gonna start cherry picking\n\n355\n00:17:20.488 --> 00:17:22.539\nwhich updates we want to\nput into this baseline.\n\n356\n00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:27.000\nSo we scan and we create our\nremediation thought process about hey\n\n357\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.580\nif you don't have these,\nthen we got to apply them.\n\n358\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.700\nThis is where we decide\nwhich ones get applied,\n\n359\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.982\nwhich ones being which\nupdates get applied right?\n\n360\n00:17:34.982 --> 00:17:38.273\nSo we're going to click add here, and\nyou'll notice the column headers just\n\n361\n00:17:38.273 --> 00:17:40.207\nbefore we do this and\nstart dropping them in.\n\n362\n00:17:40.207 --> 00:17:43.226\nTitle, MSRC number,\nthat's unique identifier number.\n\n363\n00:17:43.226 --> 00:17:47.100\nI just pointed out to you it tracks every\nupdate in the master catalogue from\n\n364\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.788\nMicrosoft.\n\n365\n00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:50.505\nArticle ID, that's the KB article number.\n\n366\n00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:53.690\nYou could provide,\nrather we do provide in the metadata,\n\n367\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:58.046\nthe header, all this information but\nwe could search by any one of these items.\n\n368\n00:17:58.046 --> 00:18:01.434\nIf we knew them and just dropped them in,\nor we could click add and go find them.\n\n369\n00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:03.134\nIt's up to us to decide\nhow we wanna do this.\n\n370\n00:18:03.134 --> 00:18:05.423\nSo we're gonna click Add.\n\n371\n00:18:05.423 --> 00:18:09.722\nWhen we do that, you'll notice we have\nessentially every update that we've made\n\n372\n00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.607\navailable here all 679 of them.\n\n373\n00:18:11.607 --> 00:18:13.292\nLet's move this over so you can see.\n\n374\n00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.450\nThey are all sitting in there.\n\n375\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.385\nWe can go in and grab which ones we want.\n\n376\n00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:21.244\nSo, we're just gonna grab a couple of\nthe ones that are up here at the top of\n\n377\n00:18:21.244 --> 00:18:21.946\nthe screen.\n\n378\n00:18:21.946 --> 00:18:25.872\nGo ahead and grab these two right here,\nI'm just gonna click Control.\n\n379\n00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:27.988\nThese are updates for Internet Explorer.\n\n380\n00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:29.379\nMay be hard to see.\n\n381\n00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:31.329\nJust show you what they\nare here real quick.\n\n382\n00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:35.598\nInternet Explorer for Windows 11, so\nyou can see a couple security updates for\n\n383\n00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:37.554\nthat, just as I kind of scroll over.\n\n384\n00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:38.905\nShow you what they are.\n\n385\n00:18:38.905 --> 00:18:42.555\nSo, we’re gonna highlight those two and\ngonna click add.\n\n386\n00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:43.479\nI will drop them in there.\n\n387\n00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:46.278\nThey get listed just you know sent\nher the same order we bring them in.\n\n388\n00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:48.123\nThere’s no rhyme or reason to and from so\n\n389\n00:18:48.123 --> 00:18:51.125\nwhich ones on the top which ones\non the bottom orders irrelevant.\n\n390\n00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:54.857\nThere is not one of those screens we have\nto be on the top to be executed and or\n\n391\n00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:56.857\nto be scanned for and looked for first.\n\n392\n00:18:56.857 --> 00:18:58.312\nThere's no order of precedence.\n\n393\n00:18:58.312 --> 00:19:00.392\nYou just add them in,\nthat's all that's important.\n\n394\n00:19:00.392 --> 00:19:04.472\nAll we're doing is compiling a list of all\nthe updates we want in our baseline, so\n\n395\n00:19:04.472 --> 00:19:07.184\nwhen we scan,\nwe know whether they're there or not.\n\n396\n00:19:07.184 --> 00:19:09.865\nBut the order that they exist\nin is totally relevant to us.\n\n397\n00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:12.261\nSo don't worry about all that.\n\n398\n00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:17.652\nWe’re going to click Next and then we\nhave to look at the assignment scope.\n\n399\n00:19:17.652 --> 00:19:20.918\nAnd the assignment scope helps\nus to understand what host or\n\n400\n00:19:20.918 --> 00:19:24.983\nhosts in this case or what resources\nbecause we have more than hosts here.\n\n401\n00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:26.131\nYou'll see we have our host group.\n\n402\n00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.085\nWe talked about that and\n\n403\n00:19:27.085 --> 00:19:29.716\nyou'll see our two hosts that\nwe've been using are added there.\n\n404\n00:19:29.716 --> 00:19:33.083\nI told you I added them in before we\nstarted the walk-through and so, we've put\n\n405\n00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:36.416\nthem in there and they're a member of\nthe default host group called all hosts.\n\n406\n00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.209\nWe've discussed that and\nexplained that to you before.\n\n407\n00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:42.015\nShowed you how to create a separate\nset of nested host groups.\n\n408\n00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.237\nAnd remember the all hosts host group,\n\n409\n00:19:44.237 --> 00:19:48.419\nthe default host group built in to\nSCVMM is going to be the parent, right?\n\n410\n00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:49.384\nIt's the ultimate parent.\n\n411\n00:19:49.384 --> 00:19:52.283\nWe went through that whole idea\nof where do all the settings for\n\n412\n00:19:52.283 --> 00:19:53.298\nhost groups get set.\n\n413\n00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:54.829\nIs there an inheritance model?\n\n414\n00:19:54.829 --> 00:19:56.058\nIs it a hierarchy?\n\n415\n00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:57.470\nThe answer is absolutely.\n\n416\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.624\nIt gets set at the all\nhost group by default.\n\n417\n00:19:59.624 --> 00:20:03.506\nBut we showed you in great detail as we\ndid our walk through on host groups that\n\n418\n00:20:03.506 --> 00:20:07.827\nwe can block that inheritance for every\nsetting by unchecking the appropriate box.\n\n419\n00:20:07.827 --> 00:20:11.144\nAnd we can override and\nconfigure for our child objects,\n\n420\n00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:15.926\nour other hist groups we create and we can\nspecify in a prohost group how we do that.\n\n421\n00:20:15.926 --> 00:20:20.777\nAnd so, we don't have any customer\nhost groups here, but if you remember\n\n422\n00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:25.565\nin the walk through we did ITPRO TV h1 or\ng1 or g2 for different groups.\n\n423\n00:20:25.565 --> 00:20:29.374\nAnd we saw essentially a child\nunderneath the default all hosts,\n\n424\n00:20:29.374 --> 00:20:31.598\nthen a subdirectory for another one.\n\n425\n00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:34.880\nSo I nested a total of three and\nwe were able to then walk-through and\n\n426\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.638\ndiscuss that.\n\n427\n00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:37.624\nSo we went through that,\nyou can see the host.\n\n428\n00:20:37.624 --> 00:20:41.529\nYou can see also, under infrastructure\nanother area of the fabric,\n\n429\n00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:44.573\nyou'll see we have our PIXE\nservers if there are any.\n\n430\n00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:49.135\nWe have our update servers if there\nare any, our VMM servers, and our library.\n\n431\n00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:53.286\nAny and all of these posts can\nbe configured to have this\n\n432\n00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:56.364\nparticular baseline assigned to them.\n\n433\n00:20:56.364 --> 00:21:01.105\nBecause remember, what we're doing\nhere with SCVMM and WSUS and\n\n434\n00:21:01.105 --> 00:21:05.326\nintegrating the two,\nis we are patch managing the host and\n\n435\n00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:08.535\nthe infrastructure of the SCVMM solution.\n\n436\n00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:14.271\nNot the VMs, VMs are gonna be patch\nmanaged through SCCM using WSUS there.\n\n437\n00:21:14.271 --> 00:21:17.269\nThis is where we're gonna deal with\nthe underlying architecture in\n\n438\n00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:19.012\nthe infrastructure that supports it.\n\n439\n00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:22.151\nAnd we're gonna be patch\nmanaging virtualization hosts.\n\n440\n00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:25.777\nEssentially Windows servers running\nHyper-V that are added in the host\n\n441\n00:21:25.777 --> 00:21:28.939\ngroups and providing resources\nto those VMs that are running.\n\n442\n00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:32.139\nSo that's why we see the hosts here and\nthe infrastructure servers,\n\n443\n00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:33.474\nwhatever they happen to be.\n\n444\n00:21:33.474 --> 00:21:37.964\nWe've only got two servers running here,\nso clearly, you see the Hyper V 0-1 or 0-2\n\n445\n00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:42.113\nhosts is listed for everything cuz we only\nhave two hosts that we're demoing with.\n\n446\n00:21:42.113 --> 00:21:45.025\nBut in the real world, you would see\nlots of different hosts here and\n\n447\n00:21:45.025 --> 00:21:46.622\nwe'd have some different options.\n\n448\n00:21:46.622 --> 00:21:48.087\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n449\n00:21:48.087 --> 00:21:52.630\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna choose Hyper-V 01.\n\n450\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.904\nSo let's just check that off.\n\n451\n00:21:53.904 --> 00:21:58.235\nAnd notice when I check it off up in the\nall hosts area, it preselects it anywhere\n\n452\n00:21:58.235 --> 00:22:02.196\nit appears in the infrastructure list,\nmeaning it's the same server.\n\n453\n00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:06.164\nAll it has is different roles on it and\nwhen we patch it, or when we scan it,\n\n454\n00:22:06.164 --> 00:22:10.649\nwe do baseline compliance check, we're\nscanning it for every one of those roles.\n\n455\n00:22:10.649 --> 00:22:12.913\nSame baseline regardless, so\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n456\n00:22:12.913 --> 00:22:14.448\nWe're just gonna really scan the server.\n\n457\n00:22:14.448 --> 00:22:16.367\nBut it is represented in different areas,\nso\n\n458\n00:22:16.367 --> 00:22:19.759\nwe select it automatically to indicate\nthat that's what we're doing, okay?\n\n459\n00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.205\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n460\n00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:22.818\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\njust finish up here.\n\n461\n00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:27.116\nWe'll click next and that's gonna let\nus finish up this particular ride and\n\n462\n00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:28.738\nit doesn't take very long.\n\n463\n00:22:28.738 --> 00:22:30.186\nYou'll see here create new baseline.\n\n464\n00:22:30.186 --> 00:22:32.043\nAlready done by the time we hit next and\n\n465\n00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:34.374\nthe job window shows up\nthat's how quick it is.\n\n466\n00:22:34.374 --> 00:22:37.836\nBecause remember, the baseline is not\nbeing applied, its just being created.\n\n467\n00:22:37.836 --> 00:22:39.518\nCreating it is just a matter\nof creating a little file.\n\n468\n00:22:39.518 --> 00:22:40.773\n&gt;&gt; Just like a check list basically.\n\n469\n00:22:40.773 --> 00:22:41.787\n&gt;&gt; Essentially its a template.\n\n470\n00:22:41.787 --> 00:22:43.103\nIt's nothing more than that.\n\n471\n00:22:43.103 --> 00:22:46.275\nAnd it's very quick to create,\nand then we've gone ahead and\n\n472\n00:22:46.275 --> 00:22:50.303\nchanged properties of the baseline to\nmodify to represent what the two patches\n\n473\n00:22:50.303 --> 00:22:52.271\nare that we specified we wanna add in.\n\n474\n00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.537\nSo we're gonna ahead,\nwe're gonna close that.\n\n475\n00:22:54.537 --> 00:22:56.506\nAnd so now we have that set up.\n\n476\n00:22:56.506 --> 00:22:57.738\nLet's just come back here.\n\n477\n00:22:57.738 --> 00:23:00.591\nYou'll see our baseline is\ndown there towards the bottom.\n\n478\n00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:02.559\nWe do have an assignment for that one.\n\n479\n00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.854\nIt's been assigned as you\nknow to one of our hosts.\n\n480\n00:23:04.854 --> 00:23:06.578\nAnd we do have two updates\nassociated with it.\n\n481\n00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:09.987\nAnd you could see it right there, and we\ncould see that unlike the other samples,\n\n482\n00:23:09.987 --> 00:23:11.407\nthis one's actually assigned.\n\n483\n00:23:11.407 --> 00:23:15.176\nThe others are sitting there with zero\ncuz we haven't actually assigned them to\n\n484\n00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:15.746\nanything.\n\n485\n00:23:15.746 --> 00:23:18.603\nAll right, so we've gone ahead and\nwe've done that.\n\n486\n00:23:18.603 --> 00:23:19.828\nWe've seen that done.\n\n487\n00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:22.496\nNow what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n488\n00:23:22.496 --> 00:23:24.802\nwe're gonna assign an existing baseline.\n\n489\n00:23:24.802 --> 00:23:26.201\nWe're gonna take a look at how to do that.\n\n490\n00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:30.460\nThat doesn't really [COUGH] cause\nus much confusion, or concern.\n\n491\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.859\nIt's a very simple extension,\nessentially, of what we've just done.\n\n492\n00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:36.948\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndo the following.\n\n493\n00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:40.195\nLet's go into our update baselines here.\n\n494\n00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:43.583\nLet’s go ahead and we'll use this one and\nwe'll just add to it.\n\n495\n00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:44.732\nWe could show you the other one.\n\n496\n00:23:44.732 --> 00:23:47.782\nIt doesn't really matter but\neither one, we just right-click here.\n\n497\n00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:49.123\nGo to Properties.\n\n498\n00:23:49.123 --> 00:23:51.164\nAnd you'll see here\nonce we have it set up.\n\n499\n00:23:51.164 --> 00:23:55.184\nLet's just move this over so that we\ncan see that on the edge of the box and\n\n500\n00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:58.206\nbox screen there so\nyou guys can see what's going on.\n\n501\n00:23:58.206 --> 00:23:58.938\nThere we go.\n\n502\n00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:01.634\nAnd you'll see that if we go through,\nwe have our updates.\n\n503\n00:24:01.634 --> 00:24:02.480\nWe can always add.\n\n504\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.293\nAnd modify here.\n\n505\n00:24:03.293 --> 00:24:06.751\nAssignment scope, all we're doing\nis going in and modifying this and\n\n506\n00:24:06.751 --> 00:24:09.600\nadding in a host or\nremoving one and adding one in.\n\n507\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.430\nAll we're doing, in other words,\n\n508\n00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.080\nis editing it after the fact\nto add an additional host in.\n\n509\n00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.360\nLike, for instance, if we do this,\nwhere I add in host 2 and\n\n510\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.670\nnow both hosts are bound to this.\n\n511\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.663\nAnd so when I do that and click OK,\nit's gonna go out, it being the system.\n\n512\n00:24:23.663 --> 00:24:24.483\nIt's gonna add in.\n\n513\n00:24:24.483 --> 00:24:25.792\nYou'll see assignments two.\n\n514\n00:24:25.792 --> 00:24:28.370\nAd we simply just add another\nhost into the baseline.\n\n515\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.450\nThat's all we have to do in order to\nupdate the assignments or modify them.\n\n516\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.280\n&gt;&gt; So I could assume that you\nwould have to be pretty cognizant\n\n517\n00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.140\nof your service window time frame.\n\n518\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.990\nAnd I think what we had over 600 potential\nupdates that we could have added here.\n\n519\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:44.410\nBut we just need to make sure\nthat we would be still falling\n\n520\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.800\nwithin whatever that maintenance\nwindow may be for us?\n\n521\n00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, you bring up a good point,\n\n522\n00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.100\nwhich is if we have these massive\nbaselines with hundreds potentially of\n\n523\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.050\npatches or\nupdates that may have to be applied.\n\n524\n00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.610\nAnd if we have to scan and potentially\nremediate, and we have to do so inside,\n\n525\n00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.730\nas you pointed out, a service window, what\nwe commonly call a maintenance window,\n\n526\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.410\nright outside, or servicing window to\nuse the exact Microsoft terminology.\n\n527\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.260\nIf we're doing it inside\na servicing window or\n\n528\n00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.590\na maintenance window\naligned with our SLAs,\n\n529\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.540\nwe do have to be aware of the fact that,\nif we have a two-hour servicing window,\n\n530\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:22.100\nlet's say, and 600 updates, we may not\nbe able to finish that process, right?\n\n531\n00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:22.930\nTo your point.\n\n532\n00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.820\nAnd that gets even more complicated\nby the fact that we are most likely,\n\n533\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.060\nin this scenario, two hosts,\nwe're only remediating two of them.\n\n534\n00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.760\nThere's no running VMs.\n\n535\n00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.630\nWe don't have to worry\nabout an entire cluster of\n\n536\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.510\nmaybe 64 hosts that are joined\ntogether that have to be remediated\n\n537\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.430\nalong with running VMs that would have\nto be live migrated or shut down and\n\n538\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.860\nhave their state stored to be able to\npatch manage the host and the host group.\n\n539\n00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.990\nSo we're not worried about that.\n\n540\n00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.880\nWe're doing just essentially two hosts.\n\n541\n00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.650\nProbably not a big deal,\n\n542\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.330\nnot gonna take a lot of time to in theory\napply two updates in Internet Explorer.\n\n543\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.150\nThat would be pretty quick.\n\n544\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.030\nBut Cherokee raises an excellent\npoint which is in the real world\n\n545\n00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.570\nwhen you're applying multiple patches,\n\n546\n00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.470\nyou've gotta really think about the logic\nof potentially how long may this take.\n\n547\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.210\nNow, we don't have an estimation tool\nwhere it says this long for this patch.\n\n548\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.970\nIt would be nice, but we don't have that.\n\n549\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.780\nSo that's part of the problem.\n\n550\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.570\nThis is one of the reasons why\nyou have to do your testing and\n\n551\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.910\nyou have to understand all this\nprior to spinning this up here.\n\n552\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.720\nBecause you're gonna have to\npush those updates to a box and\n\n553\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.900\nsee how long it take to apply, not just\nbecause you wanna how long it'll take,\n\n554\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.268\nto your point, but also because\nyou wanna know the impact of them,\n\n555\n00:26:30.268 --> 00:26:33.000\nas we both have talked about it and\nhave mentioned before.\n\n556\n00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.240\nSo you gotta think about that,\nand we've gotta understand that.\n\n557\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.220\nAnd that's a very important\npart of what we need to do here\n\n558\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.490\nas we begin to think about\nwhat's gonna happen.\n\n559\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.820\nWe also have to obviously clearly be\ncognizant of, right, to use your term,\n\n560\n00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.742\nto be aware of the idea of aligning with\nthese servicing windows so that when\n\n561\n00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:54.390\nwe do push out our scans, and we're about\nto setup and show you what a compliance\n\n562\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.400\nscan would look like, I'm about to walk\nthrough and show you that right now.\n\n563\n00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.510\nWhen we do that,\n\n564\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:02.695\nwe have to think about doing that perhaps\nin our servicing window, perhaps not.\n\n565\n00:27:02.695 --> 00:27:06.885\nJust cuz we scan doesn't mean we have to\nremediate after we get done with the scan.\n\n566\n00:27:06.885 --> 00:27:08.505\nIt just means that we're prepared, right?\n\n567\n00:27:08.505 --> 00:27:11.285\nAnd that we know that we may\nhave a target of opportunity and\n\n568\n00:27:11.285 --> 00:27:13.515\nthat we would have to\nremediate at some point.\n\n569\n00:27:13.515 --> 00:27:16.555\nBut maybe that's tomorrow\nnight at two in the morning or\n\n570\n00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:18.490\nwhenever our service window is.\n\n571\n00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.790\nSo we could do a scan to find\nout whether we are compliant.\n\n572\n00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.690\nThat doesn't mean we have to\nremediate immediately, but\n\n573\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.440\nit does mean we're prepared and\nwe're that much closer.\n\n574\n00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.163\nAnd so one of the things to think about is\nthe idea that we may wanna run compliance\n\n575\n00:27:31.163 --> 00:27:34.053\nscans, see the state of\nour host as a precursor to\n\n576\n00:27:34.053 --> 00:27:38.450\ngetting closer to our service windows\nto tee up our ability to remediate.\n\n577\n00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.330\nIt saves us time, in other words.\n\n578\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.160\nSo that may be something to consider.\n\n579\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.520\nThe downside there you just have to play\nwith is the idea that running the scan,\n\n580\n00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.620\nand I'm not suggesting that it's going\nto impact performance negatively and\n\n581\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.130\nblow your systems up when I say this.\n\n582\n00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.300\nBut everything we do on a system\ndoes have an intended consequence.\n\n583\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.910\nWe know ahead of time there's\ngoing to be a percentage of usage\n\n584\n00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.430\nof resources dedicated to this activity,\nand we have to be aware of that.\n\n585\n00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.320\nI'm not saying it's going to blow\nyour system up, but I'm telling you\n\n586\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.200\nthat we're sucking resources out of\nthe host while we're doing this scan.\n\n587\n00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.150\nSo if you do this in the middle of\nthe business day, at the height of usage,\n\n588\n00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.320\nyou may slow the host down.\n\n589\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.340\nThat could negatively impact your VMs.\n\n590\n00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.690\nWhen I say do this I mean\nwe're on the compliance scan.\n\n591\n00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.880\nNot the remediation.\n\n592\n00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.900\nJust to be clear.\n\n593\n00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.810\nWe'd never wanna remediate in production\nenvironments while we are live,\n\n594\n00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.100\nunless we're inside a service window and\n\n595\n00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.650\nwe have clearly articulated that service\ninterruption and outage may happen.\n\n596\n00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.630\nAnd that would be,\nalthough unfortunate, acceptable,\n\n597\n00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.030\ngiven the negotiated SLAs\nthat we operate under, and\n\n598\n00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.740\nthe period of time we may be implying\nthat there could be disruption for.\n\n599\n00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.840\nEven then, our technology should be able\nto operate without disrupting service.\n\n600\n00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.100\nWe should be able to live migrate VMs off\nhosts, place them in maintenance mode,\n\n601\n00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.140\nwalk through in parallel\nremediation in our host group and\n\n602\n00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.890\nremediate a certain number of\nhosts while running VMs on\n\n603\n00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.740\nthat side of the host group\nthat are not affected.\n\n604\n00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.150\nEssentially, live migrate them back\nthe other way, like a ping pong ball,\n\n605\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.170\nas we bring the hosts up and\ntake them out of maintenance mode.\n\n606\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.300\nAnd then, parallel remediate\nthe other side of the host group.\n\n607\n00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.530\nWe should be able to do that, indeed,\nwe are able to do that with no trouble.\n\n608\n00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.920\nSo just be aware of the fact that\nthat's normally what will happen.\n\n609\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.750\nKeep in mind, we add in,\nin the host group,\n\n610\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.450\nwe talked about this when we showed\nyou how to create host groups,\n\n611\n00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:26.170\nthe ability to leverage dynamic\noptimization, if that's running.\n\n612\n00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.700\nSoftware load balancing of the host\ngroup so that we can either\n\n613\n00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.580\nsomewhat aggressively or very\naggressively live migrate VMs back and\n\n614\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.920\nforth to balance out the load\nacross the host group.\n\n615\n00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.620\nSo you want to think about that.\n\n616\n00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.360\nThis will be the equivalent of using\nthe DRS technology in a VMware or\n\n617\n00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.945\nOracle virtualization\nsolution to live migrate,\n\n618\n00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:52.005\nis the Microsoft term,\nto either vMotion or\n\n619\n00:29:52.005 --> 00:29:55.975\nmove those VMs in real time to be able\nto then balance out what we would\n\n620\n00:29:55.975 --> 00:30:00.355\ncall a host cluster in those technologies\nas opposed to a host group here.\n\n621\n00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:04.590\nSo, again, it's just a matter of\nunderstanding the language and vocabulary.\n\n622\n00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.140\nThe concepts don't change.\n\n623\n00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.790\nThe language may change\nwhat we refer to it as.\n\n624\n00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.620\nThe idea's the same as I talked\nabout when we did host groups and\n\n625\n00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.968\nexplained that thought process to you.\n\n626\n00:30:12.968 --> 00:30:15.100\nSo it's a really good idea for\nyou to remind us of that.\n\n627\n00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.850\nIt's very important to think about that.\n\n628\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.910\nAnd it is definitely something\nwe wanna be aware of.\n\n629\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.710\nAnd we have to be aligned with our\nSLAs in order to understand how to do\n\n630\n00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.610\nthis properly.\n\n631\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.820\nKnowledge of our SLAs and our contractual\ncommitments to provide services,\n\n632\n00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.370\nin other words, is a prerequisite and\na requirement for\n\n633\n00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.980\nyou as an IT professional managing\nthis kind of infrastructure.\n\n634\n00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.250\nOr for your Cloud provider,\nif you're outsourced and\n\n635\n00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.190\nhosting with a third party\nprovided off-prem private Cloud,\n\n636\n00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.960\nright, through some sort of\nmanaged service provisioning.\n\n637\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.730\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n638\n00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.300\nIt is very important for\nus to be aligned with those items and\n\n639\n00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.070\nbe thinking about those solutions.\n\n640\n00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.790\nAll right, we're gonna go back in here.\n\n641\n00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.970\nWe're going to come into our fabric and\n\n642\n00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.330\nwe're going to take a look\nat that compliance baseline.\n\n643\n00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.500\nWe're going to come in here,\nwe're up under infrastructure.\n\n644\n00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.380\nAnd what we're going to do is\nwe're going to go to servers.\n\n645\n00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.250\nLet me just move up here real quick cuz\nwe're up on the update server right now.\n\n646\n00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.060\nWe're up under servers,\njust highlight servers here.\n\n647\n00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.870\nAnd you'll see up under servers we\nhave our compliance shield there.\n\n648\n00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.540\nIt's just to the right of\nfabric resources and overview.\n\n649\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.210\nNow, let's just click on overview for\na second so you can see what's there.\n\n650\n00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.000\nYou may or\nmay not have ever looked at this.\n\n651\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.300\nCan we go full screen for just a second?\n\n652\n00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.410\nLet's just take a look\nat what's going on here.\n\n653\n00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.350\nYou'll see on the overview tab for\nour servers we have two virtual machines,\n\n654\n00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.910\ntwo hosts.\n\n655\n00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.900\nWe have just an overview on the process.\n\n656\n00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.920\nThere's memory, storage, etc.\n\n657\n00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.350\nWe have just some basic information here.\n\n658\n00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.670\nWe have our agent status and\nour compliance status.\n\n659\n00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.580\nIf we come down, notice that\ncompliance status currently unknown.\n\n660\n00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.150\nWe have two agents, as in the system\ncenter virtual machine manager agents that\n\n661\n00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.843\nare managing and\ninteracting with the hosts.\n\n662\n00:31:49.843 --> 00:31:51.648\nYou'll be aware of them, and\n\n663\n00:31:51.648 --> 00:31:56.284\nyou'll see that we have no information\non non-compliancy or compliancy.\n\n664\n00:31:56.284 --> 00:31:57.402\nWe're in an unknown state right now.\n\n665\n00:31:57.402 --> 00:32:00.730\nWe're going to run compliance baseline\nscan and see if we can move those numbers\n\n666\n00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.174\naround and populate some of\nthose tiles and shift things.\n\n667\n00:32:03.174 --> 00:32:04.449\nAnd that's what we're going to do.\n\n668\n00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:07.456\nSo we're going to go\nup here to compliance.\n\n669\n00:32:07.456 --> 00:32:08.740\nAnd we're gonna go ahead.\n\n670\n00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.817\nYou'll see we have\na pending compliance scan.\n\n671\n00:32:12.817 --> 00:32:15.130\nI wanted to say pending compliance stamp,\nright?\n\n672\n00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.930\nPending compliance scan\nyou'll see it there.\n\n673\n00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:24.100\nAnd so what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and we are going to come in here.\n\n674\n00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.020\nAnd let's just open one of these\nup before we do anything just so\n\n675\n00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.410\nyou could see what's going on.\n\n676\n00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.460\nWe can see down here, just basically the\nsame information we saw on the overview.\n\n677\n00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.440\nShows us our storage, our fabric\ninformation, resource allocation,\n\n678\n00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.426\nstuff like that.\n\n679\n00:32:37.426 --> 00:32:39.510\nAnd we have our baseline\nthat's assigned here.\n\n680\n00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:43.600\nYou can see our ITPro base, 1 baseline,\nso you can see that is assigned.\n\n681\n00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.390\nCould we go back to full screen here cuz\nwe're not done talking about what's in\n\n682\n00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.270\nthe console.\n\n683\n00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.000\nAnd so you can see that as I click around,\nthe view changes.\n\n684\n00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.480\nBut on the overview, you'll see that\nwe've got all the information here\n\n685\n00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.910\nabout what's happening and any jobs that\nmay be running are gonna be listed here\n\n686\n00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.520\nalong with our compliance status,\nif we missed it out on the other area.\n\n687\n00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.230\nAnd you'll see right now\nit's set to unknown.\n\n688\n00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.700\nThis is our little dialog box\nwith our question mark, right?\n\n689\n00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.390\nThat's the unknown status\nas you can see here.\n\n690\n00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.140\nAnd so\nwe've seen in a few different places\n\n691\n00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.550\nthat we actually can see what's happening.\n\n692\n00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.660\nWe understand the output of this and\nwhat's gonna be going on.\n\n693\n00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.980\nAll right, so\nyou can see here that we can go ahead and\n\n694\n00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.610\nwe can right-click and choose Scan.\n\n695\n00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.280\nNotice scan's up here as well.\n\n696\n00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.480\nCan do this in either place and so\nwhat we're gonna do is just simply\n\n697\n00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.180\ncollapse this, right, so that we have\nthat we're gonna highlight both, just so\n\n698\n00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.150\nwe could scan both at once,\nmake it a little bit easier, all right?\n\n699\n00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.530\nSo we're just gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Scan, click that off, so\n\n700\n00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.290\nthat's gonna start, notice here,\nthe status is changed to scanning.\n\n701\n00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.820\nIt takes a minute or two,\nit's probably not gonna take very long,\n\n702\n00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.630\nwe got only two updates, you can see\nlast scan already flips over there,\n\n703\n00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.210\non the first one,\nsecond one just flip over.\n\n704\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.630\nAnd you'll see here that we are compliant.\n\n705\n00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.020\nYou can see the status here is\nchanged to compliant with our scan.\n\n706\n00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.040\n&gt;&gt; Good job Adam.\n\n707\n00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.290\n&gt;&gt; Yay right?\n\n708\n00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.640\nAnd so\nyou can see that when we run this and\n\n709\n00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.670\nwe were able to essentially do our\nbaseline scan to see whether we match and\n\n710\n00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.550\nor meet the criteria of\nour modified baseline.\n\n711\n00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.020\nRemember not the default baseline\nwith almost 700 updates in it, but\n\n712\n00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.730\nrather the modified one\nwith only the two for\n\n713\n00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.050\nInternet Explorer just to be\nclear cuz that's the one we did.\n\n714\n00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.740\nSo when you see that we do see\nthat yes we are compliant and\n\n715\n00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.330\nwe are now able to in theory rest\ncomfortably knowing at least for\n\n716\n00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.570\nthe moment anyway,\nright, we are compliant.\n\n717\n00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.960\nBut let's just take a look at one\nquick thing while we're here.\n\n718\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.790\nSo open this up so you can see here.\n\n719\n00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.190\nOur baseline does show compliant for\nour host for host 2.\n\n720\n00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.575\nAnd notice that host 2 is\njust the host update server.\n\n721\n00:34:43.575 --> 00:34:46.145\nNotice host one shows compliance.\n\n722\n00:34:46.145 --> 00:34:49.145\nIt's our library host VMM server etc.\n\n723\n00:34:49.145 --> 00:34:51.015\nBut look pending machine reboot.\n\n724\n00:34:51.015 --> 00:34:54.955\nWe may have a need to reboot\nbecause of an install we did or\n\n725\n00:34:54.955 --> 00:34:56.520\nsome sort of configuration.\n\n726\n00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.570\nAnd it picks up on that, and tells us,\nhey, probably need to reboot that server\n\n727\n00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.640\nin order to make sure\nthat everything is good.\n\n728\n00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.500\nSo, it's not necessarily\nbecause we installed the patch,\n\n729\n00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:10.310\nit's just because, probably,\nfrom the WSUS interaction,\n\n730\n00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.880\nand all the stuff we did setting\nit all up and sinking it.\n\n731\n00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.580\nAt some point we may have done\nsomething that the system says,\n\n732\n00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.810\nokay I'm good but you know what?\n\n733\n00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.710\nIt'd be good if you rebooted me just so\nI can finish doing whatever I was doing.\n\n734\n00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.035\nSo it just shows us that that's the case.\n\n735\n00:35:24.035 --> 00:35:27.815\nWe can run and re-run the compliance\ncheck as often as necessary.\n\n736\n00:35:27.815 --> 00:35:30.215\nLet's go back to our overview\narea here just to finish up.\n\n737\n00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:35.095\nAnd what we'll see now is that that\nnumber shifted from unknown over to here.\n\n738\n00:35:35.095 --> 00:35:38.830\nAnd we see that we're actually now have\ntwo systems, two hosts in this case,\n\n739\n00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.050\nright, that are compliant.\n\n740\n00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.080\nSo we actually were able\nto shift that dialogue or\n\n741\n00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.230\nthat update to the tile on our\noverview screen in real-time.\n\n742\n00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.590\nAnd if I click here, it's nice.\n\n743\n00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.700\nIt takes us back to where we were.\n\n744\n00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.520\nIt's linked.\n\n745\n00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.850\nSo we actually can just be\non that summary overview.\n\n746\n00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.200\nDrill through and\nsee the details right here.\n\n747\n00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.670\nSo this is how we integrate\nthe WSUS server into SCVMM.\n\n748\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.730\nThis is how we use SCVMM to\ncreate a baseline to scan hosts.\n\n749\n00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.140\nNotice nowhere in here did I scan,\n\n750\n00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.870\ndid I interact with that I even mentioned\nthe word virtual machines except when I\n\n751\n00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.500\nsaid hey by the way we don't\ndeal with them here, right?\n\n752\n00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.380\nBecause we're not doing that.\n\n753\n00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.100\nWe're doing hosts.\n\n754\n00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.350\nYou saw that I added in my\ninfrastructure servers and\n\n755\n00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:21.250\nmy hosts to my baseline right not my VM's.\n\n756\n00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.430\nSo keep in mind this is specifically\nthe functionality that helps us to patch,\n\n757\n00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.240\npatch manage, scan for, and\nindeed create mediation,\n\n758\n00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.790\nand compliant solutions around\nour host infrastructure.\n\n759\n00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.670\nThe other side of the coin,\nSCVMM is gonna deal with our host.\n\n760\n00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.190\nSCMM system center config manager.\n\n761\n00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.010\nThat's where we go to deal with our VMs,\nor\n\n762\n00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.790\nvirtual machines,\nglues operating systems as required.\n\n763\n00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.710\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling we're gonna\nget to that in a little bit.\n\n764\n00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.240\nIs that something that we're\nplanning in the series?\n\n765\n00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.810\n&gt;&gt; You would be feeling wrong if you felt\nthat cuz we're not gonna be talking about\n\n766\n00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:51.670\nthat here.\n\n767\n00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.880\nNot part of our discussion or our\nthought process in this particular area.\n\n768\n00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.090\nBut having said that I will\ngive you a recommendation.\n\n769\n00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:02.110\nI did a series of shows and\nepisodes unrelated\n\n770\n00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.330\nto the 7246247 content, which we're kind\nof backing and forthing and referencing in\n\n771\n00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:10.490\nregards to MCC private cloud which\nis what all this content is about.\n\n772\n00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.850\nBut the separate set of shows that I did a\nwhile ago on system center config manager,\n\n773\n00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.980\nhow to manage that product specifically.\n\n774\n00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.860\nSeparate totally set of content.\n\n775\n00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.390\nBut it is out there in the library\nencourage you to go take a look.\n\n776\n00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.920\nThere's a whole set of episodes there on\nhow to integrate WSUS set it up use it,\n\n777\n00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.070\npatch manage your physical or\n\n778\n00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:32.400\nlogical host meaning either real physical\nsystems or your virtual machines.\n\n779\n00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.470\nI walked through that whole process but\nit's in that topic and\n\n780\n00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.710\nthat show cuz it's pertinent to that\nparticular set of discussions, okay?\n\n781\n00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.800\nSo you can go see it just not\nspecific to what we're gonna do here.\n\n782\n00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you so much Adam and\nthank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n783\n00:37:45.310 -->

sign out.\n\n786\n00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.590\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n787\n00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.240\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n788\n00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.875\n&gt;&gt;

cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.500\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.510\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look\nhere at configuring application delivery.\n\n8\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.660\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.270\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody,\nhopefully you're doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.620\nWe're gonna continue, or actually\nstart talking about, I should say,\n\n12\n00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.810\nwe've been talking about a lot of stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.765\nBut we're gonna continue talking\nspecifically in this episode about how we\n\n14\n00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.195\ncan deploy applications.\n\n15\n00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:39.870\nThe idea of being able to use\nSystem Center, to be able monitor,\n\n16\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.731\nmanage, maintain infrastructure,\nbroadly and\n\n17\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:46.120\nwidely encompasses lots\nof different things.\n\n18\n00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.450\nWe have talked in prior\nepisodes up until now\n\n19\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.440\nabout System Center\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n20\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.680\nWe've been focusing on the idea\nof using the fabric resources and\n\n21\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.910\nthe concepts of using management of those\nresources to create our private cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.230\nAnd we'll obviously have more\nto say about that as we go on.\n\n23\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.620\nAnd to future topics, we'll be taking\na look at monitoring of infrastructure and\n\n24\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.520\napplications later on as we talk about\nSCOM and its role in this whole process\n\n25\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.600\nin running private clouds and\nhow we manage and optimize them.\n\n26\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.860\nBut we're gonna turn our attention, in\nthis episode, really to the idea of how it\n\n27\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.930\ncan package up and deploy and application\nfrom a few different perspectives.\n\n28\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.120\nWe'll talk about something\ncalled web deploy.\n\n29\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.070\nWe'll talk about web\napplication packages and\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.150\nhow we can create these web deployment\npackages either through IIS,\n\n31\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.400\nwith Web Deploy, through Visual Studio,\nwhatever our methodology may be.\n\n32\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.180\nAnd how we can then grab all those\nsettings, all that information, all that\n\n33\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.350\ncontent and we can make it portable, we\ncan send it out to multiple web servers.\n\n34\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.640\nImagine for a minute, hypothetically,\nwe have a server farm.\n\n35\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.540\nMultiple web servers are gonna\nprovide functionality,\n\n36\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.440\nprovide a common set of front ends.\n\n37\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.840\nThat is customers or\nusers will consume from.\n\n38\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.140\nBut we have to have the application\navailable on each one.\n\n39\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.730\nStood up, standardized,\nrunning the same way.\n\n40\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.340\nThis is one of the back end\nprocesses we use to do that.\n\n41\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.620\nSo we'll take a look at\nthat thought process.\n\n42\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.670\nWe'll explain, and just take a quick\nlook at where you get Web Deploy.\n\n43\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.510\nYou download it from the web,\nfrom Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.760\nSo take a look at that.\n\n45\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.980\nIn addition, we're gonna talk about\nanother way to provide application,\n\n46\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.960\nsomething called\nApplication Virtualization.\n\n47\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.310\nSpecifically, server-side\nApplication Virtualization or\n\n48\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.130\nServer App-V being able to stand up and\n\n49\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.240\nprovide the infrastructure to provide\nvirtualized application support.\n\n50\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.763\nAnd system center does provide these\ncapabilities and help us to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:35.941\nWe're gonna walk you through the logic of\nthat and also show you how to set up and\n\n52\n00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:40.208\nconfigure the moving parts of application\nvirtualization on the server side.\n\n53\n00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:42.029\nSo we'll install\nthe virtualization agent and\n\n54\n00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.682\nconfigure it just make sure\nyou understand how to do that.\n\n55\n00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.550\nAnd we'll create a little application\npackage along the way and\n\n56\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.760\nsee how that's done.\n\n57\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.460\nSo let's get started by talking\nabout web deployment overall and\n\n58\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.430\nthe thought process.\n\n59\n00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.210\nIf you join me over here,\nor actually right up there.\n\n60\n00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.420\nWe're gonna take a look at Web Deploy.\n\n61\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.010\nThis tool really drives the web\ndeployment processor in theory.\n\n62\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.912\nIt allows us to be able to do\nthe web deployment process for\n\n63\n00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:05.700\nus as I was just suggesting.\n\n64\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.760\nWe create a file,\n\n65\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.380\nthe file's commonly referred to as\na package when we use the web deploy tool.\n\n66\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.550\nAnd this contains the websites,\ncontent, all the settings,\n\n67\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.720\neverything necessary\nto be able to do this.\n\n68\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.870\nWe are effectively, if you think about it,\nimaging the web server, but\n\n69\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.570\nwe're extracting just the details\nof the web application and\n\n70\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.830\nthe Settings, so we're not taking\na complete image the way we would\n\n71\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.770\nwith Windows deployment\nservice thought process.\n\n72\n00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.604\nWe're simply just extracting the\napplication-specific information unique to\n\n73\n00:03:33.604 --> 00:03:36.411\nthe web server for\nthis web app or this website.\n\n74\n00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:38.230\nAnd that's what we're\nthen gonna be able to do.\n\n75\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.950\nWe collect all the website data,\npackage it up into a standard zip file,\n\n76\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.030\nso it's real easy to work with,\nvery portable.\n\n77\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.370\nAnd we then use that to deploy\nthe contents out to the private cloud.\n\n78\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.580\nAnd scale-up our web server\ninfrastructure as we were talking about.\n\n79\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.280\nYou download this as a separate\ndownload from Microsoft,\n\n80\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.330\nas you can see there, off the IIS website.\n\n81\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.620\nSo come here, version 3.6.\n\n82\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.994\nSo, this currently,\nif you happen to take a look at it.\n\n83\n00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:02.886\nI know it's real small and\nmaybe hard to see there.\n\n84\n00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:06.800\nBut works for the IS 7,\n7.5,8, 8.5 and IIS 10.\n\n85\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.974\nSo this goes back a few generations,\nIIS 10 is what we are seeing in Server 16,\n\n86\n00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.109\njust you know where that's coming from.\n\n87\n00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:20.426\n8.5 is 12 R2, 8 is 12,\n7.5 is 2008 R2 and 7 is 2008.\n\n88\n00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:24.381\nSo we're going back several versions\nof the operating system in support for\n\n89\n00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:25.240\nIIS here.\n\n90\n00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.989\nEarlier versions of Web Deploy would've\nsupported earlier versions of IIS going\n\n91\n00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:31.794\nback into the 2003 range.\n\n92\n00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:35.800\nBut remember, 2003 as a server OS\nis no longer supported officially.\n\n93\n00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.620\nAnd although you may\nstill have it running,\n\n94\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.960\nit's no longer recommended to be used for\na lot of reasons.\n\n95\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.270\nSo we're seeing that support ratchet up\nand move towards the new versions, right?\n\n96\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.470\nJust so you're aware of that.\n\n97\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.440\nSo Web Deploy 3.6,\ngot a nice little overview video here,\n\n98\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840\nwhich is actually kinda cool.\n\n99\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.470\nMicrosoft's really stepped up their game\nin recent years about providing just not\n\n100\n00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.518\nthe standard capabilities and\nthe documentation solution sets we see.\n\n101\n00:04:58.518 --> 00:05:01.843\nBut interacting and really providing\nmultiple ways of learning and\n\n102\n00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:05.225\nconsuming media to understand\nhow to better use the products.\n\n103\n00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:08.728\nSo, a little overview video is actually\nreally nice, walks you through the logic\n\n104\n00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:11.899\nof what web deploy does, and overviews\nthe process of explaining to you.\n\n105\n00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:13.680\nSo I encourage you to take a look at that.\n\n106\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.660\nBut we go ahead,\nthey give us a little overview here.\n\n107\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.405\nAnd then, by the way, we can also\ndeploy not just ASP.NET and not just\n\n108\n00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:24.920\nMicrosoft-centric applications, I forgot\nto mention, but also PHP applications.\n\n109\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.155\nSo we actually are providing\nmulti-platform support, not just for\n\n110\n00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:31.890\nMicrosoft-centric development with\nthis tool, which is also nice.\n\n111\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.780\nSo we go ahead.\n\n112\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.940\nYou can see your package archive and\n\n113\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.200\ndeploy web apps,\nit's really the goal with the tool.\n\n114\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.100\nWe manage this across multiple platforms.\n\n115\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.320\nWe spoke about this.\n\n116\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.350\nWe synchronize our farm by doing this.\n\n117\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.440\nI spoke about the logic of this,\nand why this is so important.\n\n118\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.370\nWe talk about the features here.\n\n119\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.170\nSo it gives you a little\noverview as to what we can do.\n\n120\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.880\nAnd what we're able to do this.\n\n121\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.280\nYeah, we get the access control lists,\nthe COM, GAC,\n\n122\n00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.060\nand registry settings with this tool.\n\n123\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.070\nThe GAC is the Global Assembly Cache.\n\n124\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.330\nThis is the secure area where\nwe put all of our managed code\n\n125\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.930\nthat we're able to authorize and run.\n\n126\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.310\nIt's digitally signed.\n\n127\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.970\nSo we have that capability.\n\n128\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.540\nWe package up a single app or\nan entire site or anything in between.\n\n129\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.610\nSo that's nice, we include all\nthe associated data, the settings,\n\n130\n00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.720\nthe databases.\n\n131\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.719\nSo this tool goes in and\nreally grabs everything.\n\n132\n00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.824\nIf you think about having theory\nin a mythical box, right?\n\n133\n00:06:18.824 --> 00:06:21.930\nOr a basket for Cherokee,\ncuz she likes baskets.\n\n134\n00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.970\nBut a big basket, right?\n\n135\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.690\nOne that has, you ever have one of those\nbaskets that has the little compartments\n\n136\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.971\nin it so you can put stuff into\ndifferent areas and keep it separate?\n\n137\n00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.240\n&gt;&gt; I have one, it's like a picnic basket.\n\n138\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, right?\n\n139\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.550\nSo you have a little compartment inside,\n\n140\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.890\nyou can maybe put different\nthings in different areas.\n\n141\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.460\nAnd so if you imagine a basket or\na box that's preconfigured\n\n142\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.050\nwith some different dividers that\nlet's us segment out information.\n\n143\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.140\nIn your mind you just have that thought,\n&gt;&gt; Like a bento\n\n144\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.270\nbox\n&gt;&gt; Like a what?\n\n145\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.680\n&gt;&gt; Bento box.\n&gt;&gt; Like a bento, that would be good.\n\n146\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.252\nLike a bento, you're integrating that\nwhole sushi thing we were talking about.\n\n147\n00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:51.005\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So like a bento box, right.\n\n148\n00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:54.793\nIf you think about that then you'll\nimagine that's the web deploy tool is\n\n149\n00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:58.886\ngonna use as it's container at the back\nend to grab all these different parts and\n\n150\n00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:02.330\npieces of information and\nstick them in to the appropriate label.\n\n151\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.530\nThere is so we know what they are and\nthis will create a manifest list and\n\n152\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.650\nthen can work with them.\n\n153\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.770\nWe're able to pull them out as needed\nbased on the kind of configurations\n\n154\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.170\nthat we want to reproduce,\nso we're able to do that.\n\n155\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.060\nWe're then able to provide\na full accounting of, and\n\n156\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.710\ntherefore all the resource necessary\nto reproduce the app if required.\n\n157\n00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.940\nWe can do server migration with this.\n\n158\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.840\nSo we can pull an app In\na website out of one server,\n\n159\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.625\nbring it over instantiate a new area\ninside the farm, decommission old servers.\n\n160\n00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:33.036\nJust provide's our ability to be able to\nmove that data without having to worry\n\n161\n00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.739\nabout if we do of course the right way and\n\n162\n00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:38.120\nif it's successful without having\nto worry about any of those things.\n\n163\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.010\nSo that's good.\n\n164\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.639\nWe do backups of websites\nbefore we make any changes.\n\n165\n00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.360\nSo we just have a failsafe\nrollback mechanism involved.\n\n166\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.010\nSo the tool's well-thought-out,\nwell-provided for\n\n167\n00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.990\nin terms of its functionality,\nits capabilities.\n\n168\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.172\nNotice we do have multilanguage\nsupport for this.\n\n169\n00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:56.284\nYou can see all the different languages\nthe tool comes in, both x86 and\n\n170\n00:07:56.284 --> 00:08:01.224\nx64 variety, so we can download As needed,\nprovide the appropriate language set.\n\n171\n00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:02.460\nWe do have a web command line or\n\n172\n00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.139\nrather a command line tool\nassociated with the web deploy tool.\n\n173\n00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.167\nSo if you wanna run this\nfrom the command line,\n\n174\n00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:08.780\nyou have an option to do that as well.\n\n175\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.350\nIt's gonna be up to you to\ndecide how to drive this.\n\n176\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.998\nBut when we use a tool like this to\ncreate a web deployment packages,\n\n177\n00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:19.478\nwe can either use the web deploy tool, we\ncan use, as I mentioned, Visual Studio or\n\n178\n00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:22.821\nthe IIS Manager to be able to extract and\ncreate our packages.\n\n179\n00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.079\nIf you want to see how to export\na package using the IIS Manager,\n\n180\n00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:30.380\nthere's another area on the same site\nwhere we can go and take a look at this.\n\n181\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.410\nTalks about how we can use\nthe IIS Manager to be able to do this.\n\n182\n00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.612\nWhat are the prereqs,\nwe need the web deploy tool,\n\n183\n00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:42.480\nwe need IIS 7 or the equivalent and\nabove, .NET Framework 2.0 or above.\n\n184\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.470\nIf we're using SQL,\nif SQL's our back end database,\n\n185\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.950\nwe just have to have some\nadditional stuff set up there.\n\n186\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.050\nSo they give you all\nthe different information.\n\n187\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.821\nAnd then we talked about\nhow to export a patch.\n\n188\n00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:55.420\nYou got a nice little set of how to\nscreen captures and information.\n\n189\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.980\nSo it just walks you through here.\n\n190\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.054\nYou go into IIS Manager, you right-click\non the application in question.\n\n191\n00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:03.166\nYou could see over here where the app is.\n\n192\n00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:07.100\nYou go in and you specify Manage Packages,\nand then Export Application.\n\n193\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.913\nSo it wouldn't be very\ndifficult to go in and do that.\n\n194\n00:09:08.913 --> 00:09:12.948\nYou see right over here, we can go to,\nunder Deploy, Export Applications.\n\n195\n00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:15.154\nYou just follow the wizard,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n196\n00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:18.300\nAnd the wizard takes you in,\nselect the contents of the package.\n\n197\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.130\nKinda opens it up, shows you what's there,\n\n198\n00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.970\nyou make your selections about\nwhat you wanna be able to export.\n\n199\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.026\nYou'll notice by default\neverything's selected.\n\n200\n00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:30.018\nSo we've got the application folder there,\nthe file system contents, and\n\n201\n00:09:30.018 --> 00:09:32.833\nthe application container itself up top.\n\n202\n00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:36.110\nAnd we go in with some advanced settings,\nso we need to work with those.\n\n203\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.190\nWe can then go in and\nspecify our provider name,\n\n204\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.320\nselect the contents of the package and\nmake sure everything is set up properly.\n\n205\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.228\nAnd if we're dealing with SQL,\nthis shows us how to deal with that and\n\n206\n00:09:46.228 --> 00:09:46.840\nit's a walkthrough.\n\n207\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.610\nSo looking at the steps here,\nyou'd be able to see how one\n\n208\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.970\nthought process would be executed\nagainst being able to create a package.\n\n209\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.960\nThe Web Deploy tool lets\nus do this as well.\n\n210\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.055\nAnd for those of you that are either doing\ndevelopment and/or are gonna be familiar\n\n211\n00:10:00.055 --> 00:10:04.575\nwith Visual Studio as a development\nplatform, as what I referred to in prior\n\n212\n00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:09.865\nepisodes as an IDE, integrated development\nenvironment tool, we can use that as well.\n\n213\n00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:13.865\nWhen we are able to use any one\nof these approaches to export\n\n214\n00:10:13.865 --> 00:10:17.375\nthe contents the contents of package,\nthere's a lot of stuff that goes in there.\n\n215\n00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:20.312\nI mentioned most of them already, but\nlet me just run down the list for you.\n\n216\n00:10:20.312 --> 00:10:23.045\nYou've got the single web based\napp and/or the entire site.\n\n217\n00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.886\nSo either one as we talked about.\n\n218\n00:10:24.886 --> 00:10:26.850\nI mentioned the access control lists.\n\n219\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.880\nThose will be there.\n\n220\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.365\nThe COM settings, so\nthe Microsoft COM settings.\n\n221\n00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:33.174\nThe GAC, the Global Assembly Cache\nsettings are there.\n\n222\n00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.481\nAll the registry settings,\nas I mentioned, the associated databases,\n\n223\n00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.359\nas you can see on the screen walk through.\n\n224\n00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:41.560\nIf we have a SQL database on the backend,\nwe can grab that.\n\n225\n00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.790\nThe SSL certificate's very important\nif we're using a secure website.\n\n226\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.530\nIf we don't have those,\nwe won't be able to reproduce the site and\n\n227\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.810\naccess it correctly.\n\n228\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.302\nAny and all of the .NET Framework\nconfigurations are there if required,\n\n229\n00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:53.450\nwe'll see those.\n\n230\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.830\nAnd the application pool configuration,\nwhich we actually saw at the very top of\n\n231\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.950\nthat wizard, the very first item that\nwas selected on the first screen capture\n\n232\n00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.640\nwas the application pool and all the\nconfiguration items associated with it.\n\n233\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.570\nSo we'll be able to pull all that out,\npretty authoritative and\n\n234\n00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.740\nexhaustive list of all the things\nnecessary to reproduce the app.\n\n235\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.230\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n236\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.080\nAnd by using this capability or using this\nfunctionality, we now have essentially\n\n237\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.330\nproduced a package that is portable,\nthat will allow us to then be able to take\n\n238\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.250\nour web app, and/or our web site and\nmove it between various resources.\n\n239\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.180\nNow, keep in mind, these servers that\nwe're gonna dump this application onto or\n\n240\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.470\nmove between can be virtual\ninfrastructure, we've talked about that,\n\n241\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.450\nwith System Center Virtual Machine Manager\nas we mentioned in prior shows.\n\n242\n00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.250\nIt may be virtualized infrastructure,\nright?\n\n243\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.270\nWe may be running a virtual machine\ninstead of running these web servers\n\n244\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.480\nin our private cloud stack on our fabric.\n\n245\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.420\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe may be moving this application or\n\n246\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.020\nthis website and deploying it in between,\nand among, virtualized infrastructure.\n\n247\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.040\nSo we have the complete capabilities\nto be able to do that, and\n\n248\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.120\nto make that possible,\nusing an approach like this.\n\n249\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.764\nVery important for\nus to consider our options there.\n\n250\n00:11:58.764 --> 00:12:02.028\nAnd also, for exam preparation,\nmaking sure you're comfortable\n\n251\n00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:05.890\nwith the ways in which we do this and\nthe thought process behind the tool.\n\n252\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.040\nWouldn't be a bad idea for you to have a\nlittle bit of knowledge about web deploy.\n\n253\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.613\nThree different ways we can extract\nthose packages and/or websites to create\n\n254\n00:12:13.613 --> 00:12:14.705\nthe package or the app.\n\n255\n00:12:14.705 --> 00:12:18.409\nAnd the fact now that we can have multiple\noptions to be able to deploy that.\n\n256\n00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:22.355\nCuz we may at some point be asked if\nwe can do those things and if so how.\n\n257\n00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:24.348\nAnd it would be good for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n258\n00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:27.880\nAnother way that we can look at being\nable to configure application delivery\n\n259\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.494\nin the private cloud infrastructure\nis with application virtualization.\n\n260\n00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:35.289\nYou can see Server App-V, for server\napplication virtualization overview,\n\n261\n00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:36.144\nup on the screen.\n\n262\n00:12:36.144 --> 00:12:40.830\nThe app virtualization technology\nthat exists is really in two flavors.\n\n263\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.302\nWe have just traditional App-V,\n\n264\n00:12:42.302 --> 00:12:44.975\nwhich is what Microsoft calls\napplication virtualization.\n\n265\n00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:48.175\nApp-V is the actual acronym that's used.\n\n266\n00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:49.839\nThe App-V capability is for\n\n267\n00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:53.810\ndesktop application virtualization\non an endpoint client.\n\n268\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.613\nServer App-V is being able to tee up\nthe infrastructure behind the scenes to do\n\n269\n00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:03.147\nthe capturing and the creation of\nthe packages that will be virtualized.\n\n270\n00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:06.548\nWe use a sequencer to be able to look\nat the installation of the package,\n\n271\n00:13:06.548 --> 00:13:10.064\nthe application, and to grab all\nthe settings, the registry settings,\n\n272\n00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:14.119\nthe configuration information, the state\nof the application when it's running.\n\n273\n00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:17.868\nAnd then to be able to package that up\njust like we were talking about a moment\n\n274\n00:13:17.868 --> 00:13:21.794\nago with web deploy for an application\npackage that can be used to deploy either\n\n275\n00:13:21.794 --> 00:13:23.720\na web-based app or a website or both.\n\n276\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.440\nWe do the same thing, but\nwith something like, imagine,\n\n277\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.840\nMicrosoft Office as opposed to a website,\nright?\n\n278\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.648\nHypothetically, we wanna virtualize\nMicrosoft Office and make it available as\n\n279\n00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:36.680\nan App-V, or virtualized app, running in\na memory bubble on the endpoint, without\n\n280\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.712\nhaving a footprint where it's actually\ninstalled, but essentially just streaming\n\n281\n00:13:40.712 --> 00:13:44.538\nas an on-demand application and then\ngoing away when we break that connection.\n\n282\n00:13:44.538 --> 00:13:48.170\nThat's what Server App-V on the backend\nprovides the infrastructure to do.\n\n283\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.962\nSo we're just gonna take a look at that,\ntalk a bit about that as an overview.\n\n284\n00:13:51.962 --> 00:13:54.510\nGive you a general sense\nof the thought process.\n\n285\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.658\nAnd we have a little demonstration\nI'll walk through with you to\n\n286\n00:13:56.658 --> 00:13:57.508\nconfigure this as well.\n\n287\n00:13:57.508 --> 00:14:00.160\nBut let's start by just giving you\na high-level idea of what this does.\n\n288\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.680\nSo App-V, as I said, lets us gather up,\n\n289\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.210\ncreate all the information required\nto install an application, and\n\n290\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.620\nto do so in whatever the configured\nstate is that we wanted to capture.\n\n291\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.020\nSo Office fully deployed,\nset up, licensed,\n\n292\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.020\nready to go, with PowerPoint available and\neverything else.\n\n293\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.765\nAll the registry settings,\nthe run time information,\n\n294\n00:14:19.765 --> 00:14:23.210\nthe current state of the system,\nall of that can be captured,\n\n295\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:28.010\nlog files, other data necessary for the\napplication that may be stored somewhere.\n\n296\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.748\nAll that will be captured as part of\nthe process, we're gonna grab all that.\n\n297\n00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:33.772\nThe run time state persists,\nright, so in other words,\n\n298\n00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.670\nwhen we capture it in\nthe sequencing tool that we use and\n\n299\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.780\ncapture the fully configured state\nof that application, it's available.\n\n300\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.400\nIt's essentially like a snapshot,\nit's frozen in time.\n\n301\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.286\nAnd when we redeploy that app\nthrough app virtualization,\n\n302\n00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:50.040\nthe application package comes up\ninstalled, instantiated, configured,\n\n303\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.674\nready to go as if you just did a brand\nnew install of that app and configured it\n\n304\n00:14:53.674 --> 00:14:57.610\nidentically to the way it would have\nbeen when we actually did the capture.\n\n305\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.570\nAnd so by capturing the run time state,\n\n306\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.320\nwe're reproducing the state of that\napp in real time every time we deploy.\n\n307\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.640\nAnd that persists on\nthe system until we remove it.\n\n308\n00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.190\nSo it's gonna be there,\navailable for us to use, right?\n\n309\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.400\nAnd that's gonna be one of\nthe key thought processes,\n\n310\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.340\nis what I'm trying to say, here.\n\n311\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.297\nBecause we are capturing and freezing that\nmoment in time when the application's\n\n312\n00:15:19.297 --> 00:15:22.237\nperfectly deployed,\nperfectly configured, ready to go.\n\n313\n00:15:22.237 --> 00:15:23.407\nAnd then reproducing that for\n\n314\n00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:26.225\neverybody that wants to use it as we\nspool that application out to them.\n\n315\n00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.614\nIt's kind of interesting technology.\n\n316\n00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:30.034\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and\nif you even just think about,\n\n317\n00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:34.735\nnot just in a regular business environment\nlike I guess I would normally think of it.\n\n318\n00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:39.132\nBut just going to regular places out to\neat in different restaurants, like a lot\n\n319\n00:15:39.132 --> 00:15:43.530\nof companies, Chili's and Applebee's,\nintroducing all these point of sale\n\n320\n00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.386\nsystems, connecting back to whatever, I\ndon't know the different brands out there,\n\n321\n00:15:48.386 --> 00:15:50.506\nbut these [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Backend systems [CROSSTALK]\n\n322\n00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:52.066\n&gt;&gt; So just think about the possibilities.\n\n323\n00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:57.281\nYou could maintain and track inventory,\nand what kind of dishes are more popular,\n\n324\n00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:01.543\nand And it's just a cool thing\nthat everything's not so separate.\n\n325\n00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:05.650\nAnd it's just simple, easy to use,\nand it's all integrated.\n\n326\n00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, in theory.\n\n327\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.770\nI mean, relatively simple is a relative\nterm in the sense that it depends on how\n\n328\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.900\ncomplicated the infrastructure\nmay be that you're gonna create.\n\n329\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.690\nBut, once we get it all set up,\n\n330\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.350\nthen it is a much simpler way\nof consuming applications.\n\n331\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.560\nThat is very true.\n\n332\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.030\nSo the nice thing about this also, because\nwe can deploy these applications as we've\n\n333\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.330\nsuggested through SCVMM,\nmanage them in the cloud infrastructure.\n\n334\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.720\nIf the application is load balanced\nfriendly, meaning the application itself\n\n335\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.466\nis load balanced aware, and we can use\nit across a load balanced cluster, or\n\n336\n00:16:34.466 --> 00:16:38.460\na load balanced host group,\nto use the proper terminology that we use.\n\n337\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.480\nIf it functions in a load\nbalanced environment,\n\n338\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.880\na VMM could deploy the application\nacross those servers, and\n\n339\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.560\ncan actually reconfigure the load\nbalancers appropriately so\n\n340\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.480\nthat way the application workloads\nare gonna be load balanced properly.\n\n341\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.140\nSo we have that capability through VMM or\nSCVMM as well,\n\n342\n00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.530\nwhich gives us a lot more flexibility,\nwhich is nice.\n\n343\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.860\nSo let's just talk for\na minute about some vocabulary.\n\n344\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.910\nWhat are the things that we use?\n\n345\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.000\nHow do we manipulate them?\n\n346\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.050\nWhat do they mean?\n\n347\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.900\nThere is four or five terms we just wanna\nmake sure you're comfortable with here.\n\n348\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.770\nThe concept, first of all and\nfirst and foremost,\n\n349\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.570\nis around this key word right here,\napplication.\n\n350\n00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.920\nSo let's define the concept\nof what the application is.\n\n351\n00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.550\nThe application is just the binaries,\nall the files necessary,\n\n352\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.730\nthe data associated with them that\nwe actually are gonna virtualize.\n\n353\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.040\nSo it's the binaries,\nthe configuration, all the settings\n\n354\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.110\nassociated with the program itself\nthat are gonna be virtualized.\n\n355\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.470\nThat's what we define\nan application as in the stack.\n\n356\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:33.110\nThe Server App-V Sequencer is gonna\nbe the program that actually does\n\n357\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.290\nthe heavy lifting that packages up this\napplication that we want to target.\n\n358\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.170\nMonitors and records all of\nthe changes that are taking place\n\n359\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.520\nas we're sequencing and\ngoing through and examining it.\n\n360\n00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.854\nYou're gonna see me do\nthis in a walk-through.\n\n361\n00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:48.660\nWe'll take a look how that works, and\nthen create a Server App-V package.\n\n362\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.190\nSo the Server App-V Sequencer is the\nprogram that we run to actually understand\n\n363\n00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.530\nwhat the application is that we wanna\nvirtualize and capture its current state.\n\n364\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.619\nAnd then once we're done,\nwe shut off the sequencer and\n\n365\n00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:05.975\nwe get a Server App-V package out the back\nend that will then be used to deploy.\n\n366\n00:18:05.975 --> 00:18:09.526\nIf you ever done a macro, if you ever\ncreated a macro in Office, let's say, and\n\n367\n00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:12.283\nmaybe used the macro recorder,\nright, to be able to do that,\n\n368\n00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:13.732\nif you're familiar with that.\n\n369\n00:18:13.732 --> 00:18:17.890\nOr if you've ever used the Steps Recorder\nburied in the Windows OSes in the last\n\n370\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.364\nseveral versions of the Windows OS on the\ndesktop side to essentially screen capture\n\n371\n00:18:22.364 --> 00:18:26.960\nand snapshot things, we have this cool\nlittle tool that you can use to do that.\n\n372\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.680\nAnd if you've done those things, you know\nyou're essentially turning on a program\n\n373\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.790\nthat's gonna record everything we do,\nand takes those steps one at a time,\n\n374\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.450\nand iterates them, and numbers them, and\nconfigures them so that you can reference\n\n375\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.180\nthem and play them back as often as\nyou want to reproduce that activity.\n\n376\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.810\nAnd that's what the Server App-V Sequencer\ndoes for us, essentially.\n\n377\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.232\nWe have the Server App-V Agent.\n\n378\n00:18:46.232 --> 00:18:49.590\nThe App-V Agent's installed on\nthe server that will actually run\n\n379\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.010\nthe virtualized application.\n\n380\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.070\nSo, remember, we're deploying these\napplications not to endpoint desktops,\n\n381\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.322\nthat's App-V, right.\n\n382\n00:18:56.322 --> 00:18:59.260\nServer App-V deployed the applications,\nbut\n\n383\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.218\nto servers, endpoints that are gonna run\nthem, but run them as virtualized apps.\n\n384\n00:19:03.218 --> 00:19:06.570\nSo I suggested we may deploy this\ninto our web server farm, right,\n\n385\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.460\nall the web servers.\n\n386\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.130\nSo the fundamental difference between\nApp-V and Server App-V in our world\n\n387\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.330\nis the target endpoint that runs\nthe virtualized application.\n\n388\n00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.910\nWhen we talk about Server App-V and the\nSystem Center stack in order to be able to\n\n389\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.570\nvirtualize and to be able to configure\napplication delivery in the data center,\n\n390\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.070\nwe're talking about targeting servers.\n\n391\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.028\nAnd that's why we refer to\nServer App-V as opposed to App-V.\n\n392\n00:19:28.028 --> 00:19:32.376\nSo Server App-V Agent, it's just\na software agent that runs on the server\n\n393\n00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:35.330\ncenter and it will receive, and\nessentially run, the virtualized\n\n394\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.397\napplications that we're packaging up\nthrough the Server App-V Sequencer.\n\n395\n00:19:38.397 --> 00:19:39.850\nJust so you know what that is.\n\n396\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:45.260\nThe package is the item that gets\ncreated by the Server App-V Sequencer,\n\n397\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.390\nthe Server App-V package that we referred\nto that has all the state information,\n\n398\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.680\nall the binaries, all the configuration\ninformation necessary for\n\n399\n00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.770\nus to be able to reproduce\nthat virtualized application.\n\n400\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.930\nWe import that onto the server\nwhere we're gonna run it.\n\n401\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.030\nAnd the Server App-V Agent opens\nup that package, receives it, and\n\n402\n00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.460\nessentially lets us deploy the app.\n\n403\n00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.970\nAnd then the Server App-V virtual drive\nis the Q drive by default, by the way,\n\n404\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.960\njust so you know.\n\n405\n00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.930\nWe create a virtual drive\nmapped to the Q drive.\n\n406\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.960\nSo you'll see Q:, right,\nas our virtual drive.\n\n407\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.630\nThat stores all the binaries necessary for\n\n408\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.930\nthe application\nvirtualization to take place.\n\n409\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.730\nAll the settings and all the stuff\nnecessary are referenced and stored there.\n\n410\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.220\nSo just make sure you know that cuz as\nwe go through and do the sequencing,\n\n411\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.050\nwe create the Q drive map, and we store\nall that information as part of that.\n\n412\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:34.144\nSo just wanna make sure we have a general\nsense of the overview of the logic here.\n\n413\n00:20:34.144 --> 00:20:37.780\nIf we can go back in or back in,\nI should say, right over there.\n\n414\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.206\nSo we have this all captured for\nyou here on the web page.\n\n415\n00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:43.240\nYou can refer to everything I was\njust suggesting to you, right here.\n\n416\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.590\nThe overview just gives us\na general idea of what we can do.\n\n417\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.870\nAll the settings that are captured,\neverything that goes on,\n\n418\n00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.730\nas I mentioned, is listed here.\n\n419\n00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.640\nHow we go through and implement\nServer App-V, which we'll go through and\n\n420\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.560\nshow you in a walk-through,\nwe'll be taking a look at.\n\n421\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.300\nWe'll take a look at how to deploy\nthe agent, the sequencer and\n\n422\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.120\njust capture a sequence package.\n\n423\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.550\nAnd I mentioned the difference\nbetween App-V and Server App-V.\n\n424\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.903\nHave a little chart here on the TechNet\nwebsite that just goes through that\n\n425\n00:21:08.903 --> 00:21:09.888\ndifference for you.\n\n426\n00:21:09.888 --> 00:21:13.441\nAs I suggested, the key defining\ncharacteristic is what is the target of\n\n427\n00:21:13.441 --> 00:21:16.247\nthe endpoint for\nrunning the virtualized application?\n\n428\n00:21:16.247 --> 00:21:20.682\nApp-V is a desktop end user\napplication for virtualized apps.\n\n429\n00:21:20.682 --> 00:21:24.442\nYou may, for instance, through systems\nthat are config manager, if you run that\n\n430\n00:21:24.442 --> 00:21:28.439\nproduct, be deploying virtualized apps as\npart of an application deployment cycle.\n\n431\n00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:32.849\nAnd you're using App-V technology to do\nthat down to a Windows 10 endpoint where\n\n432\n00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:36.648\nyou're running a virtualized office or\nsomething like that, right.\n\n433\n00:21:36.648 --> 00:21:41.450\nWhereas Server App-V is focused at\nthe backend server stacks, and really just\n\n434\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.350\nvirtualizing out packages and deploying\nthem there into our server infrastructure.\n\n435\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.600\nSo just so\nyou have a sense of that, right.\n\n436\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.700\nBut all the different things that you\nwanna be aware of here, installing\n\n437\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.490\nthe Server App virtualization, preparing\nthe applications with Server App-V,\n\n438\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.320\nbeing able to go through and use\nthe sequencer, the technical reference for\n\n439\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.460\nthat, troubleshooting in\ncase something goes wrong.\n\n440\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.500\nAlways good by the way,\nnot only in the real world, so\n\n441\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.010\nlook at those troubleshooting links.\n\n442\n00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.930\nBut also for exam preparation.\n\n443\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.540\nLove to get those questions out there,\nright, Microsoft does, about, hey,\n\n444\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.910\nthis technology, by the way,\nthis went wrong, common error,\n\n445\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.830\ncommon problem, how do I solve it?\n\n446\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.320\nThey love to harp on those things,\nright, so\n\n447\n00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.890\nyou wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n448\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.940\nAnd also just being able to understand\nthe overview of the technology\n\n449\n00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.200\nwould be good for you to take a look.\n\n450\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.290\nWe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe requirements here real quickly.\n\n451\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.703\nWhat kind of virtualization software\nrequirements do we have cuz it's always\n\n452\n00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:32.158\ngood to know about those as well.\n\n453\n00:22:32.158 --> 00:22:36.687\nWhen we think about virtualization or\nApp-V software requirements,\n\n454\n00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:41.528\nyou'll see we go back as far,\nactually, as Server 2003 R2 with SP2.\n\n455\n00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:44.670\nNot that you would necessarily be\nrunning that in production anymore.\n\n456\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.982\nShame on you, by the way, if you are.\n\n457\n00:22:45.982 --> 00:22:48.703\nI know you may still have a need to,\nand I understand why you're doing it.\n\n458\n00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:51.147\nBut remember it's no longer\nbeing managed and, therefore,\n\n459\n00:22:51.147 --> 00:22:52.517\nyou can't patch it effectively.\n\n460\n00:22:52.517 --> 00:22:54.825\nAnd that may present a security liability,\nright.\n\n461\n00:22:54.825 --> 00:22:59.560\nSo Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, for\ninstance, we can run all that.\n\n462\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.790\nSo you'll see the requirements here.\n\n463\n00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.628\nThen we can go in, and\nyou'll see specifically.\n\n464\n00:23:05.628 --> 00:23:08.300\nI didn't point it out on the last page,\nI'm gonna show you here real quick.\n\n465\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.120\nBut down at the bottom is where I got\nthe link to go to the next page that I'm\n\n466\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.960\nabout to show you.\n\n467\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.980\nJust like everything else we talk about,\nright.\n\n468\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.620\nWe have PowerShell commandlets\nthat we can use for Server App-V.\n\n469\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.352\nYou have to install them and\nmake them available, and\n\n470\n00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:21.604\nthe process of how to\ndo that is listed here.\n\n471\n00:23:21.604 --> 00:23:23.396\nAnd you can see what the commandlets are.\n\n472\n00:23:23.396 --> 00:23:26.050\nAnd, again,\njust from an exam preparation standpoint,\n\n473\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.604\nMicrosoft loves to ask about\nPowerShell commandlets.\n\n474\n00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:31.141\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Just remember, everybody is being told,\n\n475\n00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:35.291\nunofficially and even officially, hey,\nthis is another way to manage, another way\n\n476\n00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:39.400\nto optimize, another way to maintain, and\nyou do have to be aware of the interface.\n\n477\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.430\nSo you may wanna take a look at those.\n\n478\n00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.802\nBut, in addition, down here, besides\nthe sequencer commandlets and everything,\n\n479\n00:23:45.802 --> 00:23:50.127\nright, we just talk about what they are,\ngive you a little explanation of each one.\n\n480\n00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:52.766\nSo you may just wanna go in and\ntake a look at this page.\n\n481\n00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:57.192\nJust get a better sense of this and\nhow this is going to stand up for you,\n\n482\n00:23:57.192 --> 00:23:58.556\nright, so to speak.\n\n483\n00:23:58.556 --> 00:24:00.890\nAll right, so we've been through,\njust talked about the logic.\n\n484\n00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.899\nOf Server App V a little bit, how we set\nit up, what the software requirements are,\n\n485\n00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:07.960\nhow we're gonna go in and\nset up the agent and the cmdlets.\n\n486\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.610\nI've given you a general idea of this.\n\n487\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.690\nBy the way when you do use the cmdlets,\nyou're gonna import them,\n\n488\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.270\nremember we do have to import the modules\nin the generic version of PowerShell for\n\n489\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.820\nany of our support.\n\n490\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.690\nImport module command will be used, so\n\n491\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:26.040\nimport module Server App-V Agent is\nthe commandlet module you're gonna target.\n\n492\n00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.310\nSo you'll use the import module\nServer App-V Agent statement\n\n493\n00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.880\nto get those commands up and\nrunning, just so you know.\n\n494\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.737\nWhat we're gonna do is go through, and\n\n495\n00:24:33.737 --> 00:24:35.832\nwe're gonna take a look\nat how to actually.\n\n496\n00:24:35.832 --> 00:24:40.284\nI'll do a little hands on,\na little show and tell, if you will,\n\n497\n00:24:40.284 --> 00:24:44.960\nactually, to show you how this is\ngoing to be possible to operate.\n\n498\n00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.500\nAnd let me go, just real quick here,\nand let's go through and\n\n499\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.510\nshow you how we're going\nto actually deploy.\n\n500\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.700\nFirst of all, our server App-V agent and\n\n501\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.670\nthe sequencer rather on\nthe setup side on the server.\n\n502\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.550\nThen we'll talk about the agent, we'll\nquickly do a little capture of like WinZip\n\n503\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.710\nor 7zip program just to sequence it out\nreal quick, show you how that works.\n\n504\n00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.480\nSo what I've done is I'm\non my target server.\n\n505\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.530\nAnd I've mapped the drive just so\nthat I can go out and\n\n506\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.670\ngrab the install media for\nthe App-V Sequencer.\n\n507\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.450\nI'm in the virtual machine manager and\nthe server App-V Directory,\n\n508\n00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.730\nthere's sub folder there\nin the install media.\n\n509\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.160\nAnd the x64 folder, and\nI'm gonna run the sequence.\n\n510\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.370\nSet up program, the SEQ,\nS-E-Q setup, so sequencer setup.\n\n511\n00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.880\nJust gonna launch that real quick,\nextract the files here.\n\n512\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.470\nAnd we're just gonna run through\na quick wizard, not because installing\n\n513\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.410\nsoftware's hard, and\nI'm sure you don't need to see me do it.\n\n514\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.621\nBut I just wanna point out,\nthat we're gonna, for the most part,\n\n515\n00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:40.540\naccept the defaults here.\n\n516\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.990\nThere's really nothing\nwe're going to change.\n\n517\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.650\nBut I just want you to see the screens.\n\n518\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.840\nSo if you've never done it before,\n\n519\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.760\nat least you'll have a sense\nof what it looks like, right?\n\n520\n00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.520\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\njust run this really quickly.\n\n521\n00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.560\nApp-V Sequencer, click Next.\n\n522\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.110\nAccept our EULA, so accept our end-user\nlicense agreement, click Next.\n\n523\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.390\nWe've talked about the Customer\nImprovement Experience Program before,\n\n524\n00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.550\nup to you to decide if you wanna opt in or\nnot.\n\n525\n00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.060\nWe'll leave that at I do not want to\nright now, install the server app,\n\n526\n00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.790\nvirtualization sequencer too.\n\n527\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.800\nThis is our default path, by the way.\n\n528\n00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.390\nC programs, our C program files rather,\nx86 server app, virtualization sequencer.\n\n529\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.540\nPut it where you want, just so you know.\n\n530\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.890\nGonna go ahead, click Next.\n\n531\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.510\nIt's gonna take just a moment to do that.\n\n532\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.857\nWe need the Visual Studio C+,\n+, C++ 2005 Redistributable.\n\n533\n00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.540\nThat's what I wanted you to see.\n\n534\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.480\nIf it's not all ready on the system,\nwe go download it, grab it and\n\n535\n00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.590\ninstall it for you.\n\n536\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.630\nBut it is a requirement.\n\n537\n00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.035\nSo just be sure you're aware of that.\n\n538\n00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:34.930\nIt's a requirement for\n\n539\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.910\nalmost everything we do in most\nof our applications stacks today.\n\n540\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.020\nSo it's very likely you'll\nalready have it deployed.\n\n541\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.251\nAll right, so that's finished,\ndoesn't take very long to do that.\n\n542\n00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:46.379\nLet's go ahead just\nminimize here real quick.\n\n543\n00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:50.645\nAnd now what we're gonna do is\ncome over here, just go out here,\n\n544\n00:26:50.645 --> 00:26:53.182\ngonna go look for our App-V program.\n\n545\n00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:57.368\nYou'll see right here Microsoft server\napplication virtualization sequence server\n\n546\n00:26:57.368 --> 00:26:58.234\njust installed.\n\n547\n00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:01.370\nSo we're gonna right-click on that,\njust do a little pin to Start,\n\n548\n00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.700\nand have it available so\nwe can grab it easily.\n\n549\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.650\nGonna right-click on that, and\ndo a Run As Administrator.\n\n550\n00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.300\nJust go ahead and bring that up,\nand you'll see the screen there.\n\n551\n00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.320\nWhat we're going to do is\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n552\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.290\nrun the application virtualization\nsequencer to actually capture\n\n553\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.060\na program that we would\nwant to virutalize.\n\n554\n00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.120\nAs I said we'll do a 7-Zip right,\nso a very small program.\n\n555\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.510\nWe're going to run through the sequencer\nafter we take a look at how to do\n\n556\n00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:28.170\nthe sequencing and the capturing and then\nwe'll go to the other side of the divide.\n\n557\n00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.270\nGo to another server that we want to\nbe able to run that application on.\n\n558\n00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.960\nAnd we'll install the agent to receive it.\n\n559\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.650\nThat's what we're gonna do now, okay?\n\n560\n00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.640\nSo you're with me?\n\n561\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're basically just going to\nbe installing Seven Zip like we would.\n\n562\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:44.910\nThe sequencer captures our steps and then\nsaves that state for further deployments.\n\n563\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.518\nAm I with you?\n\n564\n00:27:45.518 --> 00:27:47.120\nYou are 100% with me.\n\n565\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.940\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n[LAUGH] Wait, over here.\n\n566\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go, all right,\nit's a moving fist bump.\n\n567\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.530\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nlet's get started here.\n\n568\n00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.970\nSo, Server App Virtualization Sequencer.\n\n569\n00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.000\nI'm gonna just move\nthe window over here just so\n\n570\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.150\nyou can kinda see the edge of that,\nyou're not missing anything.\n\n571\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.390\nWe're gonna go ahead here,\n\n572\n00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.280\nyou got two options,\nright it's pretty straightforward.\n\n573\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.500\nCreate a new virtual app package and\nor modify an existing one.\n\n574\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.260\nSo, we don't have one,\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n575\n00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.270\nBut once we create one, if we do\nneed to edit it out for any reason,\n\n576\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.020\ngo in and obviously edit it right here.\n\n577\n00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.100\nAll right, so\nlet's create that real quick.\n\n578\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.170\nWe then have the screen here where we have\nto go in and prepare the computer for\n\n579\n00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.770\ncreating virtual package.\n\n580\n00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.560\nIt's says here other applications\nare running, stop these before continuing?\n\n581\n00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.380\nRemember if we have anything else\nrunning that will get captured as\n\n582\n00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.780\npart of the state we might not want that.\n\n583\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.910\nNow what do we have running?\n\n584\n00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.710\nWell we have a few things here right.\n\n585\n00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.856\nI've got server manager up and running,\nso it's telling me I have that,\n\n586\n00:28:35.856 --> 00:28:37.296\nprobably want to get rid of that.\n\n587\n00:28:37.296 --> 00:28:40.339\nI've got explorer open so\nI probably want to get rid of that so\n\n588\n00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:41.960\nwe'll close that out, right?\n\n589\n00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.240\nSo let's just go back and refresh there\nand you'll see that now that I close those\n\n590\n00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.940\napplications out, the screen says,\nokay hey, there's nothing else running.\n\n591\n00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.850\nYou're ready to go.\n\n592\n00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.500\nAnd it's an important, but it's a subtle\nI should say, but important point here.\n\n593\n00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.600\nEverything that's running that's open on\nthe taskbar, essentially, down below is\n\n594\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.310\ngonna get captured as part of the state of\nthis computer when we do the sequencing.\n\n595\n00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:06.080\nAnd if you don't want to deploy\nthose apps configured that way,\n\n596\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.960\nyou gotta shut them off.\n\n597\n00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.280\nThat's why we warn you before\nwe actually do anything here.\n\n598\n00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.460\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n599\n00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.950\nSo I went and I closed those out.\n\n600\n00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.343\nYou can see now we're ready to go.\n\n601\n00:29:13.343 --> 00:29:14.780\nLet's click Next here.\n\n602\n00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.330\nLet's go ahead and\nselect the installer for the application.\n\n603\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.280\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo the following.\n\n604\n00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.100\nI'm gonna type this in.\n\n605\n00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.760\nJust give me one second,\n\n606\n00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.100\njust have to type of the path in here\nto where we're gonna get that from.\n\n607\n00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.560\nplebdc01, and that's going to be SW4.\n\n608\n00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.237\nSoftware\n&gt;&gt; You're just mapping to that location of\n\n609\n00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:33.708\nthat in the site file, right?\n\n610\n00:29:33.708 --> 00:29:35.330\nYeah just where I have it set up right.\n\n611\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.780\nSo its just sitting out\non our domain controller.\n\n612\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.819\nSo I'm just going to do that 7-Zip and\n\n613\n00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:45.880\nthen 7 Z 920.MSI.\n\n614\n00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.470\nAll right so we're going to go grab that.\n\n615\n00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.335\nClick Next there, virtual app package\nname, what do we want to call it.\n\n616\n00:29:53.335 --> 00:29:55.728\nNow you can call this anything\nthat you would like, but\n\n617\n00:29:55.728 --> 00:29:59.111\nobviously if you give it a name based on\nwhat the application is it's probably\n\n618\n00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:02.566\ngoing to make a lot more sense to you then\nif you call it something random right?\n\n619\n00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:06.901\nLike look it's mickey mouse, but it's\nreally seven zip probably not a good idea.\n\n620\n00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:10.683\nAll right, so we also have after we\ngive it a name, edit advanced here and\n\n621\n00:30:10.683 --> 00:30:13.597\nyou'll see that we have our\nvirtual drive as I told you,\n\n622\n00:30:13.597 --> 00:30:16.210\nthe queue drive that's\nmapped there by default.\n\n623\n00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.980\nBut we could change that if we want to.\n\n624\n00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.238\nRemember, that's just the default\nvirtual drive that we start with.\n\n625\n00:30:21.238 --> 00:30:23.714\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nmodify this, right?\n\n626\n00:30:23.714 --> 00:30:28.579\nAnd we're gonna specify instead of Q,\nlet me just specify here.\n\n627\n00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:32.284\nC, and then we're gonna do Program Files.\n\n628\n00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:40.980\nAnd this is gonna be Program Files x86,\nwe'll do that.\n\n629\n00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Which is something to think\nabout because maybe not all well.\n\n630\n00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.130\nNo all machines up like you\nhad given you said look we're\n\n631\n00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.110\nnot supposed to be using 2003 so we should\nall be on a x86 platform at this point and\n\n632\n00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.480\ntime we don't need to worry about\ndifferent architecture versions right?\n\n633\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.670\nWell, again,\nit would depend on what you're running.\n\n634\n00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.310\nIn other words, for the most part, yes.\n\n635\n00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.927\nIn theory, should we be running 64-bit OSs\ntoday in the enterprise, in our stack?\n\n636\n00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:06.378\nThat would be the standard.\n\n637\n00:31:06.378 --> 00:31:10.107\nI mean it's rare today that you would have\nolder infrastructure that wouldn't be\n\n638\n00:31:10.107 --> 00:31:12.990\nrunning on 64 bit,\nthat's not saying it wouldn't happen.\n\n639\n00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.570\nThere are many applications and\n\n640\n00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.490\nstacks out there that are still\nrunning in older infrastructure.\n\n641\n00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.460\nBut the standard for\nnew deployments in 64 bit because\n\n642\n00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.690\nwe just don't really make anything that\nruns 32 bit anymore going forward.\n\n643\n00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.450\nAll of our stack applications in\nthe enterprise in other words.\n\n644\n00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.430\nI'm not talking about things like 7zip and\noffice.\n\n645\n00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.290\nI'm talking about exchange server,\nshare point, that kind of stuff.\n\n646\n00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.931\nAll that stuffs all 64 bit only.\n\n647\n00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:36.583\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n648\n00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:40.846\nthere really is not 32 bit option anymore\nfor the most part unless we're talking\n\n649\n00:31:40.846 --> 00:31:45.193\nabout a vendor specific install that's\nunique or a custom developed app, right?\n\n650\n00:31:45.193 --> 00:31:47.740\nBecause obviously, if you're custom\ndeveloping, all bets are off.\n\n651\n00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.833\nYou may be running something that's gonna\nbe a multiversion technology based on\n\n652\n00:31:51.833 --> 00:31:52.443\nthe needs.\n\n653\n00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:55.487\nBut if we're just talking standard\ndefault stuff, it's all gonna be here.\n\n654\n00:31:55.487 --> 00:31:56.818\nIt's all gonna be 64-bit today.\n\n655\n00:31:56.818 --> 00:31:59.219\nSo that would be The standard\nwe would expect.\n\n656\n00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:00.751\nAll right, so we've got that here.\n\n657\n00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:02.810\nWe're just gonna path that out there.\n\n658\n00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.490\nMake sure that that's typed correctly.\n\n659\n00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.750\nIt looks like it is.\n\n660\n00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.840\nAll right, so\nthe install will start momentarily.\n\n661\n00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.680\nWe're waiting for the installer to go\nout essentially and to find this for us.\n\n662\n00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.700\nIt adds the application.\n\n663\n00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.116\nIt takes a minute, or so.\n\n664\n00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:17.820\nYou could see it's kinda three quarters\nof the way through approximately.\n\n665\n00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.390\nBut we just have to wait for\nit to do its job.\n\n666\n00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.390\nOnce we get it all loaded there\nwe're gonna get a run prompt.\n\n667\n00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.266\nYou've seen that before, so\nwe're gonna see that here.\n\n668\n00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:28.528\nAll right, now, brings it up.\n\n669\n00:32:28.528 --> 00:32:32.190\nYou'll see that the 7-Zip\nsetup is about to start.\n\n670\n00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.750\nJust gonna move that over just a smidge.\n\n671\n00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.508\nAll right?\n\n672\n00:32:35.508 --> 00:32:38.470\nAnd actually what I wanna do before we\nrun it, let me just bring this down for\n\n673\n00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.640\njust half a second.\n\n674\n00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.380\nAnd you can see here that we have,\n\n675\n00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.480\nin the back end, the ability to be\nable to specify unfinished installing.\n\n676\n00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.921\nThere's no additional programs\nto install when we're done,\n\n677\n00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:50.540\nwe'll come back to that in just a second.\n\n678\n00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.530\nAll right, so let's just come over here,\nkinda got that right there.\n\n679\n00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.240\nAll right, so, now, what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n680\n00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.070\nwe're going to essentially step\nthrough the install, right?\n\n681\n00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.540\nSo, I'll click Next,\nwe'll accept the EULA.\n\n682\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.940\nClick Next,\nspecify whatever features we want.\n\n683\n00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.670\nYou've got to remember every app is\ngonna be slightly different when we do\n\n684\n00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.260\nthe install, so\nyou'll often load more options.\n\n685\n00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.740\nYou may make choices there,\n7-Zip's about as simple as it gets.\n\n686\n00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.690\nNot a lot of options,\nnot a lot of choices.\n\n687\n00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.950\nBut you get the general idea, right?\n\n688\n00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.427\nSo, we'll do that click next, right?\n\n689\n00:33:20.427 --> 00:33:21.585\nWe're ready to install,\n\n690\n00:33:21.585 --> 00:33:25.174\njust go ahead let it do it's install very\nquick doesn't take very long go ahead.\n\n691\n00:33:25.174 --> 00:33:26.915\nAnd we'll click finish there, right?\n\n692\n00:33:26.915 --> 00:33:29.477\nSo, we've got all that set up,\nwe've gone through accepted the EULA,\n\n693\n00:33:29.477 --> 00:33:31.039\nwe've accepted the we've finished it up.\n\n694\n00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:35.071\nNow, that we're done, we haven't nothing\nelse to install in theory if we were gonna\n\n695\n00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:37.759\nsequence multiple applications\ninto a single package,\n\n696\n00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:39.690\nwe may install other stuff, right?\n\n697\n00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.790\nMaybe we want 7-Zip and then Office, maybe\nwe want the package to do both, who knows.\n\n698\n00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.220\nSo, we could have more than one.\n\n699\n00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.870\nBut for now,\nlet's just assume we're done installing.\n\n700\n00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.080\nSo, we're gonna click I\nam finished installing,\n\n701\n00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.890\ncheck that off notice the run box\ngoes grey, we can't run anymore apps.\n\n702\n00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.664\nWhen I unchecked it, it was available, so\nI could run other things if I wanted to.\n\n703\n00:33:57.664 --> 00:34:00.180\nAll right, so go ahead and\ndo that, click next.\n\n704\n00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.370\nCollecting system changes, now,\n\n705\n00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.880\nwe're going in a profile\nthe registry of the system.\n\n706\n00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.330\nProfiling the state of the application\ninstalled, all the changes,\n\n707\n00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.890\nall the information,\nall the data associated with it.\n\n708\n00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.380\nTakes a moment, or so,\ndoesn't take very long.\n\n709\n00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.010\nBut you'll see it does say, hey, by\nthe way, depending on the size of the app,\n\n710\n00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.130\nit may take a little bit.\n\n711\n00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.220\nSo, we'll just wait for\nthat to finish, and\n\n712\n00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:25.060\nonce that's done we'll get our screen here\nthat shows us we're complete right there.\n\n713\n00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.710\nPerfect time, I couldn't have asked for\nthat to be scripted better if I tried.\n\n714\n00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.900\nAll right, so 7-Zip file manager, it's got\nthe command line there for the executable,\n\n715\n00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.530\nthe help file, the CHM file and the\ncommand prompt, you'll see command.exe.\n\n716\n00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.830\nSo, all that stuff associated\nwith the program is there.\n\n717\n00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.230\nWe could see all of it and\nsee what's going on with it.\n\n718\n00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.631\nSo, now, that we're done, we're gonna\ngo ahead and we're gonna click Next.\n\n719\n00:34:48.658 --> 00:34:51.553\nAgain, just collecting some more changes,\njust standardizing everything,\n\n720\n00:34:51.553 --> 00:34:52.944\nmaking sure that everything is good.\n\n721\n00:34:56.995 --> 00:34:59.773\nThose are just the program shortcuts that\nwe were showing you, so we have no reason\n\n722\n00:34:59.773 --> 00:35:02.193\nto execute those, in case you were\nwondering why we didn't run them.\n\n723\n00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:04.070\nCuz nobody's going to run them,\nthey're already there.\n\n724\n00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.270\nAll right, so you see we're done,\npackage complete, we're looking for that.\n\n725\n00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.670\nIt says, we may have an unsupported\nfile extension detected.\n\n726\n00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.180\nNo big deal,\nthe file is excluded from the package.\n\n727\n00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.360\nThere may be some files excluded.\n\n728\n00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.120\nSo, you know,\nwe may want to check into that.\n\n729\n00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.160\nBut we're not too concerned about it for\nour discussion.\n\n730\n00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.140\nHere we'll click close and, now, you'll\nsee that we're actually in the sequencer,\n\n731\n00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.880\nbut we've opened the sequencer up\nwith the actual package loaded.\n\n732\n00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.440\nAgain, we just move this over here for\nyou another smidge, so\n\n733\n00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.820\nyou can see the edge of the screen there.\n\n734\n00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.780\nSo, we've got all that set up, and what we\nhave to do now is essentially save this\n\n735\n00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.060\noff, it's been completed, but we've\ngot to save it, so we can capture it.\n\n736\n00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.830\nSo, we're just going\nto go up here to file.\n\n737\n00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.450\nAnd we're going to go to save, right?\n\n738\n00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.620\nGo ahead and\nspecify what we're going to call this.\n\n739\n00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:51.470\nLet me just go in, and we'll call this\n7-Zip, I suppose, got that there.\n\n740\n00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.851\nI just want to note for you, I think,\nyou can see it, but sequence project,\n\n741\n00:35:55.851 --> 00:35:57.371\nsequencer project file.\n\n742\n00:35:57.371 --> 00:35:59.290\nAnd we've got an extension down there.\n\n743\n00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.460\nThat's our project file.\n\n744\n00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.280\nThat's the actual package\nthat is set up and sequenced.\n\n745\n00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.890\nWe want to leave that as the default,\nright?\n\n746\n00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.460\nWe don't want to be messing around in\nhere and changing it, as you can see.\n\n747\n00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.420\nSo, we've got that set up right there,\n7-Zip, we're saving it there.\n\n748\n00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.460\nLet's just go ahead and do Save.\n\n749\n00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.160\nLet that do its thing, boom, we're done.\n\n750\n00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.490\nOkay, so that part is now finished and\nwe're all set, ready to go.\n\n751\n00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.390\nNow, we've essentially, at that point,\nsaved off our sequence package.\n\n752\n00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.200\nNow, we're gonna flip over to the other\nserver where we want to receive that\n\n753\n00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.390\nServer App-V package, and install\nthe Application Virtualization Agent,\n\n754\n00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.820\nthis piece of software that lets\nthat server become a receiver for\n\n755\n00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.440\nvirtualized apps, and\ncollect them and run them.\n\n756\n00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.830\nSo, we're gonna show you\nhow to do that right now.\n\n757\n00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:43.260\nLet me just flip over here to\nour Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n758\n00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.800\nJust give me just one second.\n\n759\n00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.769\nWe also just make sure our\ntime doesn't run out there.\n\n760\n00:36:47.769 --> 00:36:51.320\nLet me go over here to our\nVirtual Machine Manager server.\n\n761\n00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.380\nIt's probably looking familiar to you.\n\n762\n00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.290\nIf you remember the other episodes,\nwe've been in there testing and demoing.\n\n763\n00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.940\nYou've seen me using this box.\n\n764\n00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.320\nSo, on the VMM system\nwe're gonna go ahead.\n\n765\n00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.990\nAnd we're gonna go run the agent setup,\nlet me just go in and path to this.\n\n766\n00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.779\nWe'll go into Program Files\nin the C drive, and\n\n767\n00:37:07.779 --> 00:37:11.487\nwe'll go into System Center 2012 R-2.\n\n768\n00:37:11.487 --> 00:37:17.300\nAnd Virtual Machine Manager and SAV for\nserver application virtualization.\n\n769\n00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.141\nx64, this is where we were mapped\nto just a few minutes ago as\n\n770\n00:37:20.141 --> 00:37:21.848\nI drove the install int he other box.\n\n771\n00:37:21.848 --> 00:37:24.004\nIt's just that it happens\nto be on this box local, so\n\n772\n00:37:24.004 --> 00:37:25.330\nwe're just pathing to it here.\n\n773\n00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.780\nAnd then we're gonna run agentsetup,\nexe right there.\n\n774\n00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.430\nRemember, we talked about bringing\nin the PowerShell commandlets,\n\n775\n00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.070\nagent commandlets setup is right above it.\n\n776\n00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.660\nIf you're gonna be able\nto want to do that,\n\n777\n00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.680\nyou have the capability\nto run that right there.\n\n778\n00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.440\nSo, let's go ahead and do that real quick,\nall right, so we've got that.\n\n779\n00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.840\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nrun the wizard, so we'll click Next.\n\n780\n00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.230\nGo ahead, accept the licensing terms,\n\n781\n00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:51.040\npretty straightforward again standard\ninstall directory, no big deal.\n\n782\n00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.320\nSays, that we do need the distributable,\nit'll be made available, or installed,\n\n783\n00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.520\ngreat, we know that.\n\n784\n00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.060\nWe'll just let it do its\nthing here real quick.\n\n785\n00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.430\nGet all that setup and\nas soon as it's done,\n\n786\n00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.940\nit won't take very long,\nwe've got our agent set up.\n\n787\n00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.206\nAnd so, now, if we wanted to\nactually provide that package and\n\n788\n00:38:08.206 --> 00:38:10.618\nrun it here virtually,\nwe'd be able to do so.\n\n789\n00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:13.498\nCuz this is all we have to do to set up\nthose sides of divide sequence out of\n\n790\n00:38:13.498 --> 00:38:17.140\npackage, and actually make it available,\nso that we can run it.\n\n791\n00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so,\nthey would just be connecting-\n\n792\n00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:19.110\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da.\n\n793\n00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Ta-da!\n\n794\n00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.706\nThey would just be connecting\ngrabbing that package and ta-da!\n\n795\n00:38:23.706 --> 00:38:26.640\n[LAUGH] Pretty cool-\n&gt;&gt; You're better at that than I am.\n\n796\n00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, tah-dah.\n\n797\n00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.212\nSo, that's actually how we set\nup application virtualization,\n\n798\n00:38:30.212 --> 00:38:31.632\nServer App-V, from start to finish.\n\n799\n00:38:31.632 --> 00:38:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, well, thank you for\nshowing us how to do that.\n\n800\n00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.120\nAnd providing at least the necessary\nterminology to make sure that we can not\n\n801\n00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.660\nonly execute, but we sound intelligent\nwhile we're doing so, right?\n\n802\n00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.950\n&gt;&gt; It's always important.\n\n803\n00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n804\n00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.040\nWell, thank you ladies and\ngentleman for joining us as well.\n\n805\n00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.440\nStay tuned we have more information\nheaded your way, but for\n\n806\n00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.480\nthis show we will go ahead and sign out.\n\n807\n00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.150\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n808\n00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.930\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n809\n00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.503\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n810\n00:38:54.503 --> 00:38:56.802\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n811\n00:38:56.802 --> 00:39:02.717\n[MUSIC]\n\n812\n00:39:02.717 --> 00:39:05.874\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.254\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:12.042\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, welcome\nto another great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.900\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.940\nit looks like it might be MCSC with\na chance of partly cloudy, right?\n\n8\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.259\nThat's right, private Cloud stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.490\nJoining us back in the studio again, our\ngood friend and mentor Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.970\nAdam, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Na new, na new.\n\n12\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Na new, na new.\n\n13\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.865\n&gt;&gt; Na new, na new.\n\n14\n00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.355\nIt is going well, it is going well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.655\nHopefully well for you as well.\n\n16\n00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:37.905\nOtherwise, it would not be well.\n\n17\n00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.645\nAnd that would, of course, be bad.\n\n18\n00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:40.785\n&gt;&gt; You could fall down a well.\n\n19\n00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:41.543\n&gt;&gt; You could.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:42.198\n&gt;&gt; That would not be good.\n\n21\n00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:42.916\n&gt;&gt; You would not be well.\n\n22\n00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:44.334\n&gt;&gt; You would not be well\nif you fell down a well.\n\n23\n00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:45.467\nThat would not be good.\n\n24\n00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:49.517\nSo we are gonna promised in our last few\nepisodes that we would do some hands-on\n\n25\n00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:51.547\ndemonstrations and\nshow you how to do things.\n\n26\n00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:53.421\nWe are gonna pick up on that thread and\ndo that right now.\n\n27\n00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:57.653\nWe are going to show you how to deploy\na SCOM agent through the console,\n\n28\n00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:00.757\nleverage that to then\ndo a network discovery.\n\n29\n00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:03.747\nAnd bring those two things together,\ndoing age of configuration and\n\n30\n00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:06.197\ndiscovery, all in one as we say.\n\n31\n00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:08.452\nSo we are going to jump in and begin.\n\n32\n00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:11.644\nWe have our SCOM Ops Manager Console\nopen and we're gonna go ahead,\n\n33\n00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:14.150\nwe're gonna take a look\nat how to kick this off.\n\n34\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.530\nSo we're in the admin workspace and\nyou've seen me doing elements of this\n\n35\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.840\nduring our discussion in\nsome of the prior episodes.\n\n36\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.200\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndo a discovery of a Windows computer,\n\n37\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.650\nthen deploy the agent to\nthat Windows computer, so\n\n38\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.470\nwe can then actually use\nit to do other things.\n\n39\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.310\nSo we're gonna do this in\ncouple of different ways.\n\n40\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210\nWe can either go to the landing page\non the admin overview here, and\n\n41\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.200\nclick on, required configure computers and\ndevices to manage, we have that option.\n\n42\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.500\nWe could simply, as you've seen me do,\ncome down here to Device Management.\n\n43\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.910\nWe'll just click here to get\nthat to move for us real quick.\n\n44\n00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.847\nAnd when we do that, we could right-click,\ndo Discovery Wizard,\n\n45\n00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:53.919\nit would essentially take\nus to the same place.\n\n46\n00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:55.780\nIt doesn't really matter how we do this.\n\n47\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.770\nSo either way, we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll click discovery Windows computer or\n\n48\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.371\nWindows computers I should say.\n\n49\n00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.452\nI'm just gonna move this\nover a little bit so\n\n50\n00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:06.870\nyou guys can see that while I\nam sitting and talking to you.\n\n51\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.903\nAnd Windows computers, we're gonna go\nahead and do that discovery method.\n\n52\n00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:12.750\nHighlight that, or\ndefault one, click Next.\n\n53\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.432\nWe can do either an automated\ndiscovery as you can see,\n\n54\n00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:19.760\nand/or we could do an Advanced Discovery.\n\n55\n00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.790\nAutomatic or automated,\nscans our domain for any and\n\n56\n00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.230\nall Windows computers,\nreturns back a complete list.\n\n57\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.881\nAdvanced Discovery, let's just specify,\nhey, do you wanna do server and\n\n58\n00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.020\nclient discovery?\n\n59\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.780\nWhat kind of device and class?\n\n60\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.295\nServer only, client only.\n\n61\n00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:37.495\nAnd what management server we're\ngonna use, if there's more than one,\n\n62\n00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:39.150\nin the management group.\n\n63\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.520\nWe can reach into the resource pool and\n\n64\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.710\nchoose which one we want\nto use specifically.\n\n65\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.960\nSo that will be something\nwe can decide to do.\n\n66\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.870\nWe're just gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndo Automatic computer discovery here.\n\n67\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.330\nJust get all the information back.\n\n68\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.024\nNotice, by the way, settings over here,\nmenu options change, excuse me.\n\n69\n00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:59.230\nAs I click here, you'll notice we\nthen have some different choices.\n\n70\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.140\nSo we'll do automatic and\n\n71\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.100\nthen when we click Next, we have to\nspecify the account we're gonna use.\n\n72\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.680\nAre we gonna use service account?\n\n73\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.350\nIf so, what is that managed service\naccount that we're gonna use?\n\n74\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.350\nUse selected management service account,\nor Action Account.\n\n75\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.060\nThat's the one we have already been using.\n\n76\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.900\nWe can specify a different\naccount if we want to.\n\n77\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.850\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do this,\nand then we're gonna click Discover.\n\n78\n00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:21.880\nAnd that will take a moment.\n\n79\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.764\nWe're gonna go to our progress bar,\ngoing through there.\n\n80\n00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:26.000\nIt won't take too long.\n\n81\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.900\nAnd then once we get that coming up,\nwe'll get a list of all the items or\n\n82\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.070\nthe machines that will be able\nto potentially interact with.\n\n83\n00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.480\nSo we'll wait for this to come back and\nshow us what's there.\n\n84\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.520\nWe're gonna choose the VMM machine.\n\n85\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.762\nVirtual machine management machine.\n\n86\n00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:44.451\nIn the last episode, before this one,\nwe were actually talking about the fact,\n\n87\n00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:46.640\nthat let's do the fabric integration.\n\n88\n00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.040\nAnd we want to tie VMM and the ops\nmanager together for monitoring purposes.\n\n89\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.820\nThat one of the key steps in\nthat process would be that,\n\n90\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.700\nonce we get the Ops Manager Console\ninstalled on the VMM Machine, we get all\n\n91\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720\nof the management packs we need installed\nand interacting on the SCOM side.\n\n92\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.669\nThat the next big thing we would do on\nour way to getting set up would be to put\n\n93\n00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.326\nthe agent on the VMM Machine and\n\n94\n00:04:08.326 --> 00:04:11.611\nultimately all the VM's that\nare gonna be monitored there.\n\n95\n00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.282\nSo we're gonna be able to do that,\n\n96\n00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:16.231\nor do this piece of it as we should\nsay by way of doing our demo.\n\n97\n00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.400\nSo we're gonna find our VMM machine,\nit's sitting right there.\n\n98\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.756\nPlaid VMM 01.\n\n99\n00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:24.445\nNow just to show you what we're ultimately\ngonna wind up doing, we're gonna go ahead\n\n100\n00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.636\nand we're gonna put that Microsoft\nmonitoring agent out there, right?\n\n101\n00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:30.232\nAnd remember,\nwe've talked about the monitoring agent.\n\n102\n00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:34.710\nMonitoring agents found in the console or\nexcuse me, in the Control Panel.\n\n103\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.180\nAnd it's gonna be a piece of software\nthat allows us to control, monitor and\n\n104\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.500\npull data off the system and upload it.\n\n105\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.610\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n106\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.960\nWe should always just take\na look at what we're doing and\n\n107\n00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.020\nmake sure we have a sense\nof what's already deployed.\n\n108\n00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.440\nWe'll go to Control Panel real quick\non the machine that we're using here.\n\n109\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.179\nJust do this.\n\n110\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.090\nWe could see Microsoft Monitoring Agent,\nlet's move this over so you can see it.\n\n111\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.870\nIs already deployed here on\nthe server that we're using.\n\n112\n00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.265\nSo this is what we're gonna wind up\nputting out into the VMM machine.\n\n113\n00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:04.940\nThis is where we're gonna do a console\npush in order to be able to deploy.\n\n114\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.922\nSo, just showing you that real quick.\n\n115\n00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:09.890\nWe've highlighted our VMM machine,\nlet's click Next there.\n\n116\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.360\nWe then have our agent installation\ndirectory, where are we gonna install?\n\n117\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.054\nDefault is percent program files percent.\n\n118\n00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:19.696\nSo it's gonna substitute in the variable\npath for the program files,\n\n119\n00:05:19.696 --> 00:05:20.998\ninstall on the machine.\n\n120\n00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:25.534\nc:program files Microsoft monitoring agent\non the machine we're gonna target, so\n\n121\n00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.794\nwe're gonna go there.\n\n122\n00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:31.740\nAnd then you'll see we specify the local\nsystem account and or another account.\n\n123\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.720\nWe'll choose the local system account,\nit'll install under the guise of that.\n\n124\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.340\nWe'll then go ahead and\nwe will click Finish.\n\n125\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.970\nGive that a moment.\n\n126\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.291\nWe get our task status coming up.\n\n127\n00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:43.357\nDoesn't take very long for this to run.\n\n128\n00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:44.880\nSo we'll get that started out.\n\n129\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.910\nAnd remember we did talk about\nthe fact when we were doing this, and\n\n130\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.560\nI'll just explode this out full size so\nyou can see it running.\n\n131\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.460\nWe talked about the fact that we could\nclose this, go to the task status view.\n\n132\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.280\nRemember up in the monitoring area and\nwe could always pull this back up and\n\n133\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.220\nsee it if we wanted to see\nit while it was running.\n\n134\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.360\nWe could leave it running here,\nwouldn't be a big deal either way.\n\n135\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.720\nJust wait for this to come up,\nsee that the task has started there so\n\n136\n00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.870\nwe can see the status.\n\n137\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.568\nIt will take a few minutes for\nthis to actually go through,\n\n138\n00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:12.507\nso we will go ahead and\njust let this cook.\n\n139\n00:06:12.507 --> 00:06:14.737\nWe'll come right on back and\nas soon as this is done,\n\n140\n00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:17.030\nwe'll actually show you the results and\nkeep going.\n\n141\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.518\nI was ready and then you said,\nwhenever you're ready.\n\n142\n00:06:21.518 --> 00:06:22.556\nAm I done?\n\n143\n00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:24.442\nMy whole mental focus is gone.\n\n144\n00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:25.336\nI'm out of the head space.\n\n145\n00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:26.046\nI have no idea what we're doing.\n\n146\n00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:27.223\n&gt;&gt; I can't work like this.\n\n147\n00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:28.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I cannot do this anymore.\n\n148\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.320\nAll right, are you good Meagan?\n\n149\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.289\nCan I go?\nYeah, okay.\n\n150\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.370\nAll right, so you can see we\nactually have finished our install.\n\n151\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.970\nSuccess is always a good thing,\nwe like to see that.\n\n152\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.410\nAnd so we'll close out our monitor\nhere and then we'll be able to go in.\n\n153\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.560\nAnd now, let's just go over\nthe VMM machine real quick.\n\n154\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.900\nWe'll see the monitoring agents there,\n\n155\n00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.570\nbut we'll now be able to use\nthat if we need to for anything.\n\n156\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.280\nWe're gonna park that for the moment and\n\n157\n00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.530\ncome back to it in a little\nwhile in an upcoming demo.\n\n158\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.090\nBut let's come over here\nto our VMM console.\n\n159\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.270\nLet's just lower this one down real quick.\n\n160\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.078\nWe'll go into the Control Panel and\nwe'll just take a look and\n\n161\n00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:03.548\nsee that we actually do have our\nmonitoring agent just sitting right there.\n\n162\n00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.310\nJust move that over so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n163\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.840\nAnd you'll see it sitting right there,\n\n164\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.530\nit's been installed and\nwe can just bring that up.\n\n165\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.310\nAnd what we have right there,\n\n166\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.420\nwe can actually just center that\na little bit better for ya.\n\n167\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.690\nWhat we have is our\nMicrosoft monitoring agent.\n\n168\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.685\nRemember the SCOM agent has been\nrebranded, renamed in 12 R2.\n\n169\n00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:25.490\nSo we do see our management\ngroup as designated there.\n\n170\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.200\nWe could see that we do have our\nmanagement server where we installed from.\n\n171\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.886\nOr rather where we're told to connect\nto actually off plaid sys 02.\n\n172\n00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:39.103\nRunning the opps console, but S01 is\nactually the server where the opps server\n\n173\n00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:41.721\nis installed so\nthat's what we're pointing to.\n\n174\n00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:45.534\nOur port 5723, we've been talking about\ndifferent ports in the firewalls,\n\n175\n00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:48.420\nconfiguration, we went through\nall that in a prior episode.\n\n176\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.196\n5723 is used to drive\nthe configuration communication.\n\n177\n00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:56.135\nWe see assignment manual, and\nwe see assignment action is, rather,\n\n178\n00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:57.888\nagent action is local system.\n\n179\n00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:00.800\nWe do just have some basic\nproperties here really it just gives\n\n180\n00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.720\nus the build of the management\nagent install, nothing more.\n\n181\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.280\nWe also get automatic update\nmanagement group assignments from ADDS.\n\n182\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.790\nSo if we have the AD integration with\nall the different things we need, we can\n\n183\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.190\nessentially get automatic management group\nupdates and get that information there.\n\n184\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.700\nWe haven't talked about\nmulti-homing an agent yet,\n\n185\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.850\nwe'll have more to say about\nthis in upcoming episodes.\n\n186\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.765\nBut, if we need to multi-home the agent,\nwe actually can do that by adding in here\n\n187\n00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:31.541\nmanagement groups and we could specify\nadditional management groups that this\n\n188\n00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:34.484\nagent will report into,\nwhen we talk about our.\n\n189\n00:08:34.484 --> 00:08:37.930\nActually, we did mention it in prior\nepisodes in our discussion on update and\n\n190\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.610\nmigration, I did mention briefly the idea\nof being able to multi-home an agent.\n\n191\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.750\nWe'll have some more to say about it, but\nthe idea generically is that we could\n\n192\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.230\nactually have this agent reported into\ndifferent management groups if needed.\n\n193\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.390\nAnd this where we would actually\ngo to do that on the tab here.\n\n194\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.620\nJust add the appropriate\nmanagement groups in and\n\n195\n00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.450\nit will report into up to four\nof them at the same time.\n\n196\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.150\nSo we have the ability to\ndo that here if we need to.\n\n197\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.035\nSo we have that so\nwe could see the fruit of our labors.\n\n198\n00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:05.772\nAnd we can see that we have\nbeen successful at installing.\n\n199\n00:09:05.772 --> 00:09:09.078\nWe're gonna go back over to our\nconsole here for the ops console, and\n\n200\n00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:12.675\nwe're gonna continue marching through\nour discussion here and our demo.\n\n201\n00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:14.618\nAnd we're gonna take what we just did and\n\n202\n00:09:14.618 --> 00:09:17.498\nnow parlay that into\na slightly different approach.\n\n203\n00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:21.080\nWe're now gonna do the network\ndiscovery piece that I talked about and\n\n204\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.880\nwe hinted at in the prior episode.\n\n205\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.200\nWe actually did a little bit of the demo,\ndidn't walk all the way through it,\n\n206\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.520\nbut we're gonna go do a network discovery\nand show you how to find network devices.\n\n207\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.767\nSo we're gonna do another kind\nof discovery now in other words,\n\n208\n00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.650\nnow that we've pushed\nthe console agent out.\n\n209\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.520\nSo we'll come back here.\n\n210\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.780\nWe'll right-click again,\ndo Discovery Wizard one more time.\n\n211\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.840\nThis time,\nwe're gonna do network discovery.\n\n212\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.910\nCome down here, let me just move\nthis over while we're talking.\n\n213\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.460\nSo you guys can get a better\nsense of that on the screen.\n\n214\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.560\nWe'll click next,\n\n215\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.460\nwe're gonna give this a name,\nspecify what we're gonna do with this.\n\n216\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.030\nIt's always a good idea and we've talked\nabout this before, just while I'm typing\n\n217\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.060\nto name these things, something that\nmake sense to you contextually.\n\n218\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.600\nWhatever that means, I'm just gonna\ncall mine discover network devices but\n\n219\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.080\nyou obviously can call this\nwhatever you would like.\n\n220\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.860\nSo discover network devices,\n\n221\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.310\nobviously if you have a description you\nwant to add in there so much the better.\n\n222\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.750\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna choose my available server so\n\n223\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.760\nI'm gonna pull down, choose my\nmanagement server right from there.\n\n224\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.930\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna create a resource pool so\n\n225\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.750\nI'm gonna click here.\n\n226\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.290\nAnd I'm gonna create a resource pool,\ncuz I don't have one already created.\n\n227\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.860\nLet me just remind you of\nthe importance of resource pools here.\n\n228\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.580\nSo we can see that we do have our\nresource pool on our diagram for\n\n229\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.256\nour management servers.\n\n230\n00:10:34.256 --> 00:10:37.630\nThis is gonna be how we group them\ntogether for management and for\n\n231\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.670\nmonitoring and all the different things\nwe do from an administration standpoint.\n\n232\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.660\nWe may have different resource pools,\nmatter of fact,\n\n233\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.170\nwe do have several out of the box.\n\n234\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.710\nThere's one for AD immigration and\n\n235\n00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.810\nvarious different sets of things,\nexcuse me that we will have going on here.\n\n236\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.200\nSo we're gonna create one of this.\n\n237\n00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.108\nWe're gonna essentially create a resource\npool and group some servers together.\n\n238\n00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.510\nSo we're gonna give this a name,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n239\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.160\nwhat do you think we should call this Dan?\n\n240\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.010\nYou got any good naming ideas here for me?\n\n241\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.900\n&gt;&gt; Let's go for the resource pool one.\n\n242\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.930\nResource pool one,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.450\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n244\n00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.210\nI was gonna call it device discovery,\nbut we'll do resource pool one.\n\n245\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.240\nI think that's spelled correctly,\ncuz my machine is doing that whole\n\n246\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.080\ndarken the screen thing again, so\nI'm not quite sure if I spelled that.\n\n247\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.246\nIt could have written something like,\ngo ducks, I'm not sure-\n\n248\n00:11:18.246 --> 00:11:18.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n249\n00:11:18.906 --> 00:11:20.053\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I put there, but close enough.\n\n250\n00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:22.081\nWhatever it is,\nwe'll just call it whatever it is.\n\n251\n00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:23.838\nBut we're gonna call it resource pool one.\n\n252\n00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:26.925\nWe're gonna add some members here\nobviously creating the pool was good but\n\n253\n00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:29.780\nif we don't put any machines in it\nreally doesn't do us a lot of good.\n\n254\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.910\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nadd in the management server or\n\n255\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.210\nservers we want in the pool.\n\n256\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.780\nAnd this is how we do that right here.\n\n257\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.455\nWe'll click we're just gonna go ahead and\ndo a search here,\n\n258\n00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:42.935\nand you will see we have only machine\nthat we're using for demo purposes.\n\n259\n00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.745\nBut in the real world,\nwe would add in multiple management severs\n\n260\n00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:48.285\nto extend the pool out and\nmake it fault tolerant.\n\n261\n00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:50.867\nSo if we have a problem,\nit's gonna be highly available.\n\n262\n00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.707\nAnd we'll have more than one system there.\n\n263\n00:11:52.707 --> 00:11:56.797\nI talked about this one in prior episodes\nwhere we're not actually done here right?\n\n264\n00:11:56.797 --> 00:12:00.727\nBecause we've selected, move this over\nagain so you can see this off to the side.\n\n265\n00:12:00.727 --> 00:12:03.607\nRight if we don't hit Add here\nto bring this selection down,\n\n266\n00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:05.197\nwe don't get the OK button.\n\n267\n00:12:05.197 --> 00:12:07.657\nCuz we're not actually done,\nwe're like half way done here.\n\n268\n00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:10.157\nWe found what we need but\nwe haven't said yeah I want it.\n\n269\n00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:12.280\nSo we gotta highlight it,\nwe gotta click ad.\n\n270\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.153\nWe're going to do that right here.\n\n271\n00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:16.208\n&gt;&gt; That's really kind of misleading here,\nwhen you only have the one server because\n\n272\n00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:18.300\nit looks like, yeah,\nthat's the one I want, thanks.\n\n273\n00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.220\nIt's highlighted you're good to go.\n\n274\n00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.490\nBut if you had multiple servers in that\nlist, you would select one, click add.\n\n275\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.500\nSelect another one, click add.\n\n276\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.400\nAnd so on and so forth, so\nthat one would make a little more sense.\n\n277\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.420\nBut yeah [LAUGH].\n\n278\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.230\n&gt;&gt; It would make no more sense\ncuz it's just bad UI design.\n\n279\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.670\nBut just it is what it is.\n\n280\n00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.010\nIt's that whole thing I go off about it.\n\n281\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.460\nWhy can't it just close\nthe window when we're done?\n\n282\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.380\n&gt;&gt; Why can't they just do that?\n\n283\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.840\n&gt;&gt; Obviously if I've only got one selected\ndoesn't it just make sense to just-\n\n284\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.080\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was interesting with\n\n285\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.930\nthe sealed versus unsealed.\n\n286\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.020\nIt said yes if it was sealed,\nand nothing if it was no.\n\n287\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.450\nWhy not just put a check mark if it's\nsealed and the fact that there's yes and\n\n288\n00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.420\nI thought there would be a no but\nthere wasn't.\n\n289\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.068\nWeird design, our random aside for\nthis episode I guess.\n\n290\n00:12:56.068 --> 00:12:59.750\n&gt;&gt; This is why, and\nI can tell you why it happens right.\n\n291\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.570\nBecause, and I don't mean to be offensive\nto anybody when I say this, all kidding\n\n292\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.850\naside, but I'm just pointing out that\noften times the people that design those\n\n293\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.410\ninterfaces, right, very talented\ndevelopers, very talented UI people.\n\n294\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.790\nThey don't necessarily have a vision\nof how the product will be used,\n\n295\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.450\nthe same way that we may as IT\nadministrators and users of the product.\n\n296\n00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.670\nAnd to them that may make perfectly\ngood sense to say, yes if it is,\n\n297\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.410\nand the inverse is of course no.\n\n298\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.980\nWe would think, okay put a no up.\n\n299\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.720\nClearly they didn't do that.\n\n300\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.370\nThey just left it blank thinking,\nwell if it's not yes, must be no.\n\n301\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:34.050\nI guess in some worlds, somewhere\nsomewhere, somewhere somehow, that logic\n\n302\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.540\nplays and make sense, it just doesn't\nreally work as you're pointing out for\n\n303\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.775\ninstance for the average person who would\nlook at that differently and say, well\n\n304\n00:13:41.775 --> 00:13:45.365\ntell me the state, yes or no, and then\nI know and there's no guesswork there.\n\n305\n00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:49.535\nSo it is the disconnect between\ndevelopment UI design and\n\n306\n00:13:49.535 --> 00:13:53.032\nactual in the field use that often leads\nto some of these little quirky things\n\n307\n00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.562\nwe're talking about, so all right.\n\n308\n00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:58.442\nSo we're gonna go back and now that we've\nset the world right we're gonna go ahead,\n\n309\n00:13:58.442 --> 00:14:01.352\nget off our soap boxes and\nwe're gonna get back to work here.\n\n310\n00:14:01.352 --> 00:14:04.352\nSo we're gonna click OK, we've gone\nahead and created our selection or\n\n311\n00:14:04.352 --> 00:14:05.662\nindicated our selection.\n\n312\n00:14:05.662 --> 00:14:08.732\nWe got our resource pool machine there,\nwe're gonna click Next,\n\n313\n00:14:08.732 --> 00:14:11.412\njust finish up on the summary\nitem here and click Create.\n\n314\n00:14:11.412 --> 00:14:14.380\nLet that go real quick,\nyou can see we are successful.\n\n315\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.990\nAnd then we're back to where we were.\n\n316\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.820\nWe do now have our resource\npool available down below.\n\n317\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.630\nSo we've populated that by doing this.\n\n318\n00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:23.280\nWe're now gonna go ahead, and\n\n319\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.680\nwe're going to click Next here,\nwe're now gonna get our discovery method.\n\n320\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.110\nWe talked about explicit\nversus recursive discovery\n\n321\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.400\nin the run through that I did, the quick\ndemo I did last time in the episode.\n\n322\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.790\nExplicit goes out as you can see only\ndiscovers devices we specify versus\n\n323\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.480\nrecursive discovery will walk through and\nwill allow us to go out and\n\n324\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.450\nsee, specify, and or\ndiscover rather devices we specify.\n\n325\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.135\nAnd and all devices that are connected\nto devices that we specify.\n\n326\n00:14:54.135 --> 00:14:58.255\nSo, if we have something connected through\nthat device, we'll get a iterative or\n\n327\n00:14:58.255 --> 00:15:01.355\nrecursive shot at that, and\nwe'll actually ultimately get to see that.\n\n328\n00:15:01.355 --> 00:15:04.655\nWe're gonna do explicit discovery here,\nso we're gonna click Next.\n\n329\n00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:08.525\nWe're then gonna go ahead and specify\nthe run-as account for the discovery.\n\n330\n00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:10.105\nDo we have an account we're gonna use?\n\n331\n00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:11.425\nDo we need to create one?\n\n332\n00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:13.900\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate this account.\n\n333\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.510\nJust let me make sure that I take a look\nat what we need for our credential.\n\n334\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.065\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\ncreate our account here.\n\n335\n00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:19.971\nClick Next.\n\n336\n00:15:22.534 --> 00:15:23.324\nThere we go.\n\n337\n00:15:23.324 --> 00:15:27.460\nGonna click Next on our wizard, and\nthen we're gonna give it a display name.\n\n338\n00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.030\nAgain, we'll just keep it simple.\n\n339\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.950\nWe'll do Device Discovery here.\n\n340\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.390\nIn the real world you may give that\na little bit more of a meaningful name.\n\n341\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.620\nThat'll be up to you.\n\n342\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.720\nBut we're gonna do the credentials here.\n\n343\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.640\nThis is an SNMP Discovery account.\n\n344\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.820\nSo this is our either community\nstring account or SNMPv3 account.\n\n345\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.610\nRemember we talked about\nthese different types.\n\n346\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.373\nThis is the community string, you wanna\nthink of it as a password for SNMP.\n\n347\n00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:51.797\nIt's the challenge that\nwe need to provide, or\n\n348\n00:15:51.797 --> 00:15:55.871\nthe response we need to provide when we\nconnect to the machine to authenticate.\n\n349\n00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:58.634\nIt's the shared secret,\nessentially, it's like a password.\n\n350\n00:15:58.634 --> 00:16:02.026\nIt's what we have to know in order to be\nable to connect in and get information.\n\n351\n00:16:02.026 --> 00:16:03.424\nSo we're going to provide that.\n\n352\n00:16:03.424 --> 00:16:07.832\nWe're going to use our standard password\nhere, so I'll just type that in.\n\n353\n00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:09.784\nWe're then go ahead, click Create.\n\n354\n00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:14.430\nWe'll then have our Device Discovery\naccount there, as you can see.\n\n355\n00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.800\nAnd we'll see it checked off and\nselected, so we've got that.\n\n356\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.470\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n357\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.750\nWe then are going to have the option\nto either add specific devices.\n\n358\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.960\nBecause remember we did say\nexplicit discovery here.\n\n359\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.450\nAnd we can do this,\neither by adding it in specifically.\n\n360\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.460\nOr, notice we can do an import here.\n\n361\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.010\nWe can import.\n\n362\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.160\nAnd we'll just show you here.\n\n363\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.150\nWe can import a file that has\nour devices listed, right?\n\n364\n00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.020\nSo, we can do a file\nthat's got them listed.\n\n365\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.710\nA comma separated value.\n\n366\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.000\nAnd or, we can do an add here.\n\n367\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.020\nOr a line, the limit, you can actually\ndo a text file one at a time.\n\n368\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.880\nWe have to name our IP address here.\n\n369\n00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.240\nWe'll do our name.plabsys01.\n\n370\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:00.280\nNotice we have our access mode,\neither ICMP and SMP or either or.\n\n371\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.710\nWe do have our port number for discovery.\n\n372\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.520\nICMP version, version 1 or 2 or 3.\n\n373\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.720\nAnd then, if we're doing version 1 or\n2 we specify the Run As account and\n\n374\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.430\nwe can add another Run As account\nin there, if we need one.\n\n375\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.807\nSo we've already point\nin our access account.\n\n376\n00:17:16.807 --> 00:17:18.742\nSo we have ICMP and SNMP selected.\n\n377\n00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:20.179\nWe got port 161.\n\n378\n00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:26.186\nWe got v1 or v2 and we're gonna\nchoose Use Selected Default Account,\n\n379\n00:17:26.186 --> 00:17:30.892\nso we do have that one, and\nthen we're gonna go ahead and\n\n380\n00:17:30.892 --> 00:17:35.518\nwe are going to, just make sure,\nyeah let's do that.\n\n381\n00:17:35.518 --> 00:17:36.035\nYeah we'll do that.\nOkay, great.\n\n382\n00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:37.920\nAnd then we'll click, okay.\n\n383\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.850\nSo we got all that, and\nthen we're gonna click, next.\n\n384\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.080\nWe got our scheduled discovery,\nrun this whenever we want,\n\n385\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.220\nwe can, we'll see here run it based\non a certain day and time, or\n\n386\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.230\nwe could run discovery manually, be\ntotally up to us to decide how we do this.\n\n387\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.710\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll do run the discovery rule manually,\n\n388\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.850\nthat way we can kick it off when\nwe're ready to actually run it.\n\n389\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.390\nSo we'll click next there.\n\n390\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.810\nWe then get our summary,\nwe'll click create.\n\n391\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.950\nNow, we do get, The little warning here.\n\n392\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.520\nLet's go full screen just so\nwe can see this for a minute.\n\n393\n00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.620\nLet me just explain this.\n\n394\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.580\nYou'll see it says, and\n\n395\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.670\nwe're just waiting on this, it's waiting\non us to finish up in the background.\n\n396\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.710\nIt says following accounts need to be\ndistributed to the health service.\n\n397\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.018\nI had own the machine, the plumb sy1\npractice lab machine the management server\n\n398\n00:18:20.018 --> 00:18:24.324\nin other words, and the members of the\nmanagement pool resource pool in order for\n\n399\n00:18:24.324 --> 00:18:26.756\ndiscovered work for your device discovery.\n\n400\n00:18:26.756 --> 00:18:29.216\nWould you like us to\ndistribute those accounts.\n\n401\n00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:33.519\nRemember, we talked about this the runners\naccount, so we had to distribute them and\n\n402\n00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:35.311\neither have system doing it for us or\n\n403\n00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:37.800\nwe actually had to do with it ourselves,\nright?\n\n404\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.950\nSo, we gonna guess here because we\nwanna to do the distribution for us.\n\n405\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.060\nIf we hit Yes,\nit will go ahead and create it.\n\n406\n00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.210\nNo, we'll have to go ahead and\ndo it on our own.\n\n407\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.560\nSo we're gonna hit Yes,\nlet that go out we can watch this.\n\n408\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.891\nRight, please wait while we're doing this\nit'll actually then be able to Go out,\n\n409\n00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:53.666\ndistribute this.\n\n410\n00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:57.944\nYou can see it finishes up, and then we\nhave there, run the network discovery rule\n\n411\n00:18:57.944 --> 00:19:02.408\nwizard app that we've closed, because, or\nrun the rule outside after the rule- run\n\n412\n00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:06.570\nthe rule outside the wizard after it\nis closed is what I'm trying to say.\n\n413\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.020\nRemember we specify we want\nto run it manually, and so\n\n414\n00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.750\nas a result we get that option.\n\n415\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.260\nSo we're gonna uncheck that, we're not\ngonna bother to run that right now but\n\n416\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.270\nyou could see that we could do that.\n\n417\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.890\nAnd then once we have that, we're gonna\ngo in and we're gonna take a look.\n\n418\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.050\nLet's go and find our rule, so\nlet's come down here to Discovery Rules.\n\n419\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.840\nAnd we could see that our\ndiscovery rule is sitting there.\n\n420\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.680\nAnd we could now, of course,\nlaunch that if we choose to.\n\n421\n00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.890\nAnd we can run it.\n\n422\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.360\nSo we can just run it ourselves\nwhenever we want we can right click and\n\n423\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.920\nrun, run from the tasks area,\nit doesn't really matter, just go in and\n\n424\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.140\ndo a run there and we'll get that setup.\n\n425\n00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.370\nIt is as you can see running.\n\n426\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.160\nSo we have that.\n\n427\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.450\nAnd then once that runs, doesn't take\ntoo long to get that going right.\n\n428\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.620\nWill go ahead and\nwe will do the following.\n\n429\n00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.870\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI am going to just take a look and\n\n430\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.110\nsee if we find anything, right,\nfrom our discovery rules.\n\n431\n00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.251\nLet me just come down here real quick.\n\n432\n00:20:06.847 --> 00:20:09.485\nAnd we may have to wait because\nit is running behind the scenes.\n\n433\n00:20:09.485 --> 00:20:12.295\nWe don't know how long it will\ntake to discover anything.\n\n434\n00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.605\nWe may not get anything right away.\n\n435\n00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:18.085\nBut eventually, what we will get is we\nwill get a network device that comes\n\n436\n00:20:18.085 --> 00:20:20.945\nin here and will then actual\ndevices if there's more than one,\n\n437\n00:20:20.945 --> 00:20:24.755\nand will come in and actually be\navailable after discovery runs.\n\n438\n00:20:24.755 --> 00:20:26.675\nAnd remember,\nyou gotta be patient with this.\n\n439\n00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:29.150\nIt does take a little while for\nthat to Run.\n\n440\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.750\nYou can see Status is Idle.\n\n441\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.550\nLet me run this again because I had this\nhappen the last time, where I ran this,\n\n442\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.830\nand it didn't take the first time\nwhen I was just setting this up.\n\n443\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.440\nAnd then it took, and\nthen it finally started running.\n\n444\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.140\nOkay, so because Status,\nthere, should actually change.\n\n445\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.870\nAnd we should actually get that\n\n446\n00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:52.220\nto go to started if we catch it\nquickly enough before it runs.\n\n447\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.500\nSo, it may take a couple of minutes\nto show up, we're not gonna wait for\n\n448\n00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.800\nit to actually get a device.\n\n449\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.380\nBut you get the general idea eventually\nwe will have a device show up in there.\n\n450\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.400\nAnd finally, what we discovered, we would\nthen be able to get the plabsy01 machine.\n\n451\n00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.630\nThe machine that we specified, then she\nwould show up and be available to us.\n\n452\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.530\nSo remember, we could target this\nto do routers, to do switches.\n\n453\n00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.050\nDo anything with SNMP, and that's what\nwe would actually see ultimately,\n\n454\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.660\nas we do run through this.\n\n455\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.460\nAnd then from there, of course,\nwe're able to then go in,\n\n456\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.610\nand we're actually able to manage those\ndevices, report on them as we saw, and\n\n457\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.728\ndo all the things we\nneed to associate them.\n\n458\n00:21:28.728 --> 00:21:29.616\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, Adam.\n\n459\n00:21:29.616 --> 00:21:33.264\nWe appreciate you walking us through this,\ncuz it can be a little arduous for\n\n460\n00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:34.983\nthe uninitiated, such as myself.\n\n461\n00:21:34.983 --> 00:21:39.096\nI've never Use SCOM in this way, so\nvery cool to see those steps, and now\n\n462\n00:21:39.096 --> 00:21:43.630\nI get a little more context of how it's\nsupposed to look, what I should expect.\n\n463\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.950\nAnd hopefully, at the end of the day,\nI get all my stuff squared away.\n\n464\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.168\nVery cool stuff Adam, we appreciate\nyou joining us and doing that for us.\n\n465\n00:21:51.168 --> 00:21:53.449\nWe do appreciate you good folks for\nwatching, but\n\n466\n00:21:53.449 --> 00:21:55.253\nthat's our demonstration for today.\n\n467\n00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:57.700\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it and\nlearned a little bit of something.\n\n468\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.250\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n469\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.396\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Before I import.\n\n39\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.375\n&gt;&gt; You will pay attention to me!\n\n40\n00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.021\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Certainly.\n\n41\n00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:45.586\n&gt;&gt; And then, we talked about the .mp file,\nthe .mpb files.\n\n42\n00:01:45.586 --> 00:01:47.881\nWe explained what they were and\nwe did the whole demonstration.\n\n43\n00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:49.650\nBut we didn't actually do the import.\n\n44\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.280\nSo I'm gonna actually show it to you and\nshow you how to pick up that thread and\n\n45\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.980\ngo from here.\n\n46\n00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.230\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n47\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.850\nI'm gonna run this,\ninstead of saving it and then running it.\n\n48\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.221\nWe'll just run it directly and we've got\nour URL user license agreement here.\n\n49\n00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.681\nLet's roll that over so you could see it.\n\n50\n00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:05.800\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll click I Accept We'll hit next.\n\n51\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.260\nWe'll accept our default\ninstallation directory.\n\n52\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.627\nWe've got that sitting right here,\njust so you guys can see what that is.\n\n53\n00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:14.313\nCopy that real quick.\n\n54\n00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:18.010\nJust so we have a record of it.\n\n55\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.270\nWe'll then go ahead, and just make\nsure it's available for everybody.\n\n56\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.470\nClick Next.\n\n57\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.410\nGo ahead, and we'll click Install.\n\n58\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.000\nThat'll be real quick.\n\n59\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.060\nPut that in there, and you can see it\nopens up just minimize that website.\n\n60\n00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.693\nOpens up and you can see that we\nhave our various management packs,\n\n61\n00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.711\nour mp files are there.\n\n62\n00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:40.178\nThis was the Windows server,\n\n63\n00:02:40.178 --> 00:02:43.769\nManagement packs with the Windows\nserver library sitting right there.\n\n64\n00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.696\nWe could see that now,\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n65\n00:02:45.696 --> 00:02:49.380\nSo we're gonna go ahead and grab that from\nthe counsel and we're gonna import that.\n\n66\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.612\nSo we're gonna minimize here we're gonna\ncome over here to our administration work\n\n67\n00:02:53.612 --> 00:02:54.934\nspace management packs.\n\n68\n00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:59.963\nWe're gonna right click we're going to do\nimport management pack right from there.\n\n69\n00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:04.932\nThen we're gonna go ahead and click Add\nwe're going to do add from disc and\n\n70\n00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:08.310\nwe're gonna get our online\ncatalog connection.\n\n71\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.650\nHey, they're not always,\nthey're not all available there.\n\n72\n00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.926\nDo you wanna go out and\nlook for dependencies?\n\n73\n00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.610\nNot right now, but\nwe would in the real world.\n\n74\n00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.413\nGo ahead and do our import.\n\n75\n00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:23.030\nWe're just gonna go ahead and we're gonna\npaste in our path there so we can find it.\n\n76\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.770\nSo we have our ability to go out and\n\n77\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.340\ngrab the management pack that we need,\nwe could see it right there.\n\n78\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.830\nWe're gonna go ahead and grab the\nMicrosoft Server library management pack,\n\n79\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.000\nwe've got it sitting right there.\n\n80\n00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.600\nLet's go ahead and double-click on that,\n\n81\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.190\nbring that in, just move this over\na little bit so you could see that.\n\n82\n00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.496\nAnd you'll see it loads up,\n\n83\n00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:43.551\nwe could stack up those management\npacks as many of them as we need.\n\n84\n00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:46.237\nWe're just gonna right click and\nhide the Taskbar here, real quick.\n\n85\n00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:49.477\nSo, we actually can see\nthe bottom button there.\n\n86\n00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:52.061\nBecause, as you know,\nsometimes those Wizards come up and\n\n87\n00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.970\nit's hard to see that screen\njust because of the screen size.\n\n88\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.015\nOr see that bottom tier of the screen.\n\n89\n00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:59.507\nSo, we're gonna click Install here.\n\n90\n00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:03.120\nAnd we're then gonna watch this import,\ndoesn't take very long.\n\n91\n00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.170\nIt's a small management pack,\ntakes just a moment to bring it in.\n\n92\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.000\nYou'll see as soon as\nthat green bar finishes,\n\n93\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.200\nyou can see it's actually already\nimporting, that we are done.\n\n94\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.510\nWe're now gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Close.\n\n95\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.230\nAnd we will give that a moment,\nit has to update.\n\n96\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.660\nBut if we come down here, We'll just\nwait for the console to update so\n\n97\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.520\nwe can actually scroll.\n\n98\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.030\nBut when we go down at the bottom,\nwe will then be able to see\n\n99\n00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.140\nthat we can find the Windows client\noperating system library and\n\n100\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.270\nwe'll know that it's been imported.\n\n101\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.577\nSo let's just scroll\ndown here alphabetically.\n\n102\n00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:38.370\nGo down towards the bottom,\nall the way down here.\n\n103\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.840\nJust one second, whoops, there we go.\n\n104\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.893\nAnd Windows, Windows, Windows,\n\n105\n00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:47.714\nWindows client operating\nsystem library right there.\n\n106\n00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:52.357\nAnd we can see that that one was the one\nthat we just went ahead and we imported so\n\n107\n00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:55.083\nnow we have that\nmanagement pack available.\n\n108\n00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:58.893\nAnd of course now all\nthe associated monitors, reports,\n\n109\n00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:03.260\nviews, anything associated with\nthat would've been loaded in.\n\n110\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.084\nSo if we have any additional information,\nwe can go in, for instance,\n\n111\n00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:08.614\ngo to our monitoring area and\n\n112\n00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:12.219\nif we did load anything up as\nan additional item as a result of that.\n\n113\n00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.747\nWe'd be able to come down here and we will\nbe able to see Microsoft Windows client.\n\n114\n00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:19.517\nAnd we'll be then able to go in and\n\n115\n00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:23.711\nsee all the different items that are\navailable as part of the management pack.\n\n116\n00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:27.623\nWe have logical disk state view,\nwe have a network adapter state view.\n\n117\n00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:30.820\nThose obviously may be important\noperating system performance.\n\n118\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.811\nWe'd have to target this out and\nobviously be monitoring task status,\n\n119\n00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.746\nWindows client status, we got some\nhealth monitoring going on here.\n\n120\n00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:40.757\nWith Windows Client OS Health,\n\n121\n00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.740\nyou can see here things like\ndisk health on our dashboard.\n\n122\n00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.108\nWe've also got Operating System Events,\n\n123\n00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:50.340\nit's a pretty detailed management\npack that we bring in.\n\n124\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.987\nYou'll see here we've got\nsome stuff there, and\n\n125\n00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:56.339\nwe've got Performance here as well,\nClient OS Performance.\n\n126\n00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.218\nDrill down, we got additional dashboards\nhere and monitoring capabilities.\n\n127\n00:06:00.218 --> 00:06:03.298\nSo we brought all that in as\npart of our implementation and\n\n128\n00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:06.650\nintegration of the management\npack through the import.\n\n129\n00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.120\nThat way you saw it end to end,\nyou saw us go out and get it,\n\n130\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.280\nyou saw me actually finish up by\nusing the Add From Disk option and\n\n131\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680\nan Import From Management Pack and\nof course you see.\n\n132\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.500\nIn the console we're able to leverage the\nmanagement pack to do a variety of things.\n\n133\n00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.267\n&gt;&gt; Adam, thanks so much.\n\n134\n00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.920\nIt's a short little demo,\nbut a very important one.\n\n135\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.928\nWanna make sure that you guys had\nthe [INAUDIBLE] that kinda thing with\n\n136\n00:06:25.928

00:00:08.156\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:11.957\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:13.951\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.700\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.706\nI\"m your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are moving on,\n\n8\n00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:23.743\nmoving forward with more\non our 70-247 series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:27.484\nAnd joining us in the studio yet again,\nto lend his expertise on that very topic.\n\n10\n00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:29.300\nOur good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.702\nAdam, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:31.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm shot, help me.\n\n13\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.494\n[LAUGH] It's going well, it's going well.\n\n14\n00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.416\nHey, you gotta have a little fun, right?\n\n15\n00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.530\nWhen you're doing this, otherwise,\nwell it's just not fun.\n\n16\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.064\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n17\n00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.720\nthat's why you gotta\nplay around a little bit.\n\n18\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.930\nBut we do bring you serious information,\nand good tidings from the land of SCOM.\n\n19\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.370\nWe're gonna continue our\ndemonstrations for you.\n\n20\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.626\nWe thought we would take a look at how to\nintegrate VMM, Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n21\n00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:54.648\nHow to take that,\nintegrate that with SCOM.\n\n22\n00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:56.808\nWe've talked a little bit about that,\none of our prior episodes.\n\n23\n00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.625\nWanna show you how that happens, gonna\ngo in take a look at the VMM settings.\n\n24\n00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:04.503\nGo in configure the Ops Manager\ninformation in there, and\n\n25\n00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:09.822\nwe wanna also bring up pro and performance\nresource optimization monitoring.\n\n26\n00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:13.794\nWe're gonna take a look at that, that\nwould be essentially the idea in VMwares\n\n27\n00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:16.874\ncompetitive stack of DRS,\nthe distributor resource code.\n\n28\n00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:20.248\nAnd that automated load balancing and\nautomation and monitoring and\n\n29\n00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.002\nall that kind of stuff that goes on.\n\n30\n00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.490\nWe're gonna take a look at some of that,\nhow all that comes together.\n\n31\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.860\nSo we're gonna jump in over here,\ntake a look, there we are right up there.\n\n32\n00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.690\nAnd I've already opened\nup the VMM console, so\n\n33\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.800\nwe're just on our server where\nour SCVMM instance is installed.\n\n34\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.483\nI've opened up the console, and\n\n35\n00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.618\nI've just gone into the settings\nworkspace right down here.\n\n36\n00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.611\nAnd in the settings workspace I've\nhighlighted System Center Settings, and\n\n37\n00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.040\nwe have our Ops Manager Server item there.\n\n38\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.550\nGonna right-click on that, just bring\nup Properties, and we're gonna get our\n\n39\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.960\nAdd Operations Manager,\njust move this over so you could see it.\n\n40\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.551\nAdd Operations Manager wizard,\n\n41\n00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:59.461\nwe're gonna go through here\nfrom the introductory screen.\n\n42\n00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.811\nAnd we're gonna specify the Ops Manager\nwe're gonna connect to, and\n\n43\n00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:04.090\nconfigure this out.\n\n44\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.963\nWe'll provide Credentials\nwe'll specify that we have, or\n\n45\n00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:09.680\nhe gives us a listing of all\nthe Management Packs we need.\n\n46\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.407\nMake sure those are already installed.\n\n47\n00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:14.140\nI'll walk through in my discussion and\nhit the high level.\n\n48\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.237\nIn most of the Management Packs I said,\nwe needed bunch.\n\n49\n00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:17.937\nI rattled two or three of them off.\n\n50\n00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:21.774\nAll of them, including the versions\nare in the show notes for you by the way.\n\n51\n00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.568\nSo you will be able to see them and\nknow exactly what those versions are,\n\n52\n00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.665\nin case,\nyou're squinting right now at the screen,\n\n53\n00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:27.744\ntrying to say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:28.687\n&gt;&gt; Let me get that real quick,\n\n55\n00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:29.592\nsee what that version is.\n\n56\n00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:31.879\nWe do tell you everything you need right\nthere when you go to integrate this.\n\n57\n00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.678\nSo no worries about that at all.\n\n58\n00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:37.014\nSo we're gonna assume we have all\nthe information necessary to proceed.\n\n59\n00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:40.294\nWe're gonna click Next,\nwe're gonna specify our Server name.\n\n60\n00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:44.431\nSo we're gonna go ahead and type this in,\n\n61\n00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:51.537\nplabcis01.practicelabs.com to\nfill our qualified domain name.\n\n62\n00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:56.450\nYou'll see here, have our use\nthe VMM service account setting.\n\n63\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.751\nWe can go ahead and use either the VMM\nservice account or use a run as account.\n\n64\n00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:03.367\nWe leave the default service account for\nVMM.\n\n65\n00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:05.222\nWe're gonna Enable Performance and\n\n66\n00:03:05.222 --> 00:03:08.222\nResource Optimization down at\nthe bottom here enable PRO.\n\n67\n00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:12.406\nThis is gonna allow us then to\ndo some proactive monitoring and\n\n68\n00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:14.664\nspecify how things are working.\n\n69\n00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:16.596\nAnd whether or not there optimize and\n\n70\n00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.990\nif not take some steps to\nhopefully make sure that happens.\n\n71\n00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.820\nEnabled maintenance mode\nintegration with Ops Manager.\n\n72\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.647\nWhen hosts are put into maintenance mode,\nmake sure that if we do them in VMM,\n\n73\n00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.075\nwe alert Ops Manager.\n\n74\n00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:33.047\nSo that way Ops Manager doesn't go crazy\ntrying to tell us, hey by the way,\n\n75\n00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:36.216\nthat server you keep wanting to monitor,\nit's not there.\n\n76\n00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.440\nAnd here's all these crazy alerts\nabout the fact it's offline.\n\n77\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.056\nWell yeah, we know that, right?\n\n78\n00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:43.752\nBut we may not know that in a sense\nthat if VMM is going to be able\n\n79\n00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:47.306\nto put our host into maintenance\nmode to do some patching or\n\n80\n00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:50.516\nmanipulation of the VMs or\nwhatever we needed to do.\n\n81\n00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.997\nThen if we don't tell SCOM that, SCOM is\ngonna think it's offline for real and\n\n82\n00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:54.642\nindeed it is.\n\n83\n00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:57.422\nBut it may not know why and\nwe're gonna get crazy alerts and\n\n84\n00:03:57.422 --> 00:03:58.912\nall sorts of stuff happening.\n\n85\n00:03:58.912 --> 00:03:59.990\nWhereas if we alert and\n\n86\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.182\ntell it that we're doing this,\nit's gonna be a lot better for us.\n\n87\n00:04:03.182 --> 00:04:05.507\nSo wanna make sure we check\nthese things off, and\n\n88\n00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:09.148\nobviously benefit from as much automation\nand communication as possible.\n\n89\n00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.857\nSo that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna click Next here,\n\n90\n00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:13.480\nleave all those settings there.\n\n91\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.512\nWe have to specify our user name\nthat's gonna be able to drive all\n\n92\n00:04:17.512 --> 00:04:19.759\nthis munificence and magic for us.\n\n93\n00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.367\nThere's a word for you.\n\n94\n00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:21.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n95\n00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.813\n&gt;&gt; Look that one up and tell me what\nthe old English use of that one was.\n\n96\n00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:28.090\nAll right, so we're gonna do\npracticelabs here for our domain.\n\n97\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.465\nSo we're gonna make sure\nwe spelled that correctly.\n\n98\n00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:34.660\nAnd then, and I'm thinking we did,\nthat could just be a smudge on my screen.\n\n99\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.206\nThere we go, practice labs,\nall right, good.\n\n100\n00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:41.540\nAnd we're writing to administrator and\nwe're going to put our password in.\n\n101\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.030\nSo we've got all of that and then, we're\ngonna click Next, give that just a second.\n\n102\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.728\nNow I like this right here, we're just\ngonna take a look at this real quick.\n\n103\n00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.974\nSo yeah, we've talked a lot about the\nvalue of PowerShell in different places,\n\n104\n00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:56.089\ntalked about the value of\nautomation in scripting.\n\n105\n00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.791\nOne of the nice things\nMicrosoft has been doing for\n\n106\n00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:02.407\nawhile now in the console is\nintegrating PowerShell where we can.\n\n107\n00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:05.161\nAnd you obviously have tie ins to do that,\nwe talked about some of them.\n\n108\n00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:08.410\nWe'll continue to in other episodes\ngoing forward throughout all the shows.\n\n109\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.540\nBut we get to peek under the hood every so\noften.\n\n110\n00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.760\nWe get to view the script that's gonna\nactually get generated to do this.\n\n111\n00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.790\nAnd so let's do a little word wrap here,\nso we can see it, so\n\n112\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.430\nit's a little bit easier for you to see.\n\n113\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.585\nIt's not a very big one,\n\n114\n00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.789\nI will make the font a little bigger\ncuz I know it's kinda hard to see.\n\n115\n00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.961\nSo give me just a second,\nwe'll do that, and\n\n116\n00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:28.889\nmake that easier for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n117\n00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.787\nAnd we could see there that\nwe got a PowerShell script,\n\n118\n00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:35.567\nit's gonnabe run to be able to\ndeclared credential, VMM credential,\n\n119\n00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.647\ndeclare variable rather I sdould say.\n\n120\n00:05:37.647 --> 00:05:41.956\nSet that equal to Get-Credential,\nwe got new SCOM or\n\n121\n00:05:41.956 --> 00:05:45.228\nnewer SCO rather SCOpsMgrConnection.\n\n122\n00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:48.358\nEnablePRO, so we've got the parameter for\nEnablePRO set to $true,\n\n123\n00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:51.780\nEnableMaintenanceModeIntegration set\nto $true, we did that.\n\n124\n00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.734\nOpsMgrServer specify\nthe name of the Ops Manager,\n\n125\n00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:57.146\nRunAsynchronously use our credential.\n\n126\n00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:59.752\nThe credential will use\nVIMServerServiceAccount and so\n\n127\n00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:01.711\nwe've got that script behind the scenes.\n\n128\n00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:05.643\nSo all this stuff we think,\nwe're gonna be smart next, next, next,\n\n129\n00:06:05.643 --> 00:06:07.453\nconfigure, configure, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:07.453 --> 00:06:11.591\nWhat really happens behind the scenes\nis PowerShell kicks off in the shell,\n\n131\n00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:13.218\nthe Op shell or the VMM shell.\n\n132\n00:06:13.218 --> 00:06:15.750\nAnd it's not gonna go ahead and\nit's gonna run this for us.\n\n133\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.350\nSo one of the reasons we\nkeep stressing to you that\n\n134\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.760\nit's important to start learning about\nPowerShell and known what it does\n\n135\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.310\nis that it's really being used to\ndrive almost everything we do.\n\n136\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.338\nWe just have a nice pretty graphical\noverlay from most part of the console,\n\n137\n00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.565\nbut reality is,\nit's there whether we like it or not.\n\n138\n00:06:29.565 --> 00:06:33.061\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda funny, we're clicking\nthings and checking boxes and stuff.\n\n139\n00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:36.416\nAnd the whole time the system is basically\nbuilding a PowerShell script out in\n\n140\n00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:37.196\nthe background.\n\n141\n00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.904\nAnd then when you're done it goes yeah,\n\n142\n00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:40.873\nyou think you did something\nwith a GUI really.\n\n143\n00:06:40.873 --> 00:06:43.277\nAll you did was tell us what we\nshould put in a PowerShell script and\n\n144\n00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:44.252\nnow we're running that.\n\n145\n00:06:44.252 --> 00:06:48.130\nSo like Adam said, it can be really\nhelpful to you to understand what\n\n146\n00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.800\nthat looks like and\nhow that works on the back end.\n\n147\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.431\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I made a booboo.\n\n148\n00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:55.035\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n&gt;&gt; It does happen on occasion,\n\n149\n00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:56.985\ncuz I could not see it cuz\nmy screen went half dim.\n\n150\n00:06:56.985 --> 00:06:57.923\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:06:57.923 --> 00:06:58.480\n&gt;&gt; And so when we\n\n152\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.578\ntake [INAUDIBLE] took the opportunity\nwhen Daniel was chatting with you.\n\n153\n00:07:01.578 --> 00:07:03.470\nTo hit Run, so\nwe just get this thing started.\n\n154\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.733\nAnd immediately we get the error, which is\nactually not a bad thing cuz you wanna see\n\n155\n00:07:06.733 --> 00:07:08.900\nwhen things go wrong, so\nyou know how to fix them.\n\n156\n00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.912\nSo if we get an error here, and\nwe can see the error up there,\n\n157\n00:07:10.912 --> 00:07:13.189\ncould we go full screen just, so\nI could show you what the error is.\n\n158\n00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.189\nWe'll rerun this to fix it for\nyou right now.\n\n159\n00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:16.397\nI think I'm gonna have Daniel type it, so\n\n160\n00:07:16.397 --> 00:07:17.229\nyou can see it-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n161\n00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.310\n&gt;&gt; Better than I can.\n\n162\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.339\nSo the problem and when you look,\n\n163\n00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.614\nI know it may be hard to see even now but\nI left out the a.\n\n164\n00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:27.368\nInstead of plab I did plb, so\nwe have a typo in a sense that-\n\n165\n00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:28.305\n&gt;&gt; There's no such computer.\n\n166\n00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:29.271\n&gt;&gt; There's no such name out there.\n\n167\n00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.979\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This does show you by the way DNS\n\n168\n00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.640\nis working and we do actually check those\nmachines to make sure they are real.\n\n169\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.850\nSo what we're gonna do is simply go\nback and rerun this, no big deal.\n\n170\n00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.118\nWe'll do this and fix it up right now, so\nlet's just quickly zip back through this.\n\n171\n00:07:43.118 --> 00:07:46.192\nWe'll spell it correctly this time,\nof course, and we'll get it right.\n\n172\n00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:53.267\nP-L-A-B-S-Y-S-0-1 could of sworn I\nput the a in there the first time,\n\n173\n00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:57.950\npracticelabs.com make sure\nwe got that in there.\n\n174\n00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.399\nGot all that stuff,\ngonna go ahead, click Next.\n\n175\n00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:06.781\nPut in our username, practicelabs and\n\n176\n00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:09.887\nthen administrator.\n\n177\n00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.687\nAt least it fails like\nthe second you start.\n\n178\n00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:12.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:15.010\n&gt;&gt; One of those like,\nlet me go get all the prep work done.\n\n180\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.650\nHalf way through, wait ten minutes, then\nI'm gonna fail right before I connect.\n\n181\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.480\nThat would have just\nobviously not been very good,\n\n182\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.670\ncuz we would have wasted all\nthat time waiting on it.\n\n183\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.540\nSo at least it did fail right out of\nthe gate, that's the good thing, right?\n\n184\n00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.565\nAll right, so we have practicelabs,\nwe've got that.\n\n185\n00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:29.771\nLet's just click Next there,\nlet's get that setup.\n\n186\n00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:31.901\nLet's hit Finish, let's get that running.\n\n187\n00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:35.272\nThis time you can see right up there it\nis running, it is out of the gate and\n\n188\n00:08:35.272 --> 00:08:36.090\nsuccessful.\n\n189\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.596\nIt's gonna take a couple\nof minutes to cook,\n\n190\n00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:38.834\nso we gotta wait on this to finish up.\n\n191\n00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:42.115\nWe're gonna come on back, show you\nwhat happens after we get done and\n\n192\n00:08:42.115 --> 00:08:43.541\nplay with Pearl a little bit.\n\n193\n00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:49.891\nAll right, so we can see that our task has\nsuccessfully completed, hoorah or huzzah.\n\n194\n00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:50.479\n&gt;&gt; Huzzah.\n\n195\n00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.875\n&gt;&gt; Or just yey.\n\n196\n00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:53.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you prefer, but\n\n197\n00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:56.180\nyou can see we were successful.\n\n198\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.068\nI do know in the real\nworld this will take you,\n\n199\n00:08:58.068 --> 00:09:00.628\nI'm guessing probably about\n10 to 15 minutes, right?\n\n200\n00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:04.774\nSo don't be surprised about that, but we\ncan see it did complete, ran successfully.\n\n201\n00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:07.672\nWe didn't really go into the detail\nwhat goes on in the job area here.\n\n202\n00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:11.330\nBut you can see this summary area\ntells us kinda what's happening.\n\n203\n00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.595\nYou can go down here, look at details,\nisn't much more to know than that,\n\n204\n00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:19.201\ncuz we only did one thing, but\nwe could see that that's there.\n\n205\n00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:22.606\nDo have a little change tracking in\ncase we did multiple iterations.\n\n206\n00:09:22.606 --> 00:09:25.500\nWe could see what was going on,\nwe'll close this out.\n\n207\n00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.260\nYou can just so close out that window\nduring install at any time, and\n\n208\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.180\njust go back and\nlook at it whenever you want.\n\n209\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.058\nGot a little jobs area right up here,\nyou can just click on that.\n\n210\n00:09:34.058 --> 00:09:37.518\nBrings the window right back up for\nus, shows us what's happening,\n\n211\n00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:39.020\nso we could do that as needed.\n\n212\n00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.750\nNow what we're gonna do is make\nsure that everything is set up.\n\n213\n00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.855\nNow we did enable PRO as part of\nthe install and configuration.\n\n214\n00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo I'm just gonna go in and\nshow you the properties and\n\n215\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.330\nshow you it's already turned on.\n\n216\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.696\nBut if we didn't we would go in and check\noff the box in the property setting here\n\n217\n00:09:53.696 --> 00:09:56.099\nand PRO would be enabled, so\nwe will take a look at that.\n\n218\n00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:59.541\nWe're also gonna go in and\nconfigure SQL Server Analysis Services and\n\n219\n00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:00.837\nmake sure we enable that.\n\n220\n00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.385\nWe're gonna take a look at that and\nshow you how to do that as well here.\n\n221\n00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:07.627\nSo we're gonna right-click on\nthe Ops Manager Server, go to Properties.\n\n222\n00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:11.261\nWe'll see that we do have connection\nstatus green circle white check okay,\n\n223\n00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:13.030\nthat is what we expect to see.\n\n224\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.374\nAll is well, we do have our hard\ncoded information here now.\n\n225\n00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:20.630\nConnection Settings, enable the connection\nto Ops Manager, that's running, of course.\n\n226\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.000\nEnable PRO,\nyou can see it is turned on by default.\n\n227\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.440\nWe had it turned on,\nwe'd come in here, check that off.\n\n228\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.360\nWe do have the maintenance mode\nintegration, we talked about those things\n\n229\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.970\non the setup, as we were doing\nthe configuration initially.\n\n230\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.430\nJust move this over, so you could\nsee that a little bit more clearly.\n\n231\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.948\nSo we talked about this,\ncan also take a look at it and\n\n232\n00:10:36.948 --> 00:10:40.983\ntell that our Management Packs have been\ninstalled and configured successfully.\n\n233\n00:10:40.983 --> 00:10:42.370\nWe'll see them here, so\n\n234\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.220\nwe do have a list of the ones that\nare part of this configuration.\n\n235\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.200\nThis is actually what's taken the longest\nhere is that making sure all these\n\n236\n00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.940\nManagement Packs get substantiated and\nset up the right way.\n\n237\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.070\nAnd then I mentioned\nSQL Server Analysis Services,\n\n238\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.240\nsaid we would show how to do this.\n\n239\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.650\nWe can enable the SSAS functionality here.\n\n240\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.165\nCheck off the box as you can see,\nin order for\n\n241\n00:11:02.165 --> 00:11:07.308\nVMM to be able to use SSAS, or\nthe SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\n242\n00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:10.408\nThis is the essentially the data cube and\nthe data warehouse and\n\n243\n00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:11.890\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n244\n00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.463\nTo able to do this, to do forecasting\nanalysis, we have to able the integration.\n\n245\n00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:19.426\nSo we're gonna set this up,\nwe give it a SSAS server name.\n\n246\n00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:23.653\nWe're gonna use our\ndefault SQL install here,\n\n247\n00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:28.312\nsass or plabsys01,\nwe give it our instance name.\n\n248\n00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:33.066\nmssqlserver are default name that\nwe've been using for everything else.\n\n249\n00:11:33.066 --> 00:11:38.159\nWe'll put in our port here, 2383 that\n\n250\n00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:43.120\nis our stand port that\nwe are going to use.\n\n251\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.631\nAnd then will specify our\ncredentials right down here.\n\n252\n00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:51.170\nWe'll do our enter username and\npassword to our username,\n\n253\n00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.447\nwhich will be our domain\npracticelabs administrator.\n\n254\n00:11:55.447 --> 00:12:02.280\nWe'll put that in and then we will put in\nour password, oops, put in our password.\n\n255\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.423\nGet that in there as well,\ngo ahead and we'll click OK.\n\n256\n00:12:07.423 --> 00:12:09.614\nWe could do the View Script at\nthe bottom there on the left,\n\n257\n00:12:09.614 --> 00:12:11.900\nI showed you that before,\njust pointing that out.\n\n258\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.921\nWe can do that as well, we'll give\nthat just a moment to do its thing.\n\n259\n00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:16.060\nWhat did I do there?\n\n260\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.736\nPlease provide a valid computer and\ninstance name.\n\n261\n00:12:18.736 --> 00:12:20.785\nSo I may have had a little typo there.\n\n262\n00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:22.616\nLet's make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n263\n00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:23.915\n&gt;&gt; Do PLB machines come back to haunt us?\n\n264\n00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:25.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps it could be.\n\n265\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.225\nLet's just make sure I\ndidn't make a mistake there.\n\n266\n00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:33.970\nI may have put in o instead of 0\non the item there, I'm not sure.\n\n267\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:39.183\nI thought I had 0 but plabsys,\nagain that screen keeps going up and down.\n\n268\n00:12:39.183 --> 00:12:43.067\nThere we go, plabsys01 mssqlserver,\nwe got that.\n\n269\n00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:46.030\nGot the right number s\nis in there mssqlserver.\n\n270\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:52.351\nGot our port number 2383 that all looks\ngood, could be our password or username.\n\n271\n00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:58.880\nLet's just go ahead and let's take a look,\nand make sure that we're good there.\n\n272\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.335\nAll right, so I'm just go in,\nwe'll just double check there real quick.\n\n273\n00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:07.023\nAnd let me see, so\nwe got practicelabs administrator,\n\n274\n00:13:07.023 --> 00:13:09.541\njust make sure the password is right.\n\n275\n00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:14.010\nThat could have been the problem,\nmake sure that's good.\n\n276\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:19.135\n2383mssqlplabsys01, that\nshould all be good.\n\n277\n00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:21.632\nLet's just take a look and see.\n\n278\n00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.967\nPerhaps I just did not pay attention.\n\n279\n00:13:30.398 --> 00:13:31.088\nIt's trying.\n\n280\n00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.126\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n281\n00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:32.694\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n282\n00:13:32.694 --> 00:13:33.230\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n283\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.302\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n284\n00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:36.534\n&gt;&gt; Had us holding our breath for\nfive seconds, right?\n\n285\n00:13:36.534 --> 00:13:37.294\n&gt;&gt; We didn't get that on-\n\n286\n00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:38.134\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Camera, more like-\n\n287\n00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:38.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n288\n00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:40.022\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be like a moving one.\n\n289\n00:13:40.022 --> 00:13:40.742\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n\n290\n00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:41.478\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, all right.\n\n291\n00:13:41.478 --> 00:13:42.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we got that.\n\n292\n00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:44.542\nSo it was probably just\nme not typing in the-\n\n293\n00:13:44.542 --> 00:13:45.142\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:13:45.142 --> 00:13:45.934\n&gt;&gt; Right stuff,\n\n295\n00:13:45.934 --> 00:13:48.382\ncuz I can't see half\nthe time on the screen.\n\n296\n00:13:48.382 --> 00:13:52.210\nSo we could see that once we get that\nset up, it's now configured as well.\n\n297\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.121\nAnd now if we go back,\n\n298\n00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:56.483\nwe take a look at the properties, we can\nactually see that it is up and running.\n\n299\n00:13:56.483 --> 00:13:59.820\nAnd we'll be able to go in and\njust configure or rather ensure that.\n\n300\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.280\nSo we can go and take a look real quick,\nand just see we got properties here.\n\n301\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.410\nCome over here, we can actually see it\nis now actually set up and configured.\n\n302\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.920\nSee, it looks a little different.\n\n303\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.168\nWe do have our instance there,\n\n304\n00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:11.429\ngot our port,\nall that information is available to us.\n\n305\n00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:14.450\nSo this is how we do\nthe back end integration and\n\n306\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.333\nmake sure that we go through configure\nSCOM, VMM integration, enable and\n\n307\n00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:24.650\nuse PRO or enable and set up PRO, enable\nand use and set up SSAS integration.\n\n308\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.416\nAnd by handing out and\ngiving out all these credentials,\n\n309\n00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:30.823\ngetting everything organized,\nconfigured up and set up correctly.\n\n310\n00:14:30.823 --> 00:14:35.721\nWe now have the ability to link the VMM\nproduct into the SCOM solution,\n\n311\n00:14:35.721 --> 00:14:39.137\nbring fabric monitoring\nof the cloud into SCOM.\n\n312\n00:14:39.137 --> 00:14:42.992\nAnd allow us to be more proactive in\nhow we manage and maintain the fabric.\n\n313\n00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:46.181\nAnd that's gonna be an upcoming\nsource of conversation for\n\n314\n00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:49.432\nus in terms of how we're gonna\ndo application monitoring and\n\n315\n00:14:49.432 --> 00:14:52.040\ndealing with some of\nthose kinds of issues.\n\n316\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.409\nWe have whole separate conversation\nthat goes, and not just a conversation,\n\n317\n00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:56.132\nan entire show.\n\n318\n00:14:56.132 --> 00:15:00.910\nWhole episodes on how to actually\nconfigure and do monitoring with VMM and\n\n319\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.004\nintegration and\nall that in the 7246 and 7247 series.\n\n320\n00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:09.966\nThe MCSE private cloud where we go\ndeeper and wider into not just SCOM.\n\n321\n00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:12.429\nBut really do a deep dive\ninto a VMM specifically, and\n\n322\n00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:14.915\nlook at how we set that fabric up,\nand maintain that.\n\n323\n00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:18.532\nSo always think about that, encourage you\nto come back, take a look at those shows.\n\n324\n00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:22.850\nJoin us and find out more about how we\nextend this product, and do more with it.\n\n325\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.160\nBut we're gonna our conversations going\nthrough the rest of our episodes and\n\n326\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.140\nshow material here around SCOM and\nSCOM monitoring.\n\n327\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.220\nAnd I would do that for\ntha datacenter in the cloud.\n\n328\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.666\nAnd Daniel, you are, if I'm not mistaken,\ngoing to use your powers of malificence.\n\n329\n00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Malevolent powers, malificence powers-\n\n330\n00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:40.255\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n331\n00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:40.808\n&gt;&gt; You are maleficent.\n\n332\n00:15:40.808 --> 00:15:41.504\n&gt;&gt; I'm malificent.\n\n333\n00:15:41.504 --> 00:15:42.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, you are not, I'm only kidding.\n\n334\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Daniel is gonna take us out,\n\n335\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.903\nbut we are done with our demo.\n\n336\n00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:49.105\nAnd keep in mind just as we're wrapping\nup, always have in your mind the thought\n\n337\n00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:51.677\nprocess about not just\ndocumenting what we did,\n\n338\n00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:55.000\nand you saw what we did,\nI'm just gonna go practice that.\n\n339\n00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.478\nBut I always stress the importance\nof using those screens that we saw.\n\n340\n00:15:57.478 --> 00:16:00.901\nThe Summer screens and the Script screen\nto grab that documentation and make sure\n\n341\n00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:04.350\nthat we have a record of it, so that you\nknow what you did in the real world.\n\n342\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.170\nSo you can track that back a year\nfrom now, two years from now,\n\n343\n00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.440\nwhenever it is you gotta\nmanage that infrastructure.\n\n344\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.381\nIn case something goes wrong we're\ngonna talk about disaster recovery and\n\n345\n00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:13.321\nbusiness continuity.\n\n346\n00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:15.550\nIn some of the very last episodes,\nwe put together for you,\n\n347\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.640\nwanna make sure you take a look at those\nand understand how to deal with it.\n\n348\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.450\nBut if anything does go wrong you've\ngot a record of what we did here.\n\n349\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.603\nSo don't underestimate the value\nof taking some screen captures.\n\n350\n00:16:24.603 --> 00:16:27.341\nTaking a look at what you did, and\ncapturing it as you're doing it.\n\n351\n00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:30.560\nSo you can refer back to it later if you\nneed to, so it's gonna be very important.\n\n352\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.480\n&gt;&gt; Last words from our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordan.\n\n353\n00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.907\nWe do thank you for\nthe cool demonstrations today, and\n\n354\n00:16:34.907 --> 00:16:36.717\nwe do thank our good folks for watching.\n\n355\n00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:41.872\nBut Adam is absolutely correct, it is\ntime for us to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n356\n00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:44.313\nThanks for watching,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n357\n00:16:44.313 --> 00:16:45.485\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n358\n00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:46.521\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n359\n00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:54.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n360\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.484\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.369\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.562\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:11.778\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\n\n6\n00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:16.520\ngentlemen to your Configuring Deploying\na Private Cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.710\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.665\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look\nat how to create the private cloud\n\n9\n00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:22.464\nbuilding blocks.\n\n10\n00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:24.556\nAnd as much as I'd like to think, but\n\n11\n00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:29.094\nwe're probably not gonna be playing\nwith Legos and Lincoln Logs today, Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:30.928\nIs that something that\nwe have in store here?\n\n13\n00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:35.262\n&gt;&gt; Not unless you brought them with you, I\nwas not planning on bringing them out for\n\n14\n00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:36.110\nthis episode.\n\n15\n00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.147\nBut Cherokee's full of surprises,\n\n16\n00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:41.702\nyou never know what will show up\nhere randomly as we are talking.\n\n17\n00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:46.410\nBut we are gonna be using the building\nblocks of the cloud, and the idea behind\n\n18\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.422\nthis discussion, and really integrating\nit into our other discussions to date.\n\n19\n00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:53.911\nAnd looking ahead at what's\ngonna come after this,\n\n20\n00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.602\nin terms of the episodes you'll see as\nwe continue, is very critical for us.\n\n21\n00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:00.959\nBecause, up until this point in time,\nwe've been talking in\n\n22\n00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:04.530\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager\nabout mainly the fabric.\n\n23\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.120\nWe've spent a lot of time in\nthe area of infrastructure to set up\n\n24\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.380\nall the networking related fabric stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.590\nWe've talked about how to integrate and\nmanage the servers,\n\n26\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.560\nat least at a high level we've talked\nabout being able to add hosts in.\n\n27\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.906\nWe've talked about being able to add in\na WSUS server, maybe a PXE Boot server.\n\n28\n00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:24.115\nWe've talked about support for\nmulti-vendor hosts to host our virtual\n\n29\n00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:27.979\nmachines to underlie our\nvirtualization for the private clouds.\n\n30\n00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.268\nWe've talked about the support\nfrom VMware and Citrix, and\n\n31\n00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:34.345\nthe ability to add host\ngroups in to deal with those.\n\n32\n00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:38.600\nWe've talked about the idea of having\nstorage capacity, bringing in storage and\n\n33\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.510\nsetting it up.\n\n34\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.530\nSo, we've been through all\nthose areas in the fabric,\n\n35\n00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.710\nreally looking at the moving parts and\npieces.\n\n36\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.850\nWe've talked about how to set up, or\nat least the idea behind setting up,\n\n37\n00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.288\nall those items, grouping them together\nand putting them into a private cloud.\n\n38\n00:01:52.288 --> 00:01:55.450\nAnd we'll walk through the logic of how to\ndo that, just to really show that to you\n\n39\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.530\nafter we get done configuring all the\nbuilding blocks we're speaking about here.\n\n40\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.860\nI'll take you back into\nthe console in a separate area,\n\n41\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.650\nand we'll take a look under VMs and\nservices and\n\n42\n00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.310\nwe'll actually see a host group\nthere we've populated with a host.\n\n43\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.290\nWe're gonna then create a cloud just\nto bring this all together for you.\n\n44\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.430\nBut in order to do that, we need some of\nthe building blocks, the profiles and\n\n45\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.260\nthe things that we've been discussing and\nthat we're gonna use to drive deployments.\n\n46\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.170\nAnd that's what we're gonna\nspend some time and focus on.\n\n47\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.610\nSo if you wanna join me over here,\n\n48\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.500\nwe'll start by talking about some of\nthe different profiles in our list.\n\n49\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.950\nAnd we'll walk through, explain what\nthey're used for, and we'll go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550\njust pull one or two out and\nwalk through the logic of them.\n\n51\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.140\nWe have our guest OS profiles or\n\n52\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.740\napplication profiles, our capability\nprofiles, our hardware profiles,\n\n53\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.330\nour physical computer profiles, and\nwe have our SQL Server profiles.\n\n54\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.620\nSo, all six of these are gonna make up the\nbuilding block elements that we have to\n\n55\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.150\ncreate, and\nthen start to use as we do deployment.\n\n56\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.890\nAnd so let's start by talking about\nthe guest operating system profile.\n\n57\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.450\nI've told you in previous\nepisodes that VMs\n\n58\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.070\nare often referred to as\nguest operating systems.\n\n59\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.790\nA virtual machine runs a guest\nOS on top of a hypervisor.\n\n60\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.360\nAnd that's where it gets\nthe representation or the name from.\n\n61\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.010\nSo a guest OS profile is gonna\nhave the collection of settings\n\n62\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.190\nthat are maintained around operating\nsystem deployments for virtual machines.\n\n63\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.145\nThat's what, essentially,\nwe're gonna be doing.\n\n64\n00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:18.132\nSo if we create an operating system or\nguest OS profile, we right-click,\n\n65\n00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:22.485\nall of these are Wizard-driven,\npretty straightforward, guest OS profile.\n\n66\n00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:25.993\nWe'll just bring our Wizard up here,\nmove this over just a touch there so\n\n67\n00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:27.385\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n68\n00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:30.546\nAnd we'll give this a name,\n\n69\n00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:36.343\nlet's say that this is going\nto be Windows Server and\n\n70\n00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:39.780\nthis is gonna be 2012 R2.\n\n71\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.660\nAnd let's say maybe this is Data\nCenter Edition or something like that.\n\n72\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.850\nSo the more documentation,\nthe more information we have in our naming\n\n73\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.800\nconvention, the better it is for us, so\nwe can keep track of what's going on.\n\n74\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.210\nNotice, under compatibility here,\nwe have Windows or Linux.\n\n75\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.410\nSo I'm specifying a Windows install,\nso my compatibility rating is Windows.\n\n76\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.800\nIf I was doing Linux, I would make\nsure I chose Linux here, right?\n\n77\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.960\nAnd notice when I do that, there's no\nchange in any of the settings here.\n\n78\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.900\nIt's just a matter of understanding what\nthe configurations will be under the guest\n\n79\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.090\nOS profile, and\n\n80\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.170\nthe specificity of the resources\nbased on a Linux deployment, right?\n\n81\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.327\nSo that's what we're doing,\nso gonna choose Windows here.\n\n82\n00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:21.310\nAnd then, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll click guest OS profile.\n\n83\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.710\nAnd you'll see then we have\nthe choice of what operating systems.\n\n84\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.900\nIf we had chose Linux,\n\n85\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.730\nthis would have a list of the Linux\noperating systems that we support.\n\n86\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.395\nSo it'd be up to us to make\nthe appropriate choice.\n\n87\n00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:35.445\nI said 12 or 12 R2 Data Center.\n\n88\n00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:38.465\nSo we would come down here,\nthere's 12 R2 Data Center.\n\n89\n00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:43.330\nWe would choose the appropriate OS\nthat's gonna signify that that OS should\n\n90\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.754\nbe the OS that is gonna be installed and\nconfigured in this template.\n\n91\n00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:51.692\nWe then walk through and\nspecify things like computer name,\n\n92\n00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:54.840\nthe admin password if\nwe choose to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.040\nA product key, so if we do have,\nour product key will specify that.\n\n94\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.545\nOur time zones, all the standard\nsettings that we would think of here.\n\n95\n00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.585\nWe have our roles and features.\n\n96\n00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.461\nWhat are we gonna pre-configure and\nhave installed as part of this deployment?\n\n97\n00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:13.235\nSo if we are going to, perhaps,\nstand up a web server on this server 2012\n\n98\n00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:18.390\nR2 Data Center OS, and pre-configure it so\nit's got a web server role already set up,\n\n99\n00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.390\nwe would check off\nthe appropriate boxes here.\n\n100\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.111\nIf we want to install some sort of\nActive Directory service, certificates,\n\n101\n00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:24.811\nfederation.\n\n102\n00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:28.880\nMake it a domain controller, for instance.\n\n103\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.610\nThe RMS, the Rights Management Server, we\nwould check off the appropriate item here.\n\n104\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.770\nSame thing with features,\nwe would install and\n\n105\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.280\nconfigure things like the .NET framework,\nwhich underlies the support for\n\n106\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.046\nmost of the capabilities that\nwe often wanna deploy and use.\n\n107\n00:05:42.046 --> 00:05:46.410\nSo it may be a good idea to have that\npre-deployed, so we would specify that.\n\n108\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.130\nWe have under Networking our standard.\n\n109\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.780\nAre we in a work group,\nare we in a domain?\n\n110\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.770\nIf we're in a domain, what's the resource?\n\n111\n00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.340\nCredentials we need in order to join\nthe domains, we'd specify all that.\n\n112\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.810\nAnd then we could also use answer files or\n\n113\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.130\nanswer scripts that we'll\nfurther configure and\n\n114\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.465\nspecify settings that we want to\ninstall here, so we can bring that in.\n\n115\n00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:06.985\nWe also have our GUI RunOnce option here,\n\n116\n00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:11.135\ncommands that would be run once the\noperating system in the VM is configured.\n\n117\n00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:14.215\nMaybe you want to map a drive,\nmaybe you want to install a printer.\n\n118\n00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:17.005\nWho knows what you may want to do, there's\nall sorts of stuff you could do there.\n\n119\n00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:20.463\nAnd we would run those.\nSo once we have all this set up,\n\n120\n00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.010\nwe click OK.\n\n121\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.732\nNotice, by the way,\n\n122\n00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.531\nI didn't need to make any choices\nin there to create the profile.\n\n123\n00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:28.122\nI would obviously want to do\nthat in the real world so\n\n124\n00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:31.316\nthat I can actually configure\nthe profile and make use of it, so\n\n125\n00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:33.386\nit actually does what I'd like it to do.\n\n126\n00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:36.068\nBut I can leave a bunch of stuff blank and\njust go back and\n\n127\n00:06:36.068 --> 00:06:39.645\nedit it later if I choose to, and\nyou saw that I was able to do that.\n\n128\n00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:41.135\nSo I've got a guest OS profile.\n\n129\n00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:43.191\nAnd if I decide I wanna have one there for\nLinux,\n\n130\n00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.778\nwe could do that real quick as\nwell just before we continue.\n\n131\n00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:48.839\nLet's just do this one and\n\n132\n00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:53.865\nwe'll call this Linux profile, whoops.\n\n133\n00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:56.665\nAnd when we do that we'll choose\nLinux here just to show you what our\n\n134\n00:06:56.665 --> 00:06:57.830\noptions are.\n\n135\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.660\nCome over here and you'll see that\nsome of these options do change.\n\n136\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.550\nWe don't need product key,\nwe don't need domain join.\n\n137\n00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.400\nWe don't need all the roles and\nfeatures for Windows.\n\n138\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.630\nObviously those things are specific\nto Windows, those disappear.\n\n139\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.545\nBut the specification for the OS, the\nidentity information, the root credential,\n\n140\n00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:16.465\nwhich would be the admin credential\nin Windows, the equivalent.\n\n141\n00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:18.865\nThe time zone and\nthe RunOnce are gonna be there.\n\n142\n00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:22.535\nWe'll use an answer file to deploy a Linux\nsystem, so we have RunOnce commands.\n\n143\n00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:25.800\nSo the basic thought process\nis gonna hold true there.\n\n144\n00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.440\nYou'll see we choose whatever Linux\ndistribution we would like to run.\n\n145\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.790\nAre you feeling like any particular\nflavor of Linux today, Cherokee?\n\n146\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.830\nYou have a certain flavor\nin mind you're thinking of?\n\n147\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Well, are we talking client\nside here on this list or\n\n148\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.285\nis it strictly-\n&gt;&gt; These are all going to be the server,\n\n149\n00:07:40.285 --> 00:07:44.290\nso Oracle, Red Hat Enterprise,\nmaybe Ubuntu.\n\n150\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ubuntu sounds good, yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.768\n&gt;&gt; Ubuntu, okay, so we'll do Ubuntu.\n32 or 64 bit?\n\n152\n00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:49.907\n&gt;&gt; 64, of course.\n\n153\n00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:50.847\n&gt;&gt; Okay, with or without fries?\n\n154\n00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:53.955\n&gt;&gt; Fries please, extra salt.\n\n155\n00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:55.912\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH], so\nwe'll do Ubuntu Linux.\n\n156\n00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:59.649\nWe got our 1204 version 64 bit there.\n\n157\n00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:01.672\nAgain, you'd make your\nappropriate choices.\n\n158\n00:08:01.672 --> 00:08:04.730\nWe would then go through Profile\nout whatever we need there.\n\n159\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.820\nClick OK, give that just a second, and\nthen we've got a Linux profile as well.\n\n160\n00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.920\nSo now we have a guest OS profile,\none for Windows, one for Linux.\n\n161\n00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.610\nAnd you can imagine the logic of stepping\nthrough this wizard several times.\n\n162\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.540\nBringing in certain specific distributions\nor operating system versions.\n\n163\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.780\nCustomized and configured,\n\n164\n00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.470\nbased on whatever it is that\nyou're looking to deploy.\n\n165\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.430\nAnd as you do that,\nyou would just make your choices.\n\n166\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.520\nAnd once you're done,\nyou're all set, ready to go.\n\n167\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.090\nAnd then, eventually,\nyou will stack all these up.\n\n168\n00:08:32.155 --> 00:08:35.925\nAnd you will be able to run through and\nstart to have a library,\n\n169\n00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:39.445\nessentially, catalog, that you build\nout with all of this information.\n\n170\n00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:42.035\nLet's take a look at\nour hardware profiles.\n\n171\n00:08:42.035 --> 00:08:43.595\nWe'll just kinda work through\nthe middle of the list.\n\n172\n00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:44.800\nNo particular order, by the way.\n\n173\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.240\nWe could do these in any order,\nreally does not matter.\n\n174\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.220\nJust want to make sure that\nwe're going through them and\n\n175\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.180\nshowing you how they work.\n\n176\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.440\nLet's do our hardware profile, same idea.\n\n177\n00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.240\nWe have a wizard here.\n\n178\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.430\nWe'll right-click Create Hardware Profile.\n\n179\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.380\nLet me just do this.\n\n180\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.630\nLet's give it a name.\n\n181\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:03.350\nLet's call this hardwareProfile1,\n\n182\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.100\njust to give a general linkage\nto a gen1 VM versus gen2 VM.\n\n183\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.610\nAnd when I say gen1, gen2,\nI mean generation one and generation two.\n\n184\n00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.060\nThe idea behind generations and VMs is the\nidea of the support that the VM provides,\n\n185\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.750\nor the guest OS provides.\n\n186\n00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.380\nA generation 1 VM uses\na traditional BIOS to boot,\n\n187\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.360\nthe BIOS that most of us will probably\ngenerically be familiar with.\n\n188\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.224\nWhen someone says BIOS to you,\nthat's what you're thinking of.\n\n189\n00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:30.076\nAnd generation two supports UEA5,\n\n190\n00:09:30.076 --> 00:09:33.910\na newer thought process that gives us\nthe ability to boot in a different way.\n\n191\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.720\nIt's more secure,\nit gives you newer capabilities.\n\n192\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.920\nSo, we would specify how this is working.\n\n193\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.330\nSo, and you want to make\nsure you differentiate here.\n\n194\n00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.460\nAnd we can quickly take\na look one of each, so,\n\n195\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.720\ngeneration one, hardware profile.\n\n196\n00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.775\nAnd notice, when we say hardware\nprofiles we really mean, hey,\n\n197\n00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:50.805\nlet's configure the hardware.\n\n198\n00:09:50.805 --> 00:09:53.005\nLet's configure the memory,\nlet's configure the CPU,\n\n199\n00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:54.780\nlet's configure the networking.\n\n200\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.250\nRemember, this is the virtual hardware,\nright?\n\n201\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.960\nThis is not the host,\n\n202\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.640\nthis is the virtual hardware that's\ngonna be provided through, for this.\n\n203\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.160\nSo we're thinking about this here, right?\n\n204\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.440\nAnd then select the capability\nprofile that will\n\n205\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.460\nvalidate it against this hardware profile.\n\n206\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.680\nVMM, Virtual Machine Manager,\nwill provide a validation state for\n\n207\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.080\nthe selected capability profile.\n\n208\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.240\nMeaning, what host is gonna be used to run\nthe VMs that uses this hardware profile?\n\n209\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.560\nThat's what we're suggesting.\n\n210\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.340\nAnd so are we gonna be on Hyper-V,\non Xen and/or ESXI?\n\n211\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.910\nSo if we choose Hyper-V versus ESXi or\nXen, it does the appropriate thing.\n\n212\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.410\nAnd then under cloud capability,\n\n213\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.520\nhere, it's gonna put in\nthe appropriate host server.\n\n214\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.120\nSo I'll do Hyper-V, just set that up.\n\n215\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.370\nSo we have that here,\nthat's what we're referencing.\n\n216\n00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.380\nThen we have our processors, right?\n\n217\n00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.400\nSo, number of processors, one,\ntwo, three, whatever we're doing.\n\n218\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.240\nHow much memory are we going to make\navailable here for the virtual machine?\n\n219\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.180\nOr, how much are we gonna make available\nto allocate to the virtual machine, right?\n\n220\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.190\nSo, static means 512 MB is gonna\nbe given to the virtual machine.\n\n221\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.470\nWhenever we use this profile,\nthat's what it gets.\n\n222\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.312\nIf we do dynamic,\nwe could specify a startup memory amount.\n\n223\n00:11:05.312 --> 00:11:08.540\nSo a minimum amount, in other words,\ngiven to it, a start-up amount,\n\n224\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.760\na maximum amount.\n\n225\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.090\nAnd, so, we could play within\nthat range a little bit.\n\n226\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.060\nIt's up to us how to do this.\n\n227\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.255\nSo, we would specify the amount\nof memory in megabytes\n\n228\n00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:18.680\nand/or in gigabytes, it's up to us.\n\n229\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.140\nSo we'll leave that at the default\njust for purposes of our discussion.\n\n230\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.640\nAre we going to be using a floppy disk,\nif we do need one?\n\n231\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.950\nObviously put that in there.\n\n232\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.510\nCom ports the same, video adapter,\nagain, the same idea.\n\n233\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:34.410\nStandard video adapter, or since this is\nMicrosoft, in this case, Remote FX 3D,\n\n234\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.910\nwhich gives us our enhanced video\ncapabilities inside the system.\n\n235\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.300\nThen here, we scroll down, we see, just\ngo down here, we got a little bit more.\n\n236\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.553\nWe got our bus configuration for\nour IDE and/or DVD or\n\n237\n00:11:46.553 --> 00:11:49.570\nCD-ROM drive, so we have all of that here.\n\n238\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.320\nAre we mounting an ISO image\nas part of the profile?\n\n239\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.940\nWe could do that if we want to.\n\n240\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.350\nSo we have the ISO available\nto us that we could install or\n\n241\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.310\naccess from that ISO directly,\nso it's up to us to decide.\n\n242\n00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.780\nWe have our SCSI adapter there,\nwe have our network adapter.\n\n243\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.250\nSpecify what the network adapter's\nconnected to, and if it's available.\n\n244\n00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.080\nWhat network do we wanna create\nand/or be a part of here?\n\n245\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.420\nSo connect to a VM network, specify\nthe network if there is one, right?\n\n246\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.840\nAnd we can create one on the fly.\n\n247\n00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.610\nIf we don't have a network already set up,\nwe can just go ahead and\n\n248\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.660\ncreate a VM network.\n\n249\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.830\nWe've talked through how\nto create logical networks.\n\n250\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.280\nRemember, prior to this, we've been\nthrough the networking fabric, and\n\n251\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.270\ntalked about all the different\nnetworks and set them up.\n\n252\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.590\nSo you go and\nyou create those if necessary.\n\n253\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.540\nSo we could then link that here,\nif we wanted to.\n\n254\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.120\nAnd then we can have dynamic or\nstatic IP addresses, dynamic or\n\n255\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.910\nstatic Mac addresses.\n\n256\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.380\nAnd we have the capability\nto create port profiles, and\n\n257\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.430\nuse those from the networking\nstack as well.\n\n258\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.730\nAgain, we've been through all these in\nprior conversations, as we looked at\n\n259\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.170\nthe fabric solutions inside VMM,\nand talked extensively about that.\n\n260\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.580\nAnd then we have some\nadditional capabilities here.\n\n261\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.310\nCPU priority, virtual NUMA,\nand memory waiting, so\n\n262\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.730\nwe have different options\nbased on what we'd like to do.\n\n263\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.080\nOnce we're done with all this, and\n\n264\n00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.350\nassuming we just accept the defaults,\nclick OK.\n\n265\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.350\nGive that just a moment, we'll then\nhave our hardware profile one, or\n\n266\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.780\ngeneration one, Hyper-V based profile.\n\n267\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.300\nAnd we can decide what we wanna do there.\n\n268\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.730\nWe could go in and create a gen2 profile,\nit would be essentially the same.\n\n269\n00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.530\nThe only difference is,\nwe would choose gen2 instead of gen1.\n\n270\n00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.560\nAnd so\nonce we pile up our hardware profiles.\n\n271\n00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.780\nAnd we may have a hardware profile for\nESXi or\n\n272\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.470\nfor Xen, we can quickly create one there.\n\n273\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.722\nLet's just go in, we'll do this.\n\n274\n00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:33.064\nLet's call this ESX.\n\n275\n00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:42.130\nJust to specify to be on the ESX host.\n\n276\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:49.010\nWe do that, choose ESX host, and then we\nget basically the same general idea here.\n\n277\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.800\nThe memory, the CPU, the comports,\nthe virtual adapter, or the video adapter.\n\n278\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.820\nThe bus configuration for the ID and\nSCSI drives, the network connections.\n\n279\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.070\nAll that kind of stuff, it's all there.\n\n280\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:06.290\nAnd then, once we do that,\nwe have our ESX Server-compatible profile.\n\n281\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.600\nAnd same thing for Xen.\n\n282\n00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.350\nWe can essentially walk through and\nhave one or more of these for each type.\n\n283\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.020\nAnd once we're done with all that,\nwe'll then have our hardware profiles.\n\n284\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.350\nNow, we have our ability to do\nour physical computer profiles,\n\n285\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.030\nthis is our host profile, if you will.\n\n286\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.970\nSo, let's go in, we'll right-click here,\ncreate a physical computer profile.\n\n287\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.206\nWe'll give this a name.\n\n288\n00:14:29.622 --> 00:14:34.423\nLet's specify that this\nwill be Windows Server or\n\n289\n00:14:34.423 --> 00:14:37.635\nWIndows Hyper-V, let's say.\n\n290\n00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:44.591\nHyper-V, there we go.\n\n291\n00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:46.950\nHyper-V host, so is it gonna be a VM host?\n\n292\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.520\nWell that's what we're saying it's gonna\nbe used for, so that's what will do.\n\n293\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.570\nAre we gonna create it as a file server\ninstead, to just store up storage?\n\n294\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.610\nWe can do either one.\n\n295\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.710\nBut it is important to\nspecify the role there.\n\n296\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.740\nBecause the role that we specify\nwill then indicate for us,\n\n297\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.960\nas you can see, a change in the amount of\ninformation we're asked to provide here.\n\n298\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.330\nThe file server does not require\nquite as many items here.\n\n299\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.255\nBecause the host settings are removed for\nthe file server,\n\n300\n00:15:10.255 --> 00:15:11.660\ncuz we're not gonna have to specify those.\n\n301\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.420\nSo it is important, just to make\nsure we know what we're doing.\n\n302\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.750\nSo we'll do a VM host one,\njust so we know.\n\n303\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.170\nSo we'll click Next here, OS Image.\n\n304\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.880\nWhat is our virtual hard disk file that\nwe're gonna be using and mounting?\n\n305\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.630\nClick Browse, again, we go back to\nthat selector we've seen before.\n\n306\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.370\nIs it a VHDX or VHD, small or large?\n\n307\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.520\nAnd we make our appropriate choice.\n\n308\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.480\nWe may have custom VHD or VHDX hard\ndrives that we've added into the library,\n\n309\n00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.570\nand are served up through\nthe library server.\n\n310\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.547\nSo we've talked before, about having one\nthat may already be installed with an OS,\n\n311\n00:15:43.547 --> 00:15:44.677\nand pre-configured.\n\n312\n00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:47.698\nSo you may see different\noptions when you do this.\n\n313\n00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:51.780\nWe're just using the standards default\nthat are loaded with VMM out of the box.\n\n314\n00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.396\nWe haven't bothered to load any\nadditional virtual drives in here.\n\n315\n00:15:54.396 --> 00:15:56.850\nBut we could easily create one,\nif we wanted to.\n\n316\n00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.475\nPut it in there, and have it available on\nthe real world, we would often do that.\n\n317\n00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.387\nSo we'll do a large VHDX file.\n\n318\n00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:04.961\nWe've talked about the fact that\nthe large ones are 60 GB in size, so\n\n319\n00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:07.459\nthat's we would go in And\nwe would take a look at.\n\n320\n00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:08.115\nSo, we're gonna do that.\n\n321\n00:16:08.115 --> 00:16:09.381\nYou can see that there.\n\n322\n00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:12.740\nWe'll then go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n323\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.550\nWe then have our ability to be able to\ngo and configure our network adapter,\n\n324\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.490\nyou can see in here our disk,\nand partitions and our drivers.\n\n325\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.830\nSo, we're gonna go in,\nlet's just take a look here.\n\n326\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.300\nUnder the network adapters, you'll see\nthat we have the ability to be able to\n\n327\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.550\neither configure a physical network\nadapter as the management net meaning,\n\n328\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.730\nhow are we gonna be able to\nthrough either the VM kernel, or\n\n329\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.960\nthe Windows Hyper-V hyper visor, whatever\nhyper visor we're using in this case,\n\n330\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.850\nthe Windows hyper visor, Hyper-V.\n\n331\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.150\nHow are we going to be able\nto manage the host, right?\n\n332\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.610\nAnd we have to have a nick\nthat's gonna allow us to\n\n333\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.040\ninteract from the hyper visor to the host\nand bind it, so that we can actually talk.\n\n334\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.960\nSo, that's what we're talking about here.\n\n335\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.170\nSo, we create that connection through\nup-linking a nick to the logical switch,\n\n336\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.300\nor whatever the equivalent by vendor\nplatform, in terms of that process.\n\n337\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.855\nSo, configuring physical adapter in, or\nas the management NIC will be done here.\n\n338\n00:17:05.855 --> 00:17:09.275\nThen you'll see we have the use\nof consistent device naming.\n\n339\n00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:14.075\nThis is going to specify if we want to,\nand name a convention for the NIC, and\n\n340\n00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:17.627\nspecify that it should be standardize,\ntop, top to decide how to do that.\n\n341\n00:17:19.047 --> 00:17:23.757\nIP configuration, is it DHCP based,\nis it going to have a static IP?\n\n342\n00:17:23.757 --> 00:17:27.987\nIf so, what are we going to\nallocate the static IP from?\n\n343\n00:17:27.987 --> 00:17:29.617\nIs there a logical network?\n\n344\n00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:32.287\nI have a logical network that\nI've created that's sitting there\n\n345\n00:17:32.287 --> 00:17:36.357\nin the networking stack inside\nthe infrastructure area, right, so\n\n346\n00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:39.887\nwe can go in in the fabric and\nwe can choose that network if we want to.\n\n347\n00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:43.660\nIt's up to us to decide, however,\nwe want to do that, so we'd specify that.\n\n348\n00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.630\nThen on the disc and\npartition here are we using an MBR,\n\n349\n00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.280\nor GUID partition table and MBR, or GPT?\n\n350\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.500\nSo, how big is the hard drive?\n\n351\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.720\nWhat are the partitions like?\n\n352\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.530\nWhat kind of support are we\ngoing to have there?\n\n353\n00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.140\nWe'll choose there make our choice,\nwhat's our volume level for ELS,\n\n354\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.030\nwhat's our file type?\n\n355\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.740\nYou'll file system,\nwrite remaining space available, and\n\n356\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.680\nwe're gonna take the whole drive portion\nof the memory 60 gigs to work with.\n\n357\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.560\nSo, how we gonna do that?\n\n358\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.190\nWhat's the thought process gonna be?\n\n359\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.136\nIs this going to be the boot partition,\nwe mark in this is active,\n\n360\n00:18:13.136 --> 00:18:16.852\nstandard stuff we don't have to think\nabout it just be aware, and think about.\n\n361\n00:18:16.852 --> 00:18:19.750\nAnd then, once we're done and\n\n362\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.550\nwe have everything set up, we're then\ngoing to go ahead we'll click Next.\n\n363\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.770\nIn the general settings here OS\nconfiguration, are we joining a domain?\n\n364\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.280\nRight, so\nif we are we're going to put that in.\n\n365\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.990\nAdmin password, you know,\nwe're gonna provide that.\n\n366\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.100\nIdentity information,\nproduct key, time zone, right,\n\n367\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.890\nstandard stuff as you can see there.\n\n368\n00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:46.207\nThen, oops, hold on one second, I'm sorry,\nI forgot I gotta put a domain in there.\n\n369\n00:18:46.207 --> 00:18:48.929\npracticelabs.com.\n\n370\n00:18:52.371 --> 00:18:56.820\nLet's go in, just use that there.\n\n371\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.333\nAnd then the password.\n\n372\n00:19:01.713 --> 00:19:03.000\nShould be the right password.\n\n373\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.340\nAll right, so we have all that,\nwe have all that, we have all that.\n\n374\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.060\nAnd, oops,\nI didn't enter the right password.\n\n375\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.270\nI thought, I typed it correctly, but\nthat's what I get for being too quick.\n\n376\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.305\nAll right, let's try that one more time.\n\n377\n00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:20.160\nThat should match now.\n\n378\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.206\nThere we go, okay.\n\n379\n00:19:21.206 --> 00:19:23.030\nSo, now, we have our host settings here,\n\n380\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.025\nthis is where we're going to use\nthe virtual machine placement path,\n\n381\n00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:29.526\nin other words, where we're going to store\nthe VMs that are going to get created,\n\n382\n00:19:29.526 --> 00:19:33.210\nright?, so we have to specify either an\nalternate path, or accept the default one.\n\n383\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.480\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n384\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.200\nWe're not going to bother to add one,\nbut we could if we wanted to.\n\n385\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.800\nClick Next, go ahead hit finish there.\n\n386\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.690\nJust let that go in.\n\n387\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.240\nYou see it's been created there.\n\n388\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.790\nAnd then we have our [COUGH] fisical\ncomputer profile that will then be used\n\n389\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.790\nto apply to a host then provision it,\nso it can be a VM host, remember.\n\n390\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.020\nThis will essentially take a host and\nconfigure it, so\n\n391\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.390\nit can be set up to run Hyper-V.\n\n392\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.550\nAnd become a host that could be added\nto a host group and added to VMM, so\n\n393\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.380\nwe can run virtual machines on it.\n\n394\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.250\nNow, to that end, we'll just break\nout of our thought process here, and\n\n395\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.030\nthe building blocks for just a second.\n\n396\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:11.400\nLet's go, actually just a second,\nright up here, right?\n\n397\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.040\nLet's go take a look real quick at.\n\n398\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.220\nWhere that host would wind up.\n\n399\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.430\nWe talked about this before, but\nassuming we've deployed this host, and\n\n400\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.130\nthe profile has been used to\nconfigure a host and stand it up.\n\n401\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.370\nWe would then wanna go in and\nadd it to a host group.\n\n402\n00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.200\nAnd we talked about this before,\nbut I wanna show this to you.\n\n403\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.390\nWe come in over here, VMs and services.\n\n404\n00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.140\nYou'll see here all up under all hosts,\nwhich is our default hosts group.\n\n405\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.830\nI've created another host group\ncalled ITPRO.TV HG1, just for\n\n406\n00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.810\nhost group one, and\nI added a host in there rplanvmm01,\n\n407\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.960\nmy virtual machine manager host is there,\nI've gone through the process doing that,\n\n408\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.635\nbut I would add in a host o a host group\nwhether it's the existing all host group.\n\n409\n00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:50.165\nOr if I want to create another host group,\nI can do that.\n\n410\n00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.695\nJust right click here and\ncreate a host group.\n\n411\n00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:53.845\nIt's very simple to do that.\n\n412\n00:20:53.845 --> 00:20:56.495\nIt's gonna be enough of you\nmore that just a container.\n\n413\n00:20:56.495 --> 00:21:01.425\nI can name it, I just called it,\nhg2 just for purposes of course,\n\n414\n00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:02.675\nI have to be in there it's the name it.\n\n415\n00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:06.435\nThere we go,\nhg2 just the purposes of our discussion.\n\n416\n00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:09.110\nLet's save this hierarchically\nit shows up there.\n\n417\n00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.880\nWhen I want to add a host to a host group,\ndoesn't matter which host group,\n\n418\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.920\nwhichever one I want,\nall I have to do is right-click,\n\n419\n00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.164\nadd either a Hyper-V host, or a cluster\nof host if there is more than one,\n\n420\n00:21:21.164 --> 00:21:24.390\nadd central sand host standard cluster,\nand VMware hosts or clusters.\n\n421\n00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.530\nSo, I could add the hosts in just by using\nthe wizard here, right-clicking, and\n\n422\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.670\ngoing in and doing that.\n\n423\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.590\nSo, I would run through the wizard here,\nit's very straightforward.\n\n424\n00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.360\nIs this, in this case we're adding\na Windows server, are we doing this from\n\n425\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.800\na trusted AD domain, computers that are in\non an untrusted AD domain are server\n\n426\n00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.660\non a computer perimeter\nnetwork meaning the DMC, or\n\n427\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.700\na physical computer that's gonna be\nprovisioned as a virtual machine.\n\n428\n00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.830\nSo, I may already have it,\nI may not, it may be available, or\n\n429\n00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.740\nmaybe on a different domain,\nI have options.\n\n430\n00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.850\nI'll choose appropriately here.\n\n431\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.500\nWe would add in by using either an\nexisting run as account and/or specifying\n\n432\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.600\nthe credential for one.\n\n433\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.610\nIt'd be up to us to decide.\n\n434\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.400\nI'm just gonna go ahead,\n\n435\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.850\nI'm not gonna run the wizard,\ncuz I've already added the host in.\n\n436\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.050\nI'm just gonna leave it there for\nthe moment just to show you.\n\n437\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.480\nBut we're not gonna actually\ncomplete the wizard at this time.\n\n438\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.635\nI would go ahead and I would specify,\n\n439\n00:22:13.188 --> 00:22:16.570\nWhatever the name of the machine\nis that I wanna target.\n\n440\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.480\nAnd I may, it come back and\ngive me an arrow.\n\n441\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.040\nThe first time I may have to\nrefresh to get it to come back in.\n\n442\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.250\nSometimes, it just doesn't\ndo the full discovery\n\n443\n00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.010\nwithin the time out value on\nthe console just like that.\n\n444\n00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.480\nAnd that's expected sometimes.\n\n445\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.110\nNo big deal.\n\n446\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.800\nIf we get that just want to\nmove that over just a smidge.\n\n447\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.570\nIf we get that just hit refresh and\nnormally you can go out and find it.\n\n448\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.740\nSo, you would see it listed there,\nit may take one, or more tries.\n\n449\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.980\nBut you get the idea.\n\n450\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.919\nOnce we're done, you get whole settings,\nwe'd actually be able to go in and\n\n451\n00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:44.879\nedit the host settings.\n\n452\n00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:49.235\nAnd then we would click finish, and\nwe would then assuming it's successful,\n\n453\n00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.670\nsee the host data in,\nyou can see the host sitting right here.\n\n454\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.204\nAnd we can see that once we have the host\navailable, you'll see that we can go in,\n\n455\n00:22:57.204 --> 00:22:59.020\nwe can start up a VM on that host.\n\n456\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.680\nWe can put it in maintenance mode.\n\n457\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.970\nWe can connect to it.\n\n458\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.870\nWe can do all sorts of stuff with it.\n\n459\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.028\nAnd we're able to go in,\nand modify the settings.\n\n460\n00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:09.165\nAnd you can see the settings\nthat are available to me here,\n\n461\n00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:10.490\nthe properties on the host.\n\n462\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.120\nYou'll see I have status,\neverything is running well.\n\n463\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.000\nThe hardware on the host, so\nI can see how much resources, CPU, memory,\n\n464\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.740\nall that kind of stuff available.\n\n465\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.570\nThe virtual machine path that\nwe were talking about setting up\n\n466\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.250\nis the default one I can add and\nmodify if necessary.\n\n467\n00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.950\nI have any reserves,\nif I have storage mounted, which I do,\n\n468\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.520\nI'll be able to see the storage.\n\n469\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.460\nAdd storage here if necessary.\n\n470\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.180\nGot virtual switches if\nthere are any available.\n\n471\n00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.200\nMigration settings, so I'm gonna be\nsetting up live migration back and\n\n472\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.550\nforth to bounce VMs between hosts.\n\n473\n00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.020\nAll the stuff is available here.\n\n474\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.910\nAnd I can go in and\ninteract with all this.\n\n475\n00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.630\nSo, when we add the host in\nusing their host profile,\n\n476\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.650\nand we actually deploy them and they come\nup, this is where we would wind up going\n\n477\n00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.810\nin order to be able to grab them,\nbring them in.\n\n478\n00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.860\nAnd then actually add them to a host\ngroup and use them to start hosting, or\n\n479\n00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.510\nproviding resources for\nour virtual machines.\n\n480\n00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.660\nSo, this are the building blocks of the\ncloud, because we then add these building\n\n481\n00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.647\nblocks, and then we use them and deploy\nthem actually create a private cloud.\n\n482\n00:24:07.647 --> 00:24:09.119\nTo that end, since we're here,\n\n483\n00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:11.968\nlet's just talk about how we\ncreate a private cloud real quick.\n\n484\n00:24:11.968 --> 00:24:12.784\nWe're in the area.\n\n485\n00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:14.363\nMight as well just take a look.\n\n486\n00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:18.375\nSo when we go up here, again we're in\nthe VMs and services area, I mentioned I'd\n\n487\n00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:21.890\nshow you quickly the Wizard and\nwalk you through the logic of this.\n\n488\n00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.130\nYou'll see the cloud here.\n\n489\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.390\nNotice I don't have any clouds created.\n\n490\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.430\nGo in, create a cloud.\n\n491\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.580\nUse our little Create a Cloud Wizard.\n\n492\n00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.920\nSo we can go and specify our name.\n\n493\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.230\nLet's call this ITPro TVCloud1.\n\n494\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.130\nYou will come up with an appropriate name,\nprobably by tenant for\n\n495\n00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.400\nthe clouds which you're gonna deploy.\n\n496\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.690\nSo if this belonged to ABC Corp\nas their private cloud,\n\n497\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.540\nyou'll probably call\nit the ABC Corp Cloud.\n\n498\n00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.860\nThat way, when the tenant logs in, they\ncan grab the cloud and interact with it.\n\n499\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.250\nThat would make a lot of sense.\n\n500\n00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.400\nGiven what we're doing in\nmulti-tenant hosting environments\n\n501\n00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.050\nwhere we may have more than one cloud and\nmore than one tenant, right?\n\n502\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.650\nSo that would be something to consider and\nbe aware of so\n\n503\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.650\nwe'll create that with\nthe appropriate name.\n\n504\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.150\nYou'll see we have our host groups there.\n\n505\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.910\nRemember I added a second host group for\ndemo purposes.\n\n506\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.290\nThat does not have any hosts in it,\nso it's empty.\n\n507\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.820\nBut the one that does have the host in\nit right there does have resources.\n\n508\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.170\nYou can see it right there.\n\n509\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.580\nSo we would select\nthe appropriate host group.\n\n510\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.040\nWith the host in it that we wanna have run\nand provide the underlying resources for\n\n511\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.230\nthe cloud with, so\nI'm gonna grab that one there.\n\n512\n00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.740\n&gt;&gt; And you said we could add individuals\nwhen you're setting up those host groups\n\n513\n00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.850\nor at a later time,\nlike you see here, correct?\n\n514\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.565\n&gt;&gt; We could add, what do you mean\nindividuals, you mean hosts?\n\n515\n00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:34.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the hosts.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could add hosts in.\n\n516\n00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:37.215\nNow, we're not adding hosts here,\nwe're creating a cloud here.\n\n517\n00:25:37.215 --> 00:25:40.015\nBut we could add hosts simply by\ndoing what I showed you before.\n\n518\n00:25:40.015 --> 00:25:44.870\nWhich would be go to the host group,\nright click and just add a host, and\n\n519\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.720\nyou can add as many as you\nwant in at any point in time.\n\n520\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.180\nBut this is gonna bring that host group\ntogether, aggregate the resources,\n\n521\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.620\nand let us create a cloud.\n\n522\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.630\nThat's what we're doing\nwith this Wizard right now.\n\n523\n00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.150\nSo I don't have all the building blocks,\nquote, unquote, setup right now.\n\n524\n00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.010\nYou see we're in the middle of\ncreating profiles and things, but\n\n525\n00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.360\njust show you quickly what\nthe Wizard looks like.\n\n526\n00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.460\nSo the logical networks,\n\n527\n00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.470\nthe ones that would be available,\nyou'd associate them here.\n\n528\n00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.430\nAny of the load balancers, we've talked\nabout all these component parts from\n\n529\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.350\nthe networking infrastructure\nin the fabric in prior episodes.\n\n530\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.490\nYou have a good sense of what\nthese are at this point.\n\n531\n00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.200\nIf you don't remember them or\nthey're not familiar to you, go back and\n\n532\n00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.660\ntake a look at those episodes.\n\n533\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.550\nWe have our virtual IP templates, we'd\nhave those if we have any listed here.\n\n534\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.970\nWe have our port classifications.\n\n535\n00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.335\nWe have created those and\ntalked about those before.\n\n536\n00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.320\nWe'd specify whatever we want here,\n\n537\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.110\nthis port classification allows us to\nbind the functionality to the cloud.\n\n538\n00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.560\nSo we wanna be able to do live migration,\nwe would specify live migration so\n\n539\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.550\nwe have that capability.\n\n540\n00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.980\nIf we want to be able to do\niSCSI workloads and pass iSCSI\n\n541\n00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.410\ntraffic through our switches for\nstorage access, we'd specify that here.\n\n542\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.790\nSo we would check off the appropriate port\nclassifications that have been created.\n\n543\n00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.930\nWe showed you in our walk throughs\non the network infrastructure and\n\n544\n00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.950\nthe fabric, how to create a port\nclassification for Hyper-V.\n\n545\n00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.280\nAnd we actually walked through and\ncreated one.\n\n546\n00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.025\nWhatever storage would be available so\nlocal storage, right?\n\n547\n00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:04.940\nWe'd specify that so\nwe grab our storage coming from the host.\n\n548\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.210\nRemember the hosts are providing all\nthese resources that's where they're\n\n549\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.820\ncoming from.\n\n550\n00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.684\nStored VM path, we need to use\nthe specified path by adding one in or\n\n551\n00:27:12.684 --> 00:27:14.210\njust use the default one.\n\n552\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.420\nIt's up to us.\n\n553\n00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.600\nWe have capacity here so what's\nthe capacity being offered by the host.\n\n554\n00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.780\nSo, we would see here, we have 6\ngigs of memory, 60 gigs of storage.\n\n555\n00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.410\nWe have quotas, and virtual machines.\n\n556\n00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.110\nAnd the ability to have virtual CPUs.\n\n557\n00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.950\nAll that is gonna either be specified or\n\n558\n00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.057\nconfigured here based on\nthe way the host is set up.\n\n559\n00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.830\nCapability profile, remember we were\ntalking about the fact we do provide\n\n560\n00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.570\nhosting, right,\nfrom three host profiles by default.\n\n561\n00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.750\nESXI, or ESX VMware servers,\nhyper v Windows compatible servers for\n\n562\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.900\nHyper V and or Zen, so we would choose\nthe appropriate one that we want here.\n\n563\n00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.360\nWe may have our own additional\ncapability profiles.\n\n564\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.350\nI haven't shown you how to create one yet\nbut we'll walk through and\n\n565\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.750\ndo that in our next upcoming episode.\n\n566\n00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.430\nCuz we're gonna have a part\ntwo to finish out the building\n\n567\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.324\nblocks here cuz we took a little\ndetour to create private clouds.\n\n568\n00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:05.340\nSo we're gonna come back and\n\n569\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.350\njust finish walking through the rest\nof those capability profiles and\n\n570\n00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:12.050\nthe application profile and the SQL\nprofile, those other ones that are there,\n\n571\n00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.380\nI want you to see how those work as\nwell and we'll talk about those.\n\n572\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.240\nSo Hyper V or whatever we would choose\nhere and we may have a custom one if we do\n\n573\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.310\ncreate one it would show up on the list\nand we would choose the appropriate one.\n\n574\n00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.130\nYou would click next here, you would click\nfinish, and then your cloud would show up.\n\n575\n00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.190\nAnd when you're done.\n\n576\n00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.900\nThere we go, create new cloud,\ngives it just a minute.\n\n577\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.600\nIt will then show up and be available\nto us, there it is right there.\n\n578\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.310\nAnd then we can go in and we can start\nto use that to provide resources and\n\n579\n00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.210\nwhatever the case may be we can\nhave VMs here, services, etc.\n\n580\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.100\nWe've got the ability to create a service\nor a VM, assign it to this cloud,\n\n581\n00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.420\ncuz that's where we're creating it.\n\n582\n00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.320\nSo we could then go and use a VM\ntemplate to actually spin up a VM.\n\n583\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.925\nWe've talked about about how\nwe could do those things.\n\n584\n00:28:55.925 --> 00:28:58.455\nAnd to begin to see all these\nmoving pieces come together.\n\n585\n00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:03.255\nAnd we can provision out\na administrative boundary or container.\n\n586\n00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:05.085\nWhich is what the cloud really represents.\n\n587\n00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:08.685\nThe aggregation of all these resources,\nassign it to our tenants and\n\n588\n00:29:08.685 --> 00:29:10.915\nallow them to come in and consume.\n\n589\n00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:11.435\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n590\n00:29:11.435 --> 00:29:13.575\nWe were able to take a look at\nsome of those building blocks.\n\n591\n00:29:13.575 --> 00:29:17.120\nBut like Adam said, we do have\nadditional blocks or pieces to look\n\n592\n00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.011\nat we are gonna take a look-\n&gt;&gt; Lego part two\n\n593\n00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:21.497\n&gt;&gt; Lego part two more SQL and what was it,\n\n594\n00:29:21.497 --> 00:29:22.905\nSQL and application?\n\n595\n00:29:22.905 --> 00:29:24.230\n&gt;&gt; SQL, application, and\n\n596\n00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.530\ncapability those three are the ones\nwe are gonna come back and do.\n\n597\n00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.780\n&gt;&gt; All right sounds like a plan so thank\nyou for joining us today but for this show\n\n598\n00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.170\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign off\nremember I am your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n599\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.110\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n600\n00:29:35.110 -->

Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.558\nThis is a part two, a continuation where\nwe were examining different building\n\n9\n00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:23.370\nblock, if I can say this, right.\n\n10\n00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.612\n&gt;&gt; Building boxes, building what?\n\n11\n00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:25.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Building blocks.\n\n12\n00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n13\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.330\nDifferent components of the private cloud,\nand\n\n14\n00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.070\nback with us in studios today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.610\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n16\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.237\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back to\nbuild boxes, blocks, and baskets, and\n\n17\n00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.820\nall sorts of other cool stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.051\nSo we're gonna continue our conversation\naround the component parts of\n\n19\n00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.700\nthe private Cloud infrastructure in SCVMM.\n\n20\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.627\nWe've been taking a look\nat them in prior episodes.\n\n21\n00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:50.712\nIn case you haven't seen it, probably\ngood for you to go back, take a look.\n\n22\n00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:52.963\nWe took a look at the three of\nthe six profiles we can create.\n\n23\n00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:56.486\nTake a look at the guest OS profile,\nthe hardware profile and\n\n24\n00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.430\nthe physical computer profile.\n\n25\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.290\nThe host profile generically will\nbe often referred to it is as.\n\n26\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.910\nWe also took a little detour.\n\n27\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.857\nTook a look at host groups and took a look\nat how to create a private cloud from all\n\n28\n00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.523\nthe component parts in the building block.\n\n29\n00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:10.220\nSo we added in a little\nextra bonus there for you.\n\n30\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.299\nBut it's important to know how to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.944\nIt's good to remind ourselves of all that.\n\n32\n00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:16.130\nWe're gonna jump back into the profiles\narea here in just a moment.\n\n33\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.070\nWe're gonna jump in,\ntake a look at how to use the SQL profile.\n\n34\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.127\nWe'll take a look at\nthe application profile and\n\n35\n00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:22.690\nthe capability profiles, as well.\n\n36\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.400\nBut before we that, just a couple of words\nabout how we can leverage the SQL profile.\n\n37\n00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.933\nWe can use this specifically, and probably\nno mystery to you based on what the name\n\n38\n00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:36.352\nof the profile is, to deploy SQL Servers\nand we can certainly do that using VMM.\n\n39\n00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:41.145\nWe can starting with VMM 12\ndo deployments of SQL Server.\n\n40\n00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:43.500\nWe could use\nSQL Server Profile to do that.\n\n41\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.070\nWe can configure our\nSQL Server instance and\n\n42\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.290\nhave it deployed out to a virtual machine.\n\n43\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.630\nRemember, all these profiles are gonna\nbe used to deploy instances to\n\n44\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.880\nvirtual machines.\n\n45\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.840\nEssentially creating copies of\nthe templated configurations and\n\n46\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.040\nthen using them to stand up the VM.\n\n47\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.530\nSo we're gonna be able to do that as\npart of an overall thought process.\n\n48\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370\nBut we do have a couple of steps,\nor things we have to be aware of\n\n49\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.700\ninvolved specifically and\nkinda uniquely associated with SQL.\n\n50\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.860\nWe have to prepare the SQL Server image.\n\n51\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.770\nIn our mind,\nkinda the thought process around step one.\n\n52\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.840\nCreate a SQL Server profile, we're gonna\ntake a look at how to do that in a minute.\n\n53\n00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.480\nStep two, create a virtual machine\ntemplate, what's called a VM template.\n\n54\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.730\nWe'll talk about that and\nshow you where that is,\n\n55\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.610\nit's up right above us in the library.\n\n56\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.030\nUp in the templates area, so we'll take\na look at that, that's step three.\n\n57\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.103\nWe'll create a service template.\n\n58\n00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:30.609\nWe've talked about how to do that and\nwhat those look like, and\n\n59\n00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.325\nwe'll remind you where those are as well.\n\n60\n00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:37.022\nAnd then we deploy the service, because\nthe deployment of SQL Server has to be\n\n61\n00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:39.490\nassociated with a service deployment.\n\n62\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.560\nSo we're gonna be doing these things.\n\n63\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.450\nWe're gonna really just jump in,\nand narrate for\n\n64\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.040\nyou quickly what the thought process is\naround preparing the SQL Server image,\n\n65\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.450\nbefore we go in and\nstart using the actual SQL Server profile.\n\n66\n00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.860\nThe templates I mentioned,\njust cuz we have the area up,\n\n67\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.530\nwe can take a look at them real quick.\n\n68\n00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.800\nUp here, the VM template,\nthe service templates.\n\n69\n00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.000\nSo we have those available, or\nwe'll have those available, as well.\n\n70\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.480\nBut before we jump in here and\nbefore we create our SQL Server profile,\n\n71\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.270\nyou could see it right there.\n\n72\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.475\nWe'll go to it in just a minute.\n\n73\n00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:10.630\nBut before we do that, just a couple\nof words, we'll move that over so\n\n74\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.436\nyou can see that.\n\n75\n00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:15.270\nJust a couple of words about\npreparing the SQL Server image.\n\n76\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.695\nWhen we prepare an image, and Cherokee,\nyou may have had some experience using\n\n77\n00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.483\nthis tool and\ndoing this I'm sure in days gone by.\n\n78\n00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:23.444\nYou remember Sysprep?\n\n79\n00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:24.308\n&gt;&gt; Sysprep, yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:27.070\n&gt;&gt; Sure okay, so Sysprep,\nwhat does Sysprep do?\n\n81\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Sysprep is going to allow\nme to take an image and\n\n82\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.820\nconfigure it in any way that I want to so\nthat I can deploy it and\n\n83\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.450\nI can deploy it numerous times\nwithout having to do it individually.\n\n84\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.410\nI create one individual image and\n\n85\n00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.720\njust have it in my little library or\nhave my own personal storage of it.\n\n86\n00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.780\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n87\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.200\nlet's try to say that Sysprep\nessentially allows me to take an image,\n\n88\n00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.940\nthe one that you're creating in any\nway you would like, as you said.\n\n89\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.191\nAnd the key to finding characteristics of\nSysprep, thing that's really important to\n\n90\n00:03:58.191 --> 00:04:01.620\nknow about it is it strips out all unique\ndefining characteristics in the image.\n\n91\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.575\nSo that we could do exactly what you\ndescribes, which is we could re-deploy\n\n92\n00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:07.500\nthat much time and again, but it's\nalways gonna be unique when we do that.\n\n93\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.318\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have to worry about\nany of those underlined underpaying\n\n94\n00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:10.880\ncomponents.\n\n95\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.211\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, things like the GUID and the\nSID and unique identifiers that specify,\n\n96\n00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:19.877\nhey, I'm a domain joined machine and I'm a\nunique instance and all that kinda stuff.\n\n97\n00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:23.811\nSo, the generic concept of Sysprep is\nlet's take away all the things that\n\n98\n00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:26.551\nare unique,\nleaving behind the configurations.\n\n99\n00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:29.976\nAnd then using the configurations\nto re-deploy multiple copies of\n\n100\n00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.620\nthe machine probably paired\nwith an answer file, or\n\n101\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.444\na little wizard lets us put\nback in those unique things,\n\n102\n00:04:35.444 --> 00:04:39.420\nlike a machine name, like the domain\ninstance, things of that nature.\n\n103\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.200\nAnd then we get multiple unique copies,\nas Cherokee was describing for\n\n104\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.665\nus, based on that image.\n\n105\n00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:47.855\nWell, Sysprep is not just for\nWindows OSs anymore.\n\n106\n00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:50.351\nReason I'm talking about this and\nmention this tool is,\n\n107\n00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.487\nyou gotta use Sysprep to\ndeploy SQL images here.\n\n108\n00:04:52.487 --> 00:04:57.560\nAnd we actually have a SQL Server Sysprep\nsolution that is bundled in SQL 2008 and\n\n109\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.355\nin SQL 12.\n\n110\n00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:02.619\nThe Sysprep tool's actually installed and\navailable as part of the build of SQL.\n\n111\n00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.351\nAnd we leverage that in a two-step\nprocess to do our image preparation here.\n\n112\n00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:09.051\nSo if you haven't done that before,\nif you're not aware of that,\n\n113\n00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.710\nit's something that's really\nimportant just to be aware of.\n\n114\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.580\nDuring the image prep phase,\nwe go through,\n\n115\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.530\nwe get the SQL Server set up,\nit installs all the binaries.\n\n116\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.850\nLays out, in other words, essentially\nthe moving parts of the product for us.\n\n117\n00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.130\nBut doesn't configure any of\nthe SQL Server settings for that instance.\n\n118\n00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.800\nIt just essentially does the install,\nnothing else.\n\n119\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.100\nAfter that first step completes, we run\nSysprep, and then the image is captured.\n\n120\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.280\nSo that strips out anything\nthat will be unique.\n\n121\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.750\nWe capture the image, and then,\n\n122\n00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.050\nas a result we could redeploy that generic\nSQL install and then customize as we go.\n\n123\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.060\nSo Sysprep's gonna be important for us to\nhave knowledge of and important for us to\n\n124\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.590\nknow that we're gonna walk through that\nprocess here as part of image preparation.\n\n125\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.640\nNow with SQL Server 14 and 16, there's\njust some additional guidance you wanna\n\n126\n00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.847\ntake a look at on the web to ensure\nyou understand the logic of this.\n\n127\n00:05:55.847 --> 00:05:59.125\nI mentioned with 12,\nwith SQL 2008 R2 and 12,\n\n128\n00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.004\nthat we have Sysprep bundled with 14 and\n16.\n\n129\n00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:04.830\nJust have some additional\nthings you wanna be aware.\n\n130\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.664\nSo we'll make sure you have the URL for\nthat in the show notes.\n\n131\n00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:07.500\nJust take a look and\n\n132\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.739\nmake sure in case you're gonna be doing\na brand new install with the latest\n\n133\n00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:13.994\ntechnology that you have all\nthe information required to be successful.\n\n134\n00:06:13.994 --> 00:06:16.480\nSo, we'll make sure we put\nthat in there for you.\n\n135\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.245\nBut let's take a look at\nhow to create SQL profiles.\n\n136\n00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.415\nI've already got that started up here.\n\n137\n00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:21.610\nWhat we're gonna do is go in here,\nwe'll give this a name.\n\n138\n00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.610\nLet's call this our ITProTV SQL Instance\nor whatever you'd wanna call it.\n\n139\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.240\nAnd of course,\nit would help if I click in there and\n\n140\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.980\nI type as opposed to typing but\nusing the force to try to type.\n\n141\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.551\nCuz apparently, I didn't actually type it.\n\n142\n00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.779\nLet me try that one more time and this\ntime actually make sure that it's typing.\n\n143\n00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.115\n&gt;&gt; You're good, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, yeah, I can see it going.\n\n144\n00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:42.391\nThank you very much.\n\n145\n00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:44.676\nSo ITPRO ISQL, right?\n\n146\n00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:45.469\nWe'll just call it that.\n\n147\n00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:46.736\nTake space out of there.\n\n148\n00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:49.953\nAll right, so SQL Server profile,\nwe go over here and\n\n149\n00:06:49.953 --> 00:06:52.610\nwe have to add in our\nSQL Server deployment.\n\n150\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.805\nNotice there's nothing there by default,\nso click that and\n\n151\n00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:58.145\nwe get a little instance here\nthat we can start working with.\n\n152\n00:06:58.145 --> 00:07:03.565\nSo we'll get our instance name and\n\n153\n00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:06.770\nour instance ID, our product key, etc.\n\n154\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.770\nSpecify a Run As account.\n\n155\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.270\nWe'll use our system\naccount to do all of that.\n\n156\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.910\nSo, we're gonna put all\nthat information in and\n\n157\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.280\nthen let's go through configuration.\n\n158\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.830\nWe have to specify as you can\nsee here our security mode,\n\n159\n00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.440\nwe'll be doing Windows authentication or\nSQL Server authentication.\n\n160\n00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.330\nThe difference here being, are we gonna\nbe doing authentication through the LDAP\n\n161\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.940\ndirectory through Windows using a domain\naccount or are we gonna authenticate\n\n162\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.320\nagainst the SQL Server locally\nusing the SQL Server account.\n\n163\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.400\nThey may be the same,\nthey may be different.\n\n164\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.340\nBut we do have an option to authenticate\nagainst the SQL Server directly.\n\n165\n00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.430\nSo we just wanna keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n166\n00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.590\nIt's up to us to decide\nhow we're gonna do that.\n\n167\n00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.286\nAnd there are reasons occasionally where\nwe will do SQL Server authentication as\n\n168\n00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:51.635\nopposed to doing a Windows\nbased authentication.\n\n169\n00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:54.688\nSo we just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and we're thinking about that.\n\n170\n00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:58.327\nLet me actually just go back here real\nquick and let me just add in There we go\n\n171\n00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:02.082\nyou just add in my instance ID so I'll\nget an error if I don't put something in\n\n172\n00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:06.090\nthere whether I have to actually put in\na real instance or not is irrelevant.\n\n173\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.660\nAnd I don't need a product key I can leave\nthat out and obviously add that in later.\n\n174\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.740\nSo I've got my run as a account there,\nso up on our configuration.\n\n175\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.040\nSo, we'll go ahead and we'll specify\nWindows Authentication, and or SA account.\n\n176\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.770\nAre we gonna use TCP IP for\nremote connections?\n\n177\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.890\nUse name pipes.\n\n178\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.790\nDo we have a SQL config file?\n\n179\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.950\nJust move that over just a little more,\nso you could see that.\n\n180\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.490\nDo we have a SQL config file,\n\n181\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.570\nessentially a scripted file that\nwe're gonna wanna use for that?\n\n182\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.320\nWe have options.\n\n183\n00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.200\nIt's up to us to decide\nhow we're gonna do that.\n\n184\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.580\nSo we're gonna put in.\n\n185\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.850\nI have my run outs account there and\nfor that,\n\n186\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.550\nI'm just wanna make sure\nthat we got all that.\n\n187\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.312\nThat's good and then for\nauthentication, got all that.\n\n188\n00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:47.190\nAll right, so for my media source,\nI'm just gonna type this in.\n\n189\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.600\nLet's just say we're gonna\nfind it on our D drive,\n\n190\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.130\nwherever we're actually gonna path to\nthe media install, it'll be up to us.\n\n191\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.030\nLet's put in our domain,\n\n192\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.250\nsince we're doing Windows authentication,\nour domain account.\n\n193\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:03.670\nPractice labs and administrator,\nup to us to decide what we're doing there.\n\n194\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.740\nAnd notice, by the way, typing this in but\n\n195\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.480\nnotice I'm clicking the add\nbutton to drop it down here.\n\n196\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.030\nImportant to make sure you go through\nthat process and don't think,\n\n197\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.060\nI just typed it in and\nit's gonna automatically take it.\n\n198\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.120\nType it in, click add,\ndrop it down there, right.\n\n199\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.930\nSo specify that, so\nwe've got all that set up.\n\n200\n00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.620\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n201\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.800\nmake sure here that we have\nour essay run as account.\n\n202\n00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.750\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna click browse,\n\n203\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.240\nI'm gonna put in my run as account.\n\n204\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.180\nSpecify the NT authority system account,\nor whatever run as account you decided.\n\n205\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.320\nAgain, it's up to you to decide\nwhat you're gonna put in there.\n\n206\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.910\nIt'll be up to you to decide how\nyou're going to set that up.\n\n207\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.480\nThen, what we're going to do is go ahead.\n\n208\n00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.250\nI don't think I need TCIP, I'll just take\na look at my notes here, real quick.\n\n209\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.640\nAnd make sure we got all that,\nnope, we don't need that.\n\n210\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.940\nAnd then service accounts, here,\nwe have to specify our service accounts.\n\n211\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.250\nWhat accounts are going to be used, to go\nin and specify the SQL Service credential,\n\n212\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.510\nthe SQL Server agent credential, and the\nreporting service credential if required.\n\n213\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.990\nReporting service is optional,\nthe other two are required.\n\n214\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.120\nSo you have to specify those.\n\n215\n00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.850\nYou'll see they are labelled\nas optional or required.\n\n216\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.990\nSo you can see required, required, none.\n\n217\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.180\nNone means optional, right?\n\n218\n00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.700\nI don't know why they\ndidn't just say optional.\n\n219\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.029\nThat would have been just so\nmuch more obvious.\n\n220\n00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:10.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But all right,\n\n221\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.640\nanyway we'll just go ahead,\nwe'll select our generic account here,\n\n222\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.370\njust to go through and do that.\n\n223\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.990\nSet that up.\n\n224\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.720\nSo we've got all that.\n\n225\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.310\nAll right, so once that's all done,\nwe'll click OK.\n\n226\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.970\nGet that deployed out.\n\n227\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.770\nTake just a second, pop in there.\n\n228\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.700\nNow we have our SQL profile.\n\n229\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.590\nSo now with our SQL profile,\nwhat we can do is we can take that,\n\n230\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.950\nleverage that if we decide that we wanna\nadd that to a service template and\n\n231\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.702\nactually drive a deployment of SQL Server.\n\n232\n00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:37.750\nWe'll take a look at what that\nlooks like here in just a moment.\n\n233\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.210\nBut before we do that,\nneed to create an application profile.\n\n234\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.900\nSo let's go in,\nwe'll go up to the top there,\n\n235\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.231\nwe'll create an application profile.\n\n236\n00:10:44.231 --> 00:10:48.730\nRight-click, create an application\nprofile, and let me go ahead and\n\n237\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.760\njust get rid of the task\nbar on the bottom here.\n\n238\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.040\nJust so we can move that down and\nwe can see that.\n\n239\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.030\nAll right, there we go.\n\n240\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.610\nAll right, so you'll see,\nwe'll give this a name.\n\n241\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:06.030\nLet's call this ITProTV App 1,\nor something like that.\n\n242\n00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.530\nCompatibility here.\n\n243\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.330\nIs it gonna be a SQL Server application\nhost, a web application host and\n\n244\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.520\nor a general item for the application\nprofile that we're creating?\n\n245\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.190\nWhat in other words is this application\ngonna do, where's it gonna run and\n\n246\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.460\nhow do we wanna set it up?\n\n247\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.690\nWe'll do a web application host cuz\nmost likely we're gonna do a web-based\n\n248\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.280\napplication.\n\n249\n00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.710\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll set that up.\n\n250\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.950\nAnd then when we do that the application\nconfiguration is gonna be done\n\n251\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.810\nover here on the left, just move this so\nyou guys can see the edge\n\n252\n00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.110\nof that screen while we're talking,\napplication configuration.\n\n253\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.440\nSo now we'll be able to go in.\n\n254\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.540\nWe'll be able to add in,\nas you can see here.\n\n255\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.680\nA web application as we chose web app.\n\n256\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.980\nIf I had chosen SQL then I'd be\nable to add in a SQL app, right?\n\n257\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.890\nAnd or if I chose general,\nI'd have access to the scripts.\n\n258\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.640\nAnd we can just quickly take a look\nat that if you just wanna see that.\n\n259\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.890\n&gt;&gt; Are we talking custom scripts or\n\n260\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.540\nare these pre-compiled that\nyou're gonna show us here?\n\n261\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.910\nWould we be able to import custom scripts?\n\n262\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.800\n&gt;&gt; Well you have the option to do a script\napplication, a virtual application and\n\n263\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.880\nor script to application or\nscript to application profile meaning\n\n264\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.840\nscripts being applied to configure and\nchange what we may choose to do.\n\n265\n00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.110\nSo SQL server here data tier\napp if we choose the SQL\n\n266\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.000\noption we can specify a SQL\nserver related application.\n\n267\n00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.580\nThat's what we get there.\n\n268\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.680\nSo we have different choices here,\ndepending on what we're choosing, and\n\n269\n00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.950\nthen under general,\nwhen you do that, you'll see here,\n\n270\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.720\ngo to click add, that we have the SQL one.\n\n271\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.650\nWe have the virtual app,\n\n272\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.320\nand the web app, as well as the script\napp, and a script app profile.\n\n273\n00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.720\nSo the virtual app, can be the server app,\nV app, that package that we may create\n\n274\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.060\nwith application virtualization and\nchoose to use here.\n\n275\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.510\nOr a web deploy output of packages where\n\n276\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.680\npackaging up a web application that could\nbe this thing for the web app here.\n\n277\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.240\nSo we have different options general just\ngives the broadest set of categories\n\n278\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.680\nthe other two are specifically\nuniquely tailored to just one.\n\n279\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.490\nAnd so\nI could chose web app from general and\n\n280\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.740\nstill do web app it doesn't\nmatter how I do that.\n\n281\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.620\nSo if I choose web app here,\nyou'll notice that I can then go in and\n\n282\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.890\nI can specify and find my application\npackage be up to me to decide what to do.\n\n283\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.910\nBut before I do that,\nlet's just go back here.\n\n284\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.870\nWe do have to choose an operating system.\n\n285\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.650\nSo we specify where this app will run,\nhow it's compatible.\n\n286\n00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.240\nIn other words what OS is it paired to.\n\n287\n00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.030\nSo we'd wanna choose,\n\n288\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.980\nwhatever operating system we think\nis gonna make the most sense here.\n\n289\n00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.120\nYou'll notice we have all the way down to\n2012, we could choose 2012 standard or\n\n290\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.190\ndata center,\n2012 R2 whatever the case may be.\n\n291\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.035\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n292\n00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:37.820\nSo I choose 2012, let's say and\nI do 64 bit 2012 standard.\n\n293\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.100\nThat would be the OS that I would\nuse if that's what I decide.\n\n294\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.210\nAnd then we can go ahead,\nwe can come here and\n\n295\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.680\nwe can choose, and you'll see it's\nrequired to choose a web app package.\n\n296\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.260\nI'd have to have a package available.\n\n297\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.280\nSo I would choose the appropriate\npackage if I had published one and\n\n298\n00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.680\nthen I would add it in here, and\n\n299\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.060\nI would then be able to go ahead and\nclick okay and get my application profile.\n\n300\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.350\nSo you would just simply have these\npackages preconfigured, loaded up,\n\n301\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.570\navailable, ready to go in the library and\nthen we're able to go in and choose them.\n\n302\n00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.490\nI haven't actually run a web deploy or\nserver app to extract,\n\n303\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.490\nserver app v rather, to extract a package,\nI don't have a package sitting here.\n\n304\n00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.670\nBut if I did I would then be able\nto simply click select it and\n\n305\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.850\ncreate or finish the appropriate choices\nthat I'm making here to drive the profile-\n\n306\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.840\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like with your,\n\n307\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.370\nyour knowledge with the bento boxes and\nbeing modular.\n\n308\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.830\nHere you can see they just took a\ndifferent approach saying building blocks,\n\n309\n00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.550\nbut pieces that are fitting together\nwith those application packages and\n\n310\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.750\nhow they integrate during\nthis process here.\n\n311\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.760\n&gt;&gt; They do.\nAnd Cherokee was asking about scripts, so\n\n312\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.400\nI just went ahead and\nremoved the web app packet for a minute,\n\n313\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.210\nadded in one of the script items here.\n\n314\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.140\nAnd so you can see, script command type.\n\n315\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.285\nAre we doing a pre pre-install,\nare we doing a post-install?\n\n316\n00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:51.195\nAre we doing a creation of a VM?\n\n317\n00:14:51.195 --> 00:14:54.765\nThe script is be able to do different\nthings, depending on what we wanna do.\n\n318\n00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:57.975\nEither modify a package\nthat's being deployed or\n\n319\n00:14:57.975 --> 00:15:00.127\ndeploy something in relation to that.\n\n320\n00:15:00.127 --> 00:15:03.487\nSo the script is just a script\nthat essentially we will use and\n\n321\n00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:05.237\nhave it do certain things.\n\n322\n00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.199\nAnd you'll see here we have\nan executable program.\n\n323\n00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.631\nWe have our parameters and\n\n324\n00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:11.700\nwe have the ability to specify\nwhat the account will be.\n\n325\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.788\nThe script resource package meaning right\nwhen we go to browse here will it be\n\n326\n00:15:16.788 --> 00:15:21.876\na web deploy or an SAV, a server\napplication, AV package or another package\n\n327\n00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:26.740\nthat we may have setup in our script\nrepository coming from the library.\n\n328\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.343\nAnd these would be loaded up or available\nagain and we would choose one or more of\n\n329\n00:15:31.343 --> 00:15:36.230\nthem and then we would deploy maybe the\nweb deploy tool or the server app V tool.\n\n330\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.570\nAnd actually deploy that so we can do the\nsequencer or the server app the agent or\n\n331\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.500\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n332\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.280\nAnd the script would then configure it for\nus.\n\n333\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.010\nSo these scripts are really designed\nto work on an application package and\n\n334\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.450\ncustomize how they get deployed.\n\n335\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.010\nThat's what we would ultimately do.\n\n336\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.519\nSo if we chose one of these,\nright, just hypothetically.\n\n337\n00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.976\nWe would put it in there,\nwe would specify our run as account.\n\n338\n00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:58.900\nLet's just grab one of those,\nsince we're here.\n\n339\n00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.218\nSpecify Our executable program,\nour parameters, right,\n\n340\n00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:06.800\nwe put all that in and\nthen we would finish up.\n\n341\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.970\nAnd then that's how we would\nactually create the profiles.\n\n342\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.825\nSo the application profiles\nare created simply by linking to\n\n343\n00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:17.370\nan application package that we wanna\nbe able to use based on category and\n\n344\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.600\nthen our capability profile,\nlet's go over here.\n\n345\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.660\nYou'll see we have the freedom we've been\ntalking about that we use hyper V ESXI for\n\n346\n00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.305\nor ESX rather for VM VMware, and Zen.\n\n347\n00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:30.375\nBut I did mention we could in the last\nepisode create a custom one if we\n\n348\n00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:32.655\nwanted to, and\nhave that available on our pick list,\n\n349\n00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:36.955\nas we did our host computer profile and\nchose compatibility, we could choose that.\n\n350\n00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:38.735\nSo we could create one\nhere if we wanted to.\n\n351\n00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:41.060\nJust right click create\ncompatability profile.\n\n352\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.570\nJust to show you this,\nwe give this a name, we'll call this,\n\n353\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:53.370\ncapabilityprofile1 and then click Next.\n\n354\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.300\nSpecify our capabilities,\n\n355\n00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.670\nyou'll see here what's our fabric\ncapability going to come from.\n\n356\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.980\nIs it HyperV ESX, ISN, so\n\n357\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.360\nwhat's the compatibility\ngonna be in terms of hosting.\n\n358\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.430\nSo we would chose the appropriate one.\n\n359\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.090\nWe would then be able to go in and\nmodify the appropriate settings for\n\n360\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.560\nthe number of processors, the amount\nof memory, whatever the case may be.\n\n361\n00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.980\nYou can see the number of hard drives for\ninstance here, things like that,\n\n362\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.900\nhow big they are, and\nthe number of network adaptors, you know,\n\n363\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.650\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n364\n00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.900\nAnd once we're done, that's assuming\nwe made a bunch of changes.\n\n365\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.570\nOnce we're done, click Finish.\n\n366\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.840\nYou'll see it gets created there for us.\n\n367\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.370\nYou'll see that we now have\na new capability profile\n\n368\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.970\nthat we can leverage as well.\n\n369\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.080\nSo we've gone through and\ntalked about all the different profiles.\n\n370\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.280\nWe said we will quickly go on top there,\nand that we would take a look at the VM\n\n371\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.870\ntemplate, and we would take\na look at the service template.\n\n372\n00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.950\nSo, since we're here,\nlet's just take a look at this.\n\n373\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.630\nWe'll go into VM templates.\n\n374\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.670\nYou'll see we have a VM template.\n\n375\n00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.040\nWe can create a VM template.\n\n376\n00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.830\nLet's just drag that down\njust a bit here if we can.\n\n377\n00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.910\nHold on one second,\ndidn't mean to click Next there.\n\n378\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.810\nLet me just see if I can move that down so\n\n379\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.270\nI can actually get a,\nI can do it right from there, no big deal.\n\n380\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.270\nAll right, so use an existing VM template,\n\n381\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.120\nit's a virtual hard drive\nstored in a library.\n\n382\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.990\nOr from an existing virtual machine.\n\n383\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.410\nWe can grab an existing VM and we can\nuse that VM and have it essentially be\n\n384\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.450\nthe thought process of providing\nthe settings to create the template.\n\n385\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.570\nSo, take an existing VM, profile it\nessentially and then use that or\n\n386\n00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.810\nwe can use an existing VM template or a\nvirtual hard drive to start from scratch.\n\n387\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.590\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll use a hard drive.\n\n388\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.430\nWe have our generic hard drives there, so\n\n389\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.270\nwe'll just grab our large VHDX\nhard drive and keep going.\n\n390\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.570\nWe're to give this a name.\n\n391\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:44.920\nWe'll call this ITPRO TV VM\ntemplate number one.\n\n392\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.500\nAgain, gen one or gen two VM.\n\n393\n00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.750\nWe've talked about this in prior episodes.\n\n394\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.040\nWe'll go with the generation of\nvirtual machine support based on\n\n395\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.510\nthe kind of hardware and\nbios that we're gonna be wanting to run.\n\n396\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.710\nWe'll do a gen1 here, that's fine.\n\n397\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.180\nClick Next, Hardware Profile.\n\n398\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.830\nRemember, we've created these profiles.\n\n399\n00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.180\nSo now, we can pull down and see\nthe hardware profile that we've created.\n\n400\n00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.210\nThis is the default profiles\nthat are available and/or\n\n401\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.990\nthe ones that have been\ncustomized in the profiles list.\n\n402\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.650\nAll the building blocks right here,\n\n403\n00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.250\nthis is where the building blocks start\nto come in if I want to modify this.\n\n404\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.340\nAnd by the way, notice our custom\ncapability profile is sitting there on\n\n405\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.190\nthe list as well.\n\n406\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.830\nSo we can see these things popping\nup all over the place now,\n\n407\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.300\nand we have the ability to\nbe able to choose them.\n\n408\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.880\nSo I can choose my capability profile\nright there changes this out.\n\n409\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.590\nAnd then I can choose my hardware profile,\nright there.\n\n410\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.279\nAnd you'll notice that when I change\nthe hardware profile out, for\n\n411\n00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:41.903\nthe no hardware profile to go with\ncapability profile selection,\n\n412\n00:19:41.903 --> 00:19:45.430\nit changes the capability profile\nthat I selected to Hyper-V.\n\n413\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.780\nAnd loads up the default settings for\nthat hardware profile.\n\n414\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.690\nSo I have to make a choice and\neither one, I can't choose both.\n\n415\n00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.860\nBecause when I choose the capability\nprofile here, it reconfigures it and\n\n416\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.220\nspecifies based on everything I said\nbecause in the capability profile,\n\n417\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.920\nI generate the hardware\nprofile as part of that.\n\n418\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.220\nIt's actually bundled in.\n\n419\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.520\nSo I make some choices here, right?\n\n420\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.260\nI have to add or remove.\n\n421\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.110\nModify?\n\n422\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:10.270\nI can add some new hardware and\nto augment this profile if I would like.\n\n423\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.230\nIt's up to me.\n\n424\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.320\nSo I specify that.\n\n425\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.400\nWe'll just go with Hardware Profile 1.\n\n426\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.990\nThat'll be fine, click next.\n\n427\n00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.400\nWe then have our guest OS profile again,\nremember we already created one, right?\n\n428\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.420\nPrior episode is where we did that,\nbut it's there, right?\n\n429\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.410\nWe kept it around.\n\n430\n00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.370\nSo no customizations required,\nwell let's say we choose that, right.\n\n431\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.200\nSo let's go in and chose either Window\nServer 12 or Two data center or Linux,\n\n432\n00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.505\nright, it will depend on what we're doing.\n\n433\n00:20:34.505 --> 00:20:38.890\nChoose that, it goes through and\nspecifies and set some settings for us.\n\n434\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.790\nAgain, we would chose what to do, can if\nnecessary take a look at making changes.\n\n435\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.770\nWe then have our application profile.\n\n436\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.978\nRemember I didn't actually create and\napplication package,\n\n437\n00:20:48.978 --> 00:20:51.114\nI was just showing the logic\nyou had to do it, but\n\n438\n00:20:51.114 --> 00:20:54.212\nyou can imagine if I did have an app\nprofile, I could create it here and\n\n439\n00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:57.940\njust apply it, or you'll notice I can\nactually add the men right from here.\n\n440\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.600\nSo I can actually just add\nthem right in on a fly or\n\n441\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.125\nuse a templated solution\nwith a profile that's.\n\n442\n00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:06.175\nIt's already been created,\nbe up to me to decide what to do there.\n\n443\n00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:08.665\nSame thing, by the way,\nfor our SQL deployment,\n\n444\n00:21:08.665 --> 00:21:11.395\nright, we do have our SQL\ndeployments already there.\n\n445\n00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:16.115\nSo do we want to go ahead and grab the one\nthat we created and set up ahead of time?\n\n446\n00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:18.925\nOr do we want to add one in and\njust reconfigure and\n\n447\n00:21:18.925 --> 00:21:20.445\nessentially do it as a one-off?\n\n448\n00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.675\nBut because we have that profile,\nwe can use that and\n\n449\n00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:24.395\ndeploy it right from\nthe template if we choose to.\n\n450\n00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:27.270\nSo we have that capability here so\nwe've got all that.\n\n451\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.920\nLet's click Next, get that set up,\nclick Create, give that just a minute.\n\n452\n00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.700\nCreate the template.\n\n453\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.620\nYou'll see it does take a moment or two.\n\n454\n00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.630\nAnd so\nwe're just gonna let it finish up there.\n\n455\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.140\nThere we go, it's all done.\n\n456\n00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.280\nAnd then you'll see we have our\nVM template already set up,\n\n457\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.310\nconfigured, ready to go.\n\n458\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.178\nAnd we could now use that VM\ntemplate if we wanted to.\n\n459\n00:21:47.178 --> 00:21:49.550\nOops, we [LAUGH] can use that\nVM template if we wanted to,\n\n460\n00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.840\nand you'll see we right-click and\ncreate a virtual machine right from it.\n\n461\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.530\nWe could actually start cranking\nout virtual machines directly from\n\n462\n00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.370\nthat template.\n\n463\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.190\nNow if I did that,\nthat wouldn't really work right now,\n\n464\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.880\nbecause that didn't assign an ISO.\n\n465\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.520\nThat would actually let me install\nWindows, I would have to go back and\n\n466\n00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.050\nreally make that template workable, so\nthat would actually work the right way.\n\n467\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.770\nAnd I would have pay attention to\nthe settings on my host to ensure I have\n\n468\n00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.500\nenough memory, enough CPU allocated\nbased on the template configuration, but\n\n469\n00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.480\nyou get the idea.\n\n470\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.110\nThe building blocks are all in place.\n\n471\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.980\nThe structure is there,\nother than just really making this\n\n472\n00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.790\naligned with our hosting of this\ntemplate would actually create VMs\n\n473\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.090\nwithin several minutes once I go ahead and\nI kick the process off.\n\n474\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.330\nThe other nice thing is that\nI can export this template,\n\n475\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.230\ngive it to somebody else who's running an\ninstance of SCVMM, let them import it and\n\n476\n00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.540\nthey would have premium templates\nready to go, that are bundled up and\n\n477\n00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.070\nwould allow them to deploy, and\nthe idea here being that if we have\n\n478\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.760\na centralized IT function,\nhypothetically, right?\n\n479\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.820\nAnd we're running a centralized\nIT solution where we create and\n\n480\n00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.040\nmanage all of these, This.\n\n481\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.680\nBut then we have remote offsets,\nwhere we are gonna have IT support staff.\n\n482\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.010\nWe could be pushing these\ntemplates out to them, and\n\n483\n00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.340\ngive them these templates pre-made.\n\n484\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.800\nSo that they could simply then\ndo the deployments locally.\n\n485\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.510\nAnd not have to worry about going\nthrough the trouble of creating them.\n\n486\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.460\nBut rather simply, just benefit from\nthem having been created already.\n\n487\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.950\nSo they are portable, which is nice.\n\n488\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.160\nSo we have the capabilities to do that.\n\n489\n00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.330\nWe also have a service\ntemplate up here and\n\n490\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.030\nwe can right click,\ncreate a service template.\n\n491\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.490\nWe talked about this idea and\njust going through the logic on this.\n\n492\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.355\nWe use our service template designer tool.\n\n493\n00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:21.265\nWe can create a service template\nwith one or more tiers.\n\n494\n00:23:21.265 --> 00:23:23.745\nWe have a blank where we\njust kind of describe and\n\n495\n00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:25.965\ndefine what we want by\nadding things in on our own.\n\n496\n00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:29.525\nWe have a single machine template\nwe can drag in our VM template,\n\n497\n00:23:29.525 --> 00:23:31.330\nprovide that, and provision it out.\n\n498\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.820\nWe have a multi tier two or\n\n499\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.460\nmore tier up to three tier\napplication solution where we could\n\n500\n00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.120\nprovision in our applications from our\ntemplates and drop them in as well.\n\n501\n00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.370\nSo we actually have the ability\nto be able to do this and\n\n502\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.720\nwalk through the logic here and we could\nthen use our templates to actually be able\n\n503\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.230\ndeploy services start to finish, end to\nend and have those made available as well.\n\n504\n00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.940\nWe do actually have an upcoming\ndemonstration where you'll actually get to\n\n505\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.370\nsee that start to finish so\n\n506\n00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.590\nyou will actually be able to\nsee how that part is done.\n\n507\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.180\nI'm not gonna walk through\nthat right now but\n\n508\n00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.020\nI've got a pretty full featured one\nwhere we actually set that up and\n\n509\n00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.760\nactually let you see the application\ndeployment and the whole nine yards.\n\n510\n00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.940\nThat'll be cool.\n\n511\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.960\nCherokee does a little tap dance\nin the middle of that whole thing,\n\n512\n00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.823\nit's actually really neat.\n\n513\n00:24:08.823 --> 00:24:09.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that that episode?\n\n514\n00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:11.370\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's that episode, right?\n\n515\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.150\nAll right, so we're gonna obviously be\nable to walk through the logic of how to\n\n516\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.920\nbe able to add those building blocks in,\n[COUGH] coordinate all the use of them,\n\n517\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.920\nadd them in in the profiles area and\nthen pull them into the template area and\n\n518\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.210\nstart to use them to actually\ndrive our templates, and\n\n519\n00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.080\nultimately drive our deployments.\n\n520\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.650\nSo it's going to be very important stuff.\n\n521\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.250\nBut we're not done yet,\ncuz we have a part three coming up.\n\n522\n00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.600\nAnd that part three is gonna talk about\nsomething called a service provider\n\n523\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.970\nfoundation, which is gonna be\nequally important for you.\n\n524\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.760\nYou gonna wanna come back and take a look\nat how we do that, why that's important\n\n525\n00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.369\nand learn all about the reasons\nwhy you can't live without SPF.\n\n526\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited, SPF all the way, woo hoo.\n\n527\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.570\nYou heard it, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n528\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.200\nWe have more information headed your way.\n\n529\n00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.810\nBut for this show we're gonna sign out.\n\n530\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.660\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n531\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.300\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n532\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.168\n&gt;&gt;

at\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.230\nour different building blocks and\ncomponents of our private clouds.\n\n9\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.830\nThis is a part three.\n\n10\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.850\nBut specifically,\n\n11\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.500\nin this episode we'll take a look\nat service provider foundation.\n\n12\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.240\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.050\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n14\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.190\n&gt;&gt; Always glad to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.010\nSo, let's talk a bit about SPF and\n\n16\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.320\nwhy you need protection when you're\nout in the sun of system center.\n\n17\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.278\nYou get that whole guffi\nanalogy thing I just did there?\n\n18\n00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:49.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But once you go over 35\nthen it's just null and void, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.120\n&gt;&gt; No, and then you're actually\n\n20\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.424\nsuper protected,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.398\n&gt;&gt; The uber-cool ITPro who never gets\n\n22\n00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.830\na sun ten cuz you're just always\nbeing protected by your SPF.\n\n23\n00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.620\nWe're gonna stop randomly associating and\n\n24\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500\nactually talk about what we're\nhere to do business about.\n\n25\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.180\nService provider foundation,\nwhy is this so important?\n\n26\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.700\nWell, this is one of those misunderstood\nand often underrepresented and\n\n27\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.250\nunderdiscussed topics that is very\nimportant for you to know about.\n\n28\n00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.870\nNumber one, because you're gonna wanna be\nable to understand how you leverage this.\n\n29\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.800\nAnd it is there,\nit's something you wanna be aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.350\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n31\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.110\nBut also you never know when you may\nbe asked about this at some point in\n\n32\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660\nthe future, and you wanna have\na little knowledge about it.\n\n33\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.580\nSo, service provider foundation.\n\n34\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.375\nThis allows us to,\nas we're scaling up and scaling up,\n\n35\n00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:28.765\nproviding private cloud services\nas we've been talking about doing.\n\n36\n00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.015\nAnd managing cloud resources,\nas we've been talking about doing.\n\n37\n00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:35.305\nTo be able to use the industry\nstandard on management APIs and\n\n38\n00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:36.910\nframeworks that are available to us.\n\n39\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.850\nI am support those resources of doubling\n\n40\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.590\nboxes things that we've\nbeen talking about.\n\n41\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.850\nWe support them for structures as service\nas long I ask on Windows Server 2012, and\n\n42\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.210\nsystems center with the service\nprovider foundations.\n\n43\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.910\nSo this is an important element of\nwhat we do want with the covers.\n\n44\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.920\nWe'll show you what it looks\nlike here in a moment.\n\n45\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.850\nIt's bundled with\nSystem Center Orchestrator, specifically.\n\n46\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.150\nAnd so, as a result, we are using yet\nanother piece of the puzzle in\n\n47\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.120\nSystem Center to provide capabilities and\nsupport for private cloud.\n\n48\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.620\nIt's not just VMM, in other words.\n\n49\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.730\nIt's all of our supporting elements\nthat get involved here, so\n\n50\n00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.790\nit's important to know that.\n\n51\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.570\nWe're using Open Data Protocol,\ncommonly known as O data APIs,\n\n52\n00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.460\nto be able to leverage industry standards\nI can't get my words out either.\n\n53\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.470\nIndustry standards.\n\n54\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.070\nI mean we all sees what is known as Rest\nAPIs or Representation State Transfer.\n\n55\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.260\nI gotta have you speak for me so\n\n56\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.350\nthat I can actually just get\nall the words out properly.\n\n57\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.860\nRest based web services, Representation\nState Transfers what rest stands for so\n\n58\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.660\nthat we can communicate with and interact\nwith different aspects of system center.\n\n59\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180\nSpecifically, if you think about\nall these web based portals\n\n60\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.670\nthat we keep talking about and web\nconsoles that we keep talking about, and\n\n61\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.140\nweb services and web applications\nthat we keep referring to.\n\n62\n00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.810\nThese are the things that are leveraging\nand taking advantage of this, ultimately.\n\n63\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.080\nSo it's very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n64\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.660\nEssentially, a programmatic web based\nmanagement interface that extends and\n\n65\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.390\nprovides rich capabilities for\nus to be able to manage over the web.\n\n66\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.890\nThis is what it refers to.\n\n67\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.030\nNow in addition.\n\n68\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.690\nI mentioned at some point, this idea of\na stamp and why the management stamps.\n\n69\n00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.860\nOr a management stamp, you can think of\nthem single or plural, are so important.\n\n70\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.480\nAnd we had a little conversation about the\nlogic of it, didn't really go into detail.\n\n71\n00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.490\nCherokee was asking me, hey,\nwhat is the management stamp.\n\n72\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.730\nWhere does it come from,\nhow do we deal with this thing?\n\n73\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.350\nWhy do we call it a stamp,\nwhy not call it something else?\n\n74\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.960\nAnd I said this has to do with the SPF,\nthe Service Provider Foundation.\n\n75\n00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.670\nAnd let's talk about it there and\nlet's make sure we understand it.\n\n76\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.500\nAnd so, the idea of management stamps\nit's really this idea of representational\n\n77\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.590\nway of thinking about or a container.\n\n78\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.800\nSome sort of a, don't go with\nthe bento box thing for this.\n\n79\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.190\nThis is not a bento box, but\nthis idea of generically a container\n\n80\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.840\nthat represents for us all of\nthe virtualized platform infrastructure.\n\n81\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.214\nThat we're gonna be managing in\na item that we could then manage,\n\n82\n00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:00.486\nwe can talk about,\nwe can attach importance to.\n\n83\n00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:03.141\nAnd so System Center Virtual\nMachine Manager, one or\n\n84\n00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:04.620\nmore virtual machine hosts.\n\n85\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.110\nSo our underlying Hyper-V,\nunderlying ESX, underlying Zen hosts,\n\n86\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.990\nall the virtual machines that are being\nmanaged as a result of being there, and\n\n87\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.670\nthe configurations that are unique for\nthem.\n\n88\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.743\nAll this stuff together goes into a stamp,\na management stamp which represents\n\n89\n00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:24.781\nthe entity that is made up of all these\ncomponents that I just described to you.\n\n90\n00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.143\nIncluding things Service accounts,\nuser roles and\n\n91\n00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:29.310\nall the resources that hosts provide.\n\n92\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.210\nI think i might have mentions\nthe stamps last time that\n\n93\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.050\nit's one of the ways we configure and\nallocate resources.\n\n94\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.080\nWe think about the memory,\nthe CPU all that kind of stuff and\n\n95\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.220\nit's a lot more than just that, but\nit is all those things together.\n\n96\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.720\nAnd so, stamps are gonna be this unique\nconfiguration of the VNM infrastructure,\n\n97\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.950\nthe host, the VMs and\nall the associated settings and\n\n98\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.760\naccounts that are gonna be managing or\nbe used to manage them.\n\n99\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.330\nAnd we'll just use that concept to them,\nrefer to this and\n\n100\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.480\nto be able to interact with it.\n\n101\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.830\nIt's centrally just a way that the service\nprovider foundation understands and\n\n102\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.260\ninteracts with resources, and\nbundles them for administration.\n\n103\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.110\nIf you wanna join me here for\n\n104\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.540\njust a second, let's just take\na look at a couple of things.\n\n105\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.820\nWe have ours we always do,\ntry to do anyway, our technet information.\n\n106\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.960\nJust to refer to, so you can see it here.\n\n107\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.400\nThis place is really just a landing page,\nan overview page.\n\n108\n00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.870\nFrom the Service Provider Foundation.\n\n109\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.080\nBut what's nice about this is that it\ngives you all the links to the other\n\n110\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.900\ntopics.\n\n111\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.033\nI'll show you the architecture\noverview here in a second.\n\n112\n00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:30.431\nBut it gives us just some general\ninformation, that may be important for\n\n113\n00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.893\nyou to be aware of just so\nthat you can see where to go.\n\n114\n00:05:32.893 --> 00:05:38.308\nAnd specifically, when we take a look\nhere you can see that we do have our\n\n115\n00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:44.821\nlittle architectural diagram that shows us\nthat we have our tenant administration.\n\n116\n00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:45.861\n&gt;&gt; Administration.\n\n117\n00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.000\n&gt;&gt; Administration thank you.\n&gt;&gt; You can move your lips.\n\n118\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.900\n&gt;&gt; I could do that if you wanna talk on my\nbehalf, almost like a ventriloquist act.\n\n119\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Let's see how that goes, yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, so my voice is suddenly\na little harder than it used to be.\n\n121\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.750\nSo tenant administration, right?\n\n122\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.330\nSo all of our tenant administrators\nare hanging out over here.\n\n123\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.280\nWe've got out self service users,\napplications, and\n\n124\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.060\nwe have the DevOps kind of functionality.\n\n125\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.340\nThey're all existing outside\nof the stack as you can see.\n\n126\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.630\nAnd then in here,\nwe've got out multi tenant portal,\n\n127\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.090\nwhere our tenant admins may connect to.\n\n128\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.340\nOver here, we've got our API's\nthat are being used for IS.\n\n129\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.250\nSo, our extension is to be able\nto give our portal support for\n\n130\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.270\ninfrastructure capabilities.\n\n131\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.480\nWe got our tenant assets,\n\n132\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.240\nwhatever the individual building\nblocks that we were talking about.\n\n133\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.300\nThat we've been using that\nare gonna be here and\n\n134\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.650\nthey are all joined to the IS fabric.\n\n135\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.180\nAnd we are referring to this\nentire thing here as our\n\n136\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.000\ninfrastructure that we're gonna be\nable to present and manage, and\n\n137\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.070\nthis is how SPF actually connects out and\nworks, And allows us to interact.\n\n138\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.280\nIt gives us the capabilities to\ninteract with all of these items and\n\n139\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.250\nthese informational thought\nprocesses that we have to\n\n140\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.500\nenvision in our mind as an administrator.\n\n141\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.460\nAnd door has a have to provide.\n\n142\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.270\nSo we have services that will do this.\n\n143\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.330\nYou could see this here.\n\n144\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.800\nThe Admin web service,\nthe VMM service, the Provider service.\n\n145\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.730\nWe will be talking about in upcoming\nconversations the Windows Azure Pack,\n\n146\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.010\ngoing through the logic of what\nthat is and how the Lexus stand up\n\n147\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.150\na self-service portal so that users\ncan interact within consumed services.\n\n148\n00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.620\nWe've also, will,\nwe have talked about it, mentioned it.\n\n149\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.710\nWe'll talk about it more.\n\n150\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.320\nBut we'll also talk about the application.\n\n151\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.410\nThe application provider,\nthe self-service portal that we use.\n\n152\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.110\nSo that we can also provide that\nthrough system center if we choose to.\n\n153\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.320\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways of doing this.\n\n154\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.698\nBut we have all these\ndifferent services here and\n\n155\n00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:35.182\nnotice the [INAUDIBLE] web service\nprovides all the stamp information.\n\n156\n00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:39.034\nThe stamp for service provider foundation,\nthe stamps we were talking about and\n\n157\n00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:42.559\nthe [INAUDIBLE] web services what's\ngonna manage and control this force.\n\n158\n00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:45.983\nAnd so, you can see that our hosting\nservice providers We're gonna be able to\n\n159\n00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:47.204\ncreate and manage tenets.\n\n160\n00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:50.610\nTuser roles and do all that the things\nthey need to do using the admin web\n\n161\n00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.000\nservice that happens right\nup here in this tier.\n\n162\n00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.835\nAnd this is where they go in and\nconfigure everything and\n\n163\n00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:59.034\nthis is where they allocate those\nresources and allocating and\n\n164\n00:07:59.034 --> 00:08:02.630\narchitecting the stamped\ninformation that's able to provide.\n\n165\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.100\nThese services in the tenant, so\n\n166\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.020\nwhen we talk about stamps we're talking\nabout just aggregating up those resources.\n\n167\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.660\nAnd using a front end service as\nis provided through the SPF here,\n\n168\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.340\nthe admin web service to be able\nto access that through one or\n\n169\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.535\nmore portals and configure it.\n\n170\n00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:18.185\nAs we go, so this is a very\nimportant thought process for\n\n171\n00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:21.305\nus, because this is ultimately how\nwe're going to be able to manage and\n\n172\n00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:24.585\nprovide resources out as\na tenant administrator.\n\n173\n00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:26.655\nTo give in a multi-tenant environment,\n\n174\n00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:30.150\nour tenants the capabilities to be\nable to access their private clouds.\n\n175\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.380\nIn our last episode,\nif you remember, we went through,\n\n176\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.010\nwe showed you two episodes, actually.\n\n177\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.060\nWe showed you how to go through and\ncreate that private cloud and\n\n178\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.560\nstand it up from all\nthe different building blocks.\n\n179\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.100\nYou wanna think about bringing\nall that knowledge together and\n\n180\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.250\nunderstanding the thought process here.\n\n181\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.220\nHow do we actually go in and install and\nconfigure the serve provider foundation?\n\n182\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.168\nWe set this up on a single server or\n\n183\n00:08:49.168 --> 00:08:52.101\ncan scale it out on multiple\nservers as required.\n\n184\n00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:55.230\nBut we have to have at least one server\nwith a Microsoft SQL server installed.\n\n185\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.850\nSo that way we have the SPF running\nwith SQL server backend for\n\n186\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.720\nthe configuration data necessary.\n\n187\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.850\nWe run the wizard.\n\n188\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.290\nIt has the web services, and\n\n189\n00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.060\nall the things that are required,\nas part of the wizard when we install it.\n\n190\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.610\nJust a few steps,\nreal simple to go through here,\n\n191\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.850\nabout seven or eight of them.\n\n192\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.270\nYou go ahead on the server you\nwanna install the foundation.\n\n193\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.140\nYou run the SetupOrchestrator.exe media,\n\n194\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.920\nand then off that media, we have\nthe ability to run the SPF install.\n\n195\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.410\nWe click Service Provider Foundation, We\ngo through and we hit the install button.\n\n196\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.960\nWe have some screens there, there's a\nlicense screen you have to accept, there's\n\n197\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.090\nprerequisite's, you wait for scanning to\nmake sure all the prereqs are available.\n\n198\n00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.290\nIf they're not, you go through,\nyou fill in the gaps,\n\n199\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.785\ninstall the prereqs when When you're done,\nyou go ahead and refresh.\n\n200\n00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:37.235\nYou're good, you run forward.\n\n201\n00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:40.345\nWe then configure the database,\nthat's why we need the SQL database, so\n\n202\n00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:42.445\nwe could figure the SQL Server\ndatabase there.\n\n203\n00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:46.660\nWe specify the information, the server\nname, the instance, the port number.\n\n204\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.370\n1433, our default port will normally be\nwhat we use there so we'll do all that.\n\n205\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.980\nWe then specify the location for the SPF\nfile, the installs for the files to be\n\n206\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.040\nlocated, so we'll set that up, it's up\nto us to decide where we wanna put that.\n\n207\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.910\nWe can set up the web service files,\nif we wanna go in the default location or\n\n208\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.610\nchange It's up to us.\n\n209\n00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.090\nWe usually will accept\nthe default port number here.\n\n210\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.770\nThe 8090, but again,\nwe'll decide what we wanna do.\n\n211\n00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.880\nIf we either change that or\naccept that, be up to us to decide.\n\n212\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.200\nWe then have a configure,\nand then Webservice page.\n\n213\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.700\nWe'll go through and\non the domain security group.\n\n214\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.030\nWe'll specify the user accounts that\nare gonna be required to set this up and\n\n215\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.140\nauthenticate.\n\n216\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.273\nStandard input's format here,\ndomain, and then username,\n\n217\n00:10:29.273 --> 00:10:34.555\ndomain\\ Username actually domain\nbackslash username right like that.\n\n218\n00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:36.835\nRight, so domain backslash username and\n\n219\n00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.775\nthen a semi colon could separate multiple\nentries you wanna put more than one\n\n220\n00:10:39.775 --> 00:10:43.082\naccount in there we will have\nto set up the service account\n\n221\n00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:46.912\nThe provider web service, VMM web service,\nthe usage web service accounts.\n\n222\n00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.502\nJust making sure I go through my notes and\n\n223\n00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:51.422\nI give them all to you and make sure we\nspecify the right ones there for you.\n\n224\n00:10:51.422 --> 00:10:54.172\nSo a total of four different accounts\nthat have to be programmed in\n\n225\n00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:55.580\non this wizard as you go.\n\n226\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.150\nWe then go ahead, and\ndecide whether we opt in or out for\n\n227\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.110\nthe customer improvement program,\nAnd then,\n\n228\n00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.680\nwe hit the installation summary screen,\nwe go ahead and we click Finish, and\n\n229\n00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.910\nit goes off, does its stuff, and when it's\ndone the SPF is installed and configured.\n\n230\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.970\nAnd then once we have that up and running,\nwe can leverage that in a multitenant\n\n231\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.670\nfarms that we're creating\nTo provide self-service,\n\n232\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.680\nmulti-tenant, private cloud solutions and\nallow those tenants to be able to manage,\n\n233\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.480\nas you can see there, and\ninteract with those resources.\n\n234\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.470\nAnd provision out the cloud\nbased resources for\n\n235\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.970\nthe consumption of their customers.\n\n236\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.930\nSo this is what the SPF provides us for\n\n237\n00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.730\non the back, or gives us\nthe capability to do, I should say.\n\n238\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.650\nOn the back end, but\n\n239\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.040\na very important component of what\nwe do in multi tenant environments.\n\n240\n00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.860\nNow keep in mind, in a single tenant\nenvironment, where you're just providing\n\n241\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.120\nand configuring all the resources, you may\nnot need to necessarily deal with this,\n\n242\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.140\nyou can just Provision everything\nout directly through SCVMM.\n\n243\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.800\nAnd publish that cloud, make it available.\n\n244\n00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.690\nAnd you may not decide that you're\ngonna have tenant administrators with\n\n245\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.790\nmultiple tenants.\n\n246\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.490\nRemember, we've talked about, there's\ndifferent ways to deploy, and ultimately\n\n247\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.090\nsee the consumption of this particular\nsolution envision so truly gonna be up\n\n248\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.240\nto you in your environment to see whether\nnot if this something that makes sense.\n\n249\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.990\nBut if you do need to go through and\n\n250\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.440\ntake a look on how to do this in\nyour action with spf services.\n\n251\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.200\nHow this is all gonna be configured.\n\n252\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.430\nMaking sure we bind to the Windows Azure\nPack to revive those self-service portals.\n\n253\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.940\nThe App Portal,\nwhich is part of the System Center,\n\n254\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.760\nthought process can be used as\nthe staging here to do this as well.\n\n255\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.270\nAll that's available here.\n\n256\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.430\nIt's just a matter of\nyou going through it and\n\n257\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.900\nreading up on it to make sure\nyou understand the logic of it,\n\n258\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.750\nif you choose to use the service\nprovider foundation.\n\n259\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.330\nBut if you do, remember, you got to\ngo through the orchestrator media and\n\n260\n00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.720\nthat's where you're going\nto install it from.\n\n261\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.870\nSo it's important to know where to find it\nas well as the steps involved with how to\n\n262\n00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.350\nactually install it.\n\n263\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.883\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n264\n00:12:39.883 --> 00:12:42.965\nThank you for joining us, Adam, and\nthank you for joining us as well, but for\n\n265\n00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:44.890\nthis show we are going to go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n266\n00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.030\nRemember I'm your host,Cherokee Boose.\n\n267\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.966\nI'm out ofGordon.\n\n268\n00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:49.803\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT PRO TV.\n\n269\n00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:56.823\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n270\n00:12:56.823 -->

00:00:08.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.141\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to\nyour MCSE Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.450\nAnd in this episode, Mr. Adam Gordon\nis actually gonna be showing us\n\n8\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.680\nhow to use APM to monitor\nnew applications.\n\n9\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.850\nSo I am pretty excited Adam, I have never\ndone this before, so this is new for me.\n\n10\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.507\nAnd I am really just ready to go.\n\n11\n00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:32.450\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well then I guess I can't\nask you to actually do this while I go\n\n12\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.047\ntake a break.\n\n13\n00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:35.239\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna drive, but\n\n14\n00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.510\nCherokee is going to be a part of this.\n\n15\n00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.630\nSo we're gonna incorporate her.\n\n16\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.092\nAnd we're gonna incorporate\nall of you actually.\n\n17\n00:00:41.092 --> 00:00:43.480\nAnd Cherokee makes\na really important point.\n\n18\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.450\nWe fool around sometimes,\n\n19\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.442\nwe obviously joke around\na little bit as we get started.\n\n20\n00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.131\nBut what she said is actually probably\nthe case for a lot of you which is,\n\n21\n00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.370\nhey I may not have actually set up and\ndone APM before, right?\n\n22\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.640\nThis is something new and\nmaybe although I've used SCOM,\n\n23\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.118\nmaybe I haven't actually used it this way.\n\n24\n00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:02.384\nAnd there's no shame in that number one,\nbecause that's one of the reasons you come\n\n25\n00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:04.520\nto ITPRO.TV,\nis to learn how to do new stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.580\nBut it can be a little intimidating and it\ncan be a little exciting at the same time.\n\n27\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.691\nA lot exciting in Cherokee's case, cuz you\ncan see just how exciting it really is,\n\n28\n00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.940\nwhen she talks about it.\n\n29\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.720\nBut it could be a little intimidating too.\n\n30\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960\nShe does a good job at hiding that\npiece of it, but the reality is\n\n31\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.670\nif I ask Cherokee to do this right\nnow herself while I sat back and\n\n32\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.076\nwatched, I'm sure she\nwouldn't be as excited.\n\n33\n00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:26.533\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; As she is about watching me do it.\n\n34\n00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then learning how to do it.\n\n35\n00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:33.479\nAnd so, that is often the case with many\nof these, especially some of the more\n\n36\n00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.830\ncomplex, at least in our mind what we\nthink is complex, technology elements.\n\n37\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.297\nAnd you're gonna see right now,\nit's actually not very hard to do at all,\n\n38\n00:01:42.297 --> 00:01:46.205\nwanna dispel those myths about the fact\nthat something like application monitoring\n\n39\n00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:46.882\ncan be tough.\n\n40\n00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:52.822\nWe hear .NET, we hear web services,\nwe hear WCF, things like that.\n\n41\n00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:57.346\nAnd we start to say, well that’s\nlike the realm of stuff that I'm not\n\n42\n00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:01.714\naware of as an IT admin,\nas a network person, as a monitor person,\n\n43\n00:02:01.714 --> 00:02:05.360\nwhatever you do,\nmaybe outside of the ad dev area.\n\n44\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.510\nThat’s that black magic\nthat people engage in,\n\n45\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.320\nright in the other side of\nthe building I know nothing about.\n\n46\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.139\nNothing could be farther from\nthe truth quite honestly.\n\n47\n00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.822\nIt's not very difficult to do,\ngonna walk you through and\n\n48\n00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.550\nshow you here in the next several minutes\njust how easy it actually can be.\n\n49\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.382\nAnd then at the end,\nwe're gonna make Cherokee do it.\n\n50\n00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:21.596\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So take good notes.\n\n51\n00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:25.582\nAnd if she doesn't do it well, then we're\ngonna have a problem because then you\n\n52\n00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:27.617\ncan't leave until she get's it right.\n\n53\n00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:31.340\nAnd we may be here for a while,\nso get your comfy clothes out,\n\n54\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.900\nput on your minion slippers,\nor whatever you have.\n\n55\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.910\nAnd make sure you got a really good,\nbig, tall drink, and a sandwich,\n\n56\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.507\nthis could take a while.\n\n57\n00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:40.007\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n58\n00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:41.464\nSo we're gonna get started.\n\n59\n00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:42.194\nSo you're\n\n60\n00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.314\ngonna keep me honest.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n61\n00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:44.344\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna make sure I don't\n\n62\n00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:45.000\nmiss a step.\n\n63\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.520\nAnd you out there are gonna watch, and\n\n64\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.600\nwhen we get done we're gonna be monitoring\n.NET application boys and girls.\n\n65\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.189\nSo let's take a look.\n\n66\n00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.251\nWhat I actually set up for us,\njust by way of getting started is,\n\n67\n00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.940\nI've already just preloaded\nan application monitor.\n\n68\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.327\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate one in just a minute, but\n\n69\n00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:03.588\nI wanted to show you what it will look\nlike so you could see the outcome of this.\n\n70\n00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:06.938\nBecause it takes about five to ten\nminutes, after we get done setting\n\n71\n00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.950\neverything up for all the data to start\ncoming in for the console to refresh.\n\n72\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.920\nFor us to start getting that status\nhealth update on our app, and for\n\n73\n00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.420\nit to show up like it is up on\nthe screen there where it says healthy.\n\n74\n00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.750\nAnd we can actually see the app,\nlet me just bring this out so\n\n75\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.150\nyou can see this here and\nwe can see the status.\n\n76\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.190\nSo I figure it was good\nto have one in there for\n\n77\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.715\nus, we could already see it running.\n\n78\n00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:30.360\nWe'll go ahead and we'll create one,\nbut we're not gonna wait around for\n\n79\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.040\nit to start showing up to be healthy.\n\n80\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.990\nWe're gonna do it and\njust show you how to do it.\n\n81\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.840\nSo what we're doing here, if you remember\nin our last episode, and by the way if you\n\n82\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.020\nhaven't seen the last episode where\nwe talk about the ideas behind APM.\n\n83\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.985\nHow we set it up,\npacks required all that kind of stuff,\n\n84\n00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:47.930\nyou may just wanna poke your head in\nthere and take a look at that real quick.\n\n85\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.950\nSo this makes a little more sense to you.\n\n86\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.100\nBut what we did is, we've gone ahead,\nwe've imported our management packs.\n\n87\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.720\nWe've set up the background and\nbackend requirements here.\n\n88\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.760\nAnd so, when we come in and we are in\nour monitoring workspace as you can see.\n\n89\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.240\nWe'll just go up to the top here, so\n\n90\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.780\nyou can see where we are,\nmonitoring workspace.\n\n91\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.040\nAnd then as we come down, we come down\ninto our application monitoring area.\n\n92\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.078\nWe've opened this up in other words, and\nthis is where we're going to see our APM,\n\n93\n00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.228\nor Application Monitoring Capabilities.\n\n94\n00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:22.729\nAll the elements, the objects that are\ngiven to us, the views, the dashboards,\n\n95\n00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.398\nperformance monitoring from\nthe management patch, right?\n\n96\n00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.960\nRemember, this is web service centric.\n\n97\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.950\nIS7, IS8, and the system app monitoring\nmanagement packs that go with that.\n\n98\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.350\nAnd so we have underneath there\nour application dashboard.\n\n99\n00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.707\nWe don't have anything on their right now,\nbecause that does awhile to populate.\n\n100\n00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:45.017\nAnd we have to be running the app for\nawhile and monitoring it,\n\n101\n00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.131\ngathering a data over a period of time.\n\n102\n00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:48.568\nTypically at least a day for\n\n103\n00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:51.580\nus to have anything of significant\nvalue to show up here.\n\n104\n00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.427\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad you shake on it.\n\n105\n00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To accumulate some information,\nit's gonna take some time\n\n106\n00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:01.068\n&gt;&gt; Good, good, thumbs up.\n\n107\n00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:02.323\nDon't ad-lib, let's just do this together.\n\n108\n00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:02.927\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n109\n00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:06.010\n&gt;&gt; So me and my little one,\nyou ever do thumb wrestling?\n\n110\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is awesome.\n\n111\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.660\nSo me and my little one,\nthis is like our thing.\n\n112\n00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.484\nWe thumb wrestle, so let's thumb wrestle.\n\n113\n00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:13.790\nAnd whoever wins has\nactually to do the demo.\n\n114\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.920\n&gt;&gt; No, all right.\n\n115\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.585\nOne, two, three, four,\nI declare thumb war.\n\n116\n00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that means you're driving.\n\n117\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.739\nYou're coming over here now.\n\n118\n00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.300\n&gt;&gt; Wait I thought\nthe winner is the winner.\n\n119\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.605\n&gt;&gt; No,\nthe winner is one who has to do the demo.\n\n120\n00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:27.553\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n121\n00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:28.073\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n122\n00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:30.840\nSo yes, it is exciting, it's cool.\n\n123\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.090\nAnd it is gonna give us\na lot of capabilities,\n\n124\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.450\nright, to take a look at stuff.\n\n125\n00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.960\nSo we do have, so\nwe just scroll back down here.\n\n126\n00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.350\nWe do have a dashboard and there's one\nquick thing that's interesting here.\n\n127\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.070\nWe also have the ability to see\nour SLA's if we have any in place.\n\n128\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.330\nOur service level agreements.\n\n129\n00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.690\nThis ties back in to our\nservice manager product.\n\n130\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.977\nAnd we talked about service manager\nsome of the other episodes until and\n\n131\n00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:55.372\nup until this point, we're going to\ntalk about it again going forward and\n\n132\n00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:56.840\nin some future episodes.\n\n133\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.344\nBut remember the service manager product,\none of the products in the system center\n\n134\n00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:05.587\nsuite is where we will be able to create\nconnectors connecting back into SCOM,\n\n135\n00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:07.928\nconnecting into the different products.\n\n136\n00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:12.518\nAnd then allow monitoring and alerting\nfrom SCOM to be taken into service\n\n137\n00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:16.508\nmanager, create incident and\nproblem management tickets and\n\n138\n00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:21.860\nworkflows, that will then be used to\nresolve, report on track and resolve.\n\n139\n00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.990\nAnd then we have the bi-directional\ncommunication coming back\n\n140\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.530\nout of Service Manager.\n\n141\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.540\nIf we set up the connectors the right way,\nwe have an alert connector for SCOM\n\n142\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.275\ncoming out of Service Manager and a CI\nconnector, a Configuration Item connector.\n\n143\n00:06:35.275 --> 00:06:39.255\nWe set both up, we then have the ability\nto check off some additional\n\n144\n00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:44.025\ninfrastructure capabilities there, where\nwe do bidirectional alert resolution, and\n\n145\n00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:47.095\nbidirectional management\nof maintenance mode.\n\n146\n00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:50.645\nSo we can actually put systems into\nmaintenance mode, and do work on them and\n\n147\n00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:52.725\ntrigger that from Service Manager.\n\n148\n00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:55.255\nWe could trigger alert tracking and\nresolution, and\n\n149\n00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:57.512\nstatus updates out of Service Manager.\n\n150\n00:06:57.512 --> 00:07:00.888\nAnd if SCOM closes an alert,\nwe update Service Manager.\n\n151\n00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:04.687\nSo it goes both ways to keep us honest\nthroughout the entire life cycle and\n\n152\n00:07:04.687 --> 00:07:05.884\nthe escalation path.\n\n153\n00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:10.620\nAnd our SLAs will show up here if we have\nthe connectors set up and they're tied in.\n\n154\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthis may be a silly question here, but\n\n155\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.150\nlike I said I am new to this concept.\n\n156\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.685\nSo if I have my SLAs there and\nI'm managing and\n\n157\n00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:22.560\nmonitoring multiple applications then this\nwill really just help me keep a good idea,\n\n158\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.432\na measurement for my performance\nlevels to make sure I'm adhering to\n\n159\n00:07:26.432 --> 00:07:29.200\nthe different applications\nthat I'm running?\n\n160\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.414\n&gt;&gt; It will show us if we're not\nadhering and it will show us if we are.\n\n161\n00:07:32.414 --> 00:07:33.456\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So in other words,\n\n162\n00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:36.060\nit will keep us on track and\nshow us graphically and\n\n163\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.850\nthen with performance counters,\nthings like that.\n\n164\n00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.242\nBut it will show us different areas and\nindicate whether we are acceptable or\n\n165\n00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:44.468\nnot based on the monitoring and\nthen, of course,\n\n166\n00:07:44.468 --> 00:07:46.814\nbased on the levels of\nthe SLAs you were suggesting.\n\n167\n00:07:46.814 --> 00:07:47.734\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it does.\n\n168\n00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:48.773\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly what it does.\n\n169\n00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.529\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna just draw down another layer.\n\n170\n00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:54.889\nSo we have our basic application,\nwe've see this fill in overtime.\n\n171\n00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.337\nWe can as you know right-click here,\nwe do a refresh,\n\n172\n00:07:57.337 --> 00:08:00.544\nit's harder to see with a little blue\nline to go shooting across there.\n\n173\n00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:04.332\nIt's the refresh on the dashboard, you've\nseen that at some of the other episodes.\n\n174\n00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.748\nWe have our .NET monitoring, specifically.\n\n175\n00:08:06.748 --> 00:08:10.299\nCome in here if we have any active alerts\non the application, we would see them,\n\n176\n00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.020\nwe don't have any now,\nso that's good to know.\n\n177\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.160\nI went in, before we got started,\nand deleted all the alerts, so\n\n178\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.776\nyou wouldn't see them.\n\n179\n00:08:16.776 --> 00:08:17.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A whole bunch in there, but\n\n180\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.030\nno, I didn't do that, I'm only kidding.\n\n181\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.110\nThere's no alerts right now, because\nwe are monitoring, the app is healthy.\n\n182\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.160\nWe haven't put it under stress yet,\nthere's really no usage of it.\n\n183\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.020\nRemember, in the real world,\nyou'd have users hitting\n\n184\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.560\nthis thing through the web constantly,\nyou would be generating traffic.\n\n185\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.670\nThis is just an app that we've\nset up that we're monitoring, but\n\n186\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.040\nnobody is in there using it,\nwe're not stressing the web service.\n\n187\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.740\nSo there's really probably gonna\nbe no alerting that's gonna take\n\n188\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.280\nplace while we're actually\nin the demo environment, but\n\n189\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.000\nit's obviously good to check and\nknow that.\n\n190\n00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.085\nWe do have IIS hosting WCF\nweb service inventory,\n\n191\n00:08:49.085 --> 00:08:51.990\nremember Windows communication\nfoundation framework.\n\n192\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.810\nYou could see here we are monitoring\nSystem Center 2012 orchestrator,\n\n193\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.610\nat least you can see the edge of that.\n\n194\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.152\nProbably not the whole thing but\n\n195\n00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:01.958\nyou can see the orchestrator\nwebsite web services there.\n\n196\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.000\nWe've got the information on that,\nwe could tell that that is doing well.\n\n197\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.280\nWe can come down here, can we go full\nscreen just on this just see the bottom\n\n198\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.690\na little bit, thank you very much.\n\n199\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.075\nYou can see down here under the detail\nview that we have some information about\n\n200\n00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:17.922\nthis Display Name,\nthe Full Path name out there.\n\n201\n00:09:17.922 --> 00:09:20.421\nSo we've got some information,\nthe application,\n\n202\n00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:22.570\nthe name of the application root.\n\n203\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:28.090\nAnd we can go through and\nwe can click on that item,\n\n204\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:35.570\nand it takes us up here into the state\nmonitor and it shows us information.\n\n205\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.340\nLet me actually drag this over just\na wee bit here so you can see this, and\n\n206\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.906\nmove that down below that annoying little\nblue box with the plus sign in it.\n\n207\n00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:46.950\nYou can see it here the state\nmonitor opens up a separate window,\n\n208\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.060\nyou can see the console, the apps\nconsole sitting there behind us and\n\n209\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.910\nyou can see that we do\nhave this information.\n\n210\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.747\nIt is in a warning state, we're not quite\nsure why, but we certainly could go in,\n\n211\n00:09:56.747 --> 00:09:58.654\nwe could drill down and take a look here.\n\n212\n00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:04.039\nAnd we can see that in the detail view,\nlet's just see what's going on down here,\n\n213\n00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:06.890\nwe've got some general information.\n\n214\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.750\nPhysical processors, logical processors,\n\n215\n00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.170\nbunch of information that helps us to\nunderstand what may be happening here,\n\n216\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.040\nbut nothing that seems to be\nindicating the warning sign.\n\n217\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.970\nBut we can right click on the warning, and\n\n218\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.600\nyou'll notice that we can open up\ndifferent views to drill down and\n\n219\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.770\nsee more data here, alerting, diagram\nview, event view, performance view.\n\n220\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.110\nWe will probably wanna use something\ncalled, the Health Explorer when we have\n\n221\n00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.550\na question as to the status of the health\nof this particular application.\n\n222\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.350\nThe Health Explorer is gonna aggregate for\nus all of the data around the alerts,\n\n223\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.810\nand the changes in state.\n\n224\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.644\nHey, we went from healthy to warning,\nwarning to critical,\n\n225\n00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:48.000\ncritical back to warning, or whatever,\nwe're gonna see all this, so,\n\n226\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.880\nI wanna show you a couple\nof these real quick.\n\n227\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.640\nBecause these can be very helpful\nto help us go in and diagnose and\n\n228\n00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.040\nunderstand what may be going on.\n\n229\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.630\nSo, let's take a look, go ahead and\nwe'll open up the Health Explorer here.\n\n230\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.360\nNotice it opens up, brings up for\nus, this window, right,\n\n231\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.380\nright on top of the one we were just\nusing, I'll just quickly show you.\n\n232\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.010\nBehind, they were kind of stacking them\nup, much like index cards, right, so\n\n233\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.940\nwe've got this one stacked up here.\n\n234\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.340\nLet's just go full screen on this one,\n\n235\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.170\nbe a little bit easier\nto see what's happening.\n\n236\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.290\nAnd we can see that we have a lot of\ninformation being generated over here,\n\n237\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.410\nentity health.\n\n238\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.610\nAnd when we click on it,\nwe can see that there's a little summary,\n\n239\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.540\nit doesn't really have\nmuch information there.\n\n240\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.410\nThe value of this is the state change\nevents tab where we can see that there's\n\n241\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.570\nbeen timeline changes from\neither critical to warning,\n\n242\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.120\nor warning to critical, red circle is\ncritical, yellow caution flag, warning.\n\n243\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.520\nRight, so we can see different states and\nhow they were moving back and forth.\n\n244\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.040\nAnd we can scroll through and just kinda\nsee that, looks like we started out.\n\n245\n00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.930\nRight here you can see this is,\n\n246\n00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.376\nif you take a look we're starting out\nfrom essentially nothing to good.\n\n247\n00:11:56.376 --> 00:12:00.630\nAnd then we're just going through and\nseeing how this all progresses.\n\n248\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.370\nNow you may notice the date stamps\non some of these are back in 2014,\n\n249\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.200\nthe most recent ones are 2017,\nthose are the ones we're using.\n\n250\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.510\nAll the ones prior to that,\nare just monitoring data\n\n251\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.850\nthat's been sitting in the system from\nwhen we initially do installs and\n\n252\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.870\nconfigure and create images and\nstuff like that.\n\n253\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.060\nSo a lot of that old data is not\nnecessarily relevant to what we're\n\n254\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.920\ndoing now.\n\n255\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.600\nJust the last couple of ones\nright up here, in the last\n\n256\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.110\nfew minutes as we've done the install of\nthe app, and started it to configure it,\n\n257\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.360\nare of interest to us right here, right,\nthese last two that are sitting up here.\n\n258\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.595\nSo we can go drill through, and\nwe can begin to see as we move down,\n\n259\n00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:43.913\nWindows Application Health rollout,\navailability of the data access service.\n\n260\n00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:48.298\nAnd there will be different state changes\nthat we will see as the system comes\n\n261\n00:12:48.298 --> 00:12:50.690\nonline, and we can reference these.\n\n262\n00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.330\nWe can begin to get a timeline, begin to\nsee what's happening, this is one element,\n\n263\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.330\none area, that we can use to help\nus understand what's happening.\n\n264\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:05.370\nNow, up here, we can recalculate health of\nthe system, and go out and ask the monitor\n\n265\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.460\nto go out and use the algorithm that uses,\nthe monitors that uses,\n\n266\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.920\npull data back in and give us an update,\nthis is essentially like a refresh, right?\n\n267\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.825\nGive us an update on the current\nhealth status, and tell us whether or\n\n268\n00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:19.251\nnot this is accurate, maybe we made some\nchanges and wanna see an update on this.\n\n269\n00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:22.454\nWe also can reset the health monitor,\nso we could say okay, and\n\n270\n00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:25.536\nwe know about all that, reset it,\nand then we can go ahead and\n\n271\n00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:29.090\nwe can start monitoring or\ncontinue monitoring from there.\n\n272\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.220\nWe also have the ability,\njust get out of here,\n\n273\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.840\none second-\n&gt;&gt; Now just, Adam, that blue plus symbol\n\n274\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.330\nthat you're looking at up at the top\nthere that you hovered over.\n\n275\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.780\nThat's just part of your\nactual lab environment,\n\n276\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.280\nthat wouldn't be in\na production environment.\n\n277\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.235\n&gt;&gt; Have no idea where that came from,\nthat's an alien piece of technology.\n\n278\n00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:47.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is actually he mind control own\n\n279\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.956\nthat we use-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:13:48.956 --> 00:13:50.924\n&gt;&gt; To make you love ITPro.TV,\n\n281\n00:13:50.924 --> 00:13:54.288\nit beams ITPro.TV thoughts\nto you in realtime.\n\n282\n00:13:54.288 --> 00:13:57.067\nNo, that is just as Cherokee\nsays I'm fooling around here,\n\n283\n00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:59.245\nthat is just the control window,\nthe control,\n\n284\n00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.200\nfloating control elements for\n&gt;&gt; The virtual lab environment we're\n\n285\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.360\nusing, you would never see\nthat in the real world, right,\n\n286\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.040\nunless you happen to host in a virtual\nenvironment where you RDP in or\n\n287\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.050\nuse some sort of KVM-like technology, and\nit gives you that kind of a control panel.\n\n288\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.780\nBut other than that you\nwouldn't see that normally.\n\n289\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.470\nYou'll see here we also can go in and we\ncan, although I like going with the whole\n\n290\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.220\nITProTV mind control thing,\nthought that was kinda cool.\n\n291\n00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.380\nWe need the flashing light and the siren\nto come on when we do that though.\n\n292\n00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.270\nWe can also go in, you'll notice,\nand deal with overrides here.\n\n293\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.480\nWe've talked about overrides in our\nmonitoring with management packs,\n\n294\n00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.430\ntalked it about in some prior episodes,\ntalk about them again later on.\n\n295\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.430\nThe ability to create overrides is the\nability to take a sealed management pack,\n\n296\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.640\nwhich is the state of most management\npacks when we import them and\n\n297\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.740\nto then lay over the top our\ncustomizations and changes.\n\n298\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.690\nAnd then apply them,\n\n299\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.580\ncombining them with the sealed management\npack together to then generate for us,\n\n300\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.850\nultimately, the output we want from the,\nquote unquote, modified management pack.\n\n301\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.130\nSo we can interact with our\noverrides here, and control them and\n\n302\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.740\nthen see the impact of them on the health\nstatus, so this is a very useful tool\n\n303\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.070\nby drilling in and looking to Health\nMonitor, Health Explorer as part of this.\n\n304\n00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.180\nBut notice we also can right click here,\nwe can go ahead and we can go,\n\n305\n00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.540\nand we can look at a diagram view.\n\n306\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.030\nJust give it a second to come in, we've\ntaken a look at these interactive diagrams\n\n307\n00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.820\nin other eposides where we can see\nthe actual structure of the application.\n\n308\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.340\nDrilling down and\nlooking at content and elements and\n\n309\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.790\nseeing the health status of\nthem in real time as well.\n\n310\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.130\nSo this is also gonna be interesting,\nwe see our healthy stuff over here.\n\n311\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.859\nOpen this up, let's just pull this down,\nand we can see all of the moving parts,\n\n312\n00:15:41.859 --> 00:15:47.785\nthe database here, the interactivity,\nthe services, whatever the case may be.\n\n313\n00:15:49.811 --> 00:15:52.941\nAnd we can see by clicking on\nthem what elements are heathy,\n\n314\n00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.735\nI like the whole risky business\nsunglasses icon there, as you can see.\n\n315\n00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:58.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have all of this and\n\n316\n00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:02.742\nwe can see the Report Console,\nthe Web Console looks healthy.\n\n317\n00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:08.277\nWe can Select there, and see the\nindividual information for each component.\n\n318\n00:16:08.277 --> 00:16:12.365\nIf we're looking at what's not monitored,\nwe could select what's not monitored and\n\n319\n00:16:12.365 --> 00:16:15.450\nsee things in the system that\nare currently not being monitored.\n\n320\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.400\nSo this is an interactive diagram view\nthat let's us understand by directly\n\n321\n00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.430\nclicking through and visually linking\nobject identifiers or these icons.\n\n322\n00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.240\nWith status, we're able to see\nwhat the current status is.\n\n323\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.180\nAnd this does update in real time as well.\n\n324\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.710\nSo there is a refresh cycle for it,\nit's not updated consistently but\n\n325\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.270\nthis diagram does update and\ndoes give us actual status.\n\n326\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.190\nAnd then we can see here\nwhat's in a warning state.\n\n327\n00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.850\nSo we can click through on each area,\nwe just have to, of course,\n\n328\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.610\nroll over here to see warning.\n\n329\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.360\nWe could see the elements\nthat are in a warning state.\n\n330\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.520\nAnd we can see that there's some sort of a\nwarning on the MS SQL Server instance, for\n\n331\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.770\nthe database for instance,\non the back-end, with this.\n\n332\n00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.800\nSo there's maybe something we want\nto go drill into, on the app, right?\n\n333\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.020\nSo we can get lots of different views\nto see what is actually happening\n\n334\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.470\nwith our data status,\nby creating this monitor.\n\n335\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.270\nWe haven't created yet, remember,\nI did say this ahead of time.\n\n336\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.510\nI'm just walking you\nthrough what the output is.\n\n337\n00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.590\nAnd then when you see me create it,\n\n338\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.340\nyou're gonna have already seen all this\ncool stuff that we could do with it.\n\n339\n00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.160\n&gt;&gt; So Adam,\nthis is a really cool user interface here.\n\n340\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.390\nAnd if I already have this particular\ncomponent setup in my environment, and\n\n341\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.410\nyou had a pretty\ninteresting notion earlier.\n\n342\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.263\nThat if my company wasn't large enough to\nhave its own internal development team,\n\n343\n00:17:30.263 --> 00:17:34.490\nand I was working with a third party\nentity, would I be able to easily take\n\n344\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.539\nthis information and export it or\nhow will that normally be handled?\n\n345\n00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:42.914\n&gt;&gt; Well, it would depend on whether\nthe third party entity was giving you\n\n346\n00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:45.079\naccess to the systems to monitor.\n\n347\n00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:47.758\nSo in other words were they hosting it and\ndoing monitoring for you,\n\n348\n00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:51.142\nthen the question would flip around and we\nwould say, hey, what are they exporting,\n\n349\n00:17:51.142 --> 00:17:52.350\nwhat are they giving you?\n\n350\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If we're gonna be hosting the app or\n\n351\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.820\nperhaps they're developing the app.\n\n352\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.600\nSo maybe they've developed the code,\nwe're running it on our servers,\n\n353\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.560\nwhich is fairly common as a thought\nprocess when we outsource.\n\n354\n00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.160\nIf they're doing that, then we will\nown the monitoring environment.\n\n355\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.750\nWe can take this information,\nwe can export it.\n\n356\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.890\nWe have reports, for\n\n357\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.310\ninstance, we can also delegate\nthrough the use of the roles area.\n\n358\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.630\nWe have talked about in another episodes\nwhere we can assign a role and tailor and\n\n359\n00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.065\nfilter that view that we give\nsomebody by security trimming the UI,\n\n360\n00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:27.895\ngiving them only rights to certain\nelements within the system.\n\n361\n00:18:27.895 --> 00:18:29.335\nOther Windows security model\nin other words, right?\n\n362\n00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:30.315\nIf you think about it.\n\n363\n00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:32.845\nWe use that generically in\nalmost every product we have.\n\n364\n00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:36.085\nWe have the ability to do that in\nall the System Center products but\n\n365\n00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:37.945\nobviously in SCOM as well.\n\n366\n00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:43.545\nWe could give those developers the ability\nto log in with limited console access and\n\n367\n00:18:43.545 --> 00:18:47.150\nC monitoring, give them a roll that\nis constrained in other words.\n\n368\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.600\nAnd we would be able to give them\naccess to the data directly.\n\n369\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.520\nSo it wouldn't necessarily be\nwe have to export the data\n\n370\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.890\nbecause we export management packs,\nwe don't tend to export data.\n\n371\n00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.730\nBecause data sits in the databases,\n\n372\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.065\nthe way we get at it would\nbe through reports, right?\n\n373\n00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:04.295\nWe query the databases, pull that data\nout of the data warehouse database and\n\n374\n00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:06.015\nuse reports for representing.\n\n375\n00:19:06.015 --> 00:19:09.095\nSo we could give them a limited view\nthat gives them reporting rights.\n\n376\n00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:10.555\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or console management rights if\n\n377\n00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:12.145\nthey wanna interact directly.\n\n378\n00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:14.035\nSo it would be different ways to do,-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just depending.\n\n379\n00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:15.496\n&gt;&gt; Just a matter of what\nthe best approach would be.\n\n380\n00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:16.037\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.\n\n381\n00:19:16.037 --> 00:19:18.115\n&gt;&gt; What we wanna do or\nhow we want to achieve that.\n\n382\n00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.740\nAll right, so let's go back in,\nlet's get out of the diagram view,\n\n383\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.330\nlet's get out of our status and\nstayed view here.\n\n384\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.900\nWe just wanted to poke around under\nthe covers a little bit to show you\n\n385\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.090\nsome of the output of this just\nbefore we go in and create one.\n\n386\n00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.610\nWe can see the monitored application here,\nwe can see the overall health.\n\n387\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.900\nWe see the application itself has\na folder, sub-folder created.\n\n388\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.980\nIf we did have alerts,\nas I said, we would see them.\n\n389\n00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.200\nWe don't right now.\n\n390\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.290\nWe could drill through, we can see\nthe health state of the monitor and\n\n391\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.990\nwe could see information here.\n\n392\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.230\nSo we do have a nice\namount of information.\n\n393\n00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.120\nAlso on the right,\n\n394\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.840\ncan we go full screen for a sec,\ncuz I didn't talk about this before.\n\n395\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.580\nWhenever we highlight anything, we've seen\nthis in other episode, another demos in\n\n396\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.810\nthe apps console, everything is contextual\non the right here in the work area.\n\n397\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.150\nBut as we highlight something,\n\n398\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.070\nwe have the ability to do a variety\nof things here as you can see,\n\n399\n00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.520\nstart maintenance mode, entity properties,\nhealth explorers I showed you.\n\n400\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.670\nAll the different views to Cherokee's\nquestion just a moment ago,\n\n401\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.620\nas I mentioned.\n\n402\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.830\nMaybe we'll do some reporting, we can\nsee a lists of reports down there on\n\n403\n00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.810\nthe right, under report tasks that may be\nvaluable that we could either generate or\n\n404\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.660\ngive to somebody, potentially.\n\n405\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.050\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Once we run them.\n\n406\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.580\nSo we do have the ability to interact\nwith this data contextually right here.\n\n407\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.250\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do, is\ngo ahead and actually create this thing.\n\n408\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.100\nWe've been poking around under the hood\nfor almost probably 20 minutes,\n\n409\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.360\nabout what it looks like after we do it,\nbut we haven't actually done it yet.\n\n410\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.090\nSo now, we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're actually gonna create the monitor.\n\n411\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.850\nSo we're going to switch gears,\nwe're gonna leave the monitoring area.\n\n412\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.150\nWe're gonna go to the authoring area,\n\n413\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.720\nbecause this is where we go to access\nour management pack templates,\n\n414\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.170\nour management pack objects,\nwe've talked about in other episodes.\n\n415\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.250\nThose will be down here, underneath\nhere in the management pack object area.\n\n416\n00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.000\nWe're not gonna mess with those for now.\n\n417\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.980\nWe're just gonna come up here,\nthere we go.\n\n418\n00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.890\nGonna come up here,\nwe're gonna go to authoring.\n\n419\n00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.970\nAnd you can see under\nmanagement pack template,\n\n420\n00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.920\nthat we do have our .NET Application\nPerformance Monitoring template.\n\n421\n00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.220\nWe can hover there, it gives us all\nthis information about what it is,\n\n422\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.520\nand how we're gonna use it.\n\n423\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.930\nYou'll see the app that\nI've already created,\n\n424\n00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.130\nthat we've been playing\naround with is there listed,\n\n425\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.390\nbeen sitting there for a while.\n\n426\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate another instantiation to this and\n\n427\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.850\nshow you how to walk through this.\n\n428\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.900\nSo, we're gonna right click on this\ntemplate and monitoring wizard.\n\n429\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.430\nAnd by the way, there is a link\nright down here off to the left,\n\n430\n00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.530\nAdd monitoring wizard.\n\n431\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.030\nWe can launch it right from there,\nand we would get-\n\n432\n00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.330\n&gt;&gt; Just giving you a couple different ways\n\n433\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.150\nto execute?\n\n434\n00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would just be the same thing,\nwe would still get to the same window.\n\n435\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.770\nWe'd still have to make a choice here.\n\n436\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.470\nIt doesn't matter if we highlight\nthe template, right click and\n\n437\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.040\nchoose Add monitoring wizard.\n\n438\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.930\nWe still get this screen,\nand we still choose here.\n\n439\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.080\nAnd if we just load add monitoring\nwizard over there on the left,\n\n440\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.030\nwe get to the same place.\n\n441\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.020\nSo it wouldn't matter either way,\nit's totally a question of just whether or\n\n442\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.470\nnot you happen to be of the mindset\nthat I'll click on the template,\n\n443\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.320\nversus launching the wizard directly.\n\n444\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.440\nWe're going to go ahead and\nhighlight our template,\n\n445\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.370\nvery important to make\nthe right selection here.\n\n446\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.750\nOtherwise we'll wind up monitoring\nsomething that we may not wanna monitor,\n\n447\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.330\nwe gotta go back and do it again.\n\n448\n00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.750\nSo we're gonna do .NET\nPerformance Monitoring here.\n\n449\n00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.050\nClick Next, we have to give it a name.\n\n450\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:22.670\nI had named my prior one ITProTVNetApp1.\n\n451\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.122\nSo I told you, Cherokee,\nwas gonna participate in this one.\n\n452\n00:22:26.122 --> 00:22:31.496\nSo we're call this one C-H-E-R,\nfor her, O-K-E-E, right?\n\n453\n00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:32.490\n&gt;&gt; You spelt it correct it.\n\n454\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.930\n&gt;&gt; I did spell it correctly,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n455\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.660\nname the application Cherokee.\n\n456\n00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.340\n&gt;&gt; You should see some\nof my Starbucks cups.\n\n457\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.275\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee.\n\n458\n00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:42.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cheruba,\n\n459\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.530\nI'm sure get all sorts of stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.810\nThey managed to slaughter and\nbutcher my name.\n\n461\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.260\nAnd we're talking four letters, and\nthe first person created, right?\n\n462\n00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.680\nI mean, It's not hard to figure\nout Adam but what can I tell you.\n\n463\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.954\nAll right, so then what we do is we go\nahead, and then the pronunciations.\n\n464\n00:22:59.954 --> 00:23:02.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; are just like even funnier, Allen,\n\n465\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.430\nAgor, I got like [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n466\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.660\nyou know what I'm talking about, yeah.\n\n467\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.340\n&gt;&gt; I've just learned to answer to\nanything that even remotely resembles it.\n\n468\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.810\nIf it's my drink I'll take it.\n\n469\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.530\nIf it's your drink and\n\n470\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.360\nI'm there before you, you are out\nof luck So I just want my coffee.\n\n471\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.890\nI don't really care whose name is\non the cup to be honest with you.\n\n472\n00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.060\nAll right so then what we are gonna\ndo is we are to go ahead and\n\n473\n00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.600\nwe are gonna choose.\n\n474\n00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.500\nCould we go full-screen cuz we\nare not gonna be able to see\n\n475\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.410\nall of these unless we do that.\n\n476\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.720\nThank you very much sir.\n\n477\n00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.400\nWe are going down here,\nto have to choose our management pack.\n\n478\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.080\nWe have to assign this application,\ntemplate, and\n\n479\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.510\nmonitoring wizard to a management pack.\n\n480\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.210\nSo that way, we get all of those views and\nall those tools I was just showing you.\n\n481\n00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:46.120\nThe application alert view, the dashboard,\nthe diagram view, all that stuff.\n\n482\n00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.396\nAll those things, they're all objects that\nare coming to us as part of being able to\n\n483\n00:23:50.396 --> 00:23:52.550\nbe associated with the management pack.\n\n484\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.927\nSo we have to assign or essentially create\na dependency between our monitor and\n\n485\n00:23:56.927 --> 00:24:00.456\nthe management pack to be able\nto bring all the information in.\n\n486\n00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:02.566\nSo we actually have it once we're done,\nand\n\n487\n00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.969\nwe can see all those things\nI was just showing you.\n\n488\n00:24:04.969 --> 00:24:07.042\nWe don't do this, we got nothing.\n\n489\n00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:08.986\nThere's nothing that's gonna\nshow up when we're done.\n\n490\n00:24:08.986 --> 00:24:12.814\nSo we're gonna either create a brand\nnew Management Pack we could do that or\n\n491\n00:24:12.814 --> 00:24:15.332\nwe can choose one of\nthe ones that started there.\n\n492\n00:24:15.332 --> 00:24:19.080\nI'm gonna use the default Management Pack,\nwhich has all those monitors,\n\n493\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.510\nall those objects,\n\n494\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.550\nall those which already exists here\nwith the reports on stuff I shared you.\n\n495\n00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.640\nIt's all there, so we're gonna\nchoose default Management Pack.\n\n496\n00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.494\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\nwe are going to, just get that up there.\n\n497\n00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:34.092\nWe're gonna click Next,\n\n498\n00:24:34.092 --> 00:24:38.244\nthen we're gonna specify add\napplication components to monitor.\n\n499\n00:24:38.244 --> 00:24:41.452\nWe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\nadd in the application component.\n\n500\n00:24:41.452 --> 00:24:43.240\nIn other words, what do we wanna monitor?\n\n501\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.860\nWhat is the application?\n\n502\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.140\nWe actually wanna bring in,\nwhat are we looking at, right?\n\n503\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.411\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna bring that in.\n\n504\n00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.619\nSo we're gonna click Add here,\nwe're gonna do a search.\n\n505\n00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:54.090\nYou'll see it says, Search for\nweb applications and services.\n\n506\n00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.955\nDo a search, we'll find orchestrater,\nwhich I already used and\n\n507\n00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:57.952\nI showed you is there.\n\n508\n00:24:57.952 --> 00:25:02.260\nIn the real world of course, we can\nsearch for either web applications and\n\n509\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.920\nservices or Windows services\ndepending on what is there.\n\n510\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.665\nBut it says here, before you select\na service here, you have to have added\n\n511\n00:25:08.665 --> 00:25:11.745\nthe appropriate monitoring for service\nby using the Windows Services Template.\n\n512\n00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:13.895\nIn other words,\nif I choose Windows Services,\n\n513\n00:25:13.895 --> 00:25:17.576\nit's telling me hey, guess what, you\nmade the wrong choice three screens ago.\n\n514\n00:25:17.576 --> 00:25:20.750\nCuz you said .NET app,\nthat's a web app, right?\n\n515\n00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.340\nIf you want Windows,\nyou got to go back and\n\n516\n00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.077\nchoose a different template in-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n517\n00:25:24.077 --> 00:25:25.505\n&gt;&gt; Order to be able to do the monitoring,\n\n518\n00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:27.530\nbecause you're not\nmonitoring the right one.\n\n519\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.864\nWhat they're saying here, this, is that I\nwould have to choose this item right down\n\n520\n00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:35.911\nhere on the left which is Windows Service\nnot the .NET application template.\n\n521\n00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:39.412\nSo I can make a choice here, but\nI've already made my choice.\n\n522\n00:25:39.412 --> 00:25:41.370\nI got to just stick with\nwhat's already there.\n\n523\n00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.845\nNow the logical question is well,\nokay smart guy, then why are they giving\n\n524\n00:25:44.845 --> 00:25:47.787\nyou Windows Service there,\nif you shouldn't be choosing it?\n\n525\n00:25:47.787 --> 00:25:50.640\nThat's a design issue,\nnothing to do with me.\n\n526\n00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.661\nI'm a knowledge of modern design,\nyou wanna talk about design-\n\n527\n00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:54.244\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:57.053\n&gt;&gt; You send an email to microsoft.com, and\n\n529\n00:25:57.053 --> 00:25:59.630\nyou ask them why they chose to do that.\n\n530\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.827\nBut what we're doing here, right?\n\n531\n00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:07.286\nIs we're gonna go back to Web Apps and\nServices, we're gonna choose Orchestrator.\n\n532\n00:26:07.286 --> 00:26:11.077\nNow, I made this point in other demos\nwhere we're not done here, right?\n\n533\n00:26:11.077 --> 00:26:14.585\nYou've selected the component, but\nyou have not added it to the bottom window\n\n534\n00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:17.410\nhere, where it actually is\nthen gonna become active.\n\n535\n00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.250\nAnd you don't have an OK button here\nthat goes active until you do that.\n\n536\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.995\nSo you got to click Add,\nmake sure you drop it down there.\n\n537\n00:26:23.995 --> 00:26:26.659\nNow the OK button is there and\nthen I hide it,\n\n538\n00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:30.703\nof course with my magical disappearing and\nreappearing task bar.\n\n539\n00:26:30.703 --> 00:26:34.246\nLet's move this over a little bit,\nso you can see that a little better.\n\n540\n00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:36.406\nAnd then we'll move it over a little more,\n\n541\n00:26:36.406 --> 00:26:39.827\nso you can see it even better because\nthat way it is away from the box.\n\n542\n00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:44.244\nAnd then we added that in,\nnow we have our monitoring scope.\n\n543\n00:26:44.244 --> 00:26:46.827\nWe've gone ahead and added in,\nwhat we're gonna do?\n\n544\n00:26:46.827 --> 00:26:49.350\nWe've done our search,\nwe've got it in our orchestrator.\n\n545\n00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:55.263\nAnd what we're gonna do down here under\nEnvironment is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n546\n00:26:55.263 --> 00:26:57.745\nspecify what stage of the cycle.\n\n547\n00:26:57.745 --> 00:26:59.890\nCan we go full screen, just so\nyou can see this for a second?\n\n548\n00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.869\nWhat stage of the environment cycle,\nthe monitoring scope, we're gonna use.\n\n549\n00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:06.690\nThis is a metadata tag by the way, right?\n\n550\n00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.330\nYou could leave this at None,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n551\n00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.993\nBut we have standard stages here for\na life cycle typically.\n\n552\n00:27:11.993 --> 00:27:14.600\nProduction, Staging, Test, Dev, New,\n\n553\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.710\nyou create your own tag there if you wanna\ngo in and create your own metadata tag.\n\n554\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.772\nThis would line up with\nyour app dev life cycle,\n\n555\n00:27:22.772 --> 00:27:26.078\nyour management thought\nprocess of how you do dev.\n\n556\n00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:29.096\nAt what your development\nlifecycle stages are, or\n\n557\n00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:32.185\nwhere you're gonna deploy\nthis application into,\n\n558\n00:27:32.185 --> 00:27:36.840\nwhat environment it's running and\nyou can look at that in different ways.\n\n559\n00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.311\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we'll say\nthis is in, let's put it in staging,\n\n560\n00:27:40.311 --> 00:27:43.490\nit doesn't really matter,\nwe'll put it in staging.\n\n561\n00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.910\nGo ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n562\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.160\nWe have here configure\nthe default monitoring settings.\n\n563\n00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.600\nYou'll notice turn on\nperformance of n-alerts.\n\n564\n00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.090\nNotice turn on exception even alerts,\nthose are selected.\n\n565\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.702\nPerformance event threshold and\nmilliseconds, 15,000.\n\n566\n00:27:57.702 --> 00:28:01.286\nMeaning 15 seconds configure\nperformance event monitoring.\n\n567\n00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:04.900\n15 second increments for\ndata grabs, we can modify that.\n\n568\n00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.641\nBut do know that is in milliseconds,\nthat will be important,\n\n569\n00:28:07.641 --> 00:28:09.287\nyou're sitting there typing 15.\n\n570\n00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you're getting slammed with data,\n\n571\n00:28:11.601 --> 00:28:15.819\nbecause you're getting data reads every 15\nmilliseconds that would be ridiculous, so\n\n572\n00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:17.161\njust pay attention to that.\n\n573\n00:28:17.161 --> 00:28:19.641\nWe do have the ability to\nuse advanced settings for\n\n574\n00:28:19.641 --> 00:28:21.810\ncustomizing additionally here.\n\n575\n00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.820\nWe can also enable additional\nconfiguration options for\n\n576\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.030\nserver side and client side monitoring.\n\n577\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.939\nWe talked about the fact that\nwhen we were setting this up.\n\n578\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.140\nWe have the ability to look at\nboth client side and server side,\n\n579\n00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.660\nboth sides of the hosting\nenvironment to interact and see.\n\n580\n00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.590\nSo let's just take a look here,\nwe'll enable those.\n\n581\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.060\nWhen we do, you'll notice we get some\nadditional options here in the wizard\n\n582\n00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.920\noff to the left that\nwe have to go through.\n\n583\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.510\nAdvanced Settings,\nthis is centrally the same idea.\n\n584\n00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.340\nWe go in and we can drill down further,\nsetting name spaces,\n\n585\n00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.800\nsetting methods,\nconfiguring exception event monitoring.\n\n586\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.120\nSo we can specify what kind of exceptions\nwe want, what's classified as critical.\n\n587\n00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.985\nWe can also go in and program in the exact\nthresholds as well as the intervals for\n\n588\n00:29:01.985 --> 00:29:06.409\nall the different monitors that we're\ngonna be engaging in to grab data\n\n589\n00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:07.536\nright down here.\n\n590\n00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:11.284\nLet's come down so you can see all that,\nhow we could see that all of this is\n\n591\n00:29:11.284 --> 00:29:15.462\navailable to us to interact with, and to\nprogram based on the exact specification\n\n592\n00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:18.570\nthat we're looking for,\nfor regards to monitor.\n\n593\n00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.869\nSo if we do advanced monitoring and\nwe do configuration.\n\n594\n00:29:21.869 --> 00:29:25.533\nIt's almost like fine tuning or tweaking\nwithin the registry where we're editing\n\n595\n00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:28.010\nspecific settings and\nachieving certain end results.\n\n596\n00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.010\nSo we can go in,\nwe can set that here if we chose to.\n\n597\n00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.410\nWe're not gonna make changes,\nbut just so you could see that.\n\n598\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.643\nThe server side and\n\n599\n00:29:34.643 --> 00:29:38.661\nclient side configurations will\nlook essentially the same.\n\n600\n00:29:38.661 --> 00:29:43.452\nLet's just click Next there,\ngive that a second.\n\n601\n00:29:43.452 --> 00:29:46.620\nWhat we're gonna get is, there we go.\n\n602\n00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.827\nOkay, so it's good to be connected.\n\n603\n00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:49.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna get is,\n\n604\n00:29:49.547 --> 00:29:52.162\nsometimes you just have to\ntake a break for a second.\n\n605\n00:29:52.162 --> 00:29:55.360\nRest, relax, consoles need\na break just like we do, right?\n\n606\n00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.077\nSo they go away and\nthen they come back, that's all it is.\n\n607\n00:29:57.077 --> 00:30:00.630\n&gt;&gt; And again,\nthat's just I guess not a symptom, but\n\n608\n00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.286\njust a cause of that lab environment.\n\n609\n00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:04.236\n&gt;&gt; It's probably just, yeah,\n\n610\n00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:06.250\nwell it's a flicker of the bandwidth\nmore than anything else.\n\n611\n00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.734\nJust a little blip in the Internet,\n\n612\n00:30:07.734 --> 00:30:10.162\nsomebody out there was probably\ndownloading something.\n\n613\n00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:12.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps watching the trailer for\n\n614\n00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:14.328\na new Marvel movie, or who knows what.\n\n615\n00:30:14.328 --> 00:30:15.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so anyway, so\n\n616\n00:30:15.891 --> 00:30:18.910\nyou see that we have the ability to\ndrill and do the advanced settings.\n\n617\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.061\nClick Next here, you'll see that we\nhave our Customized component for\n\n618\n00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:24.550\nindividual application components screen.\n\n619\n00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.100\nServer Side Components, we have that here.\n\n620\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.130\nWe can go in and customize, you'll\nsee that same exact screen I was just\n\n621\n00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.100\nshowing you for advanced settings,\nbut specific to the app.\n\n622\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.580\nSo we have the ability to drill\nthrough here on the server side.\n\n623\n00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.940\nWe also have the ability to do\nthe same thing on the client side.\n\n624\n00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.470\nTurn on the exception monitoring\nwhatever it is we may want,\n\n625\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.960\nspecify the IP addresses that\nwill be used for monitoring.\n\n626\n00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.250\nRight now we have our loop\nback address in IPv4, and\n\n627\n00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.580\nour loopback in IPv6,\n::1 sitting up there.\n\n628\n00:30:55.580 --> 00:31:00.000\nSo we can see that and specify what\nwe're gonna do there, if required.\n\n629\n00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.620\nAnd then we can enable our client\nside monitoring for the web app.\n\n630\n00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:11.280\nIf we have set up any of that we will\nbe able to see specifications here.\n\n631\n00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.994\nAnd then go ahead, we'll click Next.\n\n632\n00:31:13.994 --> 00:31:17.591\nYou will IIS may need to be restarted,\nfor us to do this, just warning us,\n\n633\n00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:18.994\nno big deal, that's fine.\n\n634\n00:31:18.994 --> 00:31:20.577\nWe will click Create.\n\n635\n00:31:20.577 --> 00:31:23.606\n&gt;&gt; Now if you allowed that client\nside monitoring that would\n\n636\n00:31:23.606 --> 00:31:26.330\nalso have to be configured\non that client machine?\n\n637\n00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:32.588\n&gt;&gt; No, because that client side\nmonitoring is going to be done\n\n638\n00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:35.412\nfrom the agent that is sitting on.\n\n639\n00:31:35.412 --> 00:31:37.660\nSo no, there's no configuration.\n\n640\n00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.801\nWe have the monitoring that takes\nplace on the server side through\n\n641\n00:31:40.801 --> 00:31:41.952\nthe monitoring agent.\n\n642\n00:31:41.952 --> 00:31:45.580\nThe SCOM agents been renamed,\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent.\n\n643\n00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.508\nThen what we're doing is we're looking at,\nfrom the client perspective,\n\n644\n00:31:48.508 --> 00:31:51.495\nwe're looking at transactional data\nthat represents inbound connection.\n\n645\n00:31:51.495 --> 00:31:53.791\nSo we're pulling the data\noff the web server, but\n\n646\n00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:55.661\nit's a question of what data we look at.\n\n647\n00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:56.184\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n648\n00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:58.838\n&gt;&gt; The client side monitoring\nis about being able to,\n\n649\n00:31:58.838 --> 00:32:01.994\nwe would specify the IP address\nthere that we wanna monitor.\n\n650\n00:32:01.994 --> 00:32:05.441\nAnd then we would then be able to\npull that data in from that machine,\n\n651\n00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:07.744\nlooking at the inbound\ndata we tagged the IP.\n\n652\n00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:10.220\nIn other words, we look at\nthe inbound data in the logs and\n\n653\n00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.660\nwe're pulling in that data\nfrom the monitored server.\n\n654\n00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.161\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n655\n00:32:13.161 --> 00:32:14.448\n&gt;&gt; So we don't really have\nto configure anything else,\n\n656\n00:32:14.448 --> 00:32:16.050\nthere's nothing we would\nhave to worry about.\n\n657\n00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.972\nAll right, so you'll see here\nwe do now have our app set up.\n\n658\n00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:23.960\nIt's gonna take a few minutes to spin up\nand instantiate itself on the monitoring\n\n659\n00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.610\nside as we already showed you the output\nof what the prior output looked like.\n\n660\n00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:32.080\nBut this is what we would do to\nstand up and enable APM monitoring,\n\n661\n00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.452\nend to end on the server or in SCOM.\n\n662\n00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:37.210\nAnd then obviously targeting\nwhatever web app we are using.\n\n663\n00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.835\nAnd then we've shown you through\nthe beginning of this demo,\n\n664\n00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:41.662\nall the output that we\nwould get from that.\n\n665\n00:32:41.662 --> 00:32:45.553\nAnd the ways that we could consume that\ndata with health explorer and the various\n\n666\n00:32:45.553 --> 00:32:49.329\nmonitoring information that we can use\nthe network view to see the diagram and\n\n667\n00:32:49.329 --> 00:32:50.161\nconnectivity.\n\n668\n00:32:50.161 --> 00:32:52.560\nThere's connectivity of the application.\n\n669\n00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.119\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there we go.\n\n670\n00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:55.037\nWe can monitor Cherokee one now.\n\n671\n00:32:55.037 --> 00:32:56.703\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can monitor Cherokee one\n\n672\n00:32:56.703 --> 00:32:58.204\nin our staging enviroment.\n\n673\n00:32:58.204 --> 00:33:01.060\nBecause that's where we said Cherokee\none was going to be deployed.\n\n674\n00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we actually have it sitting in our\n\n675\n00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.570\nstaging enviroment right now, absolutely.\n\n676\n00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.199\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n677\n00:33:05.199 --> 00:33:08.827\nare we good to go, was there anything else\nwe needed to do for this particular lab?\n\n678\n00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:11.180\n&gt;&gt; No, I think for this one, we are good.\n\n679\n00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.286\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you so\nmuch Adam, for showing us how to do that.\n\n680\n00:33:13.286 --> 00:33:15.077\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n681\n00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:19.890\nBut stay tuned, we do have more monitoring\nand operating information headed your way.\n\n682\n00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.620\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n683\n00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.452\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n684\n00:33:23.452 --> 00:33:26.411\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:06.483\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.483 --> 00:00:08.148\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.316\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:11.828\n[MUSIC]\n\n7\n00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:16.087\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen to your\nMicrosoft MCSE Private Cloud Series.\n\n8\n00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:18.690\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.780\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.910\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.900\n&gt;&gt; Hola.\n\n12\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.075\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n&gt;&gt; I'm feeling like a little Spanish flair\n\n13\n00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:27.865\ncoming on today.\n\n14\n00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:28.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps it's\n\n15\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.590\nmy bright attire, I don't know.\n\n16\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.519\nI've been told that it's lovely,\nbut I'm not sure if it is.\n\n17\n00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.602\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's called flamenco pink.\n\n18\n00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.886\n&gt;&gt; It could be although I don't\nknow how to do the flamenco, so\n\n19\n00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.644\nif that's the case we're out of luck\ncuz this is all you're gonna get.\n\n20\n00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:40.203\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we\n\n21\n00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:43.778\nare gonna talk about configuring\nnotification accounts for subscribing to.\n\n22\n00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:48.116\nNow we've actually talked about this\nin other episodes in our series and\n\n23\n00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:52.098\nwe actually done a demonstration\nof how to setup subscriptions and\n\n24\n00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:53.675\nnotification accounts.\n\n25\n00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:58.034\nBut we're gonna run you back through it\nhere as well in the context of how we do\n\n26\n00:00:58.034 --> 00:01:01.526\nand enable and\nsetup application performance monitoring.\n\n27\n00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:04.983\nCuz it is important to be able to take the\noutput of that monitoring as we've been\n\n28\n00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:07.254\ntalking about in some of\nour prior conversations and\n\n29\n00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.510\nbe able to create\nactionable items with it.\n\n30\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.989\nAnd be able to take those alerts and be\nmade aware of them, subscribe to them and\n\n31\n00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.204\nthen be notified that we may need to do\nsomething is gonna be one of the ways\n\n32\n00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:17.610\nin which we consume that data.\n\n33\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.395\nSo we're gonna start by taking a look\nat in the console our administration\n\n34\n00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:26.060\nworkspace, we are down about half way to\nthree quarters towards the bottom here.\n\n35\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.955\nWere in the Run As configuration\narea as you can see.\n\n36\n00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.612\nWe're gonna right-click here, we're\ngoing to choose create Run As Account.\n\n37\n00:01:32.612 --> 00:01:35.435\nNow before we do this just a quick\nword to remind you of this or\n\n38\n00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:39.048\ntell you the first time if you haven't\nseen any of the other conversations in\n\n39\n00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:40.830\nthe other episodes about this.\n\n40\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.340\nWe have a two step process.\n\n41\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.681\nWe're gonna create Run As Accounts\nfirst and then we're gonna go back,\n\n42\n00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:47.069\nlink that to a Run As Profile.\n\n43\n00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.206\nSo that way those two things\ntogether can then be used and\n\n44\n00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:52.560\ndistributed to the management service.\n\n45\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.240\nAnd we can then consume information.\n\n46\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.750\nSo we're gonna go through and\nsee how that takes place.\n\n47\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.880\nLet's start by creating\nour Run As account.\n\n48\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.890\nGo ahead and we'll click here,\n\n49\n00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.010\nwe've got our Wizard,\ncreate our Run As account welcome screen.\n\n50\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.190\nWe'll just move this over\njust a little bit, so\n\n51\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.510\nyou guys can see how that happens here.\n\n52\n00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.900\nAnd we are able to stay away\nfrom our floating blue box,\n\n53\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.040\nand our box in box, boxes everywhere,\njust boxes, boxes, boxes.\n\n54\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.300\nSo we're going to go ahead\nwe're going to click Next,\n\n55\n00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.360\nwe're going then choose what kind of\nRun As account type we wanna use.\n\n56\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.562\nNow we have different\nRun As account types,\n\n57\n00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.400\nthere are a whole bunch of\nthem there as you can see.\n\n58\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.210\nWe have Windows, we have Community String.\n\n59\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.320\nCommunity String is\nthe equivalent of SNMP version 2,\n\n60\n00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.830\nSimple Network Management Protocol\nversion 2.\n\n61\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.390\nCommunity String would be\nthe shared secret or password\n\n62\n00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.440\nthat is used to be able to access the\nconfiguration of the devices through SNMP.\n\n63\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.280\nWe have basic authentication,\nsimple authentication,\n\n64\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.800\ndigest authentication, different options\nyou hopefully are familiar with.\n\n65\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.040\nWe have binary authentication,\nuser choice, in other words.\n\n66\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.210\nBinary authentication means\nthe user describes and\n\n67\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.710\ndefines what the authentication\nmechanism will be.\n\n68\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.640\nWe have the action account.\n\n69\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.161\nWe've talked about accounts and\n\n70\n00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.828\naction accounts throughout\nmany of our episodes to date.\n\n71\n00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:08.861\nThese are the accounts that are setup and\nused as we configure system center ops\n\n72\n00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:11.134\nmanager to be able to\ndo a variety of things.\n\n73\n00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:13.975\nWe'd use one of those, and or S and a PV3.\n\n74\n00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:18.298\nOur Version 3 account for SNMP is just\na newer version of the SNMP protocol and\n\n75\n00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.294\nwe would use a different approach or\n\n76\n00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:23.037\nmechanism to authenticate\nif that was the case.\n\n77\n00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:24.789\nSo we're gonna choose Windows here,\n\n78\n00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.985\nbecause we are using\nWindows infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.186\nWe have to give this a name,\n\n80\n00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:36.315\nwe'll go ahead we'll name,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n81\n00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:42.320\nI'm gonna call it TestApp itprotv,\noops, user.\n\n82\n00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.322\nThink I got that right, yeah,\nclose enough for government work anyway.\n\n83\n00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:51.000\nSo testapp ITProTV user,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll click Next there.\n\n84\n00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.370\nWe have to specify our actual username,\nand our password.\n\n85\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.388\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll use the test user account.\n\n86\n00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:07.650\nNow, in the real world, you would just,\nwhile I'm typing in the password.\n\n87\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.800\nYou would provide an actual user account\nthat exists in the domain here, right?\n\n88\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.250\nWe're just using a sample account.\n\n89\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.740\nWe're not using necessarily an actual\naccount that would exist in your domain.\n\n90\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.780\nWe are just making it clear that\nyou would have to substitute in\n\n91\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.090\nan actual account value\nhere that makes sense.\n\n92\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.350\nThe account that you're gonna\ndecide is gonna be assigned\n\n93\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.610\nto this monitoring function.\n\n94\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.300\nWe've got our domain here,\npracticelabs.com, we'll click Next.\n\n95\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.210\nWe then have to specify how we're gonna\nselect our distribution security option.\n\n96\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.260\nIf we do less secure,\nwhich is not the default choice, but\n\n97\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.170\nthe one that is above the default choice\nright here, we will then have this\n\n98\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.690\ncredential automatically distributed\nto all managed computers.\n\n99\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.416\nIn other words, system center ops manager\nwill distribute for us this credential,\n\n100\n00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:55.302\nset it up on all the systems that\nwe want to do the monitoring on, so\n\n101\n00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:57.158\nwe don't have to worry about doing that.\n\n102\n00:04:57.158 --> 00:05:00.250\nWe choose more secure\ndefault choice at the bottom.\n\n103\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.060\nWe have to manually decide in\nthe next process step as we go and\n\n104\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.150\nconfigure the RunAs profile and link the\naccounts to the profile, we will then have\n\n105\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.090\nto decide which machines on Tab that\nwe get will actually be specified.\n\n106\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.430\nWe'll have to go and manually click at and\n\n107\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.390\nput in the servers that we actually then\nwant to have this account set up for.\n\n108\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.320\nSo we have an option here.\n\n109\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.680\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n110\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.260\nMore secure involves us\ninteracting with the process and\n\n111\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.520\nspecifying a pick list\nof targeted systems.\n\n112\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.750\nLess secure, distributed to all\nof the monitor manage computers\n\n113\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.760\nthat are currently in and our setup as\npart of our management infrastructure.\n\n114\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.130\nSo, we're gonna decide how to do that.\n\n115\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.010\nI'm gonna choose more secure\njust you could see what that\n\n116\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.790\nlooks like when we have to go back and\nprogram in that list.\n\n117\n00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.850\nBut we could change it at\nany point while we go.\n\n118\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.220\nSo we'll leave it at more secure.\n\n119\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.520\nWe'll click Create.\n\n120\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.840\nIt says hey, by the way,\nyou went ahead and did this.\n\n121\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.540\nYou now have to set up the Run As\naccount with the profile warning,\n\n122\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.880\nyou're gonna have to configure it.\n\n123\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.560\nThat's not the screen I was talking about.\n\n124\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.420\nWe're gonna see another screen at\nthe end of the Run As Profile Wizard\n\n125\n00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.690\nhere in just a minute, and that's\nthe screen where we make the choice.\n\n126\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.680\nSo I'm just telling you\nwhat this looks like and\n\n127\n00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.220\nmaking sure you're familiar with this.\n\n128\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.410\nSo let's do this.\n\n129\n00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.203\nWe'll then go in here,\nwe'll go to our Profiles area.\n\n130\n00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:19.120\nAnd we can see, just before we do this,\nwe have our account here.\n\n131\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.400\nAnd we have our testapp itprotv user\naccount, you can see it right down there.\n\n132\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.110\nSo we just created that account,\nthat is our Run As account,\n\n133\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.190\nthat's the one that we have set up.\n\n134\n00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.740\nAnd now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna associate it with a Run As profile.\n\n135\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.360\nSo we're gonna go in,\nCreate a profile in step two here.\n\n136\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.400\nAnd we're going to then\nassociate this account.\n\n137\n00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.799\nSo we're gonna go into Run As, and we are\ngoing to, rather we're gonna go into our,\n\n138\n00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:49.460\nRun As area, and\nwe're gonna create our Run As profile.\n\n139\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.740\nI'm thinking about what we're doing and\n\n140\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.230\nit sounds good in my head\nuntil I start saying it.\n\n141\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.030\nThen it comes out all backwards.\n\n142\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.820\nAll right, so Run As Configuration.\n\n143\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.900\nWe're gonna go ahead\ncreate our Run As profile.\n\n144\n00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.900\nLet's go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n145\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.510\nSo let's grab this,\nlet me just hide the taskbar here,\n\n146\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.730\nbecause it's one of those wizards that\ncomes up that you can't actually see\n\n147\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.700\nthe bottom lower little bit of\nthe screen there unless we do that.\n\n148\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.170\nWe'll just bump that up just a bit so\nwe can see that.\n\n149\n00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.584\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling?\n\n150\n00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:17.372\n&gt;&gt; A little finagling, yes.\n\n151\n00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:18.151\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Did not\n\n152\n00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:20.565\nrealize that you spoke Yiddish there,\nCherokee.\n\n153\n00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're just full of surprises.\n\n154\n00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.230\nI would continue talking\nto you in Yiddish, but\n\n155\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.120\nI'm feeling that's probably\nabout as far as we're gonna get.\n\n156\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.883\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.\n\n157\n00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:30.269\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking we'll just\ngive you credit for that one,\n\n158\n00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:31.862\nsay that was a good job\n&gt;&gt; Leave it at that.\n\n159\n00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:33.970\n&gt;&gt; And then we're gonna go ahead, yeah.\n\n160\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.090\nWe're gonna move on.\n\n161\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.990\nAll right, so let's do the following.\n\n162\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.150\nNow actually before I do this\nlet me show you one quick thing.\n\n163\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.870\nI meant to show you this,\nand I did forget.\n\n164\n00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.630\nSo we'll do the profile here in a second.\n\n165\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.470\nLet me just show you something.\n\n166\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.140\nSo with the account, if I go over here\nto the account, I can right-click.\n\n167\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.658\nLet me just go in and\nshow you what I was talking about here.\n\n168\n00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:54.133\nWe can go once we do have the account.\n\n169\n00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:55.550\nActually it was good right there.\n\n170\n00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.707\nOnce we do have the account set up, we\ncan go and we go to the distribution tab.\n\n171\n00:07:58.707 --> 00:07:59.523\nAnd as I said,\n\n172\n00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:03.730\nwe could change this setting that\nwe were talking about now, right?\n\n173\n00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.290\nBy doing add and\nthen adding in the servers.\n\n174\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.490\nOr we could do it as I said,\n\n175\n00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.760\nI'll just show you, do it from the Run As\nprofile wizard when we're done.\n\n176\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.910\nThat link on the Run As profile page\nwill take us right back here and\n\n177\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.839\nwe'll change it.\n\n178\n00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.180\nIt's just a matter of how we get there.\n\n179\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.370\nBut we could do it right from here.\n\n180\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:22.470\nIf we wanted to add to the distribution\narea and we wanted to search by computer\n\n181\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.340\nwe actually could go in and do this and\nwe'd be able to put this in right here.\n\n182\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.140\nWe would just search by computer.\n\n183\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.870\nDo a search,\nwe would get our management server.\n\n184\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.675\nAnd we can put that in if we want to.\n\n185\n00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:35.943\nI'll show you how to do that,\noff the other screen.\n\n186\n00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:38.253\nBut we're gonna wind up in the same place,\nokay?\n\n187\n00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:40.336\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna create our profile.\n\n188\n00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.515\nLet's go up to Run As Configuration.\n\n189\n00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:46.808\nRight-click, Run As Profile,\nback to where we were just a minute ago.\n\n190\n00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:47.860\nWe'll click Next here.\n\n191\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.910\nWe have to go ahead and\ngive the profile a name.\n\n192\n00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.640\nWe'll go ahead and we'll do this.\n\n193\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.808\nLet me, what are we gonna call this?\n\n194\n00:08:55.808 --> 00:09:00.300\nWe're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto call this, just one second.\n\n195\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.020\nHave it written down, I promise I did.\n\n196\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.531\nI just forgot to go down in the area\nwhere I see it so I can see and\n\n197\n00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.623\nwe're gonna call it\nTest Notification account.\n\n198\n00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:12.349\nOkay, so, all right, so\nlet's do Test Notification.\n\n199\n00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:15.064\nI rant about this in some episodes,\nbut the screen I'm using,\n\n200\n00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:17.200\nyou guys can't see it while I'm working.\n\n201\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.870\nIt just looks normal to you, but\n\n202\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.470\nthe screen dims like by 50% if you\ndon't keep using it constantly.\n\n203\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.670\nAnd then it will randomly\nbrighten back up again.\n\n204\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.500\nSo half the time I'm typing,\nyou see me doing this and\n\n205\n00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.620\nsquinting, it's because the screen is so\ndark, I can't see what I'm actually doing.\n\n206\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.995\nAll right, so, notification.\n\n207\n00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:35.252\nAccounts, or it's test notification.\n\n208\n00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:39.519\nThen we will select our management\npack that we are going to be using.\n\n209\n00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.240\nWe'll put this in here.\n\n210\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.070\nAnd we'll put this onto our\ndefault management pack.\n\n211\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.120\nRemember, it is important, I have to\ntalk about the Run As profile and\n\n212\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.850\nwhat we do with it.\n\n213\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.613\nBut it is important to be able to\nlink this to our management pack.\n\n214\n00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:57.020\nBecause, remember, the Run As profile and\nthe Run As account linked together\n\n215\n00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.959\nare gonna be leveraging\ninformation that we need and\n\n216\n00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:02.254\nalso objects from the management pack.\n\n217\n00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:05.529\nAnd so we have to make sure that we\nare linking them so that they can do that.\n\n218\n00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:09.413\nAnd we're gonna be using our\n[COUGH] management packs,\n\n219\n00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:13.390\ndefault management pack as\nwe did with our APM monitor.\n\n220\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.090\nWhen we set it up,\nwe did our .NET application template.\n\n221\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.450\nWe link it to management pact.\n\n222\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.730\nSo we're gonna do our Run As account.\n\n223\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.380\nSo we'll bring in the Run As account here.\n\n224\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.240\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click here.\n\n225\n00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.098\nNow remember,\n\n226\n00:10:23.098 --> 00:10:27.391\nwe already have our Run As account created\ndown at the bottom of the list here.\n\n227\n00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:30.340\nYou would choose when you do this\nwhatever account you've created.\n\n228\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.665\nI'm choosing my test itprotv user account.\n\n229\n00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.336\nBut notice,\n\n230\n00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:36.940\nI could create a brand new account here\nif I wanted to as well on the fly.\n\n231\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.916\nDo we wanna then allow the account\nto be able to manage all objects,\n\n232\n00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:42.270\nwhatever they may be?\n\n233\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.120\nOr do we wanna use a certain\nselected class or subset of objects?\n\n234\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.550\nUp to us to decide.\n\n235\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.340\nBy default, all objects make sense,\nbecause then the account and the profile\n\n236\n00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.031\ncan be used to manage and interact with\nany object and alerts from anywhere.\n\n237\n00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:59.226\nBut you may want to trim or\nsomehow modify that through a filter and\n\n238\n00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:02.520\nscope it to a more narrowly\ndefined set of objects.\n\n239\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.502\nThat will be up to you.\n\n240\n00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:06.760\nIf you choose to do that\nyou would select here.\n\n241\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.930\nYou would go in, you would choose class\nobject or group, whatever it may be.\n\n242\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.200\nAnd then based on that,\nyou have a search window that opens up.\n\n243\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.028\nYou can then from this pick list,\nonce it's populated, choose any object.\n\n244\n00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:19.909\nYou can see, there's a list of them there.\n\n245\n00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:21.994\nAnd depending on what we chose,\n\n246\n00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:27.140\nwe would then able to say I just wanna\nput this onto my ops manager database.\n\n247\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.035\nI know that doesn't say ops manager,\nit says tempdb, but you get the idea.\n\n248\n00:11:30.035 --> 00:11:33.250\nCuz I would have to go find the ops\nmanager database alphabetically.\n\n249\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.457\nBut the idea would be that it's in\nthe list, I could choose it, and\n\n250\n00:11:36.457 --> 00:11:39.781\nthen this would only be able to\ninteract with the ops manager database\n\n251\n00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:41.234\nas opposed to anything else.\n\n252\n00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:44.490\nSo we have to decide what we wanna do and\nhow we wanna do that.\n\n253\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.500\nWe'll leave it at all targeted objects,\n\n254\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.350\nmeaning anything within\nthe default management pack.\n\n255\n00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.550\nClick OK, we now have that there.\n\n256\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.958\nWe'll click Create,\ngive that just a second.\n\n257\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.010\nThen we're gonna see that screen I was\ntalking about where we have to go back and\n\n258\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.880\nspecify the distribution for the Run As\naccounts, so we can actually link this\n\n259\n00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.940\nto the appropriate servers and\nhave it be monitored.\n\n260\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.420\nWe're gonna see what I was talking about.\n\n261\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.715\nWe'll click on the link here, go back to\nthat distribution tab that I showed you.\n\n262\n00:12:09.715 --> 00:12:12.795\nAnd we'll either be able to program\nin the list under more secure or\n\n263\n00:12:12.795 --> 00:12:15.500\nswitch to less secure and\njust have it distributed for us.\n\n264\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.891\nIt's up to us to decide.\n\n265\n00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:18.720\nBut you'll see here, there's a link.\n\n266\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.400\nWe can click here.\n\n267\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.310\nWhen we do this,\nthat should look familiar to you now.\n\n268\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.670\nYou could see we're actually going to\nbe on the same tab I just showed you.\n\n269\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.800\nBy right clicking on the account and\nthen choosing properties and going in and\n\n270\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.590\nediting it directly.\n\n271\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.430\nSo, can do it either way, it's up to you.\n\n272\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.010\nWe're gonna go ahead,\n\n273\n00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.900\nwe're gonna click Add like we did just\na minute ago when I show you this.\n\n274\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.845\nWe'll click Add twice cuz clicking\nonce does not seem to be enough.\n\n275\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:40.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n276\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.680\nthen we will go ahead,\nwe'll select our server as I showed you,\n\n277\n00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.115\nremember you always have to click\nAdd there to make our selections.\n\n278\n00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:49.145\nThen we can drop it down,\nget our OK button.\n\n279\n00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:51.525\nWe'll do that,\nit's now gonna show up there.\n\n280\n00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:55.475\nWhen we click OK here, you'll notice\nthat that warning sign has now gone.\n\n281\n00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.905\nWe no longer have the caution flag,\nwe have our green check.\n\n282\n00:12:57.905 --> 00:13:01.205\nSo now, once we're done with that,\njust move this over so you can see.\n\n283\n00:13:01.205 --> 00:13:07.350\nWe'll click our Close button right there,\nand then we will have our profile.\n\n284\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.236\nLet's just go in here so we can see that.\n\n285\n00:13:10.236 --> 00:13:13.750\nIt takes just a second, and\nthen we'll have our profile here.\n\n286\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:20.456\nAnd we will sort, so\nwe get that alphabetically.\n\n287\n00:13:20.456 --> 00:13:21.825\nAnd we can go down.\n\n288\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.360\nAnd it will take a minute,\ntypically, to pop in.\n\n289\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.590\nSo you just have to wait for it.\n\n290\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.500\nWe've seen this happen in\nsome of the other demos,\n\n291\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.370\nwhere the console doesn't update or\nrefresh right away.\n\n292\n00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.730\nIt usually takes about a minute.\n\n293\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.360\nAnd if it doesn't show up\nyou can always refresh.\n\n294\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.160\nAnd you will see it there.\n\n295\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.420\nBut we could set that up.\n\n296\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.998\nAnd once we've got that all up and\nrunning and we do have that now.\n\n297\n00:13:40.998 --> 00:13:43.998\nWhat we then could do if we wanted\nto would be to then actually\n\n298\n00:13:43.998 --> 00:13:47.720\ncreate a subscription that would allow\nus to be able to then consume that.\n\n299\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.580\nI just want to show that to you,\nthat part of it.\n\n300\n00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.140\nI just want to show you what we\nwould do there really quickly.\n\n301\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.220\nBut I'm getting the sense,\nI'm using my extra special lovely shirt,\n\n302\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.539\nbright flamingo color, spidey sense.\n\n303\n00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.879\nThat the woman standing next to me may\nwanna ask a question cuz she's been\n\n304\n00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:06.410\njumping up and down, trying to get\nmy attention for like five minutes.\n\n305\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.930\nSo, what did you wanna say, Sheryl?\n\n306\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.100\n&gt;&gt; I didn't really have a question, Adam,\nbut is it really, that's it, I mean,\n\n307\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.080\nin order to obtain those notifications?\n\n308\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.980\nDo we have any additional steps\nthat we need to run through?\n\n309\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, so we are gonna take a look\nat what we do with a subscription here.\n\n310\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.090\nSo once we have our Profile,\n\n311\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.870\njust trying to refresh to see if\nwe are gonna get that to pop in.\n\n312\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.090\nSometimes you have to actually wait for\n\n313\n00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.110\nit and/or, as I said,\nyou may wanna actually close the console.\n\n314\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.210\nYou see me do that once or\ntwice as well and bring that back in.\n\n315\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.430\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll do that real quick.\n\n316\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.540\nSometimes the console does like-\n&gt;&gt; Bring it back in.\n\n317\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whoops,\nthat's not what I wanted [LAUGH].\n\n318\n00:14:39.002 --> 00:14:41.490\nI could have sworn I hit\nopen the console there.\n\n319\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.170\nAll right, so\nit's random mouse day here at ITProTV.\n\n320\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.340\nSo yes, sometimes closing and\nreopening the console just allows us to\n\n321\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.970\nget those kind of things\nto show back up quickly.\n\n322\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.138\nWhen we are waiting on them they just\ndon't seem to behave the right way.\n\n323\n00:14:57.138 --> 00:15:02.330\nSo let's go back in there and\nthen we should get our profile.\n\n324\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.668\nWhat did I call our profile?\n\n325\n00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:07.878\nSMNP, there it is, right there.\n\n326\n00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.485\nT test notification right there, right?\n\n327\n00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:10.705\nCuz I couldn't spell correctly.\n\n328\n00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:13.530\nCuz, as I said, it's hard to\nsee what was going on in there.\n\n329\n00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.350\nBut you can see now,\nit has popped in there.\n\n330\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.790\nYou can see it right down there.\n\n331\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.920\nAnd we see the profile is there.\n\n332\n00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.990\nSo to Cherokee's question, hey okay,\nso great, what do we do with that?\n\n333\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.730\nWe come up here in notifications now,\nin the workspace.\n\n334\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.780\nSo we're gonna go up just a little\nbit above where we were with Run As.\n\n335\n00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.200\nWe'll just move this down, so you could\nsee it over here on the left a little bit.\n\n336\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.690\nAnd then, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna be able to come in here,\n\n337\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.900\nand we have channels, we have\nsubscriptions, and we have subscribers.\n\n338\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.293\nAnd what we do at that point is, we can\ngo ahead, and we've been through in other\n\n339\n00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:49.295\nepisodes the entire thought process\nabout channels, notifications or\n\n340\n00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:53.377\nexcuse me under notifications channel\nsubscribers and subscriptions.\n\n341\n00:15:53.377 --> 00:15:56.891\nI'm not gonna go reproduce that\nentire thought process and\n\n342\n00:15:56.891 --> 00:15:58.441\nall the demo steps again.\n\n343\n00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:02.282\nIt actually takes about another 15 minutes\nto work through all of the logic of\n\n344\n00:16:02.282 --> 00:16:04.157\neverything, bring it all together.\n\n345\n00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:08.556\nBut the short version of it is, we then we\ncan go ahead and we can come in here and\n\n346\n00:16:08.556 --> 00:16:13.330\nyou'll see we can see we have new channels\nand we can do this via email through SMTP.\n\n347\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.120\nWe could do this via instant messaging,\nso IM.\n\n348\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.430\nWe can do text messaging,\nping ponging through SMS.\n\n349\n00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:24.010\nWe could do a command, and so\nour ability to be able to subscribe\n\n350\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.760\nthrough a channel is then\ngonna be configured here.\n\n351\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.080\nThis is the format we will then be able\nto send and receive information across.\n\n352\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.270\nWe're then able to use subscribers,\n\n353\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.530\nusers essentially that are specified\naccounts that will be used to get data.\n\n354\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.290\nAnd then subscriptions, setting up and\nessentially saying, hey,\n\n355\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.760\nI wanna dedicate a channel, and I wanna\nreceive information, and I wanna be\n\n356\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.730\nnotified about things, when alerts happen,\nor changes are made, or whatever.\n\n357\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.040\nBy using the notification area,\ninformation items here, linking\n\n358\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.780\nto the account of the profile that we're\nusing, we can actually get information and\n\n359\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.230\ntake that down, and\ninteract with it in a variety of ways.\n\n360\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.230\nWe did this other part,\nin one of the other discussions and\n\n361\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.130\ndemos in other episodes, and you could\nsee all that brought together there.\n\n362\n00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.650\nThis part was really just designed\nto show you the Run As account or\n\n363\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.130\nRun As profile specifically.\n\n364\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:09.970\n&gt;&gt; Well there you have it.\n\n365\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.140\nThat's how you go ahead and\nconfigure those notifications for alerts.\n\n366\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.050\nSo thank you so much, Adam, for\njoining us today, and thank you,\n\n367\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.490\nladies and gentlemen, for joining as well.\n\n368\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.150\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n369\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.960\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n370\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.340\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n371\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.030\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n372\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:30.755\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n373\n00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:33.072\n[MUSIC]\n\n374\n00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:35.010\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITProTV.\n\n",

series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.080\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.760\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.059\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.571\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like the mime episode,\nbut not quite, right?\n\n10\n00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.573\nHow do?\n\n11\n00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:29.673\nHopefully, everybody's going well.\n\n12\n00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:31.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to jump in and\n\n13\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.910\ncontinue our hands on demonstration.\n\n14\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.230\nWe're gonna take a look at,\nas Cherokee was just saying,\n\n15\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.410\nsynthetic transaction monitoring with or\nfor against a website.\n\n16\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.268\nWe're gonna run through using another\none of our monitoring pack templates\n\n17\n00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:43.818\nto set up.\n\n18\n00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:46.602\nIf you haven't seen the prior\nepisode we did with .NET template,\n\n19\n00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:49.635\nthe .NET template for APM, for\napplication performance monitoring,\n\n20\n00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:51.700\nprobably should go and\ntake a look at that.\n\n21\n00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.410\nWe're gonna use that same thought process,\nbut\n\n22\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.130\nuse the web application availability,\nmonitoring template.\n\n23\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.540\nWe'll spin that up, and we'll take a look\nat the difference between the local and\n\n24\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.760\npotentially outside in transaction\nmonitoring or availability\n\n25\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.850\nof transaction monitoring, something\ncalled global service monitoring.\n\n26\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.150\nIt's kind of an interesting concept.\n\n27\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.240\nWe'll take a look at that as we go.\n\n28\n00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.500\nSo if we can jump in here,\nwe'll do a quick little show and\n\n29\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980\ntell, more show than tell, hopefully.\n\n30\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.100\nBut I think that we'll probably\nhave a mixture of both.\n\n31\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.730\nSo we're gonna highlight our web\napplication availability monitoring\n\n32\n00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.290\ntemplate here.\n\n33\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.070\nYou can see it's selected, right click\nlike we've done, add monitoring wizard.\n\n34\n00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.360\nWe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n35\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.410\nGive us just a second to spin up.\n\n36\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.780\nWe'll make sure, then we choose Web\nApplication Availability Monitoring here.\n\n37\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.010\nAnd you could see we tailor our selection,\nand of course, then our script changes.\n\n38\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.420\nAnd we have the appropriate areas on\nthe left that we're gonna fill in\n\n39\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.180\nscreen by screen as we go,\nwe'll click Next.\n\n40\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.730\nWe're then gonna go ahead and\ngive this a name.\n\n41\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.800\nWe'll call it WebAppMonitor,\ncall it anything you would like.\n\n42\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.735\nWe'll then go ahead,\nwe'll put in our management pack.\n\n43\n00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.516\nWe've talked about the importance\nof associated management\n\n44\n00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:01.814\npack with our monitors, so\nwe get all the objects,\n\n45\n00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:05.070\nwe have access to all the resources\nthe management pack provides.\n\n46\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.040\nWe're gonna name our website, or URLs,\nwebsites plural, if there's more than one,\n\n47\n00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.797\nthat we would like to monitor.\n\n48\n00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:15.926\nYou'll see we just add\nthem in here in a list.\n\n49\n00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:19.300\nSo we'll just do, msn.com.\n\n50\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.644\nLet's say that we also wanna do ITProTV,\n\n51\n00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:32.758\nso we'll put in http://www.itpro.tv.\n\n52\n00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:35.530\nAnd you would put in the list of URLs for\n\n53\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.870\nall the websites that you would\nlike to be able to monitor.\n\n54\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.570\nThis would be, of course, in the real\nworld the question of you figuring out\n\n55\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.210\nwhat websites you wanna\npay attention to and\n\n56\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.450\nwanna be able to draw data down from\nin order to understand the health and\n\n57\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.970\nthe performance of them, which\nare the key things we're focusing on.\n\n58\n00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.652\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n59\n00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.461\nAnd by the way, I forgot to tell you.\n\n60\n00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.548\nI should just point out, but\nyou can do http or https here, right,\n\n61\n00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:03.133\njust so you know, even though it doesn't\nsay cuz it's an empty text screen,\n\n62\n00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.484\nyou're just filling it in.\n\n63\n00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.850\nBut you do actually have the ability\nto do http or https monitoring.\n\n64\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.620\nSo I just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n65\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.490\nHere, under Select Location from where\nyou want URLs to be monitored, so,\n\n66\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.854\nyou ever play the game,\nwhere in the world is Waldo?\n\n67\n00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:21.769\n&gt;&gt; I didn't know it was a game,\nbut I thought it was a book.\n\n68\n00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.195\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a book, it's a game.\n\n69\n00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:25.333\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess it is a game if\nyou're trying to race someone.\n\n70\n00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.724\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You probably read the book,\nI'm assuming, with them and,\n\n71\n00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:31.960\nor perhaps occasionally, and\nthere's like old TV cartoon thing.\n\n72\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.524\nSo the idea with Where's Waldo,\nright, is Waldo goes around, or\n\n73\n00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:37.061\nDora the Explorer, right?\n\n74\n00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.570\nAnd I forget what her monkey is.\n\n75\n00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.320\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam?\n\n76\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.677\nCould we spot you in that shirt?\n\n77\n00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:41.495\n&gt;&gt; Where's Adam?\n\n78\n00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:42.485\nYou could do that, as well.\n\n79\n00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:44.304\nYou could track me using this shirt.\n\n80\n00:03:44.304 --> 00:03:45.995\nIt would not be hard to find me\nif I was wearing this shirt.\n\n81\n00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:49.743\nBut you can think about the concept\nof Where's Waldo when we think\n\n82\n00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:54.460\nabout location-based URL tracking here,\nright, because we have two options.\n\n83\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.490\nWe can track and, or monitor\nthe website from an internal monitor,\n\n84\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.190\nmonitoring agent that is\nsitting inside of our network.\n\n85\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.380\nIf this website is sitting in a DMZ,\nin our host on one of our web servers,\n\n86\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.040\nin the DMZ, in our data center, we may\nwanna monitor it from inside the network\n\n87\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.480\nto look at aspects of performance that\nare specific to the communication pathway.\n\n88\n00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.560\nInside of the network, right, behind\nthe firewall or firewalls, depending on\n\n89\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.270\nwhere they are, but essentially in\nthe LAN, right, for the most part.\n\n90\n00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.120\nWe could also, potentially,\n\n91\n00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.050\nmonitor from the outside in,\nusing what is referred to on the screen,\n\n92\n00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.400\nyou could probably see it, but\nit's a little bit hard to see, it's small.\n\n93\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.560\nBut global service module,\nwe call it GSM, and GSM is outside in.\n\n94\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.950\nWe have what are called watcher nodes\nthat are pre-positioned around the globe\n\n95\n00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.780\nin Microsoft's Azure fabric,\nin their data centers.\n\n96\n00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.910\nAnd we can leverage those to actually,\nthen, create monitoring, or\n\n97\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.860\nwe can decide that we're gonna\nhave our own watcher nodes, right?\n\n98\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.122\nSo we may have a global enterprise\nwith infrastructure around the world.\n\n99\n00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:05.674\nAnd we may then wanna be able\nto utilize or specify hey,\n\n100\n00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:10.154\nthese machines sitting out there in Spain,\nand these in London, and\n\n101\n00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:15.510\nthese in Germany, or wherever, we wanna\nuse them to actually do the monitoring.\n\n102\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.265\nAnd so global service monitoring is\noutside in monitoring that allows us to\n\n103\n00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:24.489\nmonitor from outside of the network and\nlook at our traffic flow and\n\n104\n00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:28.053\nlook at performance and\ninformation from the outside.\n\n105\n00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:31.427\nThis would be the perspective of the user\nconnecting into the web server, as\n\n106\n00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:35.250\nopposed to inside, the server connecting\nto the rest of our infrastructure.\n\n107\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.050\nAnd we most likely wanna able to use and\ndo both, because it's gonna be important\n\n108\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.680\nfor us to have those perspectives with\nregards to how we monitor, right?\n\n109\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.331\n&gt;&gt; So those external entities,\nare they able to monitor our internal or\n\n110\n00:05:47.331 --> 00:05:48.943\nour private websites?\n\n111\n00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:52.965\nSo we would have to give them access, or\nare they only monitoring public websites?\n\n112\n00:05:52.965 --> 00:05:55.615\n&gt;&gt; No, well, they're gonna\nmonitor our websites, remember,\n\n113\n00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:59.080\nif they're watcher notes that we control,\nthey have monitoring agents on them.\n\n114\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.810\nThey're part of our fabric,\npart of our infrastructure.\n\n115\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.300\nIf we are hooked up to Microsoft and using\nAzure and we're using the Azure fabric to\n\n116\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.330\ndo monitoring,\nwe are using Microsoft's infrastructure.\n\n117\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.960\nBut again,\nwe're giving it the ability to be\n\n118\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.210\npart of our own infrastructure by\nextending and connecting to it.\n\n119\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.010\nSo you're absolutely right\nto call that out because,\n\n120\n00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.240\nessentially, yeah, we do need to have the\nsystem somehow identified and integrated.\n\n121\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.321\nIn our fabric, we wouldn't want\nmonitoring done by strangers.\n\n122\n00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:24.944\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n123\n00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:26.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That wouldn't be good.\n\n124\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.810\nSo, Mommy always said stranger danger,\n\n125\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.360\nmake sure you pay attention to that,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.590\nSo if a strange monitoring\nservice comes up and says hey,\n\n127\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.270\nwe wanna offer you a deal.\n\n128\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.205\nRun away quickly, right,\ndon't pay attention to them.\n\n129\n00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:38.195\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna do here, right,\n\n130\n00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:40.800\njust gonna use our add button\nas you can see right here.\n\n131\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.390\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click.\n\n132\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.080\nAnd we're gonna have to decide what\nthe locations will be that we monitor\n\n133\n00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.940\nfrom the list that's available to us.\n\n134\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.740\nRight now,\nit's internal location agent based.\n\n135\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.430\nWe're gonna, for purposes of the demo,\nuse internal agents.\n\n136\n00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.894\nBut we talked about the fact we could\nbroaden this out if we did go out and\n\n137\n00:06:57.894 --> 00:07:00.383\nclick on the link for\nglobal service monitoring.\n\n138\n00:07:00.383 --> 00:07:05.351\nWe would actually be able to go find some\ninformation out here, just really quickly,\n\n139\n00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:10.112\nout on the Microsoft website about the\ndata center, fabric, the Azure fabric and\n\n140\n00:07:10.112 --> 00:07:12.840\neverything, in the cloud platform area.\n\n141\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.981\nYou could go out and do a little\nbit of search on global service.\n\n142\n00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:25.135\nOf course,\nyou would have to spell correctly,\n\n143\n00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:28.370\nwhich is one of my biggest problems,\nmonitoring, right?\n\n144\n00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.319\nBut you can go out and do a search here,\nand you would then be able to get\n\n145\n00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.260\ninformation about the global\nservice monitor from TechNet.\n\n146\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.498\nUsually, we show you\nthis kind of information.\n\n147\n00:07:38.498 --> 00:07:44.074\nAnd we'll put it up, and\nyou can go in, Click here,\n\n148\n00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:48.217\njust get a little information about the\nidea of this outside in monitoring with\n\n149\n00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.210\nthe global service monitor.\n\n150\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.495\nAnd you can read up on it and\n\n151\n00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:54.834\nunderstand the different kinds of\nmonitoring that are available.\n\n152\n00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:57.994\nWe're gonna be able to\ndo two monitor types.\n\n153\n00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:01.844\nThey talked about web application\navailability monitoring against single\n\n154\n00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:05.571\nURLs Talk about Visual Studio,\nweb test monitoring, running multi step\n\n155\n00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.260\nauthentication and monitoring against\nthe site to check performance.\n\n156\n00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.100\nSo we have different options.\n\n157\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.810\nWe do talk about test maximums and\nlocations a little bit here,\n\n158\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.726\nwhich is nice.\n\n159\n00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:19.123\nSo we go through and give you some\ninformation about how all this is set up.\n\n160\n00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:23.750\nWe talked about test parameters here,\nmaximum number of requests for web test,\n\n161\n00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.020\n100, maximum web test file size,\nthe subscriptions per tenant.\n\n162\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.200\nYou get this with your Azure subscription\nif you're gonna do GSM monitoring.\n\n163\n00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.450\nIt's part of the Azure Fabric.\n\n164\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.070\nYou'll be able to get that and hook that\nup as part as what we were talking about.\n\n165\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.490\nAnd you could see we have 16\ndifferent currently anyway.\n\n166\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.410\n16 locations that are setup\nthat Microsoft maintains.\n\n167\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.050\nThis list does update over time, so\n\n168\n00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.455\nobviously you would have to make sure\nyou get the most recent information.\n\n169\n00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:54.220\nBut you'll see here, they have data\ncenter monitors in most geographies.\n\n170\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.370\nThey got them in Europe, they have them in\nAsia, they have them all over the world,\n\n171\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.650\nLatin America,\nthey got one sitting in Brazil.\n\n172\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.610\nIn the US, there's actually one in Miami,\nright, not too far from me.\n\n173\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.490\n&gt;&gt; Are you looking at extra costs\nwhenever you utilize these services?\n\n174\n00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.801\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthis will be part of your Azure Fabric-\n\n175\n00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:09.454\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:11.816\n&gt;&gt; Subscription, so\nyou're not looking at extra costs, but\n\n177\n00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:14.760\nyou're looking at the outlay initially\nto set up, and connect to Azure.\n\n178\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.390\nSo, whatever those monthly fees are,\ndepending on how you set up and\n\n179\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.460\nlicense Azure.\n\n180\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.110\nAnd there is a sliding scale,\nthe right of which,\n\n181\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.600\ndepending on how you are buying in with\nwhat you're opting in at what level and\n\n182\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.120\nhow you are subscribing how\nmany services you're using.\n\n183\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.990\nSame thing with Amazon, right, it's\nkind of an a la carte thought process.\n\n184\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.774\nThe more you consume the more you pay for.\n\n185\n00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:34.929\nSo there definitely would be costs\nassociated with this, but not directly.\n\n186\n00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:37.945\nIt's the broader thought process\nof opting into Azure, and\n\n187\n00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:40.580\nthen using this as part of\nthe subscription model.\n\n188\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.940\nSo you would go through,\nyou could look all this up and\n\n189\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.920\nthen find out about all\nthis through the website.\n\n190\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.295\nAdam would then give you a little bit more\ninsight into what we do for that piece.\n\n191\n00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:51.055\nSo we want to come in from the outside.\n\n192\n00:09:51.055 --> 00:09:53.535\nWe're just gonna set this up from\nthe assumption we're monitoring from\n\n193\n00:09:53.535 --> 00:09:54.380\nthe inside.\n\n194\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.545\nCuz we're not subscribing to Azure and\n\n195\n00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:59.972\nsetting up a fabric subscription to\nbe able to do the demonstration.\n\n196\n00:09:59.972 --> 00:10:02.892\nWe are just simply gonna show\nyou the thought process behind\n\n197\n00:10:02.892 --> 00:10:04.602\nhow you would do that,\nif you were going to.\n\n198\n00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:07.942\nSo I'm going to search here for\nmy internal solution.\n\n199\n00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:13.211\nI do have my monitoring capability,\nor my watcher node, so to speak.\n\n200\n00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.041\nWith my internal management group server.\n\n201\n00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:17.441\nSo my S 01 server right here.\n\n202\n00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:18.891\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a creepy name.\n\n203\n00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:19.661\n&gt;&gt; The watcher node?\n\n204\n00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.057\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:22.721\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it could be a movie title.\n\n206\n00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:26.811\n&gt;&gt; It could be, The Watchmen, that was,\nthat's a Marvel kind of thing right.\n\n207\n00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:28.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you could have those.\n\n208\n00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:29.292\nSo kind of be like that.\n\n209\n00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.541\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n210\n00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:33.272\nwe have our agent pool set up here and\nwe'll click Next.\n\n211\n00:10:33.272 --> 00:10:38.360\nAnd then we have our view and\nour validate test, and\n\n212\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.280\nwe can go in and we can and\nyou'll see we have two URLs there.\n\n213\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.860\nAnd, excuse me,\nwhat we're gonna do is we can go in and\n\n214\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.390\nwe can specify that we\nwould be able to buy URL.\n\n215\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:56.310\nWe have each one, we could run a test and\nsee if we can connect out and monitor.\n\n216\n00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.850\nAnd if we can actually,\n\n217\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.399\nthen we would get the results back on\nhow long did it take us to connect.\n\n218\n00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.393\nAnd what was the performance on it,\n\n219\n00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:08.190\nwe begin to see the sample data\nwe'll ultimately get as we monitor.\n\n220\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.610\nNow, we're doing this\nfrom an internal monitor.\n\n221\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.310\nWe're not going out to the web to actually\nconnect and hit these sites for real.\n\n222\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.150\nSo we're not gonna run the tests here.\n\n223\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.930\nOnly cuz if we do that, and\nyou can't even see the run test button,\n\n224\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.380\ncuz I'm talking to you and\nthe box is covering it.\n\n225\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.910\nLet me move it over so you can see it.\n\n226\n00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.410\nIf we were to click the run test now,\n\n227\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.020\nwe would get a failure because\nwe're not actually connecting out.\n\n228\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.680\nBut I'm just showing you that\nthat's what we would do.\n\n229\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.410\nWe could, you'll see here,\nchange our configuration.\n\n230\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.520\nLet me just click here.\n\n231\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.690\nLet's just talk about what we do have\nunderneath the hood for testing for\n\n232\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.400\na minute, though,\ncuz this part will be of interest to you.\n\n233\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.830\nSo we have test frequency and\nperformance data collection.\n\n234\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.170\nThat Cherokee was asking.\n\n235\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.620\nHey, where will we monitor from?\n\n236\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.680\nHow do we set it up?\n\n237\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.830\nBut she easily also could have asked,\nhey what are we gonna monitor?\n\n238\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.797\nWhat are we gonna get back?\n\n239\n00:11:47.797 --> 00:11:51.191\nAnd what kind of data might we be\ninterested in that would also be part of\n\n240\n00:11:51.191 --> 00:11:52.770\nwhat we would see here?\n\n241\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.210\nAnd you could see we\nhave our test frequency.\n\n242\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.730\nWe have the ability to specify our\ntimeout values, things like that.\n\n243\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.630\nWe will then look at our alerts.\n\n244\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.420\nSo for this one, by default, we have\na request status code, generate, or\n\n245\n00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.620\nrather, greater than or\nequal to anything that's 400 or above.\n\n246\n00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.975\nMeaning, error codes that come\nback in the http language stack,\n\n247\n00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:15.052\nwe've got different numbers, right?\n\n248\n00:12:15.052 --> 00:12:19.549\nA 404 error, page not found,\neverybody usually familiar with that, 200,\n\n249\n00:12:19.549 --> 00:12:23.200\n300, 400, so all these different codes.\n\n250\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.133\nWe could search for\nin the monitoring stream and\n\n251\n00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:29.887\nthen pull that data specific to\nerror codes or status codes.\n\n252\n00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:32.649\nProper way of referring to them,\ncuz not of them imply errors.\n\n253\n00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:34.090\nIn fact, most of them do not, but\n\n254\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.740\na subset of the status codes\nhappen to deal with errors.\n\n255\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.015\nSo bad to me for\ntalking about it that way.\n\n256\n00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:40.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I should actually be referring to it as\n\n257\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.640\na status code.\n\n258\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.310\nSo the status codes can be queried\nas part of our monitoring.\n\n259\n00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.650\nAnd we can go in here and\nthrough just a simple string and\n\n260\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.180\na boolean thought process say\ngreater than or equal to, equal to,\n\n261\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.080\nnot equal to etc, specify a number here.\n\n262\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.906\nIf we do have our own custom\ncodes that we have included in\n\n263\n00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:04.332\nour web servers,\na lot of developers will do that.\n\n264\n00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:07.751\nWe just have to know what they are in\nterms of the number sequence and\n\n265\n00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:11.258\nthen specify the monitor to be at\nthat level or above to return them.\n\n266\n00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:14.180\nIf we wanna be able to see evidence\nof them in the data stream.\n\n267\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.135\nSo we could do that as well.\n\n268\n00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:16.458\n&gt;&gt; So, Adam, would we wanna,\n\n269\n00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:19.832\nit just seems like I wouldn't want\nto know about every single instance.\n\n270\n00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:23.440\nMaybe a not at\nthe particular notification.\n\n271\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.765\nAnd I wouldn't wanna have an extreme and\nhave to sift through and\n\n272\n00:13:25.765 --> 00:13:26.720\nfind the important ones.\n\n273\n00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.079\nIs there a way to triage these alerts?\n\n274\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.520\nWell you would want to get multiple\ninstances if they refer to\n\n275\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.460\ndifferent activities.\n\n276\n00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.080\nSo there may very well be\nlegitimate reasons why we\n\n277\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.110\nwould want to see multiple\noccurrences of a code.\n\n278\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.800\nUser hits a page five\ntimes in five minutes and\n\n279\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.180\nit's not coming up, we'd want to\nget that repetition and know that.\n\n280\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:46.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we'd wanna\n\n281\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.580\nknow there's a service outage versus\nI hit it once and didn't come up, and\n\n282\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.340\nthen we don't know if it actually ever\ndid or not, in other words, right?\n\n283\n00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.250\nSo we would potentially wanna\nknow that things are happening.\n\n284\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.540\nWe can filter, but\n\n285\n00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.697\nthere usually is a mindset that we wanna\nsee iterations as we're monitoring\n\n286\n00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:07.789\nto tell us whether multiple users from\ndifferent places in these streams.\n\n287\n00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:11.312\nIn other words, if we're doing\noutside monitoring with GSM and\n\n288\n00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:16.090\nwe're monitoring from different watcher\nnodes in Ireland, in Brazil and wherever.\n\n289\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.187\n&gt;&gt; So you can isolate burn issue, maybe?\n\n290\n00:14:18.187 --> 00:14:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Certain pathways may be functional, but\nothers may not be right to your point.\n\n291\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.410\nAnd so we would want to see iterations\nof that help us fine tune the data and\n\n292\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.830\nmake it more valuable so.\n\n293\n00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.640\nWe would probably\nactually want to be doing\n\n294\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.640\nthat as opposed to filtering out for it.\n\n295\n00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.500\nWe could see here content match.\n\n296\n00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.540\nSo we could actually content match.\n\n297\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.310\nDoes not contain or does contain,\nequal to, less than, wild card, etc.\n\n298\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.630\nAnd we can actually say if it\ncontains this in the stream, tell us.\n\n299\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.820\nSo we could be looking for a word.\n\n300\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.807\nWe could be looking for a URL.\n\n301\n00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:50.589\nI mean, there's just sort of all stuff\npotentially that we could do here in\n\n302\n00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.510\nthe request for the base page.\n\n303\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.340\nCheck for redirects, right?\n\n304\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.620\nSo if we're being bounced to a URL, and\n\n305\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.950\nthen bounced again to another URL,\nthrough redirect.\n\n306\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.310\nWe wanna to check for that.\n\n307\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.710\nWe could select all, or\nspecify the criteria that we wanna use for\n\n308\n00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.990\nmanaging health state.\n\n309\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.890\nThis top one here,\nis all about error states for alerts.\n\n310\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.630\nDown here, same idea for\nwarning state for health.\n\n311\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.570\nIs the health of the system degrading,\nor is it running the right way?\n\n312\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.830\nSo we could be looking at all this.\n\n313\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.310\nIn addition, as we scroll down here.\n\n314\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.130\nWe could specify the number of consecutive\ntimes the criteria would be generated.\n\n315\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.090\nSo as you were saying,\nyeah we could filter it as you asked.\n\n316\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.230\nYou just have a little\nbox there with a number,\n\n317\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.160\nyou specify how many consecutive\ntimes you want to see that.\n\n318\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.930\nWe may, as I suggest,\nI wanna see multiple iterations.\n\n319\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.480\nBut Cherokee's point, we could\neasily filter that if we wanted to.\n\n320\n00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.640\nAnd then we can go ahead and we can\ndo performance collection down here.\n\n321\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.385\nAnd you'll see that we could look at\nresponse times as I was suggesting,\n\n322\n00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.774\nwhat's the inbound and outbound and\nthe performance on that?\n\n323\n00:15:48.774 --> 00:15:53.284\nAnd we could look at values\nassociated with that DNS resolution,\n\n324\n00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:57.392\ntest time, round trip time,\nTCP, things of that nature.\n\n325\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:01.876\nWe also look at allowing redirects and\nspecifying HTTP version.\n\n326\n00:16:01.876 --> 00:16:07.129\nSo are we doing version 5,\nversion 1.1, or I'm thinking HTML.\n\n327\n00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:09.136\nI'm thinking HTML, not HTTP.\n\n328\n00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:13.020\n1.0 or 1.1 is what I meant to say on HTTP.\n\n329\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.840\nWe can look at the HTTP method GET, HEAD,\nPOST, and program in information for\n\n330\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.860\neach of those.\n\n331\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.620\nAnd then we also have information\nthat we could specify down here\n\n332\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.300\nabout the HTTP headers.\n\n333\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.870\nAnd how we're gonna deal with them and\nwhat headers we wanna see.\n\n334\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.100\nThis is very detailed, very,\nvery detailed diagnostics, in here, right?\n\n335\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.110\nSo it's interesting that we have the\nability to really detail out and spec out\n\n336\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.870\nalmost every aspect of the interaction\nacross the web server divide here.\n\n337\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.215\nFrom the monitor, the watcher node\nto the web server and back, and\n\n338\n00:16:44.215 --> 00:16:45.725\nthen draw down all that data.\n\n339\n00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:48.146\nSo this is actually a really, really, and\n\n340\n00:16:48.146 --> 00:16:51.661\nI'm gonna use a highly technical\nterm here, right, nifty.\n\n341\n00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:55.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is a very nifty feature that we\n\n342\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.944\nhave.\n\n343\n00:16:55.944 --> 00:16:59.446\nSo it is really kinda cool that\nwe have the ability to do GSM,\n\n344\n00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:01.558\nglobal service monitoring, now.\n\n345\n00:17:01.558 --> 00:17:05.945\nBecause this is one of the big competitive\nlandscape points for Microsoft and\n\n346\n00:17:05.945 --> 00:17:09.135\nthe System Center stack and\nthe Ops Manager stack.\n\n347\n00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:10.620\nThere's a lot of other products.\n\n348\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.810\nYou've heard me talk about\nthem in some other episodes,\n\n349\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.940\nin other areas in the show.\n\n350\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.540\nThings like HP OpenView, IBM Tivoli,\nSolarWinds, the Orion product.\n\n351\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.160\nAll sorts of different products out\nthere that essentially do this and\n\n352\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.620\nspecialize in doing this.\n\n353\n00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.930\nAnd we do it too, and we do it very well.\n\n354\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.130\nSo being able to delve into this feature\na little bit and see it is helpful,\n\n355\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.900\nespecially if you haven't really\nhad to set this up yourself or\n\n356\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.820\ndon't understand the capabilities of this.\n\n357\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.930\nThis is really, under the hood, a very\nvaluable set of tasks that we can run and\n\n358\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.809\nvery valuable information we\ncan get back as a result.\n\n359\n00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:44.466\nSo we're gonna finish out here,\nwe're gonna leave this here.\n\n360\n00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:46.022\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n361\n00:17:46.022 --> 00:17:48.030\nWe're then just gonna\nget our summary screen.\n\n362\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.774\nAs I've told you in other episodes,\nI'll remind you of this here.\n\n363\n00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:54.408\nIt's always a good idea to capture\nthe information on the summary screen for\n\n364\n00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.732\ndocumentation purposes.\n\n365\n00:17:55.732 --> 00:17:59.630\nA screen capture, a picture, do a little\nselfie, do one of these with the camera.\n\n366\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right there.\n\n367\n00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:03.530\nI could actually do it face-on,\nbecause I'm standing there.\n\n368\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.100\nSo we'll just pretend to take a picture.\n\n369\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.656\nLet me get it in frame, click, right?\n\n370\n00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:11.138\nSo you have that, and then with that you\ncan put that into your documentation.\n\n371\n00:18:11.138 --> 00:18:14.896\nSo you've got an exact reproduction of\nwhat the settings were when you configured\n\n372\n00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:15.540\nthis thing.\n\n373\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.007\nVery important for you to think about\nthat, and make sure you're doing that.\n\n374\n00:18:18.007 --> 00:18:19.818\nWe're gonna click Create.\n\n375\n00:18:19.818 --> 00:18:22.198\nGive that just a minute to come up.\n\n376\n00:18:22.198 --> 00:18:26.773\nAnd then when this is done, we'll have our\nmonitor, it will show up and we'll, again,\n\n377\n00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.972\nwe may have to refresh\nto get it to be there.\n\n378\n00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:30.179\nBut trust me it will be there.\n\n379\n00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:32.536\nBut we can go in and\nwe'll have this available.\n\n380\n00:18:32.536 --> 00:18:37.076\nAnd we'll just go ahead and we'll refresh\nhere real quick to get this in there.\n\n381\n00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:38.433\nJust give it a second.\n\n382\n00:18:38.433 --> 00:18:43.310\nAnd then once we do that, there we go,\nthere's our web monitor right there,\n\n383\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.620\nthen we will have it available.\n\n384\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.480\nAnd then we'll be able to go ahead and\ndeploy this and actually use this, right?\n\n385\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.167\nSo [COUGH] this will then allow\nus to be able to go in and\n\n386\n00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.825\nultimately check our web status, right?\n\n387\n00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:57.195\nWe'll be able to go in and\n\n388\n00:18:57.195 --> 00:19:01.035\nwe'll be able to go to Monitoring\nup under the web application.\n\n389\n00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:03.570\nSo we'll transition over here,\nsee the output of this,\n\n390\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.535\nessentially see where it goes live.\n\n391\n00:19:05.535 --> 00:19:07.765\nWe go in here,\nwe'll go into Application Monitoring.\n\n392\n00:19:07.765 --> 00:19:12.494\nWe went in here when we were doing\nthe setup in the .NET framework\n\n393\n00:19:12.494 --> 00:19:15.305\ntransaction template and doing APM.\n\n394\n00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:17.731\nWe went in and showed you what\nthe output would look like here.\n\n395\n00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:19.147\nIt's gonna be the same idea.\n\n396\n00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:23.320\nWe're gonna go up under web applications,\nso let's scroll down here real quick.\n\n397\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.100\nAnd we've got our\nWeb Application Availability Monitoring.\n\n398\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.290\nWe did our .NET Monitoring last time.\n\n399\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.891\nAnd you'll see we can go in under\nWeb Application Status, and eventually,\n\n400\n00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:33.478\nwe'll get our status to update.\n\n401\n00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:35.786\nAnd then remember,\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n402\n00:19:35.786 --> 00:19:40.920\nI preloaded the application when we did\nthe .NET application monitoring demo.\n\n403\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.073\nSo, we actually had it run for about\n20 minutes behind the scenes before we\n\n404\n00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:45.859\nactually brought it out and showed it you.\n\n405\n00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:48.662\nSo, you actually would be\nable to see some status but\n\n406\n00:19:48.662 --> 00:19:50.712\neventually we will get a status here.\n\n407\n00:19:50.712 --> 00:19:53.975\nWe'll be able to see the state\ntest status as well.\n\n408\n00:19:53.975 --> 00:19:57.093\nIf there are any active alerts,\nwe won't have anything right now but\n\n409\n00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.190\neventually if we do have anything,\nwe'll be able to see them.\n\n410\n00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.080\nBut over time, we will be able\nto get this up and running and\n\n411\n00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.690\nit will show up and\nwe will see our application running there.\n\n412\n00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.230\nOur web application status will show up.\n\n413\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.780\nHopefully it will show up as healthy\nonce it spins up and starts running.\n\n414\n00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.514\nAnd then once we have that up and\nrunning, we're able to go in and\n\n415\n00:20:17.514 --> 00:20:21.613\nlook at the diagram view on it if we\nchoose to, so we actually can go in.\n\n416\n00:20:21.613 --> 00:20:25.043\nAnd we can, let me see if we\ncan refresh one more time,\n\n417\n00:20:25.043 --> 00:20:27.037\nsee if we can get that in there.\n\n418\n00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:29.108\nSee the web app monitor starting to build,\nbut\n\n419\n00:20:29.108 --> 00:20:32.203\nit's gonna take time to come online and\nactually be available to us.\n\n420\n00:20:32.203 --> 00:20:35.882\nBut in the meantime, what we can do\nbecause we at least have it up and\n\n421\n00:20:35.882 --> 00:20:37.855\nrunning now since it's out there,\n\n422\n00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:40.967\nwe can even go over here to\nthe right do our diagram view.\n\n423\n00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.034\nI wanna show the diagram view in the .NET.\n\n424\n00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.543\nAPM monitor will remember you.\n\n425\n00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:45.449\nYou were pretty excited about that.\n\n426\n00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:46.087\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n427\n00:20:46.087 --> 00:20:47.109\n&gt;&gt; That was the interactive diagram.\n\n428\n00:20:47.109 --> 00:20:48.351\nWe'll show that again right here.\n\n429\n00:20:48.351 --> 00:20:49.540\nSame idea.\n\n430\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.588\nThis is one of the benefits we get\nfrom linking this to our default\n\n431\n00:20:52.588 --> 00:20:53.497\nmanagement pack.\n\n432\n00:20:53.497 --> 00:20:55.880\nWe have all of these objects\nalready built out and\n\n433\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.499\nwe're then able to use them as we set\nup the monitor and start to deploy it.\n\n434\n00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:03.389\nSo all the objects from the management\npack like these views are then able or\n\n435\n00:21:03.389 --> 00:21:05.315\navailable to us to actually deploy.\n\n436\n00:21:05.315 --> 00:21:06.674\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Which is one of the values, right?\n\n437\n00:21:06.674 --> 00:21:07.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n438\n00:21:07.255 --> 00:21:09.310\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna right-click\nhere just to show this to you.\n\n439\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.000\nWe did do the health\nexplorer in our last demo.\n\n440\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.640\nI'm not gonna walk through\nthat whole thing again.\n\n441\n00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.580\nAnd we're not gonna have any data\nin the health explorer right now.\n\n442\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.200\nCuz we're still spinning up the monitor.\n\n443\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.940\nBut eventually we will get the ability to\nwalk through all the state changes and\n\n444\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.440\nlook at information about how healthy\nwe are over a period of time with\n\n445\n00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.040\nHealth Explorer.\n\n446\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.366\nSo that's gonna be very important for\nus to think about.\n\n447\n00:21:29.366 --> 00:21:31.595\nWe do have the ability to run our reports.\n\n448\n00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:34.546\nAnd by the way, these report tasks, could\nwe go full screen for a minute just so\n\n449\n00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:36.400\nwe can see what's behind my box there?\n\n450\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.979\nThese report tasks right here are the same\nones that are sitting over here, right?\n\n451\n00:21:39.979 --> 00:21:41.639\nSo we don't have to right-click and do it.\n\n452\n00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:42.452\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE].\n\n453\n00:21:42.452 --> 00:21:44.867\n&gt;&gt; Same way to get to it, it's just\na matter of where you wanna see them from.\n\n454\n00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n455\n00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:48.431\n&gt;&gt; But all of this stuff here\nis the same as over here.\n\n456\n00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:50.825\nAnd if we go to Navigation and\nsee the views,\n\n457\n00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:55.165\nall those views right there are the same\nas these views right here, right?\n\n458\n00:21:55.165 --> 00:21:57.030\nSo let me just refresh one more time,\n\n459\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.291\nsee if we have another status\nupdate before we do anything else.\n\n460\n00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:02.427\nIt's starting to go,\nwent from gray to green.\n\n461\n00:22:02.427 --> 00:22:04.946\nYou may not be able to see that but\nthe circle's now green,\n\n462\n00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:06.444\nwhich means it's initializing.\n\n463\n00:22:06.444 --> 00:22:07.771\nSo we're getting data.\n\n464\n00:22:07.771 --> 00:22:10.151\nEventually, we'll get a green\ncheck there that says healthy.\n\n465\n00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:13.663\nBut we can go in and\nwe could do our diagram view and\n\n466\n00:22:13.663 --> 00:22:17.860\nwhen we do this,\nwe will then see our Web App Monitor.\n\n467\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.270\nAnd we've got our interactive diagram.\n\n468\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.480\nThere's no status there yet cuz again,\nthe monitor's still spinning up.\n\n469\n00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.929\nBut over time,\nwe will be able to go in and see.\n\n470\n00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.634\nAnd we saw the green status\ngo on the circle there.\n\n471\n00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:33.077\nThe top circle, one's a green,\nas I said a moment ago,\n\n472\n00:22:33.077 --> 00:22:35.800\nshows us that the monitor is initializing.\n\n473\n00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.010\nIt's not healthy or unhealthy yet,\nit's just turning on.\n\n474\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.927\nBut this stuff, once you deploy it, takes\nabout 20 to 30 minutes, maybe even longer\n\n475\n00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:45.029\ndepending on what kind of monitoring\nyou're doing, to come online.\n\n476\n00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:46.410\nSo you do have to be patient.\n\n477\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.525\nIt's not gonna happen right away.\n\n478\n00:22:47.525 --> 00:22:50.243\nAnd it will not happen [LAUGH]\nduring the course of our demo fully.\n\n479\n00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:52.658\nWe're just showing you the outline\nof how to set this up.\n\n480\n00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.724\nBut over time, this will come online.\n\n481\n00:22:54.724 --> 00:22:57.882\nAnd over time,\nwe then will be able to monitor.\n\n482\n00:22:57.882 --> 00:23:01.386\nAnd if you look, you'll see we\nhave MSN there, we have ITProTV,\n\n483\n00:23:01.386 --> 00:23:04.147\nevery one of your URLs is\nset up at its own instance.\n\n484\n00:23:04.147 --> 00:23:06.536\nWe have our Web App Monitor\ninformation and\n\n485\n00:23:06.536 --> 00:23:09.929\nall this essentially will now\nbe monitored and come online.\n\n486\n00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:14.530\nWe'll be able to see the status of it and\ninteract with it along the way, okay?\n\n487\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, folks, there you have it.\n\n488\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.720\nWeb application availability monitoring\nbrought to you by the distinguished\n\n489\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.460\nAdam Gordon.\n\n490\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.820\nSo thank you so much,\nAdam, for being here today.\n\n491\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.640\nAnd thank you, ladies and\n\n492\n00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.350\ngentlemen, for turning in, but stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n493\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.500\nFor this show, I'll go ahead and\nsign out as your host.\n\n494\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.110\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n495\n00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.280\n&gt;&gt; I'm the distinguished Adam Gordon,\napparently.\n\n496\n00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.342\nBut it's always a pleasure to be with you,\nnonetheless.\n\n497\n00:23:35.342 --> 00:23:37.083\nTake care everybody,\ncome back and see us soon.\n\n498\n00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.136\n&gt;&gt; Bye.\n\n499\n00:23:39.136 -->

Adam.\n\n8\n00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.970\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n9\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n10\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.490\nSo we're gonna continue our conversations\naround showing you different aspects of\n\n11\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.810\nthe system center ops manager capabilities\nfor monitoring application health.\n\n12\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.010\nWe've taken a look at APM,\nwe've talked about inside out and\n\n13\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.810\noutside in transaction monitoring\nwith global service monitoring.\n\n14\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.880\nWe've taken a look at and talked about how\nto deal with event notifications, alert\n\n15\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.970\nnotifications, how we do run as accounts,\nrun as profiles and deal with that.\n\n16\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.010\nWe're gonna now put the Capstone in place,\ntalk about distributed applications.\n\n17\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.530\nHow we can diagram out or\nessentially create a reference for\n\n18\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.910\nour application stack and\nthen monitor against that stack.\n\n19\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.390\nSo, we're gonna start off in\nthe console take a look here,\n\n20\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.190\nif you don't mind joining me.\n\n21\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.240\nOver here in the left wing of\nthe ITPro.TV demo environment.\n\n22\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990\nI've already gone ahead and\ncreated an app we can just look at first,\n\n23\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.680\njust to show you some things.\n\n24\n00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.170\nWe'll then go ahead and go back and\n\n25\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.210\nshow you how to create this using\nDistributed Application Wizard.\n\n26\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.690\nBut we call this up,\nDistributed App ITPro.TV Test App 1.\n\n27\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.730\nYou can see we've opened up or\nexploded out our diagram.\n\n28\n00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.540\nThis is like that network diagram\nview that we've looked at\n\n29\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.105\nin some of the other episodes where we've\nlooked at the health status monitoring and\n\n30\n00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:36.150\nthe update in real time\naround those elements.\n\n31\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.230\nAnd this is gonna be the same idea,\nand we'll see underneath here,\n\n32\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.040\nI've added in two elements,\none that's called All Computers.\n\n33\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.710\nAnd I have all Windows computers\nas objects listed here\n\n34\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.240\nthat I can monitor for.\n\n35\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.080\nI've an object called Server and\n\n36\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.930\nI've added a specific instance\nof a Window Server here.\n\n37\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.090\nAnd when I hover, which you'll notice is,\nwe get a pop out, and what I'll select is,\n\n38\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.600\nthat information will show up at\nthe bottom pane in just a minute.\n\n39\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.560\nBut I get a pop out hover, indicates\nthat I wanna know some information and\n\n40\n00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.320\nwhen I do that, if I can get to do that\nagain, I get this nice little pop out box\n\n41\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.350\nthat gives me all the information\nabout the object in question.\n\n42\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.880\nBut it's only there for about ten seconds.\n\n43\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.490\nIt's hard to read.\n\n44\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.620\nSo, if you highlight that,\nall that information shows up down here in\n\n45\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.320\nthe lower third and we could see the name,\nthe display name, principal name, DNS,\n\n46\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.520\nthen the BiOS name, the IP address, all\nthe information about this object is here.\n\n47\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.320\nThe network name,\n\n48\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.880\nwe have the Active Directory\ninformation if it's domain joined,\n\n49\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.450\nwe have the number of logical processors\nand physical processors available here.\n\n50\n00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.820\nWe have quite a bit of information\nif it is a virtual machine.\n\n51\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.840\nWe can tell that it's a virtual machine.\n\n52\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.460\nAll that stuff would be available to us.\n\n53\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.380\nSo all of that is here.\n\n54\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.640\nIn addition, on these diagrams,\nthey are fully interactive.\n\n55\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.490\nWe can go in we can open up any of the\nviews on, can we got full screen just so\n\n56\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.690\nyou can see this is a pops out because\nit's kinda hidden behind me a little bit\n\n57\n00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.790\nthere and I didn't bring my\ncloak of invisibility today,\n\n58\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.572\nwith me\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:06.302\n&gt;&gt; So it's hard for\n\n60\n00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.840\nme to disappear out of that\nbox while your taking a look.\n\n61\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Maybe next time Adam.\n\n62\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps next time when I'm\nfeeling more like Harry Potter\n\n63\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.635\nkind of mood as opposed to my bright\neffervescent pink mood that I'm in today.\n\n64\n00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you'll see Alert View,\n\n65\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.800\nEvent View, Performance View,\nDiagram View.\n\n66\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.790\nThese views can be opened to response\nspecific to the object in the diagram and\n\n67\n00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.880\nany of these stages would allow to be able\nto click an access the information for\n\n68\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.520\nthat, so you'll see that.\n\n69\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.700\nWe have our instance properties, Health\nExplorer, we've talked about that before,\n\n70\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.840\nthe importance of the ops manager shelf,\nyou could see that or\n\n71\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.250\nwe could interact with that here.\n\n72\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.360\nAnd you'll see we could\nstart maintenance mode and\n\n73\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.090\nwe could actually put this machine into\nmaintenance mode and to work on it.\n\n74\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.670\nNow we could do the same\nthing right over here, and\n\n75\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.920\nthen out far on the right we have\naccess to all of those options.\n\n76\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.020\nWe could use this information, or\nthis set of Windows computer tasks.\n\n77\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.610\nRight down here for instance to be\nable to go in, open Computer Manager,\n\n78\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.800\nping the computer perhaps to\na remote desktop out to it, right?\n\n79\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.710\nSo there's all this different\nstuff that we could do.\n\n80\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.950\nIf we use one of these tasks you'll notice\nI'm able to open Computer Management\n\n81\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.060\nagainst the system immediately as\nlong as the system's online and\n\n82\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.030\navailable of course.\n\n83\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.160\nAnd I could do that, so\n\n84\n00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.910\nyou can see that I'm able to\nuse the tasks off to the right.\n\n85\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.940\nInteract with elements in\nthis diagram in realtime,\n\n86\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.970\nwhich is incredibly important for us.\n\n87\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.020\nCuz we don't have to go into five or\n\n88\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.560\nsix different screens to do\nadministration based on health status.\n\n89\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.480\nWe could do it right from within\nthe distributed app diagram itself,\n\n90\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.920\nwhich makes a lot of sense\nwhen you think about it.\n\n91\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.260\nSo we could see that.\n\n92\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.500\nAnd we could obviously execute any\nof these tasks depending on what\n\n93\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.560\nwe're looking for.\n\n94\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.410\nNow as we scroll down,\n\n95\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.950\nwe continue to see, I only opened\nup one area here under the server.\n\n96\n00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.710\nI could do the same thing under\nall Windows computers, but\n\n97\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.050\nI'll see that we have some\nstuff that's healthy, so\n\n98\n00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.100\nI could open this up,\nit'll tell us what is healthy here.\n\n99\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.740\nAll these things on the server\nare healthy elements.\n\n100\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.890\nI can look at, just bring that back up,\nthings that are not monitored.\n\n101\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.900\nSo what is currently not being monitored?\n\n102\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.510\nI can see whatever is not being monitored.\n\n103\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.840\nAnd I would see the status of those.\n\n104\n00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.400\nAnd if there's anything\nin a warning state,\n\n105\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.160\nI could see what's in a warning state.\n\n106\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.200\nAnd I could see that maybe our database\ninstance is in a warning stance for\n\n107\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.670\ninstance, hypothetically, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n108\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.170\nMay be a service or\nsomething like that, and\n\n109\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.980\nI could get more information\ndepending on what's happening.\n\n110\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.015\nI can refresh in any area,\nit has to redraw,\n\n111\n00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.970\nre-render the diagram,\nbring me back in updating it.\n\n112\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.890\nSo I can do that, it takes just a moment\nas you can see, it comes back up and\n\n113\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.170\nthen I could delve in and\ncontinue to see if there's any updates.\n\n114\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.840\nSo the application, or distribute\napplication diagram, is very valuable for\n\n115\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.460\nus because it allows us to\nbring up an application\n\n116\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.920\nthat has been put into the system.\n\n117\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.030\nHere you can see when\nwe close the diagrams,\n\n118\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.480\ngo back to the monitoring screen\nyou can see that under authoring.\n\n119\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.140\nAs we use our distributed application\narea and we create our applications,\n\n120\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.920\nthis is the one that I\npreloaded before we came on,\n\n121\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.380\nto do the demo just to\nshow you the output.\n\n122\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.620\nThat once it's there and created we then\ncan simply go in, it's very simple to do.\n\n123\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.440\nRight click and just view diagram.\n\n124\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.380\nThat's what I was doing just now and\nthat's what we were seeing.\n\n125\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.130\nWe could view state as well,\nright click and view state.\n\n126\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.960\nGive us just a second.\n\n127\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.850\nWe can go in and see our state monitor.\n\n128\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.910\nWe've looked at our state monitor\nbefore in some of the other demos,\n\n129\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.400\nwe've seen the value of\nunderstanding what the state is.\n\n130\n00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.810\nWe could see the state in\nany of these categories.\n\n131\n00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.640\nAre we up to date with software updates?\n\n132\n00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.390\nIs our APM or application\nperformance monitoring taking place,\n\n133\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.750\nall the different things that are here,\n\n134\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.440\nand you'll see that there is quite\na number of them as we scroll over, right?\n\n135\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.630\nJust going by there, right,\n\n136\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.210\nlook at all that stuff that potentially\nwe can monitor for and tell the state of.\n\n137\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.400\nAnd I'm just gonna keep going\nuntil either we run out of room,\n\n138\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.675\nI run out of things to say.\n\n139\n00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:50.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or you get so\n\n140\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.930\ndizzy that you go like this and\nfall out of your chair.\n\n141\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.700\nBut you can see all the different stuff.\n\n142\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.810\n&gt;&gt; That's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; That potentially is being monitored for\n\n143\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.120\nhere, because and\nwe're not even halfway through yet.\n\n144\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.030\nI mean,\nlook at the slider on the bottom, right?\n\n145\n00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.160\nWe're approaching halfway right now.\n\n146\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.760\nAnd I've already actually shaved and\nchanged my shirt twice and\n\n147\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.405\nwe're still going.\n\n148\n00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:08.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n149\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.480\nyou could see that this is pulling\ndown all of this information.\n\n150\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.280\nEvery aspect of all the information\nassociated with the management packs and\n\n151\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.780\neverything we can be looking for.\n\n152\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.720\nNow clearly we're not monitoring for\nmost of this.\n\n153\n00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.540\nMost of it is just essentially there.\n\n154\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.720\n&gt;&gt; Available.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm available but\n\n155\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.580\nI'm not really monitoring for it yet.\n\n156\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.010\nBut the point is you could\nsee that I have hundreds\n\n157\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.380\nof items that could be looked at for\nstate.\n\n158\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.440\nRight now we're just looking at the fact\nthat we're in a warning state generically,\n\n159\n00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.380\nwe don't really know why.\n\n160\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.660\nBut we know that we can go in, and\n\n161\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.980\nwe can open up any of our views\nhere to get a better sense of that.\n\n162\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.580\nWe also know that we can open\nup our Health Explorer, and\n\n163\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.700\nbegin to look at state transition, or\nchanges, and see what's happening when.\n\n164\n00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.720\nAnd then we're backwards to\nfigure out what may be going on.\n\n165\n00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.520\nWe may want to do a quick look and\nsee if there's any alerts.\n\n166\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.532\nSo maybe we'll just do a quick alert view.\n\n167\n00:07:59.532 --> 00:08:03.172\nWe'll see there are some alerts here that\nmay be leading to some of the concern that\n\n168\n00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:03.927\nwe're seeing.\n\n169\n00:08:03.927 --> 00:08:05.156\nBut we can see what they are.\n\n170\n00:08:05.156 --> 00:08:07.343\nPowerShell scripts fail to run.\n\n171\n00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:08.716\nMay or may not be important.\n\n172\n00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:11.463\nWe can take a look and see that,\n\n173\n00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:16.500\nAPM .NET server side\nconfiguration error conflicts.\n\n174\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.940\nSo something was setting up APM.\n\n175\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.840\nMay have been the problem.\n\n176\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.040\nIt looks like IIS needs to be restarted.\n\n177\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.720\nThat will be from one of our prior demos,\nwhere I didn't bother to restart IIS.\n\n178\n00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.080\nI just continued to do some stuff and\nconfigure it.\n\n179\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.670\nSo we can see there is evidence of things\ngoing on in the system, but that's okay.\n\n180\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.430\nWe can at least now tell what they are.\n\n181\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.220\nAnd if we needed to delve in to one\nof them in more detail, we can go in,\n\n182\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.360\nwe can click on it.\n\n183\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.680\nWe could see down here, that we get\nthe information about the alert.\n\n184\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.040\nWe can see we have\nthe Alert Description down here.\n\n185\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.275\nWhat machine it came from,\nif there is a action that is required,\n\n186\n00:08:47.275 --> 00:08:48.715\nit shows us what it is.\n\n187\n00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:50.385\nOver here, as we scroll down,\n\n188\n00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:54.285\nwe could see that there may be\nadditional details in the alert summary.\n\n189\n00:08:54.285 --> 00:08:56.665\nOr in the error summary,\nthat we may want to take a look at.\n\n190\n00:08:56.665 --> 00:09:00.375\nSo it's very detailed information,\nwith regards to performance monitoring,\n\n191\n00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.415\nthat the system will\ngive us in the console.\n\n192\n00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:03.545\nBut we've gotta know where to go.\n\n193\n00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:04.655\nIn order to find it,\n\n194\n00:09:04.655 --> 00:09:07.920\nwe've gotta be able to follow\nthe breadcrumb trail, essentially.\n\n195\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.110\nThat we have from console to console,\nwindow.\n\n196\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.300\nTo be able to see what we're having\nto figure out as administrators and\n\n197\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.770\nwhat may be impactful to us.\n\n198\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.260\nSo, we better understand it,\nvery powerful tool.\n\n199\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.010\nLots and lots of things going on, and\nlots of information that, whoops,\n\n200\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.690\nthat we can interact with.\n\n201\n00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.630\nI did click, lots of things going on\nthat we can interact with in there.\n\n202\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.330\nSo what I want to do is show you how to\ncreate this distributed application view.\n\n203\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.290\nSo we're gonna do that right now.\n\n204\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.870\nWe're gonna right-click on\nthe distributed application item.\n\n205\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.260\nNotice we are in the authoring work space,\nwe are up under authoring.\n\n206\n00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.490\nWe've been through\nthe management pack templates.\n\n207\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.530\nDone a couple of different things there,\nwe're gonna take a different tact here.\n\n208\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.481\nDo distributed applications, right-click,\ncreate a new distributed app.\n\n209\n00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:51.150\nGet a little wizard that shows up,\npretty straightforward.\n\n210\n00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.450\nWe're gonna name this one for\nmy lovely co-host over there, Cherokee.\n\n211\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.760\nAnd we're gonna say that this will\nbe called Cherokee App, right?\n\n212\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.620\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; So that we get those three P's.\n\n213\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.460\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for that.\n\n214\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.134\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for that.\n\n215\n00:10:04.134 --> 00:10:05.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for Cherokee,\n\n216\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.480\nCherokee App 1, okay?\n\n217\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.070\nAnd we have some templates\nhere that we can choose.\n\n218\n00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.420\nWe have a .NET three-tier application.\n\n219\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.830\nSo, if the Cherokee App was a .NET app.\n\n220\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.960\nWe would choose that to be able\nto represent the different\n\n221\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.280\nfunctionality levels in a .NET app.\n\n222\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.510\nWith a two or a three-tier solution.\n\n223\n00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.470\nWe may do a blank advance,\nwhich is just a blank template.\n\n224\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.190\nThat's the one I'll do.\n\n225\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.930\nWe can pull out and essentially,\ncreate components, and then join them and\n\n226\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.650\ncreate a connection.\n\n227\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.010\nI'll show you how to do that.\n\n228\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.030\nWe could do a messaging one,\nwe could do a line of business web app.\n\n229\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:42.120\nSo every template has information specific\nto it, and a specific way of diagraming.\n\n230\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.560\nThe application we're gonna look at.\n\n231\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.770\nAnd if you're not familiar with it,\nhighlight the appropriate one.\n\n232\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.410\nYou'll get a little description here.\n\n233\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.490\nYou can view the details of it.\n\n234\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.560\nGo in, it brings up purpose and feature.\n\n235\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.260\nGives you a little bit more information\nabout what the template does,\n\n236\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.520\nwhat you're able to do.\n\n237\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.080\nYou'll show things like websites and\n\n238\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.620\ndatabase objects,\nif you do the line of business web app.\n\n239\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.090\nVersus a messaging app,\nwhere we'll go in and\n\n240\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.290\nwe'll be able to see all of\nthe messaging components.\n\n241\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.700\nLike exchange, mail stores,\nDNS infrastructure, right?\n\n242\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.940\nPretty standard messaging platform stuff.\n\n243\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.230\nWe'll be able to diagram that out.\n\n244\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.860\nSo, it's a question of what back-end\napplication we're representing.\n\n245\n00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.700\nRemember, we're not creating\nthe application here.\n\n246\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.470\nWe're creating a representation\nof an existing app,\n\n247\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.290\nnot the real app itself, right?\n\n248\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.820\nWe're not about to create a messaging\nsystem if we choose Messaging Template.\n\n249\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.354\nWe're gonna represent the messaging\napplication that already exists,\n\n250\n00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:35.497\nthat we wanna monitor.\n\n251\n00:11:35.497 --> 00:11:39.810\nAnd this is gonna give us a structure,\nand the objects that will be populated.\n\n252\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.777\nIn order to be able to do that,\nif you've never used Visio, for instance.\n\n253\n00:11:42.777 --> 00:11:45.810\nAnd done any work in Visio,\nto create a network diagram of some kind.\n\n254\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.350\nOr if you've built workflows in either\nVisio or SharePoint Designer or\n\n255\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.404\nVisual Studio for SharePoint.\n\n256\n00:11:52.404 --> 00:11:55.765\nOr any of those kind of thought processes.\n\n257\n00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:59.204\nIf you've used SQL Server Reporting\nServices' Report Resign or\n\n258\n00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:00.402\nReport Builder tool.\n\n259\n00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:04.010\nTo be able to build those objects,\nyou're using some sort of a grid, and\n\n260\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.380\nyou're creating shapes.\n\n261\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.836\nOr using pre-determined shapes,\nto represent items, objects,\n\n262\n00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:11.155\nfunctionalities, services, etc.\n\n263\n00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:12.998\nAnd that's what we're doing here,\nthat's all were doing.\n\n264\n00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.872\nSo we are not actually creating the app,\n\n265\n00:12:14.872 --> 00:12:17.755\nwe're creating a visual\nrepresentation of an existing app.\n\n266\n00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.800\nThat we then want to monitor,\njust to be clear, okay?\n\n267\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.290\nAnd we're gonna bind objects to it,\nso that obviously,\n\n268\n00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.180\nthen, they represent\nwhat we want to monitor.\n\n269\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.080\nI'm gonna show you how to do that.\n\n270\n00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.674\nWe'll do our Blank Advanced.\n\n271\n00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:30.720\nWe'll select our management pack.\n\n272\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.050\nWe've talked about the importance\nof selecting a management pack.\n\n273\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.960\nHaving the objects available that come in,\nas a result of that.\n\n274\n00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.130\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n275\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.780\nAnd then we get our designer, right?\n\n276\n00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.210\nThis is the page where we're gonna\ngo out and actually lay this out.\n\n277\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.982\nCan we go full-screen?\n\n278\n00:12:44.982 --> 00:12:46.790\nCuz we're gonna need to be able\nto see everything as we go.\n\n279\n00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.370\nSo, Cherokee, you're gonna help\nme make some choices here,\n\n280\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.720\nwhile we are doing this.\n\n281\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.000\nLet's just go full-screen,\nfull-screen for real so we see the grid,\n\n282\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.540\nit's a little bit easier to work with.\n\n283\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.150\nSo we have, first of all,\nthe need to put some objects out here, and\n\n284\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.680\ncomponents out here on the screen.\n\n285\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.800\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nclick Add Component.\n\n286\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.930\nAnd when we do that, we're gonna\nget a little Add Component picker.\n\n287\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.980\nAnd we have to specify what\nwe wanna call the component.\n\n288\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.190\nAnd then we have to specify\nafter we call it something,\n\n289\n00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.730\na certain kind of object\nthat we're gonna bind to it.\n\n290\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, let's give our first\n\n291\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.990\ncomponent a name.\n\n292\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.150\nWhat do you wanna call the first\ncomponent for the Cherokee app?\n\n293\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.740\n&gt;&gt; How about fuchsia?\n\n294\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia?\n&gt;&gt; Cuz,\n\n295\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.150\nI'm seeing a lot of fuchsia right now.\n\n296\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.560\n&gt;&gt; I don't know how to spell fuchsia,\nso I'm gonna give it my best shot, and\n\n297\n00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.550\nI'm gonna say F-U-C-H-I-A,\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n298\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.360\nthink so,\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia,\n\n299\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.980\n&gt;&gt; And maybe there's an s in there?\n\n300\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.270\nPerhaps, but we're gonna go with that.\n\n301\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:41.788\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n302\n00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:42.330\n&gt;&gt; Fuchsia, or\n\n303\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.840\nfuchia, depending on how you choose\nto pronounce it, that may be nice.\n\n304\n00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.380\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; But you called it,\n\n305\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.330\nI didn't specify I had\nto be able to spell it.\n\n306\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.080\nSo bad for me, good for you.\n\n307\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.970\n&gt;&gt; I think Google has an operating system\nnamed Fuchsia out there right now.\n\n308\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.110\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, they know how to spell it.\n\n309\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.210\n&gt;&gt; They're on to something.\n\n310\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.080\n&gt;&gt; They are,\nhopefully they know how to spell it.\n\n311\n00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.040\nSo, we've got Fuchsia there, as our first\ncomponent, let's add one more component.\n\n312\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.580\nSo we have a couple that we can\nthen create a connection between,\n\n313\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.860\nthat we'll be able to interact with.\n\n314\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.090\nSo we're gonna click\nAdd Component one more time.\n\n315\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we'll just do that,\n\n316\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.920\nsame pick list, right.\n\n317\n00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.060\nThis time, you're gonna pick\nsomething I know how to spell, okay.\n\n318\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.800\n&gt;&gt; I know, I was thinking,\n\n319\n00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.680\nI was like I don't want it to\nsay something like chartreuse.\n\n320\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.656\nHow about just, we'll stick with colors,\nand go with green?\n\n321\n00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:22.061\nHow about that?\n\n322\n00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:25.049\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're gonna go with green.\n\n323\n00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:29.546\nNow, we didn't talk about this last time,\nbut if we want.\n\n324\n00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:31.620\nJust move this over here so you can see.\n\n325\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.004\nIf we wanted to scope or narrowly define\n\n326\n00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:40.010\nthe particular object down here,\nor group of objects.\n\n327\n00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.910\nThat we wanna be able to make this shape,\nthis component, represent.\n\n328\n00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.231\nWe could decide, hey, you know what?\n\n329\n00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:48.358\nInstead of all objects,\nand you can see over here,\n\n330\n00:14:48.358 --> 00:14:52.440\nI have 313 objects currently\nin my pick list, all objects.\n\n331\n00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.630\nIf I want to narrow that,\nI could say, you know what,\n\n332\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.540\nI just want this particular one,\nthe one we're about to choose, green.\n\n333\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.560\nI just wanted to be associated with\n\n334\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.670\nthe administration item, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n335\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.850\nOr connector, or whatever.\n\n336\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.090\nAnd it would then narrowly define and\n\n337\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.700\nconstrain the opportunity for\nme to add objects to this component.\n\n338\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, based on that category.\n\n339\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.410\n&gt;&gt; Unique to the object choice I make,\nessentially,\n\n340\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.150\nbased on my initial choice, right.\n\n341\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.080\nSo as you're building out\nthis thought process, and\n\n342\n00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.120\nwe're adding the components in.\n\n343\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.210\nYou have to be thinking about,\nwhat kind of components are gonna be used?\n\n344\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.910\nAnd what objects are we gonna represent?\n\n345\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.190\nComponents are just empty shells,\n\n346\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.780\nthey're essentially just boxes\nthat was ascribe functionality to.\n\n347\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.960\nThink of them almost like text boxes,\nright?\n\n348\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.430\nBut they're able to, as containers,\nhold objects that we bind to them.\n\n349\n00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.799\nWe're gonna bring objects in, and\nadd them in here in just a minute.\n\n350\n00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:44.392\nSo there are a special kind of container,\n\n351\n00:15:44.392 --> 00:15:47.228\nI don't wanna minimize their\nfunctionality, they are very important.\n\n352\n00:15:47.228 --> 00:15:50.710\nBut they're really nothing more than,\nessentially, an empty box that we label.\n\n353\n00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.407\nWith a name that we've,\nhopefully, spelled correctly.\n\n354\n00:15:52.407 --> 00:15:56.273\nCuz our co-host doesn't throw us under the\nbus with a color that we don't know how\n\n355\n00:15:56.273 --> 00:15:57.225\nto spell.\n\n356\n00:15:57.225 --> 00:15:59.448\nI'm not bitter, by the way,\nI just found that way.\n\n357\n00:15:59.448 --> 00:16:04.142\nAnd then, when we do that, we're then\ngoing to actually, in the step two here.\n\n358\n00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:05.470\nAs soon as we create the green one,\nwe're gonna bind.\n\n359\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.301\nWe're going to go select an object.\n\n360\n00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:12.260\nAnd bind it by adding it into the object,\nis gonna get added into the component.\n\n361\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.251\nAnd we're then essentially\ngonna have an association, and\n\n362\n00:16:15.251 --> 00:16:18.780\nthen we're gonna create a connection\nbetween those two components.\n\n363\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.550\nAnd then link them so\nthis would create the distributed app.\n\n364\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.290\nWe get that nice diagram,\nwe're gonna see everything line up for us.\n\n365\n00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.420\nThat's what we're gonna do right now.\n\n366\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.340\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n367\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.670\nI'm gonna instantiate the green component\nhere with all objects selected.\n\n368\n00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.700\nSo let me do this, and\nwe'll see we have both there.\n\n369\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:41.060\nNow, we can position these, and move them\naround, if you would prefer to have them\n\n370\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.260\nset up and\njust kind of dropped in here, right?\n\n371\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.060\nThat way, you can put them side by side.\n\n372\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.350\nIf you want to put it over here where\nit was, kind of underneath each other.\n\n373\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.460\nUp to do you to decide where to put them.\n\n374\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.490\nThis is you designing the app visually,\nremember,\n\n375\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.070\njust to show the components and understand\nthe monitoring of these components\n\n376\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.380\nwhen we link objects to them to\nrepresent them so we can see the data.\n\n377\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.200\nIn other words-\n&gt;&gt; Whatever makes logical sense.\n\n378\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.841\n&gt;&gt; You can make it look as pretty or\nas ugly as you want.\n\n379\n00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:12.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is up to you, okay?\n\n380\n00:17:12.722 --> 00:17:16.553\nIf it makes sense in your mind,\nthat is what matters, okay?\n\n381\n00:17:16.553 --> 00:17:19.399\nBrought to you from the mind of Cherokee,\nthis is gonna be interesting.\n\n382\n00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:20.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask\n\n383\n00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:21.650\nher where she wants me to put them.\n\n384\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.070\nWe're going to leave them there.\n\n385\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.910\n&gt;&gt; That's fine, Adam.\n\n386\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Because they may wind up, who knows?\n\n387\n00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.680\nWe're not quite sure.\n\n388\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.570\nAll right, so what we're going to do\nis we're going to actually add objects\n\n389\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.250\ninto our components, right?\n\n390\n00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.320\nSo next step is we're going to go ahead,\nwe're going to come over here,\n\n391\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.470\nwe're going to find an object\nthat's appropriate for fuchsia.\n\n392\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.460\nI don't have a clue what the heck that's\ngonna be, but we'll figure something out.\n\n393\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.100\nAnd an object that's appropriate for\ngreen.\n\n394\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the primary colors,\nbecause those are secondary.\n\n395\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's no logic that makes sense or\n\n396\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.852\nI would just not say anything\nabout that if I was you.\n\n397\n00:17:52.852 --> 00:17:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But what we would do in the real world,\n\n398\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.010\nyou saw me in the demo\napp I had already setup.\n\n399\n00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.050\nSomething just from a labeling\nperspective that actually made more sense\n\n400\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.420\nwould have been servers and\nall Windows computers.\n\n401\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.950\nAnd then we would clearly be able to\n\n402\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.950\nassign objects like a specific\ninstance of the server.\n\n403\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.510\nWe're going to pretend that\nwe did something like that.\n\n404\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.325\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n405\n00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:14.600\nThe labels, as I said,\nare pretty much just gonna be innocuous.\n\n406\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.210\nBut if we wanted to remove the label and\nchange it, just right-click there and\n\n407\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.400\nwe can rename it if we need to.\n\n408\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.260\nSo it's not like if we made a choice and\n\n409\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.150\nwe didn't like it we couldn't go back and\nfix it.\n\n410\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.960\nIt would be easy enough to figure it out.\n\n411\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.380\nIt's just that we already went with\nthat so we're just gonna use that.\n\n412\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.140\nBut you get the idea.\n\n413\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.280\nIn the real world, this would be something\nmore meaningful like web server.\n\n414\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.860\nLike file and print server.\n\n415\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.050\nSomething you would name it, so\n\n416\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.710\nas we add the object in and we drop in\nthe specific instance in the file server,\n\n417\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.050\nit actually shows up and\nmakes sense when we track it, right?\n\n418\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.930\nThat's what we wanna make sure we do.\n\n419\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.530\nSo let's scroll down here, and we've got\nall sorts of objects here, by the way.\n\n420\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.180\nThere's quite a number of them.\n\n421\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.680\nWe're gonna look for\nJust go back up right here.\n\n422\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.240\nWe're gonna look for an instance\nof the Windows operating system\n\n423\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.540\nthat has a server name attached to it.\n\n424\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.250\nYou could see it right there, right?\n\n425\n00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.980\nSo we can drag this out,\nright-click on it,\n\n426\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:09.070\nrather I should say, Add To, and specify\neither create a New Component Group, or\n\n427\n00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.980\nadd it to one of the ones\nthat we have here.\n\n428\n00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.080\nWe'll add the server to Fuschia.\n\n429\n00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.610\nAnd you can see when we do that,\n\n430\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.730\nserver 12 R2 operating system\ngets added in right there.\n\n431\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.730\nAnd we can then see that\nwe're gonna start monitoring.\n\n432\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.440\nCould we go full screen, so\nwe gotta see what's behind me here, okay?\n\n433\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.130\nAnd you'll see that we now have,\nwhen we do this, right?\n\n434\n00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.640\nWe have down here our object name.\n\n435\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.630\nWe have our holding computer,\nthe computer that we're gonna be using.\n\n436\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.090\nAnd you'll see we have the different\nviews that are gonna be associated with\n\n437\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.180\nthis object.\n\n438\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.260\nWe have our state view,\nour alert view, and our diagram view.\n\n439\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.400\nSo we're starting to build in\nsome component structure, and\n\n440\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.275\nthen objects bound to them as containers.\n\n441\n00:19:47.275 --> 00:19:50.709\nAnd then logic that as we continue\nwe'll add another object into\n\n442\n00:19:50.709 --> 00:19:54.985\nthe other component in a minute,\ncreate a relationship, we'll then save it.\n\n443\n00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.779\nAnd then,\nwhen we go to look at the diagram,\n\n444\n00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:00.222\nthis is how we began to see the monitoring\nbecause we're binding specific instances\n\n445\n00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:02.549\nof objects that we want to get\nhealth monitoring for, and\n\n446\n00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:05.432\nthen their going to be brought in,\nwe're going to be able to see them.\n\n447\n00:20:05.432 --> 00:20:07.409\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go grab another one.\n\n448\n00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:09.739\nFor green.\n\n449\n00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:11.329\nLets' do-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n450\n00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:14.891\nprobably would've made a little bit more\nsense if I, instead of saying green,\n\n451\n00:20:14.891 --> 00:20:16.870\nmaybe something like domain controllers.\n\n452\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.590\nAnd then you could put those domain\ncontrollers in that grouping, right?\n\n453\n00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.820\n&gt;&gt; Hey, reflection and self-awareness\nis a really important concept.\n\n454\n00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.310\nThat is awesome that you\ncame to that on your own.\n\n455\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.140\nThat is great, and yes, it would have.\n\n456\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.280\nBut you had your choice,\nand you chose poorly.\n\n457\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.210\nSo, you're now gonna have to live with\nthe outcome of your consequences.\n\n458\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.570\nAll right, so we are gonna choose,\nI'm just trying to find something here.\n\n459\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.940\nLet's do,\nlet me just go up here real quick.\n\n460\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.760\nLet's do the ops manager.\n\n461\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.180\nI'm just trying to find the one I want.\n\n462\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.480\nLet's do the ops manager database, okay?\n\n463\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.335\nLet's grab that one, add that one.\n\n464\n00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:51.490\nWe'll add that one into green.\n\n465\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.430\nSo we have the ops manager data warehouse\ndatabase, one of our two databases,\n\n466\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.530\nour reporting database where\nwe're gonna get all of that\n\n467\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.930\ninformation that's held there and then\nsend it over to the reporting server and\n\n468\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.990\nthe reporting server\ninstance through querying.\n\n469\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.830\nSo we're gonna use that to structure,\nso we have that.\n\n470\n00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.150\nLet's create a relationship\nbetween these two.\n\n471\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.590\nWe're gonna go click on our\nCreate Relationship item up here.\n\n472\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.800\nAnd we're then gonna get\nour little connector.\n\n473\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.820\nGo fullscreen for me so\n\n474\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.870\nyou can see the little icon hanging at\nthe bottom, right-hand corner of my mouse.\n\n475\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.720\nIt's got that kind sideways,\nknocked off your face,\n\n476\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.859\nhalf broken glasses looking thing, right?\n\n477\n00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:27.340\nThe little square and circle icon.\n\n478\n00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.050\nAnd as I grab and drag here,\n\n479\n00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.744\nyou'll see I can create a connection,\nessentially a relationship.\n\n480\n00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:35.500\nYou could the little dohicky,\nI don't know what to call it but\n\n481\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.790\na little squiggly thing\nunderneath my arrow.\n\n482\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.140\nThat is essentially the connector or\ncreate relationship tool.\n\n483\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.270\nAnd I have now my\nrelationship between the two.\n\n484\n00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.340\nSo I've gone ahead and said these two\nitems are going to be related, right?\n\n485\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.670\nAnd I wanna make sure that\nwhen they are linked up and\n\n486\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.280\nset up that I see this relationship.\n\n487\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.100\nNow that I've done this, I'm gonna go\nahead and go over here to the left and\n\n488\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.490\nI'm gonna click Save.\n\n489\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.300\nSo let's click Save.\n\n490\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.420\nWe'll give this just a minute.\n\n491\n00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.280\nTakes a moment or so to save.\n\n492\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.360\nDoesn't take very long, but\njust have to be patient with it.\n\n493\n00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.420\nLet it finish up doing its thing.\n\n494\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.910\nAnd then once it is saved,\nwe'll then be able to see the application.\n\n495\n00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.480\nIt'll show up momentarily in\nthe pick list behind this window.\n\n496\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.920\nIn the application or\ndistributed application\n\n497\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.180\narea that we were working with,\nwe'll see another instance there.\n\n498\n00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.790\nWe may have to refresh to see it.\n\n499\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.270\nWe'll wait to find out.\n\n500\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.435\nIt's always a mystery.\n\n501\n00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:29.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You never quite\n\n502\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.750\nknow if you'll have to refresh or not.\n\n503\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.850\nBut we'll refresh if we need to.\n\n504\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.390\nAnd then once we're done,\nwe'll close this.\n\n505\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.160\nAnd then we will be able to,\ndid not mean to do that.\n\n506\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.570\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n507\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.015\nWhen you go to close,\ndon't close the console, right?\n\n508\n00:22:43.015 --> 00:22:45.850\nThat's always a good\na good piece of advice.\n\n509\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.078\nI hit the wrong x there, so\nlet's get back into where we were.\n\n510\n00:22:49.078 --> 00:22:52.129\nLet's go back to authoring,\nand let's go here,\n\n511\n00:22:52.129 --> 00:22:55.845\nyou'll see now that we do have\nour Cherokee app right there.\n\n512\n00:22:55.845 --> 00:22:58.499\nLet's highlight that,\nand let's right-click.\n\n513\n00:22:58.499 --> 00:23:01.180\nAnd we know we can do view diagram.\n\n514\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.206\nAnd when we view our diagram,\nthere's diagram.\n\n515\n00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:08.884\nAnd if we go ahead and\nopen up either Fuschia and or Green,\n\n516\n00:23:08.884 --> 00:23:14.648\nwe will see whatever instance that\nwe've been asked to take a look at.\n\n517\n00:23:14.648 --> 00:23:18.494\nAnd we'll see information,\neither there or over here.\n\n518\n00:23:20.474 --> 00:23:23.450\nFor our Ops manager data\nwarehouse database.\n\n519\n00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.340\nThat one does have information about it.\n\n520\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.970\nWe see a log file, we see primary.\n\n521\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.570\n&gt;&gt; Pretty nice.\n&gt;&gt; Databases all healthy.\n\n522\n00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.425\n&gt;&gt; A lot better than trying\nto make this out of Paint or\n\n523\n00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:34.445\nsome other kind of tool like that.\n\n524\n00:23:34.445 --> 00:23:36.307\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember,\nthese are also interactive.\n\n525\n00:23:36.307 --> 00:23:37.735\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's not just making them out of\n\n526\n00:23:37.735 --> 00:23:39.823\nPaint and it looks nice but-\n&gt;&gt; The've done a good job here.\n\n527\n00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:43.025\n&gt;&gt; But they're actually, as you can\nsee I'm actually drilling down into\n\n528\n00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:47.427\nthe data table I see the data\ntables are healthy as well.\n\n529\n00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.807\nAnd remember, we can right-click and\n\n530\n00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:53.057\nwe can interact with information around\nthe diagram here and see what's going on.\n\n531\n00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:55.927\nSo this is a much more powerful-\n&gt;&gt; Real time, yeah.\n\n532\n00:23:55.927 --> 00:23:59.297\n&gt;&gt; Thing than just having a picture.\n\n533\n00:23:59.297 --> 00:24:00.823\nSo this very nice, right?\n\n534\n00:24:00.823 --> 00:24:04.127\nI the sense that now we have\na representation on our application and\n\n535\n00:24:04.127 --> 00:24:05.717\nthe moving parts and components, and\n\n536\n00:24:05.717 --> 00:24:08.890\nwe can look at real time status\nupdates on health and performance.\n\n537\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:13.330\nBut we can also interact if necessary and\ndo some investigation monitoring.\n\n538\n00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Microsoft has done really\ngreat job at showing us how to go ahead\n\n539\n00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.540\nand view those distributed app locations.\n\n540\n00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.400\nAnd then thank you, Adam, for\nshowing us how to actually set it up and\n\n541\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.350\nuse this tool that they've provided.\n\n542\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.613\nIs there any final thoughts that\nyou have for this particular demo?\n\n543\n00:24:30.003 --> 00:24:32.600\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n544\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.640\nThrow away the key.\n\n545\n00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.570\nWell, I think that that about covers\nit for this particular episode, so\n\n546\n00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.820\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n547\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.510\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n548\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.450\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n549\n00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.470\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n550\n00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:49.446\n[MUSIC]\n\n551\n00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:52.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:12.990\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your Configuring and\n\n5\n00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.880\nDeploying in Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.680\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.950\nSo in this episode we're actually gonna\nbe looking at the configuring and\n\n8\n00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.730\ndeployment access of a private cloud.\n\n9\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.380\nWith us today, in studios,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.100\nHow are you today Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.160\nWe're gonna simplify that a little.\n\n13\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.430\nWhat we're really gonna look\nat is just building blocks and\n\n14\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.610\nelements of how we control\naccess to the private cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.020\nThat hopefully makes sense for you.\n\n16\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.210\nAnd specifically we'll\ntalk a bit about and\n\n17\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.870\nbuild on some of the conversations\nwe had in some prior episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260\nIf you haven't seen them,\nI encourage you to go back, take a look.\n\n19\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.370\nWhere we talked about creating\nthe building blocks of the private cloud,\n\n20\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.920\nall the different profiles that we\ncan use for resources, applications,\n\n21\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.410\ncapabilities, things like that.\n\n22\n00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.910\nWe've taken all those, talked about them,\nessentially created a private cloud,\n\n23\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.260\none of more of them, with that.\n\n24\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.110\nBut now that we have this private cloud,\nhow are we gonna deploy and\n\n25\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.830\nconfigure access to it, meaning how are we\ngonna control things like services that\n\n26\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.540\nmay be used to provide for functionality\nand consumption through a private cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.800\nSo we'll talk about that.\n\n28\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.570\nWhat are the resources\nof the private cloud,\n\n29\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.180\nwe'll just quickly remind ourselves of\nwhat some of those building blocks are.\n\n30\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.470\nThings like the logical networks, the load\nbalancers, as well as the host group and\n\n31\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.350\nthe host that are underlying those\nresources that are being provided in other\n\n32\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.250\nwords to the private cloud.\n\n33\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.530\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n34\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.473\nWe'll talk about the app controller,\nyou've heard me mention this and\n\n35\n00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:32.220\ntalk about it before,\nthis is our self service portal,\n\n36\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.440\nor one of the ways anyway,\nwe could provide a self service portal.\n\n37\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.810\nSo we'll show you what that looks like.\n\n38\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.430\nWe'll be walking through and showing you\nhow to configure the app controller and\n\n39\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.730\nstand it up and\nset it up in a little how to episode.\n\n40\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.350\nBut here, we'll just take a look at it,\nassuming it's already been installed.\n\n41\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.960\nI'll quickly show you what it looks like.\n\n42\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.090\nI'll show you how we\nconnect it up to SCVMM.\n\n43\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.140\nIt's already been done, so I'll just\nwalk you through the logic of that.\n\n44\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.690\nAnd we'll also take a look at and we'll\ntouch on the idea of service templates.\n\n45\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.440\nWhat they are, why they are important,\nhow do we bundle up\n\n46\n00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.730\nour blank generic service template\nif we wanna populate it out.\n\n47\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.168\nOr multi tier service offering, attach\nvirtual machines things like that to it\n\n48\n00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:13.337\nand then publish that\nservice to make it develop.\n\n49\n00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:16.468\nSo we're gonna take a look at all that,\nand if we have a little time left over\n\n50\n00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.906\nwell then we're gonna share\nwith you the secret of life and\n\n51\n00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.170\nthe meaning of the universe.\n\n52\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Great I can't wait for that.\n\n53\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Only if we have time left over all\nright so let's take a look if you wanna\n\n54\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.035\njoin me in here actually right\nup over there, there we go.\n\n55\n00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:30.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Got a little latency today in our magic\n\n56\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.630\nfinger pointing device.\n\n57\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.440\nSo when we take a look inside of the\nSCVMM, and that's where we are right now\n\n58\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.340\njust so you can know where we're located,\nkind of center yourself so to speak.\n\n59\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.730\nYou'll see we're in the library area,\nwhich is one of the workspaces we've been\n\n60\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.050\nin and out of over the time we've been\nspending taking a look at the content and\n\n61\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.960\nthe ways in which we configure\nthings inside SCVMM.\n\n62\n00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.240\nAs I was suggesting in the prior episodes\nthat you may hopefully have taken\n\n63\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.040\na look at.\n\n64\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.470\nWe've taken a look at profiles and\n\n65\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.540\ntalked extensively about the building\nblocks here, and what goes on.\n\n66\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.490\nWe've talked about certainly,\njust jumping over here for a minute.\n\n67\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.120\nAbout the private cloud, and\ntalked about how to set one up.\n\n68\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.360\nWe'll come back in here in a minute and\n\n69\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.650\ntake a look at the service that\nI've created that's running.\n\n70\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.140\nWe've spoken about the fabric and the\nbuilding blocks and pieces of the fabric,\n\n71\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.750\nthe servers, all the infrastructure\nthat we're running and how we manage it.\n\n72\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.210\nSee our VMM server is there.\n\n73\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.310\nWe'll talk about networking and all\nthe individual constituent components of\n\n74\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.490\nthe network private cloud\ninfrastructure so the load balancers,\n\n75\n00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.040\nthe virtual switches and all of the\ndifferent things the port capabilities and\n\n76\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.300\nall that stuff we talked\nabout storage as well.\n\n77\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.815\nAnd so back in the library area here,\njust gonna scroll up.\n\n78\n00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:40.965\nAnd you'll see that up under templates.\n\n79\n00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.555\nAnd I'll just go ahead and\nI'll just minimize this so\n\n80\n00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.987\nit's a little bit easier to keep track of.\n\n81\n00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:47.785\nUp under templates here, haven't really\nspent a lot of time in here up until now.\n\n82\n00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:51.257\nWe have our service templates sitting\nthere and what we wanna do is, first,\n\n83\n00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:54.767\njust talk generically about\nthe idea of these configurable or\n\n84\n00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.027\npooled resources we provide\nfrom the host group and\n\n85\n00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.577\nthrough the configuration here\nas I was just suggesting.\n\n86\n00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:03.208\nYou know, when we create private\nclouds we have to define\n\n87\n00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:07.418\nthis aggregated set of resources that are\nmade available to the private cloud, or\n\n88\n00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:10.458\nthrough the private cloud from SCVMM and\nthe underlying host.\n\n89\n00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.910\nAnd we've spoken about this before,\n\n90\n00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.770\nwe generically call this a resource pool,\nregardless of what platform, what vendor,\n\n91\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.430\nwe're just taking resources from the hosts\nand we're then making them available.\n\n92\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.250\nYou wanna help me remind our studio\naudience out there what the four major\n\n93\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.400\nresources that we would\nprovide in general would be?\n\n94\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.970\nWhat do you think they are?\n\n95\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Resources for, in general, what?\n\n96\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.460\n&gt;&gt; So, from the host, in other\nwords when we pool hosts together,\n\n97\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.670\nput them into a host\ngroup as we do in SCVMM.\n\n98\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n99\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.690\n&gt;&gt; And when we are gonna then provide\nthose resources to the Hyper-Visor.\n\n100\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.540\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And abstract\n\n101\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.900\nthem to the virtual machines.\n\n102\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.860\nWhat are those resources?\n\n103\n00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.780\n&gt;&gt; So, we have our memory,.\n\n104\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Our memory.\n&gt;&gt; Our CPU.\n\n105\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n106\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.350\n&gt;&gt; Our storage space and\nour networking capabilities.\n\n107\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding, very good.\n\n108\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.330\nSo, we have our RAM, our memory,\nas Cherokee said, our CPUs, our storage,\n\n109\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.303\nwhich will be typically across\nthe networks somewhere, right?\n\n110\n00:04:56.303 --> 00:04:58.445\nA SAN or a NAS backed system,\nbut it may be local,\n\n111\n00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:01.480\nwe've talked about the fact we\ncan do this different ways.\n\n112\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.020\nAnd then of course we have network access,\nmeaning our network cards that we use.\n\n113\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.140\nSo those are our four resource groups, or\nareas, that we aggregate resources from.\n\n114\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.090\nAnd we define the hardware and\nthe software components that are used by\n\n115\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.810\nthe private cloud as building blocks,\nas I suggested.\n\n116\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.500\nJust to remind you, as I pointed out, but\nwe'll just take a look here real quick.\n\n117\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.810\nLet me just pull this down.\n\n118\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.700\nWe do this through a couple\nof different areas.\n\n119\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.574\nWe have, up there, on the left,\n\n120\n00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:29.640\nin the library under profiles,\nour guest OS profiles,\n\n121\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.750\nour capability profiles, our hardware\nprofiles, physical computer profiles.\n\n122\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.720\nRemember this is where we're gonna be\nable to provide the different templates.\n\n123\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.760\nProfiles are essentially like templates\nthat are used to configure and tell us how\n\n124\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.780\nwe're going to be able to bring those\nresources to bear and consume them.\n\n125\n00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.090\nAnd remember, in the fabric,\nlet's go over here.\n\n126\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.560\nUp under networking, we've got\nour network based resources here.\n\n127\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.140\nWe've got our logical networks,\nour address pools,\n\n128\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.670\nMac address, IP address, things like that.\n\n129\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.670\nOur load balancers,\nour virtual IP configurations.\n\n130\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.250\nOur switches, port profiles.\n\n131\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.520\nWe've been through all these.\n\n132\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.510\nWe will have up under storage, just\npull this down here, just one second so\n\n133\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.780\nI can move that down.\n\n134\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.460\nAs we were talking about, we'll have our\nclassifications for storage under storage\n\n135\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.970\npools, which is going to be just\nthe way we present storage.\n\n136\n00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.860\nWe will have our providers,\nour file servers, so\n\n137\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.060\nall the different moving parts and\npieces are being provided here.\n\n138\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.410\nAnd up under VMs and services,\nwe will have our host groups,\n\n139\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.130\nthis is the all host group,\nthe group by default that's there.\n\n140\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.060\nWe may have others once we set them up and\nbuild them out, and\n\n141\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.660\nthen we're able to see the hosts\nthat are gonna be associated, and\n\n142\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.950\nlook at different aspects of\nour resource provisioning.\n\n143\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.360\nSo we have all these pieces\nthat we've talked about,\n\n144\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.735\nall the moving parts that\nare available to us in here.\n\n145\n00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:49.930\nAnd we've talked about some of the\nsupporting elements in prior discussions\n\n146\n00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.870\nthings like the integration of the WSUS\nserver in so we could do patch management\n\n147\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.120\njust since we're here, we'll take a look\nand quickly show you, remind you of that.\n\n148\n00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.790\nWe have our library servers here,\n\n149\n00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.470\nwhere we actually are providing\nthe storage back end that we're\n\n150\n00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.730\nusing to provide our VM templates,\nour ISOs, things of that nature.\n\n151\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.200\nAny information we wanna store and\nmake available into SCVMM for\n\n152\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.430\nconsumption is put in here.\n\n153\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.320\nWe did talk about, or\nactually I should say we will talk about\n\n154\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.670\nin some upcoming episodes because\nwe haven't talked about it yet.\n\n155\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.230\nBut we will talk about\nthe use of web deploy and\n\n156\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.975\nthe use of application virtualization,\n\n157\n00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:31.095\nthat'll be one of the topics that we'll\ntalk about and we'll see that will.\n\n158\n00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:33.515\nActually I take it back,\nI'm sorry, I'm turned all around.\n\n159\n00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:35.607\nWe talked about that back\nin some prior episodes.\n\n160\n00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:36.935\n&gt;&gt; We may have or have not,\nthat's up to you.\n\n161\n00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:38.264\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we did, well, yeah,\n\n162\n00:07:38.264 --> 00:07:40.890\nthat's true, it depends upon\nwhether you watched them or not.\n\n163\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.930\nWe have talked about it before, I forgot.\n\n164\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.890\n&gt;&gt; They're there, regardless.\n\n165\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.170\n&gt;&gt; Smack in the middle of our\nconversation flow here but\n\n166\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.712\nwe have talked about them if you\nhaven't seen those episodes,\n\n167\n00:07:48.712 --> 00:07:49.687\nyou would wanna go back and take a look.\n\n168\n00:07:49.687 --> 00:07:51.945\nBut we talked about how\nyou can actually go in and\n\n169\n00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.329\nuse alternate methods to\nprovide applications.\n\n170\n00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:58.150\nAnd web deployments,\nyou'd be able to package up either an app,\n\n171\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.493\nAnd/or website and/or\napplication virtualization.\n\n172\n00:08:01.493 --> 00:08:05.153\nWe discussed those topics and we talked\nabout the fact that we will use and\n\n173\n00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:08.220\nwe could see right up here under\nthe application framework.\n\n174\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.740\nSo I'm gonna just extend this out,\nso you could see it here.\n\n175\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.797\nWe could see the web deploy packages and\n\n176\n00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:15.736\nthe server application\nvirtualization information.\n\n177\n00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:18.990\nThis is where they actually\nwind up being installed and\n\n178\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.410\nconfigured from when we actually load them\nin to the, in this case, the SCVMM server.\n\n179\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.558\nSo we've talked about this and\n\n180\n00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:28.217\nit's just one of the pieces that you\nwould have seen as we went through.\n\n181\n00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:32.678\nSo when we go back up here and we think\nabout this idea of being able to work with\n\n182\n00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:37.830\nthese resources in these pooled aggregated\nresources that we're talking about.\n\n183\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.310\nWe're thinking about utilizing resources\nfrom the host group, essentially, right,\n\n184\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.430\nand then providing them.\n\n185\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.720\nNow keep in mind, when we do this,\nwe're able to go in.\n\n186\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.990\nAnd if you remember,\nwe can host in a SCVMM, this is unique,\n\n187\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.532\nwe can work with Microsoft hosts and\nMicrosoft infrastructure.\n\n188\n00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.311\nBut remember,\nwe also have the capabilities in\n\n189\n00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.854\nmanaging virtual server or,\nexcuse me not virtual server,\n\n190\n00:08:59.854 --> 00:09:05.050\nvCenter Server and VMware Infrastructure,\nESX or ESXi hosts and/or Citrix Xen.\n\n191\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.520\nSo we have the ability to be\nable to work with all three.\n\n192\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.561\nAnd so when we're thinking about this and\nwe go in.\n\n193\n00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:16.012\nAnd for instance up under here,\njust go, let's just go and\n\n194\n00:09:16.012 --> 00:09:19.470\nlet's just go up here under Servers.\n\n195\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:25.384\nWe go to our all hosts, Right here.\n\n196\n00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:28.318\nThis is where all host resource group is,\nor host group rather is, and\n\n197\n00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.760\nwe've talked about that and we'd have\nthe hosts that are there by default.\n\n198\n00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.122\nBut then if you remember, you could see\nwe can bring in a vCenter server here if\n\n199\n00:09:35.122 --> 00:09:37.726\nwe're gonna be managing\nVMware Infrastructure, right?\n\n200\n00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:39.550\nAnd we can integrate that and\nconnect that.\n\n201\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.320\nWe've talked about the logic of that,\nwe've shown you-\n\n202\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.987\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n203\n00:09:42.987 --> 00:09:44.664\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, yes,\nthank you, appreciate that.\n\n204\n00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:46.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about the ability to be\n\n205\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.140\nable to integrate WSUS Server, PXE Server-\n&gt;&gt; It's not proprietary,\n\n206\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.547\nit has an open mind.\n\n207\n00:09:51.547 --> 00:09:54.300\nYeah, it's It's open for new experiences.\n\n208\n00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.918\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n209\n00:09:56.918 --> 00:10:00.889\n&gt;&gt; Are you talking about the-\n&gt;&gt; I'm talking about the software.\n\n210\n00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:02.626\n&gt;&gt; I was, okay, good, just making sure.\n\n211\n00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:05.310\nI wasn't sure what that reference was for\nbut, yes, appreciate that.\n\n212\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.766\nI was not sure what you were saying.\n\n213\n00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:08.580\nSo do appreciate you clarifying.\n\n214\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.143\nSo when we go in and\nwe are looking at this.\n\n215\n00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.511\nRemember, we have different compatibility\nsolutions that we can deploy and\n\n216\n00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:15.560\nthink through.\n\n217\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.600\nAnd those resources that we talk\nabout can come from VMware servers,\n\n218\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.270\nESX or ESXi servers.\n\n219\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.379\nThose hosts, they can come\nfrom Microsoft infrastructure,\n\n220\n00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:26.601\ncuz Microsoft Server is running Hyper-V.\n\n221\n00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:30.057\nAnd we've shown you how to add those\nhosts in and join them in to SCVMM and\n\n222\n00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:33.800\ncreate a host group and gone through\nsome of that in prior discussions.\n\n223\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.820\nThey could be coming from a Citrix Xen or\ngroup of Citrix Xen servers.\n\n224\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.613\nSo we have those capabilities.\n\n225\n00:10:39.613 --> 00:10:42.505\nAnd we just wanna be thinking about\nthe fact that we can bring them in and\n\n226\n00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:43.200\nwork with them.\n\n227\n00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.080\nAnd when we configure cloud capacity,\nwe're really thinking about limiting\n\n228\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.600\nthe resources made available to\na tenant for the private cloud.\n\n229\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.490\nAs part of our thought process and\npart of the way in which we can\n\n230\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.930\nessentially allocate out those resources,\nright?\n\n231\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.598\nAnd so when we figure or think through\nthe logic of configuring the resources and\n\n232\n00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:05.638\nallocating them out to the cloud,\nwe're thinking about going in and\n\n233\n00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:08.655\nlooking at our capability profiles here,\nright?\n\n234\n00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:13.185\nThis is what we see our hosts or\na Hyper-V, Xen Server, ESX or ESXi Server\n\n235\n00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:18.410\nthought processes or capability profiles\nthat are already configured for us.\n\n236\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.110\nAnd this remember, ship by default, the\nlimit tool we've talked about this before.\n\n237\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.080\nI think I've mentioned them,\nI'm just gonna remind you here.\n\n238\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.668\nCuz we're not gonna do much with the ESX\nServer on the sense that we haven't really\n\n239\n00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:29.177\nused it to demonstrate anything.\n\n240\n00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:32.757\nBut I just wanna point out to that\neven though it says ESX Server here,\n\n241\n00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:34.560\nthis is ESX and/or ESXi, right?\n\n242\n00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.445\nIt will work with both the older and\n\n243\n00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:40.160\nthe newer versions of\nthe VMware Operating System for the host.\n\n244\n00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.396\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n245\n00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:43.206\nBut we have these three by default.\n\n246\n00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:47.460\nAnd as you can see,\nlet's go to Properties here.\n\n247\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.669\nYou could see under Capabilities that for\nany of them.\n\n248\n00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.848\nThis is what I'm talking about when I talk\nabout allocating the capabilities and\n\n249\n00:11:53.848 --> 00:11:54.910\nfiguring them out.\n\n250\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.380\nWe have the ability,\njust move this over, so you can see it.\n\n251\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.410\nWe have the ability to go in here and\n\n252\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.330\nwe have the ability to be able to\nspecify what's the processor range.\n\n253\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.700\nYour minimum maximums where we\ntalk about ranges traditionally.\n\n254\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.324\nSo what's the minimum and maximum number\nof processors that we would support?\n\n255\n00:12:11.324 --> 00:12:12.820\nThis is per host, by the way.\n\n256\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.770\nWhat's the minimum and maximum amount\nof memory we support for a host?\n\n257\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.950\nYou could see minimum there for\n\n258\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.300\nmegs currently, maximum 255\ngigs out of the box by default.\n\n259\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.430\nCan we modify these?\n\n260\n00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.825\nCan we make changes?\n\n261\n00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:26.979\nYou can go ahead and do that, of course.\n\n262\n00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:31.693\nCurrently, we support up to\n255 gigs on a host is low,\n\n263\n00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:36.605\nbecause we actually support up\nto 6 terabytes of memory per\n\n264\n00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:41.041\nVM running on a host in VM or\nESXi currently in 6.5.\n\n265\n00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:45.157\nSo we actually may have host that provide\na significantly larger amount of memory\n\n266\n00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:49.333\nthan 255 gigs if we're spending that kind\nmoney to invest to be able to run those\n\n267\n00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:50.440\nvirtual machines.\n\n268\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.135\nSo we may want to modify these profiles,\nthese capability profiles here to adjust.\n\n269\n00:12:55.135 --> 00:12:58.721\nSo that as we bring in those really high\nend hosts, we're able to provision them\n\n270\n00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.139\nand understand them and\nadd them in to the host group.\n\n271\n00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.102\nSo we can then pool our resources\neffectively and allocate them accordingly.\n\n272\n00:13:05.102 --> 00:13:08.190\nSo I just want you to be thinking\nabout that and be aware of that.\n\n273\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.370\nAll the limits, the minimums,\nmaximums are listed here by profile type.\n\n274\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.360\nAs you can see,\n\n275\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.540\nminimum of 0 hard drives that are virtual,\nup to 255 virtual hard drives.\n\n276\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.980\nMeaning, we could support a VM with\nno hard drives currently assigned,\n\n277\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.213\nwhich we know we can do is as we\ncreate a VM and then assign later.\n\n278\n00:13:24.213 --> 00:13:29.458\nBut we also can support a VM that has\nmultiple virtual hard drives assigned, and\n\n279\n00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:34.956\nthat we can run a VM with three or four\nvirtual hard drives up to potentially 255.\n\n280\n00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:38.511\nAlthough that would certainly not really\nnecessarily be something we would do in\n\n281\n00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:40.670\nproduction but we could if we needed to.\n\n282\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.760\nSo any of these capability\nprofiles that exist can be edited.\n\n283\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.788\nBut we also can create our own,\nas you can see here,\n\n284\n00:13:48.788 --> 00:13:52.254\na custom one that will\nallow us to be able to,\n\n285\n00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:57.151\nsay, for instance, let's say,\n2012 R2 or whatever.\n\n286\n00:13:57.151 --> 00:14:01.207\nI just wanna create one specific to\na certain configuration and/or certain\n\n287\n00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.250\noperating system platform.\n\n288\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.180\nI could do that and\nall I'm doing is just then going in and\n\n289\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.300\nprofiling out all of the constraints\nthat I just showed you with all\n\n290\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.830\nthe different resource\nelements that are added here.\n\n291\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.632\nAnd we would just go in and\nwe start from the basic concept here,\n\n292\n00:14:15.632 --> 00:14:18.840\n1 to 64 processors,\nwhatever the memory is.\n\n293\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.154\nAnd then we just go ahead and\n\n294\n00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:23.709\nwe just build out by editing out all\nof these different options, save it.\n\n295\n00:14:23.709 --> 00:14:25.659\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe'll just go ahead and do that,\n\n296\n00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:27.300\nwe'll just hit Finish real quick.\n\n297\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.410\nAnd then you'll see our\nlittle job role [COUGH] or\n\n298\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.500\njob creation window here,\ncreate and add a capability.\n\n299\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.620\nIt's been done and then you'll see\nright down there, I have a new one.\n\n300\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.350\nNow notice that unlike the ones that\nare there, let me scroll up, so\n\n301\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.510\nyou can see this.\n\n302\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.414\nThe three that are built in by default\nhave the little padlock on them,\n\n303\n00:14:45.414 --> 00:14:48.007\nthe one that we created\nthat was just done now.\n\n304\n00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:51.169\nIt doesn't just to signify that I\ncreated it locally in the console,\n\n305\n00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:53.310\nit's not the one that\nshipped in by default.\n\n306\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.860\nSo we could set these cloud capabilities\nup or these capability profiles up and\n\n307\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.240\nthen use them as part of\nthe deployment process.\n\n308\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.040\nThis is how we actually will control\nall of the various resources and\n\n309\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.550\nelements that go into making up.\n\n310\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.050\nThe feeder elements, if you will,\nof the private cloud.\n\n311\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.945\nAnd so there's about ten different items\non that list right in that set of settings\n\n312\n00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:12.630\nthat we edit.\n\n313\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.450\nLet me just quickly hit the highlights for\nyou.\n\n314\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.530\nI'll just give you a quick rundown.\n\n315\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.140\nI put them all in the show notes for\nyou, certainly you could take a look.\n\n316\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.856\nBut the fabric compatibility, you saw\nthat we have the ability to link and\n\n317\n00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:26.992\nto list Hyper-V virtualization,\nVMWare and/or Xen Server.\n\n318\n00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.630\nSo I'll just go back in here real quick.\n\n319\n00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.431\nYou'll be able to see\nthat right on this tab,\n\n320\n00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.918\nright here where we got\nfabric compatibility, right?\n\n321\n00:15:34.918 --> 00:15:36.855\nYou'll see that as I save this off.\n\n322\n00:15:36.855 --> 00:15:39.460\nThe highlighted one that was\nthere by default was Hyper-V.\n\n323\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.006\nThat's what I wind up getting, but\n\n324\n00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:44.270\nwe do have three there we could choose\nwhich one we wanna select from.\n\n325\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:49.214\nWe have our Processor Range,\nour Memory Range, our DVD Support,\n\n326\n00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.609\nour Shared Image support here.\n\n327\n00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:54.486\nThis is Shared Image mode, rather\nthan this is really only for Hyper-V.\n\n328\n00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:58.869\nSo we see this we would choose the Hyper-V\none but we have the ability to\n\n329\n00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:03.791\ndo the synthetic video adapter For\nvirtualization in terms of video support.\n\n330\n00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:06.693\nWe have the capability to deal\nwith the bus configuration,\n\n331\n00:16:06.693 --> 00:16:09.870\nthe different hard drive elements,\nthe network adaptors.\n\n332\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.300\nRight, so we've got all this\ndifferent kind of stuff, and\n\n333\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.830\nthese are the different\npieces that we will modify.\n\n334\n00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.170\nA few of them are unique to Hyper-V,\nso some of them won't exist.\n\n335\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.640\nIf we did a Xen or a VMware template,\nwe would not see some of those.\n\n336\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.200\nBut the majority of them\nare gonna be the same, regardless.\n\n337\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.130\nSo, when you're asked to\ncreate a resource pool,\n\n338\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.980\nyou wanna add resources,\nmodify that resource pooling profile.\n\n339\n00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.520\nThis actually what we're talking about.\n\n340\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.400\nWe're talking about dealing\nwith capability profiles, and\n\n341\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.716\njust reminding ourselves of that and\nhow that works.\n\n342\n00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:40.949\nThought, question, comment?\n\n343\n00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:43.760\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, thoughts,\nquestions, or comments.\n\n344\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.860\nSo perhaps, Adam, would we ever,\nI guess, really just think\n\n345\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.780\nabout adhering to any kind of precompiled\nprofiles from our organization?\n\n346\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.490\nOr just kind of create\nthat information and\n\n347\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.489\nmake those decisions as a team\nwithin our IT department?\n\n348\n00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:04.610\nOr I just guess it would all just\ndepend on your environment and\n\n349\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.290\nwhat your end goal is.\n\n350\n00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.750\nBut that where would that\nconversation normally transpire?\n\n351\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.138\n&gt;&gt; Well it would, as you indicated right,\nmost likely it would be a team event if\n\n352\n00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:20.040\nwe're in a big enough organization I would\nguess that has multiple people that may\n\n353\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.030\nhave control of or interest in different\nelements associated with the hosting.\n\n354\n00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.610\nAnd what I'm suggesting or\nthinking about is, hypothetically,\n\n355\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.510\nlet's say we are the IT\nfunction essentially.\n\n356\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:36.310\nWe are IT, right, and\nwe become the Cloud service provider.\n\n357\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.650\nCuz if we go into the Cloud business,\n\n358\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.400\nprivate Cloud, on-prem, IT essentially\ndoes become Cloud service provider.\n\n359\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.150\nBut locally installed in the business for\nthe benefit of the business, right?\n\n360\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.510\nWe're a private Cloud provider.\n\n361\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.400\nSo if we're doing that and\n\n362\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.370\nwe are now providing cloud services to\ndifferent lines of business owners.\n\n363\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.670\nThe database owners,\nthe web server owners, things like that.\n\n364\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:04.160\nI have lots of customers that are gonna\nhave specific applications that\n\n365\n00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.920\nare controlled or owned by certain quote,\nunquote LOB or line of business owners.\n\n366\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:14.100\nAnd those people are the customers\nthat consume those services or\n\n367\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.520\nare managing the consumption of those\nservices, depending how we look at it.\n\n368\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.350\nAnd because of that,\nwe are providing to them,\n\n369\n00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.340\nspecific usage profiles and\nresource profiles.\n\n370\n00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.910\nTo be able to enable those services or\nthose applications or those functions-\n\n371\n00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.660\n&gt;&gt; And equally charging.\n\n372\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.260\n&gt;&gt; To operate correctly,\nwe may do charge back, we may not.\n\n373\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.110\nIt would just totally depend on\nthe model that the business is going to\n\n374\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.853\noperate under.\n\n375\n00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:38.520\nWhat Cherokee's asking about and\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n376\n00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.355\nThe concept of charge back,\ncase you're not familiar with it.\n\n377\n00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:45.305\nWe may in many private organizations,\nwe have an IT budget.\n\n378\n00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:48.255\nMost companies regardless of how big or\nsmall they are, do.\n\n379\n00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:50.894\nThis is pretty common,\nstandard business practice.\n\n380\n00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:54.180\nBut some companies will take that budget,\ncarve it up, and,\n\n381\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.530\nessentially, allocate it\nout to certain functions.\n\n382\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.190\nAnd then they will actually,\nbecause of what's called GAP,\n\n383\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.640\nGenerally Accepted Procedures for\naccounting purposes.\n\n384\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.930\nThey will actually go ahead and\nthey will pretend, on paper and\n\n385\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.560\nin functionality, as they implement\nto align with this thought process.\n\n386\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.390\nThey will pretend that the internal\ncustomers are conducting business and\n\n387\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.010\ntransacting and buying and\nselling services.\n\n388\n00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.405\nThe way they would if they were\ndoing it on the open market.\n\n389\n00:19:23.405 --> 00:19:26.875\nLet's say outside, from Amazon,\nor Google, or Microsoft.\n\n390\n00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:31.785\nAnd so those budgets are then\nused to consume services and\n\n391\n00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:35.480\nthey're build quote unquote on\na monthly basis, based on usage.\n\n392\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.550\nTraditional model just like we've\nsee in the external Cloud provider.\n\n393\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.880\nBut the idea is that we're then\ntracking all that internally.\n\n394\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.213\nSo instead of throwing a bucket\nof money at IT and saying, okay,\n\n395\n00:19:45.213 --> 00:19:46.523\nhere’s a $1 million.\n\n396\n00:19:46.523 --> 00:19:48.330\nProvide all IT services for the year,\n\n397\n00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:52.000\nwe're taking that money,\nwe're giving it to different departments.\n\n398\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.987\nAnd we're saying you've got a budget\nof $10,000 to buy Cloud services for\n\n399\n00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:01.188\nthe year from our internal Cloud\nprovider called IT, generically.\n\n400\n00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:05.185\nAnd you're gonna spend, I don't know,\n$1000 a month or whatever it is.\n\n401\n00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:08.045\nBased on what they tell you it costs\nus to run your infrastructure.\n\n402\n00:20:08.045 --> 00:20:11.295\nAnd then our accounting function's\ngonna keep track of all that.\n\n403\n00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:12.785\nAnd then at the end of the year,\n\n404\n00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:16.185\nit's gonna look as if we're spending\nthe money externally the same way.\n\n405\n00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:19.132\nBut it's really just all internally\nmoving money on a One sheet.\n\n406\n00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:23.182\nThe idea behind it is we then can ascribe\nvalue to services being consumed,\n\n407\n00:20:23.182 --> 00:20:25.382\nand we can understand what they cost.\n\n408\n00:20:25.382 --> 00:20:28.582\nAnd there are some benefits potentially,\ndepending on the size of the organization.\n\n409\n00:20:28.582 --> 00:20:31.680\nYou do it because you wanna deal\nwith your taxes in certain ways.\n\n410\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.910\nThere's lot of reasons why we may do that.\n\n411\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.080\nBut we could do charge back, it would\ndepend on the size of the organization.\n\n412\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.780\nMany small, medium size businesses,\nthey just don't do this.\n\n413\n00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.350\nIt's not worth the time and effort.\n\n414\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.515\nThey just simply say,\nwe're providing the services.\n\n415\n00:20:43.515 --> 00:20:46.690\nAnd they don't really make you pay\nif you're an internal customer.\n\n416\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.792\nAlso goes into the fact whether or\nnot they like you or not.\n\n417\n00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:49.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you piss IT off,\n\n418\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.140\nthen you may wind up having\nto pay if you do that.\n\n419\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.730\nBut if you don't aggravate them, then of\ncourse likely you'll be able to get your\n\n420\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.220\nservices without being inconvenienced.\n\n421\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.098\nSo it does depend, there's a lot\nof variation that I see in my\n\n422\n00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:03.998\ncustomer base outside of this environment.\n\n423\n00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:08.184\nIn the real world as we talk through the\nlogic of how does this really play out?\n\n424\n00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.685\nI have small customers that stand\nby that concept of charge back.\n\n425\n00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:15.510\nCuz to them it's very important to\nbased on how they run their business.\n\n426\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.940\nI have large customers that should do it,\nbut don't.\n\n427\n00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.510\nI have large customers that do it,\nsmall customers that don't.\n\n428\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.900\nSo really, it's all over the place.\n\n429\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.340\nSo it would depend,\nit's a very good conversation to have.\n\n430\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.300\nBut there's a lot of variables associated\nwith the outcome, let's put it that way.\n\n431\n00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.390\nAll right, so let's shift gears for\na couple of minutes.\n\n432\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.790\nWe've talked about the concept\nof resources, resource pooling.\n\n433\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.930\nHow we would use access\nto those profiles and\n\n434\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.310\nthose capabilities to\nthen control essentially.\n\n435\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.720\nWhat resources are given to\ntenets that consume clouds.\n\n436\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.570\nSo that's one way we're dealing with that.\n\n437\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.874\nLet's take a look at the App Controller,\nif we can go full screen here.\n\n438\n00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:52.150\nCuz I've been hovering over a portion\nof the screen while we've been talking.\n\n439\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.903\nSo the App Controller is Is gonna be\nour ability to be able to stand up and\n\n440\n00:21:55.903 --> 00:21:58.680\nuse another element of\nthe System Center platform.\n\n441\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.200\nThis is our self service portal as\nI've referred to it several times.\n\n442\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.110\nAnd when we install and\nconfigure the App Controller.\n\n443\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.490\nAnd remember I've already done that for\npurpose of our conversation here.\n\n444\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.930\nYou're seeing it already stood up,\nconfigured, ready to go.\n\n445\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.320\nWe're gonna do a separate,\nhow do I install and walk you through it.\n\n446\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.350\nSo you'll see that as another episode, but\n\n447\n00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.100\nwe're just jumping ahead,\nif you will, here.\n\n448\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.460\nWe've already installed and configured it.\n\n449\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.140\nIt's a web based portal you connect,\nyou do need Silverlight,\n\n450\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.330\nas we've talked about with all\nthe web based portals from Microsoft.\n\n451\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.400\nSo if you don't have it,\nfirst time you connect,\n\n452\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.200\nyou get prompted to download it,\nno big deal there.\n\n453\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.600\nThen you log in, so\nyou'll have your credentials, easy to do.\n\n454\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.382\nAnd you've got this interface.\n\n455\n00:22:37.382 --> 00:22:41.632\nNow, I've already taken the liberty\nof going in under Private Cloud here.\n\n456\n00:22:41.632 --> 00:22:44.490\nAnd I've gone head and\nI've hit this link right here,\n\n457\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.200\nConnect a Virtual Machine Manager Server\nin Cloud.\n\n458\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.850\nAnd I have put in the information\nto connect to our SCVMM server.\n\n459\n00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.340\nAnd I've gone ahead and programmed that.\n\n460\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.060\nCould we go back to full screen please?\n\n461\n00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.500\nSo we could see that that\nis there ready to go.\n\n462\n00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.190\nAnd right above it, you'll see right here,\nI've already linked the SCVMM server, and\n\n463\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.690\nit's in there.\n\n464\n00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.140\nBut just to show you what we would do,\n\n465\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.570\nyou will click right here,\nit's just a very simple wizard.\n\n466\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.420\nAnd you just provide a name for\nthe connection.\n\n467\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.450\nI'll show you my connection in a minute.\n\n468\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.541\nAnd I have the server name, so\n\n469\n00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:19.750\nwe provide the there Ours is\nplabVMM01.practicelabs.com.\n\n470\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.985\nPort 8100,\nstandard port that's connected to SCVMM.\n\n471\n00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:27.210\nReal important to automatically\nimport the SSL certificates here.\n\n472\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.405\nYou wanna leave that checked off,\nit is by default.\n\n473\n00:23:29.405 --> 00:23:33.945\nThat's gonna give us the ability to bring\nin all of the connection certificates\n\n474\n00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:38.315\nrequired to be able to secure the connect\nand manage SCVMM through the portal.\n\n475\n00:23:38.315 --> 00:23:41.525\nIf you don't do that, you're then gonna\nhave to import them as a secondary step.\n\n476\n00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:44.015\nSo, just be aware of that,\nso I've done all that.\n\n477\n00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:46.145\nIt takes a minute, doesn't take very long.\n\n478\n00:23:46.145 --> 00:23:49.668\nOnce we've done that, we then can\ncome down here under Connections, so\n\n479\n00:23:49.668 --> 00:23:51.129\nyou'll see under Settings.\n\n480\n00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:55.711\nUnder Connections, and aside from\nthe ones that are already there,\n\n481\n00:23:55.711 --> 00:23:59.188\nyou'll see that I have ITPROtv,\nSCVMM right here.\n\n482\n00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:03.964\nThis is the one that I just Describe to\nyou I would create you could see just\n\n483\n00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:07.581\nthe information I told you\nwould be there right there.\n\n484\n00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:12.157\nAnd you'll see that as I said if you don't\nimport the certificates during the Wizard\n\n485\n00:24:12.157 --> 00:24:15.768\nthere is a import certificates option or\ncertificates change, or\n\n486\n00:24:15.768 --> 00:24:16.895\nadd it or modify it.\n\n487\n00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:18.809\nWe can go ahead and\nadd it in there as well.\n\n488\n00:24:18.809 --> 00:24:21.832\nSo you could always go in and add them or\nimport them after the fact, so\n\n489\n00:24:21.832 --> 00:24:23.420\nyou could see how to do that.\n\n490\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.715\nNow, once I've done that,\nI do then have access to or\n\n491\n00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:30.106\nwill have access to,\nas soon as I go back, there we go.\n\n492\n00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:34.069\nI will have access to any Clouds\nthat have been created and or\n\n493\n00:24:34.069 --> 00:24:37.410\nany services that may be deployed or\ncreated.\n\n494\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.490\nVirtual Machines that may be deployed or\ncreated etc.\n\n495\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.710\nYou could see I don't have any of those\nthings right now but you could see\n\n496\n00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:48.020\nthat they would be there and I could then\nuse them and see them interact with them.\n\n497\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.990\nManage them from here,\nbecause I'm linked to SCVM now.\n\n498\n00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.540\nNow, I also have the ability here to\nconnect to a Windows Azure subscription\n\n499\n00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.320\nand go out and\nconnect to the Microsoft Azure fabric,\n\n500\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.430\nwhich is another element that app\ncontroller lets us work with.\n\n501\n00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.930\nYou gotta have Azure connectivity,\nmeaning you need Internet connectivity.\n\n502\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.050\nYou need the Azure, what am I thinking of?\n\n503\n00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Profile.\n\n504\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.480\n&gt;&gt; No, the, sounds like, two words, right.\n\n505\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.380\nNo, user account, we need the Azure\nuser account to be able to.\n\n506\n00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.620\nWe talked about this in other\nepisodes where we keep reminding you,\n\n507\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.295\nhey, you can get that free trial.\n\n508\n00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:23.310\n$200 in service credits.\n\n509\n00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.600\nGo out, click on the button,\ncreate the profile.\n\n510\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.940\nIt is like a profile, it is that.\n\n511\n00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.730\nBut we're actually talking\nabout the credential,\n\n512\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.240\nthe user account that we wold\nneed to be able to log in.\n\n513\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.960\nSo we're kinda both right, that's a half-\n&gt;&gt; Half pump?\n\n514\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.462\n&gt;&gt; A half first-bump there for that.\n\n515\n00:25:35.462 --> 00:25:37.782\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we have that, and so we need that.\n\n516\n00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:42.760\nAnd once we connect up,\nwe're able to sync to the Azure Cloud.\n\n517\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.830\nWe're able to deploy virtual\nmachines into the Azure Cloud\n\n518\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:46.830\nthrough the app controller.\n\n519\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.150\nBut we gotta create that\nconnectivity first.\n\n520\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.558\nYeah so if we do this,\nyou'll see it brings up the,\n\n521\n00:25:51.558 --> 00:25:54.582\nhey how do we connect to\nthe Windows Azure subscription window,\n\n522\n00:25:54.582 --> 00:25:57.677\nagain names of description\n&gt;&gt; That's where you put your account\n\n523\n00:25:57.677 --> 00:25:58.490\ncredentials.\n\n524\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.065\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna put your\ncertificates in there but\n\n525\n00:26:01.065 --> 00:26:04.152\nmost importantly what we use at\nthis point is our subscription ID.\n\n526\n00:26:04.152 --> 00:26:08.000\nSo its actually not the credential but\nit does it just get refered to that way.\n\n527\n00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.640\nBut it's actually the subscriber ID.\n\n528\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.081\nWhich is the unique ID, you could see\nit's a 36 character string there,\n\n529\n00:26:13.081 --> 00:26:16.416\nbut you'll see it's gonna actually be\nyou pull it off your Windows Azure\n\n530\n00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:19.388\nsubscription on the Azure side\nin the Azure management portal.\n\n531\n00:26:19.388 --> 00:26:21.545\nAnd that's what you put in\nthere that identifies you, and\n\n532\n00:26:21.545 --> 00:26:23.966\nthen you have to authenticate a log\nin as you're going through and\n\n533\n00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:26.139\nconfiguring it and\nall that stuff then actually happens.\n\n534\n00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:31.172\nSo we need that we will connect out to\nthe Azure fabric if we had the reason to.\n\n535\n00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:33.952\nYou can also add here\nan external hosting provider,\n\n536\n00:26:33.952 --> 00:26:36.600\nan external service provider connection.\n\n537\n00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.385\nSo, we can click here and you'll see that\nwe can go ahead, let me just see if we\n\n538\n00:26:40.385 --> 00:26:44.135\ncan, yeah there we, just get rid of\nthat little warning annoying item.\n\n539\n00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:47.165\nConnection name, service locations,\ncertificate, file, password for\n\n540\n00:26:47.165 --> 00:26:48.525\nan external service provider.\n\n541\n00:26:48.525 --> 00:26:53.027\nThis would be a service provider that\ndoes cloud services that's not Microsoft,\n\n542\n00:26:53.027 --> 00:26:55.977\nif you think about the logic of it,\nbecause how do we connect to an external\n\n543\n00:26:55.977 --> 00:26:59.157\nservice provider when it's\nthe Azure fabric in Microsoft?\n\n544\n00:26:59.157 --> 00:27:00.777\nWe use the other one I just showed you.\n\n545\n00:27:00.777 --> 00:27:05.307\nBut when it's a non Microsoft third party\nprovider, we used this generic wizard.\n\n546\n00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:08.217\nSo we have this here, and we have\nthe ability to be able to step through and\n\n547\n00:27:08.217 --> 00:27:09.167\ndo all this.\n\n548\n00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:13.697\nPlease if you take a look here, and I'm\ncovering this, here we go, you'll see that\n\n549\n00:27:13.697 --> 00:27:18.340\nwe have, and this is important to know\nbecause obviously things change on\n\n550\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.050\na rolling basis in cloud services, you may\nneed to update or know about information\n\n551\n00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:28.060\nthat may not necessarily be obvious and\nis gonna be important to you.\n\n552\n00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.220\nUse these built in help links,\nthings like how I manage services?\n\n553\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:31.912\nHow do I create templates,\n\n554\n00:27:31.912 --> 00:27:34.050\nwe're gonna take a look at\nservice templates in a minute.\n\n555\n00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.980\nHow do i obtain\na Windows Azure subscription,\n\n556\n00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.360\nvery important to be able to\ndo that as we talked about.\n\n557\n00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.610\nHow do I set up any and\nall of these things?\n\n558\n00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.800\nHow do I take care of all the various\nelements we're dealing with?\n\n559\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.210\nGotta make sure we know that.\n\n560\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.440\nSo common tasks, right connecting in.\n\n561\n00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.310\nThis just is another link to\nthe same thing that we've done up\n\n562\n00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.620\nabove with the wizard.\n\n563\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.560\nSo it's important for\n\n564\n00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.900\nus to know that we will have\nthe capability to use the app controller,\n\n565\n00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.300\nto be able to connect out and to then\nprovide this portal so users can login.\n\n566\n00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.580\nAnd when they do you'll think\nabout the fact that as the systems\n\n567\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.590\ncenter virtual machine manager admin, or\nthe Windows Azure Fabric Administrator,\n\n568\n00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.980\ncontrolling that fabric,\ncontrolling the infrastructure.\n\n569\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.490\nI'd have a job here to log in and\nconfigure this initially.\n\n570\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.885\nBut once I do that, I then have the\nability here under user roles to be able\n\n571\n00:28:19.885 --> 00:28:24.714\nto go in, and I have the ability as you\ncan see, as the administrator right now,\n\n572\n00:28:24.714 --> 00:28:28.203\nI have the ability to be able to go and\ndo my full work here.\n\n573\n00:28:28.203 --> 00:28:32.438\nBut I may be given users the ability to\nlogin here with other capabilities, and\n\n574\n00:28:32.438 --> 00:28:34.747\nto be able to use this\nas an administrator,\n\n575\n00:28:34.747 --> 00:28:39.570\nit's got delegated rights or just as this\nadmin, it depends on what they're doing.\n\n576\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.320\nBut I may give other users the right\nto do this and to go in and\n\n577\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.640\nstart to work with these systems as well.\n\n578\n00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.780\nCuz remember,\nwe can use this as a stepping stone portal\n\n579\n00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.130\nto deploy our VMs into the cloud, to\ndeploy them out to a third party provider.\n\n580\n00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.486\nSo we do want to make sure that we're\naware of that and we're thinking about\n\n581\n00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:58.597\nthe logic of what App Controller\nprovides us the capabilities to do.\n\n582\n00:28:58.597 --> 00:29:02.870\nThe specifics of how we're gonna connect\nup, and let me show you why we're here.\n\n583\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.720\nSo, deploying the system\ncenter 2012 R2 App controller.\n\n584\n00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.343\nWhat do we do to get that stood up?\n\n585\n00:29:07.343 --> 00:29:10.202\nAs I said could do that on\na separate walk through with you, so\n\n586\n00:29:10.202 --> 00:29:12.408\nyou'll be able to see what's involved.\n\n587\n00:29:12.408 --> 00:29:15.981\nBut you could give it a quick look here,\nyeah we have the links to install\n\n588\n00:29:15.981 --> 00:29:18.976\nin configuring, how we set up,\nand back up, and restore.\n\n589\n00:29:18.976 --> 00:29:20.996\nIf we have to get rid of it,\nhow we uninstall it.\n\n590\n00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:23.410\nHow to manage those user roles\nthat I was just showing you.\n\n591\n00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.360\nHow we create and use them if we're gonna\ndelegate rights out in the console.\n\n592\n00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.840\nHow we set up all the different\naspects of what we need,\n\n593\n00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.540\nincluding adding\nmultilingual support here.\n\n594\n00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.410\nThere are system requirements that\nare important for app controller.\n\n595\n00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.160\nDon't be thrown off by the fact that\nSystem Center 2012 SP1 is what's on there.\n\n596\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.922\nThe SP1 requirements are the same for\n2012 R2, just so\n\n597\n00:29:43.922 --> 00:29:46.968\nyou know, so these are the requirements\nyou would operate under.\n\n598\n00:29:46.968 --> 00:29:50.813\nBut you'll see, we need some minimum\nhardware on the server side,\n\n599\n00:29:50.813 --> 00:29:54.198\nwe do have supported OS's, so\nwe have to take note of that.\n\n600\n00:29:54.198 --> 00:29:58.034\nThe .NET framework needs to be there,\nthe IIS role needs to be there set up and\n\n601\n00:29:58.034 --> 00:29:59.770\ninstantiated a certain way.\n\n602\n00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.410\nWe need the VMM console feature available\non the box where we're gonna run\n\n603\n00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.375\nApp Controller.\n\n604\n00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:07.330\nIt's running on my SC VMM server,\nso that makes sense.\n\n605\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.230\nThey need the supported version of SQL.\n\n606\n00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.990\nSo the database requirements in\nterms of what's supported here,\n\n607\n00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.570\nyou'll see SQL 2008 R-2 all the way\nup to 12 Enterprise, right.\n\n608\n00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.226\nSo you just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that, and\n\n609\n00:30:19.226 --> 00:30:22.845\nknow that these are the kind of things\nincluding performance and scale.\n\n610\n00:30:22.845 --> 00:30:26.985\nAnd we do have some maximums here on the\nnumber of items in terms of scale limits\n\n611\n00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:31.128\nthat are provided, this would probably\nbe really important information for\n\n612\n00:30:31.128 --> 00:30:33.110\nyou right here, to take note of.\n\n613\n00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.060\nCertainly in the real world, but\n\n614\n00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.520\nI am thinking also maybe just\nfrom an exam prep perspective.\n\n615\n00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.220\nWould you like to ask us,\nhey how many of these things can\n\n616\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.860\nhappen before we hit a brick\nwall kind of questions.\n\n617\n00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.590\nAnd things like number of jobs that\ncould be run at a 24 hour interval.\n\n618\n00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.760\nHey, do you know what that number is?\n\n619\n00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.100\nOff the top of your head,\nyou may or may not, it's 10,000.\n\n620\n00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.061\nAnd as Cherokee's squinting trying to\nsee what that looks like from across\n\n621\n00:30:53.061 --> 00:30:54.662\nthe room here, that's 10,000.\n\n622\n00:30:54.662 --> 00:30:57.580\nMaximum number of concurrent user\nconnections into the app controller.\n\n623\n00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.390\n75, so you kinda go through here, but\nI would definitely take a look at this.\n\n624\n00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.860\nAs we're setting up the App Controller,\nwould be helpful for\n\n625\n00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.690\nyou just to know what's going on there.\n\n626\n00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.880\nWith regards to Cloud Services and\nspecifically the linkage of\n\n627\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.490\nsomebody lie App Controller into the Azure\nFabric and certificates needed to do that.\n\n628\n00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.150\nAnd I talked about the importance\nof importing the certificates just\n\n629\n00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.050\na minute ago.\n\n630\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.605\nIf you need a little primer and\noverview on it, you could see right here,\n\n631\n00:31:22.605 --> 00:31:25.360\nwe've got a little page on\nthe Azure Fabric web site.\n\n632\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.870\nAgain, I'm just pointing out,\nFREE ACCOUNT,\n\n633\n00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.435\nright there, go out and set up\nthe subscription, get it configured,\n\n634\n00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:34.280\n$200 in free hosting credits, be important\nfor you to be thinking about that.\n\n635\n00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.210\nBut we got a nice little primer here\nabout the different certificate types\n\n636\n00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.089\nthat are on file and usable with Azure.\n\n637\n00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.197\nThe management certificates, so the types\nwe're talking about specifically for\n\n638\n00:31:43.197 --> 00:31:43.999\nthe app controller.\n\n639\n00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:45.518\nThose are the ones you saw me import or\n\n640\n00:31:45.518 --> 00:31:48.030\nat least that I showed you that\nwere imported, I should say.\n\n641\n00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.770\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n642\n00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.287\nWe can use our own new self signed\ncertificates if we wanna do this\n\n643\n00:31:53.287 --> 00:31:55.388\nourselves with our own internal PKI.\n\n644\n00:31:55.388 --> 00:31:58.514\nSo, public key infrastructure,\ncertificate architecture.\n\n645\n00:31:58.514 --> 00:32:00.069\nSo, we just wanna make sure\nyou read through this.\n\n646\n00:32:00.069 --> 00:32:03.137\nIt may just be Able to give you\na quick heads up primer and\n\n647\n00:32:03.137 --> 00:32:05.026\noverview that will be valuable.\n\n648\n00:32:05.026 --> 00:32:08.216\nThere's also the MakeCert\nutility that can be referenced.\n\n649\n00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:11.870\nIt's no longer, as you can see here,\nbeing supported going forward.\n\n650\n00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.716\nIt's deprecated but it's still out there.\n\n651\n00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:15.910\nDepending on the version you're running,\nyou may be be able to use it.\n\n652\n00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.390\nSo, if you want to take note of that,\nthere's some information on it here.\n\n653\n00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.570\nAnd of course, PowerShell always present,\nalways available, right?\n\n654\n00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.563\nIf we're going to go in and use\nPowerShell to manipulate and manage and\n\n655\n00:32:25.563 --> 00:32:27.553\nconfigure our certificates,\nwe can do that.\n\n656\n00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:30.020\nYou see the information on it there.\n\n657\n00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.650\nSo you may want to take a look at that.\n\n658\n00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.180\nAnd then more broadly, just the Azure\ndocumentation website overall for any and\n\n659\n00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.960\neverything we're talking about with Azure.\n\n660\n00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.532\nYou'll see here the general link to it.\n\n661\n00:32:39.532 --> 00:32:42.799\nAnd again, these URLs are in the show\nnotes for you, remind you of that and\n\n662\n00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:46.556\nencourage you to go out, take advantage of\nthem, take a look at them, and use them.\n\n663\n00:32:46.556 --> 00:32:49.471\nI just put this one in because this\ngives you the landing page for\n\n664\n00:32:49.471 --> 00:32:52.504\nall the different Azure services,\neverything you'd wanna do.\n\n665\n00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:54.214\nYou'd obviously have to search and\n\n666\n00:32:54.214 --> 00:32:57.000\nfind the appropriate area\nthat you wanna read up on.\n\n667\n00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.113\nBut you can see here that all of our\ndifferent categories of usage are listed,\n\n668\n00:33:01.113 --> 00:33:04.666\nand there's documentation associated\nwith each of them as we go.\n\n669\n00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:08.561\nSo you can certainly take a look there if\nyou are interested in figuring out how to\n\n670\n00:33:08.561 --> 00:33:12.400\nleverage our documentation to better\nunderstand the product, in this case,\n\n671\n00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.520\nlet's say, app control linked to Azure.\n\n672\n00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.920\nBut we can deploy virtual machines to\nMicrosoft Azure from the app controller,\n\n673\n00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.913\nas we suggested.\n\n674\n00:33:19.913 --> 00:33:21.363\nYou just into the virtual machine page.\n\n675\n00:33:21.363 --> 00:33:24.938\nAnd I'll just quickly show you this\nitem just to give you a sense of\n\n676\n00:33:24.938 --> 00:33:26.820\nwhat can happen here, right?\n\n677\n00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.915\nSo we have our virtual machine page right\nhere, and we'd be able to go in and\n\n678\n00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:35.400\nonce our virtual machines are populated\nfrom SCVMM, we can right-click here and\n\n679\n00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.513\nthen we can deploy.\n\n680\n00:33:36.513 --> 00:33:39.400\nWe would just essentially\nchoose deploy to Windows Azure.\n\n681\n00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.500\nWe'd copy the VM and\nthen put up a new deployment.\n\n682\n00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.390\nA new deployment diagram will open up.\n\n683\n00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.566\nWe'll click configure and\nwe'll walk through the, just name it and\n\n684\n00:33:47.566 --> 00:33:49.500\nwalk through a couple of the steps there.\n\n685\n00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.014\nWe'll configure the cloud service, we'll\nconfigure the virtual machine tile, so\n\n686\n00:33:53.014 --> 00:33:56.154\nwe'll just configure all the different\nelements of how that's gonna run.\n\n687\n00:33:56.154 --> 00:34:00.279\nSpecify the destination container up in\nthe Azure platform, so where are we gonna\n\n688\n00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:03.647\nhost it on or in the Azure Fabric\nthat we already are subscribed to.\n\n689\n00:34:03.647 --> 00:34:06.671\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe just click deploy,\n\n690\n00:34:06.671 --> 00:34:11.104\nthe virtual machine when we do deploy it\nout from here has to be in a stored state.\n\n691\n00:34:11.104 --> 00:34:12.916\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n692\n00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:14.895\nIt’s not gonna be running live,\nin other words.\n\n693\n00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:18.690\nIt’s gonna be essentially in a turned\noff state that we're gonna deploy up.\n\n694\n00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.060\nAnd then once we've done that,\nwe can go ahead and\n\n695\n00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.090\nstart working with it and have it going.\n\n696\n00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:28.810\nSo this is not a live migration, real-time\ndeployment of a running VM by bouncing it\n\n697\n00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:34.340\nbetween our SCVMM infrastructure locally\non-prem and the Azure Fabric in the cloud.\n\n698\n00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.760\nWe're moving a VM that is stored so that\nwe can then bring it back up, spin it up\n\n699\n00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.860\nand run it in the Azure Fabric after it\nis deployed, just to be clear about that.\n\n700\n00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.697\nBut this is what we would be able to do.\n\n701\n00:34:44.697 --> 00:34:48.413\nAnd we could do a lot of these kinds\nof activities, as I pointed out,\n\n702\n00:34:48.413 --> 00:34:50.970\nright or\nengage in these kinds of activities.\n\n703\n00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:55.477\nBut remember, the key here, link this to\nSCVMM, so we can bring in and populate\n\n704\n00:34:55.477 --> 00:34:59.804\nthese items and then use this as a staging\narea to then deploy into the cloud.\n\n705\n00:34:59.804 --> 00:35:01.753\nWe've been focusing on Azure but remember,\n\n706\n00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:05.490\nwe have the capability to manage alternate\nplatform providers here, as well.\n\n707\n00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.560\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n708\n00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.620\nAll right, good.\n\n709\n00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.250\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n710\n00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.130\n&gt;&gt; So far.\n\n711\n00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.178\n&gt;&gt; At least then,\nwe'll know how to go ahead and\n\n712\n00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:17.996\nschedule our service Windows or\nmaintenance Windows accordingly if we\n\n713\n00:35:17.996 --> 00:35:21.625\nwere performing a live\nmigration versus non-live.\n\n714\n00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:25.122\n&gt;&gt; Well, we wouldn't necessarily have to\nworry about that here, because remember,\n\n715\n00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:28.618\nwe're not actually dealing with a live VM,\nit's gonna be shut off, in theory, and\n\n716\n00:35:28.618 --> 00:35:29.390\nported out.\n\n717\n00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.620\nWe're most likely gonna be dealing with\nsome sort of a VM that's templated\n\n718\n00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.238\nthat we have that's probably just a copy\nof something that's saved off that we're\n\n719\n00:35:36.238 --> 00:35:37.020\ngonna deploy up.\n\n720\n00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.192\nWe wouldn't wanna interrupt production,\nin that respect.\n\n721\n00:35:39.192 --> 00:35:41.885\nSo chances are good we wouldn't have to\nnecessarily be aware of that, but yeah,\n\n722\n00:35:41.885 --> 00:35:43.151\nit's good to know that, in general,\n\n723\n00:35:43.151 --> 00:35:44.715\ncertainly we can align\nwith that if we need to.\n\n724\n00:35:44.715 --> 00:35:45.453\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n725\n00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:46.465\n&gt;&gt; Good, all right, so we're-\n&gt;&gt; What about service templates,\n\n726\n00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:47.143\nare we gonna take a look at those?\n\n727\n00:35:47.143 --> 00:35:49.521\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, well, do we have\nenough time to take a look at those,\n\n728\n00:35:49.521 --> 00:35:50.351\nis what I was gonna say.\n\n729\n00:35:50.351 --> 00:35:54.596\nI'm thinking we may have to actually\ncreate a, as we call it here, part two.\n\n730\n00:35:54.596 --> 00:35:55.206\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, okay, we can do that.\n\n731\n00:35:55.206 --> 00:35:57.136\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm thinking that's\nprobably more than a couple minutes\n\n732\n00:35:57.136 --> 00:35:57.863\nconversation, right?\n\n733\n00:35:57.863 --> 00:35:59.387\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah,\nwe don't wanna short change service.\n\n734\n00:35:59.387 --> 00:36:01.599\n&gt;&gt; No, we don't, but we wanna make\nsure we get a look under the hood.\n\n735\n00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.093\n&gt;&gt; Or short change you.\n\n736\n00:36:03.093 --> 00:36:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Or short change you.\n\n737\n00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.450\nCherokee is in rare form today.\n\n738\n00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.691\nDid you have that caffeine water during\nlunch, is that what was going on?\n\n739\n00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:09.328\n&gt;&gt; Something.\n\n740\n00:36:09.328 --> 00:36:10.513\n&gt;&gt; Something during lunch.\n\n741\n00:36:10.513 --> 00:36:12.482\nAll right, so we will be coming back and\n\n742\n00:36:12.482 --> 00:36:15.658\ntaking a look at what we're just\nhinting at and talking about.\n\n743\n00:36:15.658 --> 00:36:18.708\nAnd just to give you a little taste of\nit before we go away and come back,\n\n744\n00:36:18.708 --> 00:36:20.724\nif you go back to the console for\njust a second,\n\n745\n00:36:20.724 --> 00:36:24.035\nwhat you'll see is we're gonna go up\ninto this area, again in the library,\n\n746\n00:36:24.035 --> 00:36:26.885\nwhere we started out I was pointing\nout that we have templates.\n\n747\n00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:28.780\nWe’re gonna go up where to take\na look at the Service Templates.\n\n748\n00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.640\nYou have one already deployed there,\nI'm gonna show you how to create that,\n\n749\n00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.510\ntell you what it is.\n\n750\n00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.680\nWe're gonna show you how to\nright-click on this thing and\n\n751\n00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.680\nactually deploy this service,\nyou'll see we can do that right there.\n\n752\n00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.520\nAnd once we've done that, we'll actually\nbe able to go in, and we'll actually be\n\n753\n00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.909\nable to reference that service and see it\ndeployed and see what it looks like here.\n\n754\n00:36:44.909 --> 00:36:46.737\nSo we're gonna be able to come back and\ntake a look at that.\n\n755\n00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.842\nBut that will be in two\nclicks of the mouse.\n\n756\n00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:50.139\n&gt;&gt; Part two [LAUGH].\n\n757\n00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:52.205\n&gt;&gt; Part two, as we say, so\ndo come back and join us for that.\n\n758\n00:36:52.205 --> 00:36:55.256\n&gt;&gt; Well, we look forward to\nseeing you there in part two.\n\n759\n00:36:55.256 --> 00:36:57.366\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n760\n00:36:57.366 --> 00:36:59.302\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n761\n00:36:59.302 --> 00:37:00.075\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n762\n00:37:00.075 --> 00:37:03.127\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n763\n00:37:03.127

00:00:08.220\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.033\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.410\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your Configuring\n&amp; Deploying a Private Cloud Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.320\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.090\nThis is actually a part two where we're\nreally examining how to deploy and\n\n8\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.860\nconfigure access to a private cloud, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.370\nwe really wanted to spend some extra\ntime looking at service templates.\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.890\nSo to explain this concept with us today,\nback in studio we have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.910\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.800\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nThank you for\n\n13\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410\nthe opportunity to continue discussing.\n\n14\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.587\nSo we can almost say\nthis is a micro episode.\n\n15\n00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:39.884\nFocused mostly on-\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of a micro episode.\n\n16\n00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.560\n&gt;&gt; Service templates, right?\n\n17\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.950\nSo its a micro episode,\n\n18\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.690\nmeaning I got to talk really fast\ncuz we gotta finish quickly.\n\n19\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420\nSo let's not waste any more time.\n\n20\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.524\nAll right so we're just gonna focus on, as\nCherokee was saying, really just the last\n\n21\n00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:54.830\nelement in this conversation block\nabout the idea of how we deploy and\n\n22\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.075\nconfigure access for the private cloud.\n\n23\n00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:58.925\nWe wanna just spend a couple of minutes,\nand\n\n24\n00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.655\nit really won't be much more than that,\nactually It'll be a short episode for\n\n25\n00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.345\nyou on the concept of service template.\n\n26\n00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:04.875\nSo let's jump in and take a look.\n\n27\n00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:06.575\nThe idea of a service template,\n\n28\n00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.332\nof any template really, is the idea of\ndefining all the elements that contain\n\n29\n00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:12.702\nthe thing that we wanna be\nable to deploy and manage.\n\n30\n00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:15.821\nIn this case a service template\nis focused on a deployment and\n\n31\n00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:18.817\nmanagement of services out\ninto the private cloud, or for\n\n32\n00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:22.712\nthe private cloud customers,\nthe tenants that are consuming it.\n\n33\n00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:25.874\nIn order to set up this service template,\nwe're gonna be able to go in,\n\n34\n00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:29.479\ngonna go to our library that you saw right\nhere, go to our Service Template area.\n\n35\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.430\nI've already got a service\ntemplate deployed.\n\n36\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120\nI've just created one\ncalled ITPro Service 1.\n\n37\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.530\nBut to do this, it's very straightforward,\nright-click Create Service Template.\n\n38\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.780\nWe have three options here.\n\n39\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.910\nLet me just draw this over so\n\n40\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.040\nyou can see what the template designer,\nwhat this looks like.\n\n41\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.560\nWe have the ability to\nbe able to use a blank\n\n42\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.530\nslate to kind of just create our\nown template as we would like, and\n\n43\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.930\nset up the service in what ever\nway we would want to do this in.\n\n44\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.360\nA single machine, a two tier or\n\n45\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.140\na three tier application, and we have\nchoices here, if we do a three tier,\n\n46\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.850\nthen we're gonna have different levels\nwe have to provide and program in.\n\n47\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.670\nIf we do a two tier we'll have two levels,\nso let's just go ahead and this case,\n\n48\n00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.270\ncuz I did a blank one last time,\nlet's do a two tier.\n\n49\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.070\nJust click OK just to show you that,\nand we obviously want to name that.\n\n50\n00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.780\nI didn't bother naming it,\nit just took the generic name\n\n51\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.670\nof new service template one, but you want\nto name it just so you know what that is.\n\n52\n00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.080\nBut you can see, and let me just make\nthis full size here, you'll see that with\n\n53\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.190\nthe service template designer what we\nnow have is the service template here,\n\n54\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.370\nand we have first tier,\n\n55\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.495\nsecond tier, and in the tier,\ncan we go fullscreen so you can see this?\n\n56\n00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:38.810\nIt may be a little hard to\nsee some of the detail there.\n\n57\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920\nYou'll see we can add applications, and\nwe can, I'm just clicking there to add\n\n58\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.720\napplications, and you'll see that we have\nthe ability to interact with this here and\n\n59\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320\nprovide information on the application.\n\n60\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.040\nWe have the ability to\nbe able to specify here\n\n61\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.670\nthe OS name, and again,\nnone of this has been programmed in yet.\n\n62\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.010\nSo when I click you're seeing errors,\nbecause we haven't provided any of this\n\n63\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.030\ninformation and you'll see that we\nhave the configuration for this,\n\n64\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.280\nthe CPU and all that, and it says, just\nover here if we can just drag this over,\n\n65\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.200\njust get this out of the way for a second.\n\n66\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.310\nJust so you can see it.\n\n67\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.350\nDrag VM Templates onto the canvas\nhere to create a new tier.\n\n68\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.790\nCopy VM Templates if you wanna do that.\n\n69\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.780\nSo we can add VMs in here\nfrom our VM Template area.\n\n70\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.990\nLet me show you what I'm talking about,\nlet me just close that for a minute.\n\n71\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.040\nRemember our VM Templates are sitting\nover here if we have any created.\n\n72\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.623\nWe haven't created any but we could create\na VM template as you see here, and so\n\n73\n00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:41.697\nif we wanted to create a VM template we\nwould go in just pull this, Down here,\n\n74\n00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:47.010\nand let me see, how are we gonna,\nwell, yeah, there we go.\n\n75\n00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.810\nOkay, perfect.\n\n76\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.330\nSo when we do a VM template, we can either\nuse an existing template or hard drive,\n\n77\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.520\nin other words, or decide that\nwe're gonna use an existing virtual\n\n78\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.590\nmachine that's already\nconfigured as our template.\n\n79\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.020\nIt would be up to us to decide but\nI can just go ahead and\n\n80\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.950\nuse an existing VM template or hard drive,\nand I can go in and grab that hard drive.\n\n81\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.780\nWe've seen these in some of the other-\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about this.\n\n82\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.710\n&gt;&gt; Episodes,\nwe've done this before, right?\n\n83\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.960\n&gt;&gt; Basically like a kind of smaller or\nbigger.\n\n84\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, small or large,\nand they're two types.\n\n85\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.280\nRemember VHDX and VHD, cuz remember\nwe support older and newer, right?\n\n86\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.420\nSo we could do let's say large hard\ndrive there, so we'll specify that.\n\n87\n00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.700\nOkay, so just put that in there, changes\nthis one out for us, you can see that and\n\n88\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.540\nthen once we've done,\nthat me just hide the taskbar here,\n\n89\n00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.970\njust one second,\nthat way we can see the bottom.\n\n90\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.120\n&gt;&gt; And you also said, Adam,\nwe're not bound by this generic template.\n\n91\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.860\nWe could also customize as well if\nwe wanted an extra large per se.\n\n92\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is just the standard for\n\n93\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.320\nhard drives that are in\nthe template area that are stored,\n\n94\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.470\nin other words in the libraries,\nfiles that we use out of the gate.\n\n95\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.180\nBut we could add to\nthose library resources.\n\n96\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.940\nWe would upload hard drives that have\nbeen pre-configured maybe with an OS and\n\n97\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.970\nother stuff, already.\n\n98\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.510\nSo remember, these are blank hard drives,\nthey have nothing on them.\n\n99\n00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.260\nWe may want to use one that's got Windows\nServer 12 R2 data center already deployed.\n\n100\n00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.580\n&gt;&gt; Ready to go.\n&gt;&gt; And just set up and\n\n101\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.400\nwe would load that as a resource up into\nthe library, and have it available, and\n\n102\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.460\nthen the agent will pick that up after\nit sinks, and then it'll show up there,\n\n103\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.780\nand then we're able to do that.\n\n104\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.090\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n105\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.900\nSo the VM Template name,\nlet's just call this\n\n106\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.350\nITProTV1Temp, something like that,\nwhatever it is.\n\n107\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.590\nWe have to specify\nthe generation of the VMs.\n\n108\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.460\nRemember, we've talked about\nthis Gen 1 versus Gen 2.\n\n109\n00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.924\nGen 1 is the older VM, Gen 2 is the newer\none that supports the UEFI BIOS,\n\n110\n00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:33.734\nas opposed to the older BIOS.\n\n111\n00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.890\nIt'd be up to us to decide what to do.\n\n112\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.760\nSo if we do Gen 2, specify next, and\n\n113\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.250\nthey talked about generation found at the\nbottom there on the par screen by the way,\n\n114\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.680\nand then we have our ability here as you\ncan see to bring in some of the profiles.\n\n115\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.760\nLet me move this back over, so\n\n116\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.770\nthat you can see what I'm talking\nabout when I say profiles.\n\n117\n00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.740\nHere it says here, hardware profile\ndefault, the hardware profile, as we've\n\n118\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.150\ntalked about in the prior episodes, when\nwe went through profiles, would be listed.\n\n119\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.530\nYou would have already\ncreated those obviously and\n\n120\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.730\nyou could bring that in here, and specify\nwhatever hardware profile you may have, so\n\n121\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.670\nwe could add that in.\n\n122\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.730\nYou'll see that we have the profile,\n\n123\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.200\nit's the default profile\nconfigured a certain way.\n\n124\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.240\nWe would check off what kind of\ncapability profiles we wanna have,\n\n125\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.841\nnotice our capability profiles,\n\n126\n00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:22.670\nthe ones we've talked about in the prior\nepisodes here as well, and we could,\n\n127\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.210\nwell let me just move this out so you can\nsee, the capability profile it created\n\n128\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.260\nin the prior episode, the Server 12 R2\nprofiles there, HyperV is there, etc.\n\n129\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.480\nSo you ought to be able to go in and\nselect what I want to use here,\n\n130\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.609\nas you can see and I would choose which\none, and notice they're exclusive.\n\n131\n00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:40.440\nI can't have more than one\nbecause it pre-configures\n\n132\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.090\nall the hardware elements that\nare off on the left-hand side.\n\n133\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.570\nSo it says, okay you'll get\nthis amount of hard drives,\n\n134\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.580\nyou'll get this amount of\nmemory all that stuff, and\n\n135\n00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.120\ndepending on what I choose,\neveryone of them is different.\n\n136\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.790\nSo, I'm gonna apply the appropriate\ncompatibility profile or\n\n137\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.250\nthe capability profile here\nunder compatibility, and\n\n138\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.340\nthat's how I would set this up, but\nI could also add in and modify to it.\n\n139\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.170\nNotice new here, I could do new hardware,\nnew disk, new Scuzzy adapter, DVD,\n\n140\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.720\nnetwork, fiber channel adapter,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n141\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.860\nSo I can modify and\nadd from here if necessary,\n\n142\n00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.170\nand I can click from any\none of these items and\n\n143\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.800\nedit out the capability profile\nafter it's been provided or applied.\n\n144\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.750\nIt's just that if I say hey, you know\nwhat, I want two process instead of one,\n\n145\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.850\nI can click there and\nadd two processors instead of one.\n\n146\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.380\nSo I can go ahead and modify any of this.\n\n147\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.000\nOnce I'm done with all this,\nI click, Next.\n\n148\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.190\nI then have the operating system,\n\n149\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.530\nessentially the same idea,\nremember I have a guest OS profile.\n\n150\n00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.860\nI'm able to bring that in as well.\n\n151\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.534\nYou'll see that up there if I have one,\nand then again, I'll just go through and\n\n152\n00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:42.292\nedit it out,\nthe standard default profile server 12 R2,\n\n153\n00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:46.153\nif that's what I chose on the other window\nwhere I did, so that's what's applied.\n\n154\n00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:50.727\nBut again, I can modify this, add in my\nproduct key, whatever the case may be,\n\n155\n00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:53.133\nif I choose to bring in a profile, right?\n\n156\n00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:56.578\nIt says none, customization's not\nrequired by default, nothing there.\n\n157\n00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:59.465\nBut great new Windows OS specification,\n\n158\n00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:03.020\nor system customization settings,\nor new Linux.\n\n159\n00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.090\nI can do this for either operating system,\nand I have that capability.\n\n160\n00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.210\nSo I can do that, if we do Windows\nthen I can open this up and\n\n161\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.810\nI can pull this down, and\nI can choose whatever OS I would like.\n\n162\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.753\nAnd I could choose whatever licensing, and\n\n163\n00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:17.178\nall that stuff becomes\navailable obviously, right?\n\n164\n00:08:17.178 --> 00:08:19.230\nSo I'd go through, I do all that.\n\n165\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.910\nThen I have my application configuration.\n\n166\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.350\nAgain, I've got my application profile.\n\n167\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.118\nI can bring that in right here, any of\nthose ones that I would have created prior\n\n168\n00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:30.301\nI'll be able to stack them up and\nadd them in.\n\n169\n00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.037\nVM Templates is a really cool place,\n\n170\n00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:34.618\nbecause essentially all it\nis Is a bunch of open boxes.\n\n171\n00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:37.324\nGonna go back to that bento box\nconcept that you mentioned, right?\n\n172\n00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:40.120\nIt's just essentially a bento box\n&gt;&gt; Super modular.\n\n173\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.360\n&gt;&gt; And super modular, right.\n\n174\n00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.909\nIt's like the Ikea of VM's, right?\n\n175\n00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.360\nSo we just have the ability to build\nall those different functional areas.\n\n176\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.840\nEither by applying a profile that's\npreconfigured and then modifying to suit.\n\n177\n00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.130\nOr just saying out of the box, I just\nwant a generic one, and I'll deploy that.\n\n178\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.060\nSo I've got the ability to essentially\nhang all these profiles on to\n\n179\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.820\nthis area, right?\n\n180\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.130\nSo I'm doing all that, and\n\n181\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.070\nnotice I can add here as well,\nI could add in applications, right?\n\n182\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.460\nThese are the applications that would have\nbeen built out, my script application,\n\n183\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.170\nmy SQL DAC, my data.\n\n184\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.850\nApplication tier, I could do virtual apps.\n\n185\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.060\nWe've talked about virtualized apps and\nthe Server App-V and the value of that.\n\n186\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.220\nA web app etc, so\nI have all those capabilities here.\n\n187\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.980\nWhen I'm done and I do,\n\n188\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.600\nif I'm doing a SQL server specifically,\nI could add SQL servers in here as well.\n\n189\n00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.220\nIf I'm gonna run SQL Servers\nspecifically in the VM,\n\n190\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.260\nprogram that out here as part\nof the service template.\n\n191\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.470\nAnd they offer it.\n\n192\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.380\nSo I have all that.\n\n193\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.220\nAnd then when I'm done,\njust click Create here real quick,\n\n194\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.620\njust kinda let that spin up, do its thing.\n\n195\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.480\nSo it's got that.\n\n196\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.050\nCreate the template.\n\n197\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.000\nLooks like it's all good.\n\n198\n00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:49.265\nAnd we've got our VM template now.\n\n199\n00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:52.965\nSee now if I go back and\nI create my service template as you saw,\n\n200\n00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:55.725\nI already had the beginning of\nthe service template created.\n\n201\n00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:58.280\nBut instead of this one,\nyou just get rid of this one.\n\n202\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.740\nAnd let's just delete this and we'll\njust start from scratch in other words,\n\n203\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.560\nand just create a brand new one.\n\n204\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.710\nSo let's go in, let's right-click.\n\n205\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.660\nAnd create a Service Template.\n\n206\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.300\nBy the way, just so you know, Create\nService Template up there on the ribbon as\n\n207\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.960\nwell, you could do it from either place.\n\n208\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.853\nAnd we can create a VM template\nright from up there also as you saw.\n\n209\n00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:19.230\nAll right, so if I do either a multi\ntier application or a single machine,\n\n210\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.960\nagain, choose whichever\none may make sense.\n\n211\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.100\nI can do this, right?\n\n212\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.810\nAnd I can bring in\nthe associated item that I want.\n\n213\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.618\nIf I have, what did I?\n\n214\n00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:36.691\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; No I'm just thinking and\n\n215\n00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.200\nI just made a stupid mistake as\nI was creating my VM template.\n\n216\n00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.510\nLet me go back and fix that real quick.\n\n217\n00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.620\nLet me show you what I did.\n\n218\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.450\nI just wasn't thinking.\n\n219\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.000\nWhat I was thinking, when I create the VM\ntemplate, I'll quickly bring it in, and\n\n220\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.120\nthen drag it over here.\n\n221\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.660\nI forgot that I created\nit as a gen two template.\n\n222\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.180\nAnd gen two templates are not supported\nin the VM template browser here.\n\n223\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.340\nWell yes it does and\n\n224\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.460\nhad I been thinking about that I would\nof seen it, but they are not supported.\n\n225\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.240\nThe reason that it’s not showing up here.\n\n226\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.120\nIf you look right down here,\n\n227\n00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.740\nit’s kind of hard to see, but you look\nright down there, it does tell you, hey,\n\n228\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.980\nthey're not supported,\nyou need a Gen1 template.\n\n229\n00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.760\nSo we can fix that, no big deal.\n\n230\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.644\nJust come over here real quick, let’s just\ngo and lets just crank out of VMware.\n\n231\n00:11:12.644 --> 00:11:14.800\nOr VM template that's a Gen 1 template.\n\n232\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.010\nAnd we'll call that Gen 1 just so we know,\n\n233\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:24.660\nmaking sure we don't choose Gen 2, and\nwe'll just all that other stuff alone.\n\n234\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.885\nAnd not really worry about any of that,\nand that should be created.\n\n235\n00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:31.195\nBoom, there we go,\nall right, so that's there.\n\n236\n00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:35.305\nSo now if we go back in here just open the\ndesigner we can edit that existing one.\n\n237\n00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:39.340\nYou see my templates right there, easy to\nfix, no big deal, and you'll see that.\n\n238\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.020\nI can drag this out,\n\n239\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.320\nand when I drag it out you'll notice\nit changes the service template.\n\n240\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.130\nAnd it actually populates that middle\ntier there, that box where it says,\n\n241\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.650\nhey provide the machine.\n\n242\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.490\nI just put the template on there and\npopulated it and profiled it,\n\n243\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.610\nset it up with the profiles and\nconfigured it.\n\n244\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.990\nSo now, my machine that's in\nthis template is gonna operate\n\n245\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.700\nthe way that generation\none VM is gonna operate.\n\n246\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.370\nInstead of me having to\ngo in edit everything,\n\n247\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.060\nI just use the templates to apply it, and\nthat's exactly what we do to create that.\n\n248\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.942\nAnd you'll notice down here.\n\n249\n00:12:10.942 --> 00:12:13.950\nSend up the network card, and\nall the things associated with it.\n\n250\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.200\nAnd now we could see all\nthe details down here.\n\n251\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.310\nBecause we can see that we have the owner\nof the template, whoever's there.\n\n252\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.730\nWe could see all the information\nassociated with it.\n\n253\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.925\nIf I click on any one of these areas I\ncould see the information about this and\n\n254\n00:12:26.925 --> 00:12:28.197\njust how it's setup.\n\n255\n00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:32.110\nAll right, so we have basically just\nthe guts of the template deployed.\n\n256\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.350\nWe're not gonna do a lot\nof customization in here.\n\n257\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.640\nSo just the idea of showing you how\nwe create the service template.\n\n258\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.550\nBut keeping in mind all of those profiles,\nand\n\n259\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.910\nall of those supporting elements that\nhave to be there to populate the VM and\n\n260\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.560\nthe service wanna have all\nthose built out ahead of time.\n\n261\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.570\nThat's really the secret of doing this,\nand we did all that.\n\n262\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.950\nSo now, if I wanna add a tier in here, add\na virtual machine network, a load balance.\n\n263\n00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.750\nYou see up here,\nI could any of those things.\n\n264\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.680\nI could add them in and additionally build\nout the template that's required to scale,\n\n265\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.840\nto be whatever I want it to be.\n\n266\n00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.120\nOnce it's done, I'll save and\nvalidate, so let's just do that.\n\n267\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.340\nOnce that is done, let me just go here.\n\n268\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.240\nYou'll see that my template has now been\nsaved, shows up in the list, ready to go.\n\n269\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.230\nNow keep in mind,\n\n270\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.660\ntemplates are not deployed until you\ndecide you want to do something with them.\n\n271\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.010\nThere's some that are just\nsitting in a library waiting for\n\n272\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.010\nyou to want to use them.\n\n273\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.910\nSo the template is sitting here, but\nwe haven't done anything with it.\n\n274\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.580\nNow I did deploy the ITProTV Service\n1 template as a service and\n\n275\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.460\nwe took a look at this.\n\n276\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.560\nLet me just remind you of that.\n\n277\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.320\nI can come over here to my VM's and\nservices area.\n\n278\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.890\nI can go to my all hosts which represents\nthe host group that generic host group.\n\n279\n00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.810\nAnd you'll see if I look at the overview\nitem here, I have a service here.\n\n280\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:47.400\nIf I go specifically to services I can\nsee the service that has been deployed\n\n281\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.880\nto this host group from\nthe service template.\n\n282\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.230\nThat's the service you're\nlooking at right there.\n\n283\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.610\nAnd if I wanna deploy the service\nI just created, I can do that.\n\n284\n00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.380\nLet me come over here and\nlet me do the following.\n\n285\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.629\nConfigure Deployment, give it a name.\n\n286\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.805\nAnd specify the destination.\n\n287\n00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:12.547\nI've only got a single\nhost group right now.\n\n288\n00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:14.950\nBut we've talked about the value of host\ngroups and how you would create them.\n\n289\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.590\nIn fact, you may have more than one.\n\n290\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.960\nRemember we said for instance we may\ncreate a history for Linux Unix systems.\n\n291\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.150\nSeparate one for Hyper V hosts, separate\none for web servers, things like that.\n\n292\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.230\nSo you may have a multitude of host\ngroups, you'll figure that out.\n\n293\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.290\nBut for now we're just gonna use our\ndefault, All Host Group Container.\n\n294\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.690\nThat's where we're gonna deploy it,\nwe gave it a name.\n\n295\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.100\nClick OK, that's done, essentially, right?\n\n296\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.850\nWe've got our little wizard here now.\n\n297\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.620\nIt's set up and ready to go.\n\n298\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.420\nWhen I say that's done,\n\n299\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.160\nwhat I mean is the service has\nnow been teed up for deployment.\n\n300\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.010\nWe now have our service here.\n\n301\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.510\nAll I have to do here is just simply\ngo in and say, hey, deploy the service.\n\n302\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.430\nLet's click right there, click Deploy.\n\n303\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.340\nService gets deployed out right there.\n\n304\n00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.330\nNow you'll notice this one failed.\n\n305\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.200\nThis one failed because I don't\nactually have all the profiles and\n\n306\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.440\nconstituent parts in the VM template\nbuilt out and available and serviceable.\n\n307\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.920\nThe first one I did didn't fail because I\ndidn't bother to put a VM template in it.\n\n308\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.871\nI just went ahead and said,\nhey, give me a blank one and\n\n309\n00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:10.460\njust deploy the service by itself.\n\n310\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.060\nSo the reason we get the failure is just\nbecause some of the specifics in those\n\n311\n00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.773\nitems I chose to quickly create the\ntemplate, are actually not configured and\n\n312\n00:15:17.773 --> 00:15:18.572\nsupported yet.\n\n313\n00:15:18.572 --> 00:15:20.184\n&gt;&gt; So, it's a good failure.\n\n314\n00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:21.882\nIt's like a little toll gate there.\n\n315\n00:15:21.882 --> 00:15:23.490\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's just telling us,\nhey, by the way,\n\n316\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.258\nwe can't actually make this work because\nyou don't really have all these things.\n\n317\n00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:29.309\nAnd that's fine, cuz we're doing\na quick demo just show you, and\n\n318\n00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:31.924\nwe expect that failure to happen\ngiven the way I did it just\n\n319\n00:15:31.924 --> 00:15:33.793\nquickly to fix the Gen 1, Gen 2 issue.\n\n320\n00:15:33.793 --> 00:15:36.595\nBut I wanted you to see the idea\nof how we would deploy it, and\n\n321\n00:15:36.595 --> 00:15:37.950\nthen when we come over here.\n\n322\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.897\nJust come back over here.\n\n323\n00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:44.000\nYou'll see that although it did not work\nit does still show up on the list here.\n\n324\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.380\nBut it gives us a problem,\nit says hey by the way, needs attention.\n\n325\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.273\nThere's an issue here, right?\n\n326\n00:15:50.273 --> 00:15:53.694\nAnd it says the Gen 1 machine needs\nattention specifically meaning as I\n\n327\n00:15:53.694 --> 00:15:57.066\nindicated there's a problem with\none of the selections I made there.\n\n328\n00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:00.978\nI didn't choose a compatibility\nprofile So, I didn't say, hey,\n\n329\n00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:04.008\nit's gonna be able to\nsupport this kind of hosting.\n\n330\n00:16:04.008 --> 00:16:05.627\nSo, as a result it's failing saying, hey,\n\n331\n00:16:05.627 --> 00:16:07.859\nwe don't know what you're\nactually gonna run on this thing.\n\n332\n00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:10.811\nBecause remember I went through so\nquickly, I just said, let me do this gen\n\n333\n00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:13.432\none, and I clicked through any one and\ndidn't bother to take my time.\n\n334\n00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:16.188\nI didn't create, or choose\na compatability profile to link it, and\n\n335\n00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:17.530\nthat's the problem I have here.\n\n336\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.820\nIf I go back and edit it,\n\n337\n00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.150\nredeploy it would actually fix itself\nwith no trouble and it'll be fine.\n\n338\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.950\nBut showing you the failures not\na bad idea as Cherokee suggests,\n\n339\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.100\ncuz it shows you what can\nhappen in the real world.\n\n340\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.280\nAnd it shows you here that you can go in,\nright here.\n\n341\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.650\nAnd you can see that we actually have the\nfailed item, but we can work with it and\n\n342\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.310\nfix it, right,\nfrom within the interface if we choose to.\n\n343\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.350\nJust wanna make sure you're familiar with\nthat and you get a sense to see that and\n\n344\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.770\nan idea of how this happens.\n\n345\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.830\nYour service templates are very important,\nbecause they do allow us\n\n346\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.831\nto pre-configure what kinds of systems and\nservices we wanna run.\n\n347\n00:16:49.831 --> 00:16:53.459\nRemember, the idea is if we can automate\nand preconfigure a lot of this, make good\n\n348\n00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:57.313\nconfiguration choices, unlike what I did,\nso you actually get templates that work.\n\n349\n00:16:57.313 --> 00:17:01.916\nBut assuming you take your time and we\nautomate this, then imagine somebody comes\n\n350\n00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:06.840\nto us and says, hey, I need three SQL\nservers deployed with this configuration.\n\n351\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.740\nWell, all I have to do is\ngo to the Servers template.\n\n352\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.090\nLet's assume I have one that says,\nSQL Server 2012,\n\n353\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:18.030\nright, or 2008, or 2014, or whatever,\nrunning on a server with this.\n\n354\n00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.550\nAnd all I have to do is just\ndeploy three instances of that.\n\n355\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.390\nAnd then it's able to be consumed and\n\n356\n00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.500\nready to go, or one instance that\nI would use for multiple things.\n\n357\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.950\nAnd I would have that service available,\n\n358\n00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.300\nbecause you could see here-\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\n\n359\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.870\nonce you build up your repertoire, or\nthe maturity level of your organization.\n\n360\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.330\nIt's kind of just like, pick, and\nchoose, and grab and go, kind of thing.\n\n361\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.136\n&gt;&gt; It is like the Kwik-E-Mart\nof provisioning.\n\n362\n00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:41.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you're using that analogy.\n\n363\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, but\n\n364\n00:17:42.616 --> 00:17:44.410\nyou'll see that I'm deploying, in theory,\n\n365\n00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.759\nvirtual machines that are running\nthese services, right.\n\n366\n00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:50.140\nAnd so, you can see, start and\nstop them right here.\n\n367\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.700\nI mean, this is turned off,\nobviously it's not running right now.\n\n368\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.330\nThere's no VM that's currently on, but\n\n369\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.820\nif it was,\nthose menu items would be available.\n\n370\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.000\nAnd you'll see that I can use this to\nquickly crank out a VM associated with\n\n371\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.540\na service, pairing the two together,\nusing the service template do to that.\n\n372\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.100\nIt further allows me to automate,\nand to quickly provision\n\n373\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.830\non my capabilities to provide private\ncloud resources to customers.\n\n374\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, that sounds so\nmuch more eloquent, Adam.\n\n375\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.586\n&gt;&gt; Than the Kwik-E-Mart analogy,\nyes it does.\n\n376\n00:18:15.586 --> 00:18:17.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does sound a little bit better than\n\n377\n00:18:17.823 --> 00:18:19.576\nthe Simpsons analogy for the Kwik-E-Mart.\n\n378\n00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:22.730\nBut it's not as colorful, so\nI do have to give you that.\n\n379\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.570\nBut you could see, obviously,\nthe idea behind it here, and\n\n380\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.260\nthe thought process that we can use to be\nable to manage and use search templates.\n\n381\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.644\nAnd if, for instance, hypothetically, we\nhad a service here, like maybe this one,\n\n382\n00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:35.760\nthat we wanted to decide, you know what?\n\n383\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.280\nIt's not good, you wanna get rid of it?\n\n384\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.930\nJust go to Delete.\n\n385\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.690\nClick Yes, just to wrap up here.\n\n386\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.730\nYou could see we can remove\nthat really quickly.\n\n387\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.760\nDon't do that to VMs running\nin production by the way.\n\n388\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.170\nThat would not be a good idea.\n\n389\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.290\nBut we could do that.\n\n390\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.710\nWe could go in here.\n\n391\n00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.211\nAnd go to Properties, so\nyou can see that we can go in.\n\n392\n00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:53.210\nAnd we can make changes to what's here.\n\n393\n00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.300\nYou'll see we can see the status,\nit is deployed.\n\n394\n00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.360\nWe can see information about it.\n\n395\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.502\nWe could see,\nCherokee just pointed earlier,\n\n396\n00:19:01.502 --> 00:19:03.545\nour servicing windows\nif we have them set up.\n\n397\n00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:07.220\nAnd we can see properties around\nthe actual template itself.\n\n398\n00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:13.250\nAnd we can also see access in terms of\nusers that are given self service control,\n\n399\n00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.250\nor user roles that are made available\nhere, so that we could see these.\n\n400\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.410\nRemember, these are services that\nultimately get populated out to app\n\n401\n00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.450\ncontroller, and\n\n402\n00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.270\nwould show up as services that could\nthen be consumed and used there.\n\n403\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.850\nThis is where we'll be able to\npopulate who gets to see them.\n\n404\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.010\nWe talked about that in the prior episode\nwhen we looked at app controller.\n\n405\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.478\nNow, you'll notice, we're not able to\nedit the settings of the VM template, or\n\n406\n00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:35.765\nwhatever there, but we are able to edit\nthe general settings of the service.\n\n407\n00:19:35.765 --> 00:19:39.110\nWhen we want to go in to fix the VM\nitself, in that problem I would have\n\n408\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.045\nhad in the other one I just deleted I'd\nhave to go back into the actual designer,\n\n409\n00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:45.290\nopen that up essentially open the file.\n\n410\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.780\nAnd edit it there and configure it\nthe right way, save it off, and\n\n411\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.220\nthen republish it to make it available.\n\n412\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.760\nBut I would be able to do that easily.\n\n413\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.650\nThat would not be a problem at all.\n\n414\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.150\nAll right, so talk about that whole idea\nand how that thought process makes sense.\n\n415\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.320\nAnd just to point out,\njust a minute, yeah, just, okay.\n\n416\n00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.816\n&gt;&gt; High five [CROSSTALK],\nyou can't see it.\n\n417\n00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:03.180\nHigh five for service templates.\n\n418\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.994\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n419\n00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.396\nthe point I was just making about this,\n\n420\n00:20:05.396 --> 00:20:07.489\nI just want to stress this,\ncuz this is kind of important.\n\n421\n00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:10.550\nSo, I just showed you, then when we\nright-click on the service template we're\n\n422\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.630\nable to edit properties, but\nnot the properties you may have expected.\n\n423\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.230\nNot fixing, for instance, the problem\nassociated with the template that\n\n424\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.050\nI created, where I had to go back and\ncreate, or select, and\n\n425\n00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:25.050\nbind a compatibility profile to enable\nthe VM hosting to actually setup.\n\n426\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.676\nSo, yeah, I could deploy that,\nso I know what VM-\n\n427\n00:20:26.676 --> 00:20:27.577\n&gt;&gt; Not everything is automated,\n\n428\n00:20:27.577 --> 00:20:28.760\nthere is some human interaction there.\n\n429\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.890\n&gt;&gt; No, not what I'm talking about.\n\n430\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.050\nWhat I'm talking about is the following,\nwe need to understand.\n\n431\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.690\nYou specifically need to understand\nthat the linkage between the,\n\n432\n00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.160\ncan we just go back to\nthe console just a second?\n\n433\n00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.890\nExplain by showing what I'm talking about.\n\n434\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.500\nThe linkage between this object right\nhere, and the properties of this object\n\n435\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.080\nwhen you edit it is not going to be\ndirectly linked to the VM templates,\n\n436\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.010\nand the profiles that we created and\nused to create this service template.\n\n437\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.610\nWhat I'm getting at is, that when you edit\nthe properties of the service template\n\n438\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:01.040\nobject that's deployed, you're not\nediting all that stuff that you have\n\n439\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.720\nthat is from those templates\nthat were used to create it.\n\n440\n00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.090\nYou're editing just the container itself,\nnot the objects within it.\n\n441\n00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.770\nTo get to the objects within it, you have\nto open this up and added it separately.\n\n442\n00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:15.650\nAnd so, as a result,\nthere is a distinct demarcation, right?\n\n443\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.920\nBetween the fact that there's no link, or\nrelationship between the VM template, and\n\n444\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.120\nthe tiers that we created and\n\n445\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.100\nalso between the service container here,\nand all of that.\n\n446\n00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.800\nSo, I just want you to see that,\ncuz I've showed it to you, but\n\n447\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.560\nI want you to get that in your head.\n\n448\n00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.290\nAny changes we make are not\nultimately updated,\n\n449\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.890\nin other words, in the service template\nif we'd modify the VM template.\n\n450\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.960\nHopefully you know that, and\nI'm sure that makes sense to you.\n\n451\n00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.760\nBut we also have to go in and\nedit the service template individually\n\n452\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.440\nas uniquely instantiated object, and\ncopy of the master service template.\n\n453\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.900\nBecause, again,\nwhen we update the individual object here,\n\n454\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.020\nit's not changing the master\nservice template.\n\n455\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.020\nOr any of the master VM templates,\nor capabilities, or\n\n456\n00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.030\nany of that kind of stuff.\n\n457\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.812\nIt's totally divorced,\ntotally disconnected from it.\n\n458\n00:21:55.812 --> 00:21:57.343\nTo unique instantiated object,\n\n459\n00:21:57.343 --> 00:22:00.527\nand it exists independent of those\ntemplates that we're creating.\n\n460\n00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:02.675\nJust wanna make sure you're aware of that,\nand you're thinking about that.\n\n461\n00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:03.425\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for clarifying.\n\n462\n00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.275\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that is important, okay?\n\n463\n00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:04.825\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.\n\n464\n00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:05.565\n&gt;&gt; All right, good.\n\n465\n00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.107\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you for\nthat bit of information there,\n\n466\n00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:09.977\nand thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us.\n\n467\n00:22:09.977 --> 00:22:12.017\nBut, for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n468\n00:22:12.017 --> 00:22:14.177\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n469\n00:22:14.177 --> 00:22:15.747\n&gt;&gt; I am, ooh, you know who I am?\n\n470\n00:22:15.747 --> 00:22:18.107\nBefore I tell you who I am,\nand I am just such an idiot,\n\n471\n00:22:18.107 --> 00:22:19.337\ncuz I did not think about this.\n\n472\n00:22:19.337 --> 00:22:20.517\nI need two seconds.\n\n473\n00:22:20.517 --> 00:22:21.800\nI forgot to show them [CROSSTALK].\n\n474\n00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.625\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we can do that.\n\n475\n00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:24.306\n&gt;&gt; Very easy, but\njust [CROSSTALK] something to consider.\n\n476\n00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:25.537\nJust so,\nthat you wanna be aware of as well.\n\n477\n00:22:25.537 --> 00:22:26.467\nI forgot to show you this.\n\n478\n00:22:26.467 --> 00:22:31.060\nSo, the other thing that I just wanna show\nyou here real quick is the following.\n\n479\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.590\nLet me just do this.\n\n480\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.300\nLet me go back here just one\nsecond right here to our service.\n\n481\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.599\nYeah, let's bring the console back up.\n\n482\n00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:40.014\nAnd we're gonna have to show you, you can\nimport and export these things as well,\n\n483\n00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:41.643\ncuz that's probably [LAUGH] important for\nyou to know.\n\n484\n00:22:41.643 --> 00:22:44.256\nSo, on any of these services up in\nthe library here in the templates,\n\n485\n00:22:44.256 --> 00:22:46.538\nright, the service templates,\nspecifically.\n\n486\n00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:49.860\nWe can right-click and one of things,\nwe can do is we can export a template,\n\n487\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.150\ncreate essentially a file that will have\nall the content-migration information, and\n\n488\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.660\nthen give it to somebody who\ncan then import somewhere else.\n\n489\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.790\nSo, we can make these portable.\n\n490\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.840\nWe've talked about that before.\n\n491\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.010\nAnd I forgot to show that to you.\n\n492\n00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.460\nSo, when we go to export here\nyou can see service template.\n\n493\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.960\nWe can override if we've\ndone an export before.\n\n494\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.360\nWe can export these\nsensitive template settings.\n\n495\n00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.665\nWe can specify a password to protect it,\nwe can then specify a location.\n\n496\n00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:15.125\nAnd I've gone ahead, and\nI've done that already.\n\n497\n00:23:15.125 --> 00:23:19.035\nIf I can just get the Taskbar to\ncome up here, hold on half a second.\n\n498\n00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:24.385\nAnd let me just see if I\ncan click to bring up our,\n\n499\n00:23:24.385 --> 00:23:26.975\nthere we go, there's our Taskbar.\n\n500\n00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:31.285\nAnd if I go into the C drive,\nand I go here to SEV TEMP,\n\n501\n00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:36.270\nwhich is just where I was go in to do\nthat, you'll see this is our export.\n\n502\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.060\nOur file is essentially just an XML file.\n\n503\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.011\nIt's a couple of kilobytes in size, not\nreal big, and when I export that template\n\n504\n00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:45.334\nI'm creating an XML file that somebody\nelse can import into SCVMN and\n\n505\n00:23:45.334 --> 00:23:47.416\nrecreate that template so they can use it.\n\n506\n00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:49.912\nSo, they become highly portable,\nwhich is also really cool.\n\n507\n00:23:49.912 --> 00:23:51.480\nI mean, you could share them\nwith family and friends.\n\n508\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.633\nThey make great Hanukkah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:53.935\n&gt;&gt; And Christmas gifts and\n\n510\n00:23:53.935 --> 00:23:55.502\nstocking stuffers for you.\n\n511\n00:23:55.502 --> 00:23:59.283\nAnd they're also perfectly appropriate for\nthat new IT administrator just starting\n\n512\n00:23:59.283 --> 00:24:02.027\nout, and they need something\nto decorate their data center.\n\n513\n00:24:02.027 --> 00:24:03.276\nThis a perfect data center [CROSSTALK].\n\n514\n00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:06.122\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nwe have three easy payments of 19.95.\n\n515\n00:24:06.122 --> 00:24:09.001\n&gt;&gt; We do, and we accept PayPal as well,\nas all major credit cards.\n\n516\n00:24:09.001 --> 00:24:12.979\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, you guys know who\nwe are, like we've mentioned before,\n\n517\n00:24:12.979 --> 00:24:17.146\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign-up for\nthis show, so thank you for joining us,\n\n518\n00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:18.630\nremember Cherokee Boose.\n\n519\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\nswallowed a sip of water Adam Gordon.\n\n520\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.920\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, bye.\n\n521\n00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.331\n&gt;&gt; See you guys later.\n\n522\n00:24:25.331 --> 00:24:31.295\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:34.115\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.035\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:12.088\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:15.804\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to your\nMicrosoft MCSE Private Cloud Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.600\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.550\nToday we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon back in studios.\n\n8\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.700\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.820\n&gt;&gt; So howdy, everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.140\nWe're going to talk about overrides,\nlike Cherokee was saying.\n\n11\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.730\nAnd an override, exactly as you described,\n\n12\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050\nis going to be something that\nwe call out and say I need this.\n\n13\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.390\nSomebody help me with this.\n\n14\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.930\nAnd specifically, what the override\nreally implies is the idea of taking what\n\n15\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.630\nis the standard operational thought\nprocess in the management pack.\n\n16\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.840\nWhatever the monitoring is, because\nwe're going to override the monitoring.\n\n17\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.520\nWhatever the monitoring\nis that takes place.\n\n18\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.270\nAnd we're gonna kinda push that to\nthe side and say, hey, you know what?\n\n19\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.540\nNormally, it's this.\n\n20\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.890\nBut let's do it this other way instead.\n\n21\n00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.710\nWe're gonna put on top\nof what that monitor is,\n\n22\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.070\nsomething different that\nchanges its behavior.\n\n23\n00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.670\nHence, the concept of overriding it.\n\n24\n00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.650\nAnd then we're going to apply that\noverride to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n25\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.030\nSo I'm gonna invite you to sit back,\nrelax, and\n\n26\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.150\ntake a look as we walk you\nthrough how to do this right now.\n\n27\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.100\nSo what I've done is we've gone into\nour management pack objects area.\n\n28\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.770\nWe're still in the authoring area because\nthis is where all of the things we have to\n\n29\n00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.040\ndo to configure, change, modify, apply,\nsomehow manipulate our objects and\n\n30\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.690\nthe templates that exist for\nmonitoring are gonna be taking place.\n\n31\n00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.605\nAnd so we've been in and\nout of here doing demonstrations for you.\n\n32\n00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:35.500\nHave a whole bunch of episodes where we\ngo in and look at different aspects of\n\n33\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.320\nthe monitoring pack templates, or the\nmanagement pack templates rather up above.\n\n34\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.508\nDistributed applications, we created\nan application in honor of Cherokee.\n\n35\n00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:47.010\nAnd we used that to be able to do\nsome diagrams and monitoring and\n\n36\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.480\nunderstanding how things work.\n\n37\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.220\nBut now what we're going to do is take a\nlook specifically at one of the management\n\n38\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.510\npack objects called monitors.\n\n39\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.500\nRemember all of the things that go\ninto management packs are called\n\n40\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.910\nmanagement pack objects.\n\n41\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.190\nAnd so we've got a list of them here.\n\n42\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.320\nWe've got attributes,\nwe've got monitors, we've got overrides,\n\n43\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.390\nobject discoveries, rules, service\nlevel tracking, all that kinda stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.069\nWe're gonna look at monitors specifically.\n\n45\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.210\nI've come and I've gone on the computer\narea over here on the right\n\n46\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.270\nin where I can choose what kind\nof monitors are available to me.\n\n47\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.820\nSo the computer category into the health,\nwe're gonna go to availability, so\n\n48\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.062\nit's gonna highlight availability here.\n\n49\n00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:23.420\nThis is what we're gonna use.\n\n50\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.810\nAnd we're going to, you can see,\ncome over here to the far side,\n\n51\n00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.530\ngo to overrides, click on that and then we\nhave the ability to disable the monitor,\n\n52\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.020\nthat would be an override of a kind,\nbut not really an override.\n\n53\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.010\nWe don't really call that an override,\nI mean, in theory, in my mind, I think of\n\n54\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090\noverriding as being making changes and\ndisabling what would certainly be\n\n55\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.310\na kind of change, but most people confuse\nthis, disabling is just that, disabling.\n\n56\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.320\nTurn off the monitor.\n\n57\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.160\nAnd we classify that\ndifferently than overriding.\n\n58\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.420\nSo we also have override the monitor.\n\n59\n00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.730\nKeep the monitor on but\nmake a change in some way.\n\n60\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.830\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna override here as you can see.\n\n61\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.670\nAnd we have some object and or group\n\n62\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.300\ninformation we have to think through in\nour mind and decide how we wanna operate.\n\n63\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.200\nCan we go full screen just so\n\n64\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.210\nyou could see this a little\nbetter while we're talking?\n\n65\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.250\nYou'll see we can do an override here for\nall objects of the class,\n\n66\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.690\nin this case computer, and, or for group,\nor for specific object of class computer.\n\n67\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.540\nThis would be a specific\ncomputer maybe computer one\n\n68\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.890\nversus all objects of the class computer,\nmeaning any and all monitored end\n\n69\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.298\npoints that classify themselves as\ncomputers, difference between them, right?\n\n70\n00:03:30.298 --> 00:03:33.360\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that,\nwe're gonna choose for group.\n\n71\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.310\nWe'll go in, and\nthen we'll search for our group here.\n\n72\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.910\nYou can see that we have a whole\nlist of items that are going to be\n\n73\n00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.200\nconsidered groups, categories of different\ncomputers that we may be able to use.\n\n74\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.580\nWe have SQL Server in here,\n\n75\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.360\nwe have web services in here with\nsome IS stuff a bit further up.\n\n76\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.750\nWe've got the Windows server category,\nwe've got Unix and Linux in here.\n\n77\n00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.410\nWe've got all sorts of stuff\nthat are categories, so\n\n78\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.330\nit really just depends\non what we wanna use.\n\n79\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.990\nWe're gonna use\nthe All Windows Computer category so\n\n80\n00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.620\nthat we can get all of the Windows\nmachines and override them with\n\n81\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.360\nthis particular override we're\ngonna create on this monitor.\n\n82\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.910\nSo, let me just find\nAll Windows Computers here.\n\n83\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.610\nWe'll scroll down, scroll down there,\nwe are right there.\n\n84\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.170\nAll Windows Computers,\nwe'll highlight that, we'll click OK.\n\n85\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.740\nThen we have the availability to go in,\nand\n\n86\n00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.910\nwe've actually seen this grid before\non one of our prior episodes.\n\n87\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.380\nWe've talked about the fact, let me\njust move this over so you can see this.\n\n88\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.660\nWe've talked about the fact that\nwe can go in and do overrides and\n\n89\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.580\ngo in and edit and modify the individual\nproperties here in the grid.\n\n90\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.790\nEssentially, row by row we can go\nthrough and decide what we wanna do.\n\n91\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.090\nWhat we're seeing here\nright now is the setup,\n\n92\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.970\nor essentially, the layout of everything\nthat's currently taking place, right?\n\n93\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.800\nAnd what we can do is we can\ndecide to go into any of these.\n\n94\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.310\nI've just highlighted, randomly, one.\n\n95\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.360\nI think my second down, Alert Priority.\n\n96\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720\nI just clicked so that I can enable\nthe ability to edit, to override.\n\n97\n00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.651\nYou may have noticed when we were just\nlooking at it just before I clicked there,\n\n98\n00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.449\nit looked all kind of grayed out and\nwashed out.\n\n99\n00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.600\nBecause we were not or\n\n100\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.790\nhad not decided that we were gonna\nwork with any one item in particular.\n\n101\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.656\nAnd the ones above and\n\n102\n00:05:13.656 --> 00:05:16.508\nbelow are still looking like they're\nkind of washed out a little bit.\n\n103\n00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:18.976\nLooking kind of tired, like you would say,\nyou feel like there, Cherokee.\n\n104\n00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:20.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel a little washed out too.\n\n105\n00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.802\n&gt;&gt; So they're looking kind of like that.\n\n106\n00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:25.800\nSo but when we click on one as\nyou can see, we highlight it,\n\n107\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.120\nit becomes interactive, we do put\na selection there, so a little check mark,\n\n108\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.360\na little carrot indicating,\nhey, you're here, right?\n\n109\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.980\nAnd then we've got whatever\nthe parameter name is.\n\n110\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.050\nBut what we have is the ability\nto see the default value here.\n\n111\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.770\nSo we can see, and let's just go full\nscreen, it'll be a little easier for\n\n112\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.860\nme to talk to you and\nshow you this while we're doing it.\n\n113\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.880\nYou can see we see Default Value,\nin this case the Default Value is Low.\n\n114\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.910\nYou'll see that the Override Value\nis specified here.\n\n115\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.590\nThe Override Value mirrors\nthe Default Value initially and\n\n116\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.300\nwhat we have to do is\nspecify an override value.\n\n117\n00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.640\nBecause by default, we don't have\nan override value until we provide\n\n118\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.370\nsomething different than what's there.\n\n119\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.052\nSo we populate that override value with\nthe default value to specify data or\n\n120\n00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:12.680\nvalues in the column for us to work\nwith and then we go in and modify that.\n\n121\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.380\nSo you people are gonna ask you why all\nthose override values identical, right?\n\n122\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.700\nSo the default values,\n\n123\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.430\nthey are specifically because\nthat's where we start out from.\n\n124\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.570\nBut we have make a change and\n\n125\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.070\nonce we do that, we will then see\nthat the Effective Value column,\n\n126\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.150\nhere, will be modified depending\non the change we make, right?\n\n127\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.280\nSo, let's instead of doing Low,\nlet's go to High, right?\n\n128\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.400\nLet's click there.\n\n129\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.700\nSo, when we do that,\nwe have this new custom property or\n\n130\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.930\nthis new custom override down below will\nbe created in the, not available, right?\n\n131\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.140\nWe have to specify, click apply to achieve\nthe new effective value for the perimeter.\n\n132\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.770\nSo we may go ahead,\nchoose little edit here,\n\n133\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.160\nwe may decide to edit\nthe override description.\n\n134\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.590\nThis is just the language\nassociated with the override.\n\n135\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.870\nHey, this is gonna do this,\nI'm describing what it is, so\n\n136\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.810\nwhen somebody sees this,\nthey have better understanding, right?\n\n137\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.787\nSo something like this will allow me to\n\n138\n00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:08.669\nchange this, From low to high, or\n\n139\n00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.330\nwhatever we're doing, you would write\nsomething in there that's meaningful.\n\n140\n00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we're just doing that,\n\n141\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.750\nthat's just gonna be our description.\n\n142\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.040\nWe're gonna specify our management pack.\n\n143\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.970\nRemember, we have to specify\nour management pack because\n\n144\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.920\nwe have to bind this to the management\npack that we wanna be able to create or\n\n145\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.970\nuse this override with, so\nthat it overrides the objects\n\n146\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.290\nin the management pack based\non what we're specifying here.\n\n147\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.490\nSo we have to decide where we're\ngonna want to put this, right?\n\n148\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.950\nWe do have to enable\nthe override parameter.\n\n149\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.070\nAnd we do then.\n\n150\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.590\nAnd we put the checkmark in the box,\nI talked to you about that.\n\n151\n00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.190\nWe do then need to make sure we\nput this onto the specified or\n\n152\n00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.040\nthe specific override management pack, or\nwhatever management pack we're gonna use.\n\n153\n00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.500\nI'm gonna put this into the Client\nMonitoring Overrides Management Pack\n\n154\n00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.980\nright above the default one.\n\n155\n00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.470\nSo we're gonna use that.\n\n156\n00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.140\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we'll\nset up whatever our parameters are,\n\n157\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.770\nwhatever we decide that we are going\nto do, whatever it may be.\n\n158\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.840\nWe may override or decide to do a couple\nof these, whatever the case may be.\n\n159\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.060\nBut once we're done,\nwe'll click OK, and we click Apply.\n\n160\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.890\nThen we now have created,\nessentially, an override, right?\n\n161\n00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:31.070\nAnd once we've done this,\nwe then are gonna decide that we can\n\n162\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.450\nuse this override, if necessary,\nwhen we do monitoring.\n\n163\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.340\nWe can also take a look, potentially,\nat overrides that may have been created.\n\n164\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.160\nAnd we can go see,\nwe'll just give this a second here,\n\n165\n00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.090\nwe can go see different overrides that may\nbe available or that have been created.\n\n166\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.680\nYou'll see we have management pack\nobject type monitor, object discovery,\n\n167\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.992\nrecovery and or rule.\n\n168\n00:08:52.992 --> 00:08:57.970\nAnd so depending on what we did and where\nit is, we'd have to go in and take a look.\n\n169\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.240\nAnd we have to start looking and\n\n170\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.740\ndelving through all these different items\nto be able to go and find the override.\n\n171\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.323\nBut our override will be there if we go\nall the way through the different options\n\n172\n00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:08.570\nto take a look for it.\n\n173\n00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.215\nWe'll be able to find our override and\nwe would actually be able to see evidence.\n\n174\n00:09:12.215 --> 00:09:16.130\nBut now we've talked about the fact\nthat we can also pull all the overrides\n\n175\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.810\nout using the System Center Ops Manager\nShell, in other words, PowerShell right?\n\n176\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.620\nWe could use the PowerShell commandlet\nto be able to pull overrides out,\n\n177\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.040\nI talked about this in one of the other\nepisodes, and we can actually go in and\n\n178\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.420\nwe can see or get a list of overrides.\n\n179\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.568\nAnd we can actually get that from\nthe shell, we can check and validate, yep,\n\n180\n00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:35.765\nit's there or hey, no it's not,\nthere's something wrong, we gotta go in,\n\n181\n00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:37.672\ngotta make sure that we\ndid this the right way.\n\n182\n00:09:37.672 --> 00:09:39.786\nSo there's a few different\nways to be able to look for\n\n183\n00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:41.719\nevidence of overrides\nthat have been created.\n\n184\n00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:46.556\nBecause remember, you could see there's\nprobably it's almost 170 overrides just\n\n185\n00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:49.570\non the management pack type here alone.\n\n186\n00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.120\nBy the time we get done,\nthere's 158 on the rules.\n\n187\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.410\nYou got probably almost 340\noverrides just in the system more or\n\n188\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.730\nless by default, just as we install and\nset up management packs.\n\n189\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.790\nLet alone what we may do to customize-\n&gt;&gt; Your customize roles.\n\n190\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as we go through and\ncreate our own.\n\n191\n00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.610\nSo there could be hundreds of\noverrides that are created for\n\n192\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.060\nyou to do a variety of things.\n\n193\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.140\nGetting an authoritative list of them is\nactually going to be very helpful and you\n\n194\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.310\nwant to make sure you're thinking about\nthat, and just have a way of doing that.\n\n195\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.260\nYou could see we could go through and\nbrowse here but it may be hard for\n\n196\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.500\nus to see them here.\n\n197\n00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.510\nSo, we may wanna be thinking\nabout the use of PowerShell,\n\n198\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.900\nI'm also just clicking on\nreporting here real quick.\n\n199\n00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.920\nWe can go in inside of\nthe Reporting area here.\n\n200\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.940\nAnd we can also go in and we can take\na look at, depending on what we're doing,\n\n201\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.170\nwe can take a look at either a report\nthat may already be created to show us\n\n202\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.300\noverrides in certain monitoring areas or\nand\n\n203\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.040\nwe've talked about the value of\ncreating our own reports before.\n\n204\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.330\nWe could create a report using\nthe report designer tool\n\n205\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.270\nthat would let us see overrides and\nwe could then pull that data out and\n\n206\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.270\nactually have a list of overrides or\nan ongoing report that could be updated.\n\n207\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.500\nWe could actually create a dashboard and\nuse the customization options for\n\n208\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.950\ndashboard creation.\n\n209\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.850\nAnd perhaps create a monitor\nthat would show us overrides, or\n\n210\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.080\nat least give us a least.\n\n211\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.720\nSo, different options depending on\nwhat we wanna do to be able to create\n\n212\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.130\nthe override and work with it.\n\n213\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.990\nBut it's important for us to be aware of\nthe fact that we can create an override.\n\n214\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.700\nIt's important for us to know that\noverrides are going to allow us to apply\n\n215\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.580\nchanges to a management\npack that is sealed.\n\n216\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.740\nWe've talked about the different\nkinds of management packs before just\n\n217\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.670\nwhile we're doing this.\n\n218\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.860\nLet me bring management\npacks back up real quick.\n\n219\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.670\nRemember, we applied this to the Client\nMonitoring Overrides Management Pack.\n\n220\n00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.680\nThat's the management pack I\nchose to apply my override to.\n\n221\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.280\nIt is an open management pack,\nwhat we call an unsealed management pack.\n\n222\n00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.190\nIt's there by default,\n\n223\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.700\nit's imported into the system to give\nus a place to put our overrides.\n\n224\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.320\nBut we can also apply these\noverrides to some other ones.\n\n225\n00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.050\nThe default management pack,\nothers that may be available to us.\n\n226\n00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:59.240\nSo we're taking the idea of what's\nin an existing management pack,\n\n227\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.200\nan existing monitor, and then we're gonna\nmodify it and then store those changes,\n\n228\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.390\nthose overrides,\nin another management pack.\n\n229\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.420\nCreating the ability\nto combine the two and\n\n230\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.220\nthen generate something that's\nthen gonna work for us.\n\n231\n00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.700\nAnd we may have to create a separate\nunsealed management pack for us to be able\n\n232\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.780\nto do that, or use the few that\nare provided automatically out of the box.\n\n233\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.910\nThe choice is up to us.\n\n234\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.920\nAnd that's obviously gonna be\nsomething you'll figure out in\n\n235\n00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.570\nthe real world based on the best way for\nyou to approach that in your business.\n\n236\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.560\nBut we've shown you how to\ncreate a management pack.\n\n237\n00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.170\nIt would not be hard to do.\n\n238\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.370\nAnd just by way of demonstration,\njust specifically to show you something.\n\n239\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.461\nJust to remind you, this management pack,\nright here, Crete Management Pack,\n\n240\n00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.705\nit's very simple to do,\n\n241\n00:12:37.705 --> 00:12:41.466\nit's going to be a unsealed management\npack, we're gonna give it a name.\n\n242\n00:12:41.466 --> 00:12:46.208\nLet's call this ops or actually use A so\n\n243\n00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:50.517\nit comes up at the top of the list, so\n\n244\n00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:57.723\nwe'll called it\nA.Ops.Manage Pack Overrider, right?\n\n245\n00:12:57.723 --> 00:13:00.320\nAnd all we have to do is give it a name,\nclick there.\n\n246\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.340\nWe're not gonna bother\nwith any description or\n\n247\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.750\ndocumentation in the Knowledge tab.\n\n248\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.700\nThat would just be hey, this management\npack overrides being used for blah, so\n\n249\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.830\nwe would just be narrating, we're not\ngonna bother with that right now.\n\n250\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.930\nWe'll just click Create here.\n\n251\n00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.650\nAs soon as that is, it's already there,\nyou can see it there.\n\n252\n00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.630\nWhat we then can do, if we wanted to\ngo back here and have an option or\n\n253\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.360\nhave the ability,\nmaybe I should put a period in there or\n\n254\n00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.930\na comma, have the ability to go\nback here and be able to use this.\n\n255\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.630\nLet's just say we go back here to\nthe monitors one more time and\n\n256\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.320\nwe go back here to\ncomputers one more time.\n\n257\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.250\nSo let's just scroll down to\nwhere we were just a minute ago.\n\n258\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.160\nYou just didn't see all the different\ncategories that were there cuz I'd already\n\n259\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.670\nselected computers.\n\n260\n00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.039\nBut let's just scroll down\nback here to where we were.\n\n261\n00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:47.785\nBack through the 5,000 instances of cards-\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.878\n&gt;&gt; Where we get to computers All right, so\n\n263\n00:13:49.878 --> 00:13:51.280\nthere we are right there.\n\n264\n00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.320\nSo we get to Computer, and we'll just open\nthis up real quick, open up Entity Health\n\n265\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.520\nthe way we were just doing,\nopen up Availability just one more time.\n\n266\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.890\nRight click,\nyou see we do an Override right from here.\n\n267\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.680\nWe don't have to necessarily go to\nthe right hand side, we've pointed out and\n\n268\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.090\nCherokee's pointed out as I've been doing\nthis, hey, more than one way to do that.\n\n269\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.420\nAbsolutely, it's all the same we're\njust operating on the object, so\n\n270\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.820\nwhether we do it from the right click or\ngo off to the right to the task area.\n\n271\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.983\nWe get to the same place, it's up to you,\njust a question of what you\n\n272\n00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:20.551\nare in the mood for and, or\nyou feel more comfortable.\n\n273\n00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:25.503\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do\na group again and we'll go ahead and\n\n274\n00:14:25.503 --> 00:14:29.756\nwe'll choose All Windows Computers\njust one more time.\n\n275\n00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:31.690\nLet's click OK.\n\n276\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.830\nAnd then we've already got that, you'll\nsee the couple that I have there, right?\n\n277\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.980\nAnd we can, actually you know what,\ninstead of doing that one hold on,\n\n278\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.380\nbecause I don't wanna\nedit that one I forgot.\n\n279\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.260\nI already did that,\n\n280\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.580\nI wanna create a new one and\nassign it to the other management packs.\n\n281\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.810\nSo let me override.\n\n282\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.802\nBut let me override for a different group,\n\n283\n00:14:49.802 --> 00:14:53.250\nand, let's do there, we'll do databases.\n\n284\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.950\nAnd let's go ahead,\nlet's just select something,\n\n285\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.880\nagain we're not worried about\nwhat we're overriding right now,\n\n286\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.820\nI just wanna show you the idea that,\nsince we created the management pack\n\n287\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.840\nthat is open, you'll see that we\nhave an unsealed management pack.\n\n288\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.380\nIf we go full screen you can see them\nselecting or about to select my own\n\n289\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.900\nmanagement pack that I just created there\nA.OPS.Manager Pack Overrider or whatever.\n\n290\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.970\nThese are all of the management packs\nthat are unsealed that we can store\n\n291\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.080\nour overrides in.\n\n292\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.670\nSo, if we create a new one it's easy for\n\n293\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.560\nus then to bind to that or\nwe can use one of these existing ones.\n\n294\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.781\nNow, the default management pack is\nconsidered an unsealed management pack,\n\n295\n00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:29.360\nwe could store our stuff there.\n\n296\n00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.910\nBut we also have one\nspecific to overrides,\n\n297\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.710\nClient Monitoring Override Management\nPack, the one I selected first.\n\n298\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.180\nAnd we could do either one of those or\ncreate our own.\n\n299\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.940\nAnd then we just name it accordingly and\nwe know what it is.\n\n300\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.710\nSo it's up to us to decide,\nultimately, whether or\n\n301\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.090\nnot we want to use\nthe specific management pack.\n\n302\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.830\nAnd once we figure out what management\npack we wanna be able to do,\n\n303\n00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.190\nwe'll go ahead,\nwe can enable this, set it up.\n\n304\n00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.900\nSpecify it's gonna be true and then turn\non whatever other options we may want and\n\n305\n00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.260\nwe're off to the races and\nwe're set to go.\n\n306\n00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.900\nOkay, so just keep that in mind.\n\n307\n00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.970\nWe are not going to save our changes\ncuz we don't care about that one.\n\n308\n00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.640\nAnd that's how we would\ncreate an override.\n\n309\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.530\nWe'll just keep going through that\ncreating as many overrides as we need.\n\n310\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, Configuring Overrides 101.\n\n311\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.920\nThank you so much, Adam, for\n\n312\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.410\nshowing us how to walk through\nthat step-by-step process.\n\n313\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.710\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n314\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.680\nBut stay tuned, we have more\ndemonstrations headed your way.\n\n315\n00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.010\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n316\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.470\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n317\n00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.600\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n318\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.911\nSee you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n319\n00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:35.949\n[MUSIC]\n\n320\n00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:39.464\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:12.099\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.850\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to\nMicrosoft MCSE Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.970\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.040\nIn this episode,\nwe have Mr Adam Gordon back in studios.\n\n8\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.570\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.180\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.793\n&gt;&gt; Very good, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:27.370\n&gt;&gt; I know, it was quite a mouthful there.\n\n12\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.010\nIt's a lot.\n\n13\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.670\n&gt;&gt; And you got it out and you did\na good job, so that is just high five.\n\n14\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.721\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n15\n00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.630\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Moving high five.\n\n16\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Where's my hand, there it is.\n\n17\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.833\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we are, awesome.\n\n18\n00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.461\nSo, Cherokee did a great job, she set\nus up and we're gonna jump right in,\n\n19\n00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.410\nbecause this is such a cool topic.\n\n20\n00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.460\nWe don't wanna waste any time\nshowing you how to do it.\n\n21\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.980\nWe're gonna talk about synthetic\ntransaction monitoring.\n\n22\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.500\nAnd I demoed and kinda teased this a\nlittle bit, in the prior episodes when we\n\n23\n00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.010\ntalked about just running through all the\ndifferent options for service monitoring.\n\n24\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.760\nAnd we took a look at this kinda at\nthe very end, ran through the wizard,\n\n25\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.400\nshowed you almost everything,\nit's going to repeat that pretty quickly.\n\n26\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.730\nBut then I specified that little check\nbox there on the corner of that,\n\n27\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.620\nwe're not gonna check off and show you,\nthat's gonna be where the magic happens.\n\n28\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.790\nWe're gonna take a look at that right now.\n\n29\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.040\n&gt;&gt; We get to see magic?\n\n30\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.179\n&gt;&gt; We get to see magic.\n\n31\n00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.330\nAnd at no point in any part\nof this demonstration,\n\n32\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.392\ndo my hands ever leave my\nbody while we do magic.\n\n33\n00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:17.081\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is awesome,\n\n34\n00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.373\ncuz they always stay put.\n\n35\n00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:21.710\nAnd therefore,\nI can do cool things like go up here.\n\n36\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.645\nAnd use this right here, to be able to\nmake this kind of stuff happen over there.\n\n37\n00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:29.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n38\n00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Now that everybody knows where we are,\nwhat we're doing and\n\n39\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580\nis totally confused,\nlet's actually go do something cool.\n\n40\n00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.380\nSo Web Application Transaction Monitoring.\n\n41\n00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.840\nWhat we're gonna do.\n\n42\n00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.530\nCome over here up underneath\nour management pack templates.\n\n43\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.420\nWe're going to right-click,\ngoing to add our monitoring wizard.\n\n44\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.844\nWe are going to choose web\napplication transaction monitoring.\n\n45\n00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:52.196\nRemember, we talk about this as allowing\nus create monitoring for a simple web app.\n\n46\n00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:55.360\nYou could see this down on the bottom,\nwe'll move the screen.\n\n47\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.660\nHere we go, thank you sir.\n\n48\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.132\nSo we could see this down here.\n\n49\n00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:01.640\nWe can use the web app recorder,\nthat's the magic we're gonna talk about\n\n50\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.030\nat the end of the Wizard,\nto record a web browser session.\n\n51\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.650\nAnd then we can look at that, and\nwe can actually see what's happening, and\n\n52\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.270\nunderstand the interaction, and\n\n53\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.670\nsee what a typical user sees,\nwhen they interact with our web server.\n\n54\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.090\nThis is the really cool part,\nbecause this allows us to be able to\n\n55\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.900\ndecide how things are gonna happen, what's\ngonna happen and all that kind of stuff.\n\n56\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.050\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\nclick here, we're gonna click Next.\n\n57\n00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.314\nWe have to now provide a name,\nso we'll put a name in here.\n\n58\n00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:32.426\nWe'll call this test web app.\n\n59\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.300\nMonitor.\n\n60\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.790\nYeah, close enough.\n\n61\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.992\nAnd then select our web pack or excuse me\nour management pack, into our default.\n\n62\n00:02:45.738 --> 00:02:48.593\nCome on, very good,\ndo our default management pack, and\n\n63\n00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:50.590\nthen we have to provide our web address.\n\n64\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.840\nNow, I've gone ahead and\nI've typed in this address already,\n\n65\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.300\ncuz it is a really long one.\n\n66\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.860\nJust go full screen so we can see this.\n\n67\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.632\nWe're using this in the test environment.\n\n68\n00:02:58.632 --> 00:02:59.640\nWe're going-\n&gt;&gt; You weren't lying.\n\n69\n00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.660\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; You weren't lying.\n\n70\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.235\n&gt;&gt; No, I wasn't lying.\n\n71\n00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:02.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You won't have to type that for real.\n\n72\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.444\nSo this, we're gonna go to the local host,\nops manager, hashtag,\n\n73\n00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:12.767\ncuz we are paying homage to the absolute\ncraziness of social media, overview.\n\n74\n00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.668\nAnd then we're gonna do Microsoft\nsystem monitoring view folder root.\n\n75\n00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:19.282\nThis is gonna allow us to do just some\nbasic monitoring against a local system,\n\n76\n00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.230\nand understand it.\n\n77\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.450\nSo, we're using this merely for\ntest purposes.\n\n78\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470\nIn the real world, just let me\ncopy this while we are talking.\n\n79\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.090\nIn the real world, you would want to, let\nme just paste while we're talking as well.\n\n80\n00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.962\nYou would wanna go ahead and you would\nwanna be able to actually use a website\n\n81\n00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:41.054\nthat is going to a web\napplication I should say,\n\n82\n00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.633\nagainst the website that\nyou actually wanna monitor.\n\n83\n00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.596\nThis is us essentially\njust setting up a monitor,\n\n84\n00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:50.680\nin a local system that we\ncan use to demo for you.\n\n85\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.810\nBut, this is not what you would\nnecessarily do in the real world.\n\n86\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.200\nIn the real world, you would actually\ntarget your web application,\n\n87\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.720\nmeaning your front end Web URL.\n\n88\n00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.110\nAnd you would use that\nURL here whatever it is,\n\n89\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.500\nto actually then run the test again.\n\n90\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.300\nSo, we're gonna test this to\nmake sure the string works.\n\n91\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.740\nI've already tested it, so\nI know it's gonna work.\n\n92\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.490\nSo we're gonna just wait for this to come\nback, you'll see this takes a few seconds.\n\n93\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.680\nIt will then come back.\n\n94\n00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.159\nIt will show us just the output here.\n\n95\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.570\nShow us that we are successful.\n\n96\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.500\nYou can see it there.\n\n97\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.487\nBoy, that would have been so\nembarrassing if that came back.\n\n98\n00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:24.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they're like yeah,\n\n99\n00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:25.590\nwe're gonna show you.\n\n100\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.980\nYou tested it, boop, not gonna happen.\n\n101\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.113\nBut luckily-\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n102\n00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:29.820\n&gt;&gt; It happens.\n\n103\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.272\nIt does sometimes,\nmore often than we care to admit.\n\n104\n00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:36.050\nBut, you'll see we are successful.\n\n105\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.990\nYou'll see and let's just go full\nscreen rather, we'll go back.\n\n106\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.590\nWe talked about response codes\nin our earlier conversation.\n\n107\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.080\nEarlier episode, where we did Web\nApplication Availability Monitoring and\n\n108\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.760\nwe talked about the different HTTP\nresponse codes 200, 300, 400.\n\n109\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.100\nMaybe custom codes that would be there.\n\n110\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.270\nSo you could see the response code.\n\n111\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.100\n200 says yep, essentially found the page,\nI was able to connect.\n\n112\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.340\nYou'll see DNS Error solution time,\nabout 1.3 milliseconds.\n\n113\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.890\nTotal response time about 7,\nalmost 8 milliseconds.\n\n114\n00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.970\nSo, you could see here that we're\ngetting some general information.\n\n115\n00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.335\nNow the cool thing is we\ncan go into details here.\n\n116\n00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.281\nWe'll just pull this off to the side so,\n\n117\n00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.790\nyou can kinda see what we're\ndoing while we're doing this.\n\n118\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.600\nSo I just went in, went to details.\n\n119\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.730\nI'm drilling down on this data,\ngetting more response information back.\n\n120\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.770\nIn terms of what it did and how it did it.\n\n121\n00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.540\nSo I can see the general information\non the response time, you see all that.\n\n122\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.000\nI can see the HTTP requests,\nI can actually see the get request and\n\n123\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.330\nthe code that was used.\n\n124\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.720\nThis is HTTP version\n1.1 as opposed to 1.0.\n\n125\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.990\nSo I could see that here.\n\n126\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.720\nI could see the HTTP\nresponse that's coming back.\n\n127\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; This is the actual code\n\n128\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.710\nfrom the web server.\n\n129\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.461\nAnd this is what I'm seeing and\nit's telling me,\n\n130\n00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:49.566\nthat I'm running IS Version 8.5.\n\n131\n00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.808\nSo I'm running 2012 R2, for\ninstance under the hood.\n\n132\n00:05:52.808 --> 00:05:54.972\nAnd it's giving me information, ASP.NET,\n\n133\n00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:58.190\nwhich is what we would expect\nto see with Microsoft certainly.\n\n134\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.840\nBut it's giving us information.\n\n135\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.370\nAlso day and time, and\nthe size of the cache, and\n\n136\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.710\nother stuff that may be valuable.\n\n137\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.540\nSo we're just recording all this\njust to setup the demonstration,\n\n138\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.433\nin the sense that we did the test.\n\n139\n00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:12.323\nThis is just the data that comes back\nwith the test, but this is validating all\n\n140\n00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:15.040\nthe things that we need to understand and\nmade sure are there.\n\n141\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.360\nSo we always wanna take a look\nat the request details,\n\n142\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.940\nmake sure everything\nlooks the way it should.\n\n143\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.340\n&gt;&gt; It really is a lot of information.\n\n144\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.660\nAnd I know Adam you are very\nwell versed in security, and\n\n145\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.090\nit just kind of we also need to take that\ninto consideration when we do have this.\n\n146\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.990\n&gt;&gt; We don't pay attention to that stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's just a waste of time.\n\n148\n00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:31.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who cares about security?\n\n149\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.375\nThat's not important.\n\n150\n00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.046\nCherokee raises a really-\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n151\n00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:36.430\nyou're showing me all of this information\nin one stop shop, and it's like wow.\n\n152\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.090\n&gt;&gt; No, Cherokee raises a really\nimportant point which is, security is so\n\n153\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.950\nimportant everything we do, and\nwe talk a lot about it, and\n\n154\n00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.920\nis certainly one of the areas\nI do a lot of work in.\n\n155\n00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.660\nI'm passionate about as I\nknow many of you are, and\n\n156\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.440\nyou know how important it is to make\nsure that we safeguard this information.\n\n157\n00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.060\nSome of the stuff that we're just showing.\n\n158\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.860\nVersion number for instance of what?\n\n159\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.450\nYou're operating system is\nrunning can be extrapolated\n\n160\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.390\nfrom understanding what version of web\nsurfs are being presented, as I explain.\n\n161\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.810\nAnd so those kind of things definitely\ncould be problematic, in the wrong hands.\n\n162\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.770\nAnd Cherokee's right to stop us here for\na second and say, hey, wait a second,\n\n163\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.220\nis there some concern here?\n\n164\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.190\nShould we be keeping track of this stuff?\n\n165\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.080\nDo we have to do something\nto deal with it?\n\n166\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.180\nRemember that this information is\ncoming back to us in a, right now,\n\n167\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.110\nin a kind of a secure environment.\n\n168\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.470\nWe're in the LAN behind our firewalls, so\n\n169\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.490\nlet's just take a look at\na little diagram here.\n\n170\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.750\nWe're sitting here, and\nwe're behind this firewall, and\n\n171\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.220\nactually this is our external entity,\nour perimeter defense if you will.\n\n172\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.960\nOur outer area of our defense\nin depth architecture.\n\n173\n00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.420\nAll the stuff we're doing is taking place\nback in this area over here to the right.\n\n174\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.645\nWe're interacting with the ops manager\ndatabase, we have our agent managed\n\n175\n00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:48.807\nservers down here, we have our agent\nmanaged infrastructure I should say.\n\n176\n00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:50.555\nWe have our management servers here.\n\n177\n00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:55.637\nAll the stuff we're doing that's taking\nplace inside the LAN, hopefully.\n\n178\n00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:57.399\nAnd again, everything is relative,\nof course.\n\n179\n00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.605\nBut hopefully, behind a protection\nperimeter that is deep enough,\n\n180\n00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:06.753\nwide enough, broad enough, and architected\nsufficiently and strongly enough and\n\n181\n00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:11.530\nhardened enough to be able to withstand\ninbound attacks from the outside.\n\n182\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.090\nSo we hope this data would\nnot see the light of day.\n\n183\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.940\nI would be certainly concerned about\nthe fact that this data's out there.\n\n184\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.470\nBut it's sitting in our databases.\n\n185\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.000\nWe would wanna make sure\nwe are taking steps to\n\n186\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.696\nprevent physical access to the database.\n\n187\n00:08:23.696 --> 00:08:24.757\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The standard stuff we\n\n188\n00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:25.717\nwould normally do.\n\n189\n00:08:25.717 --> 00:08:30.974\nDon't let unauthorized users without\nproper access control oversight get into\n\n190\n00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:36.310\nthese systems remotely and/or physically\nby walking into the data center.\n\n191\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.630\nInteracting with something that\nthey're not supposed to do.\n\n192\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.690\nLet's make sure we encrypt that traffic\nif it is flowing across the wire.\n\n193\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.170\nWe didn't choose HTTPS in the demo here.\n\n194\n00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.090\nBut if we were using HTTPS,\nwe'd be securing that transactional data.\n\n195\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.300\nCuz we would obviously,\n\n196\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.790\nhopefully benefit from the use of SSL/TLS\nto be able to encrypt that stream.\n\n197\n00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.570\nSo there are definitely\nsome considerations and\n\n198\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.750\nconcerns, as Cherokee is reminding us of,\nthat we'd want to think about here.\n\n199\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.280\nBut I think we're probably okay for\nthe moment in\n\n200\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.040\nthe sense that this is happening inside\nright now, and we're monitoring inside.\n\n201\n00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.060\nWe're gonna use a watcher node\nthat is inside right now.\n\n202\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.450\nSo we're gonna be behind our firewalls.\n\n203\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.471\nWe're not gonna be as concerned,\nif, as we talked we about,\n\n204\n00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:20.910\nwith global service monitoring, one of\nout other episodes in our demonstrations.\n\n205\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.340\nIf we were gonna be doing\noutside-in monitoring,\n\n206\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.500\nwhere we have watcher nodes\nthrough the Global Service Monitor\n\n207\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.100\nfoundation that's available\nthrough Azure that we can use.\n\n208\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.790\nRemember, set up System Center by\nlicensing with Enterprise, within EA,\n\n209\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.104\nwith software assurance,\nand use the Azure Fabric.\n\n210\n00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:40.477\nAnd we actually get access to\nthe global service monitoring.\n\n211\n00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:42.381\nAnd we can use those external\nwatcher nodes, right?\n\n212\n00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.740\nThose data center watcher nodes\nthat Microsoft maintains.\n\n213\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.820\nBut keep in mind,\nthose are insecure data centers, right?\n\n214\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.110\nAcross the Azure Fabric,\nthat communication will be secured.\n\n215\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.838\nThose data center endpoint\nmonitoring agents are physically and\n\n216\n00:09:55.838 --> 00:09:57.460\nlogically protected.\n\n217\n00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.435\nSo we're seeing the extension\nof that protection perimeter.\n\n218\n00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:01.416\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're just pushing it\n\n219\n00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:02.200\nout into the cloud.\n\n220\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.381\nSo we hope that all of that,\nobviously, is still gonna be in place.\n\n221\n00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.510\nAnd it's important to call that out and\nremind ourselves of that.\n\n222\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.230\nNever a bad time to think about security,\nas we often say.\n\n223\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.730\nAnd the earlier you do so, the less likely\nit is you're gonna have to make up for\n\n224\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.260\nlost time and opportunity, where you\nhave to go back and fix something.\n\n225\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.630\nSo it's always good to think about that.\n\n226\n00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.929\nSo another high five.\n\n227\n00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:22.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n228\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n229\n00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.625\nGotta be quick to do those high fives.\n\n230\n00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:25.179\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n231\n00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:27.658\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we're gonna\ndo is just continue on here.\n\n232\n00:10:27.658 --> 00:10:30.885\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna click Next.\n\n233\n00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:32.218\nJust a second to do that.\n\n234\n00:10:32.218 --> 00:10:33.861\nWe're then gonna choose our watcher node.\n\n235\n00:10:33.861 --> 00:10:35.040\nYou heard me just referring to this.\n\n236\n00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.830\nIf you haven't seen the other episodes\nwe've done on watcher nodes, the watcher\n\n237\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.330\nnode is just the endpoint that we're gonna\nuse with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on\n\n238\n00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.260\nit, that's gonna be used to\ndo the monitoring for us.\n\n239\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.847\nIn this case, it's gonna be\none of our management servers.\n\n240\n00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:48.130\nSo you could see it selected there.\n\n241\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.330\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna check this off.\n\n242\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.060\nWe have to specify how often\nwe wanna run the query.\n\n243\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.970\nEvery two minutes or\nwhatever we decide to do.\n\n244\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.063\nWe'll leave it there at two minutes,\nit's fine.\n\n245\n00:10:58.063 --> 00:10:59.700\nWe'll go ahead and we'll click Next.\n\n246\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.265\nAnd then what we're gonna do,\ncan we go back?\n\n247\n00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:03.660\nCuz we need to see on full screen here,\nthis part.\n\n248\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.794\nSo we're now gonna go in.\n\n249\n00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:09.701\nWe're gonna check off Configure Advanced\nMonitoring or Recorded Browser Sessions,\n\n250\n00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.008\nthe box that I talked about\nthat we're gonna select here.\n\n251\n00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:16.640\nWe'll just move this over for\njust a sec so you can see this.\n\n252\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.170\nSo we're going to check this off.\n\n253\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.000\nAnd you'll notice here,\nunder Custom Actions, after we get done.\n\n254\n00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.030\nWe can record the browser\nsession from out here.\n\n255\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.160\nWe have an action that\nwill allow us to do this.\n\n256\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.590\nBut we're gonna select this.\n\n257\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.800\nSo it's gonna pop up for\n\n258\n00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.150\nus immediately instead of us having\nto go out and do it separately.\n\n259\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.060\nYou could do it either way,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n260\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.491\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna click Create.\n\n261\n00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:36.400\nGive that a moment.\n\n262\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.642\nOnce that does happen, we're gonna\nopen up the editor screen here.\n\n263\n00:11:39.642 --> 00:11:42.460\nWe're gonna then be able to go in and\nprogram in some things.\n\n264\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.810\nSo we'll give this just\na moment to finish up.\n\n265\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.550\nOnce we have done this, we then will\nbe able to set up our request, or\n\n266\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.570\nin the Request Details pane of the editor,\nset up exactly what we wanna have happen.\n\n267\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:58.500\nAnd this is gonna look somewhat familiar\nto you based on what we've taken a look at\n\n268\n00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.160\nin some of the other episodes when\nwe did demos of this already.\n\n269\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.790\nWe took a look at getting in and\ntaking a look at the request details,\n\n270\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.960\nthe status codes.\n\n271\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.830\nGreater than or equal to,\nthings of that nature.\n\n272\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.500\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n273\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.070\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n274\n00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.822\nWe have our status code greater than or\nequal to, let's say, 400.\n\n275\n00:12:12.822 --> 00:12:15.204\nWe talked about content\nmatch with a string.\n\n276\n00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:18.430\nWe talked about response time in so\nmany seconds.\n\n277\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.910\nSo we can go in, say response time is\nequal to, let's say, or greater than or\n\n278\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.770\nless than.\n\n279\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.609\nSo if it's greater than or\nequal to, let's say, one, or\n\n280\n00:12:28.609 --> 00:12:31.880\nlet's say, two seconds.\n\n281\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.420\nThen we want to monitor for that.\n\n282\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.930\nSo we can go in,\nwe can decide what we're gonna do.\n\n283\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.650\nWe see greater than or\nequal to status code 400.\n\n284\n00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.290\nThat'll be something in the error area,\nmost likely.\n\n285\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.049\nThose status codes up above 400\ntypically have to do with errors.\n\n286\n00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:48.890\nSo we wanna see if there's any errors\nthat come back as we're interacting here.\n\n287\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.460\nSo we'd be doing that.\n\n288\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.420\nNotice down here,\n\n289\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.905\nstop processing the subsequent\nrequest if an error criteria is met.\n\n290\n00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:58.810\nMeaning, if we find an error,\nwe could actually then stop processing.\n\n291\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.160\nAnd we can just essentially,\nat that point, stop and do something or\n\n292\n00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.080\nnot do something,\ndepending on what we want to do.\n\n293\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.480\nSo we have some different options here.\n\n294\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.640\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n295\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.120\nwe will just scroll down,\nto show you some more of this down here.\n\n296\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.790\nWe also have settings and\nother entries that are for\n\n297\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.910\nthe warning health state here.\n\n298\n00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.990\nWe saw this in our other demo, as well.\n\n299\n00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.180\nWe're not gonna bother with health state\nright now, but you get the general idea.\n\n300\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.540\nSo then, once we've done this, we could\nverify our criteria by hitting Verify.\n\n301\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.441\nSo let's go in and verify.\n\n302\n00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.700\nGive this a second.\n\n303\n00:13:35.323 --> 00:13:37.200\nSays changes verified.\n\n304\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.430\nChanges verified and applied.\n\n305\n00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.040\nChanges verified and\napplied to selected requests.\n\n306\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.580\nSo in other words, yes,\nwe are able to verify that.\n\n307\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.590\nWe'll go ahead, we'll Apply.\n\n308\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.381\nGive that just a moment to do its job.\n\n309\n00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:51.165\nAnd then.\n\n310\n00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:58.050\nYou'll see web application\ndata imported successfully.\n\n311\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.000\nLet me actually just go full screen here.\n\n312\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.230\nCan we go full screen?\n\n313\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.870\nWe need to be able to see the rest of the\nconsole area and what's going on there.\n\n314\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.450\nSo we have that, and\nwe've actually done that now.\n\n315\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.640\nSo now, we come over here,\nand we actually run our test.\n\n316\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.060\nWe're gonna go out and test this,\nand see what's gonna happen.\n\n317\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.745\nSo let's run our test, click there.\n\n318\n00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:20.753\nWe're gonna test the web app\nresponse data against this.\n\n319\n00:14:20.753 --> 00:14:23.280\nYou can see right here,\nwe've got our information.\n\n320\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.750\nIt ran successfully.\n\n321\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.610\nTransaction response time,\nabout 6.9 milliseconds.\n\n322\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.660\nSo less than our two second boundary or\nthreshold, we said.\n\n323\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.460\nNo error codes or no response codes\nabove 400 that indicate errors.\n\n324\n00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.190\nSo we can see that we get\nback this information.\n\n325\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.454\nIf we click on Total Data, for instance,\nwe could see the aggregated response,\n\n326\n00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:46.098\nDNS resolution, and\ncontent size information.\n\n327\n00:14:46.098 --> 00:14:49.450\nSo we could see some detailed\ninformation about what's there.\n\n328\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.710\nIf we look here, just click here.\n\n329\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.820\nWe can see that we may have\ndata in some of these folders.\n\n330\n00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.210\nUnder Response Time,\nyou see zero milliseconds.\n\n331\n00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.280\nEssentially, it was instantaneous, cuz\nthis is running on the localhost, right.\n\n332\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.641\nSo we're kinda skewing\nthe results a little bit here,\n\n333\n00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:05.859\ncuz we're doing a test\nagainst the local machine.\n\n334\n00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:08.739\nIn the real world, if you were doing\nthis out against a remote machine,\n\n335\n00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:12.151\nwe would actually get response times there\nthat are higher than zero milliseconds.\n\n336\n00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.638\nBut you'll close your eyes and\npretend that it says ten and not zero.\n\n337\n00:15:15.638 --> 00:15:18.720\nCuz it would have taken at least that\nlong to go out to a website somewhere\n\n338\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.390\nelse and come back.\n\n339\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.580\nSo you can see that.\n\n340\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.060\nWe also have links here.\n\n341\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.340\nAnd if we have any\ninformation about the links,\n\n342\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.310\nwe would be able to see that information,\nas well.\n\n343\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.570\nSo we were able to run\nour test successfully.\n\n344\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.330\nWe can view test results underneath here,\nas you can see.\n\n345\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.100\nWe can view test results.\n\n346\n00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.700\nYou saw me just do that.\n\n347\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.800\nWe also can view full results.\n\n348\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.850\nLet's go take a look.\n\n349\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.520\nThis is kinda cool.\n\n350\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.500\nWe got a little bit of a fuller\nread on the data here.\n\n351\n00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.681\nSo we actually can now\nsee what we're doing.\n\n352\n00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:46.400\n&gt;&gt; What are we looking at.\n\n353\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Or see all that information.\n\n354\n00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.640\nWe'll go in and\nwe'll actually take a look.\n\n355\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.482\nSo you could see here.\n\n356\n00:15:51.482 --> 00:15:53.472\nJust make this full screen so\nyou could see this.\n\n357\n00:15:53.472 --> 00:15:55.595\nWe have all of our formatted data.\n\n358\n00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:56.698\nWe also have our.\n\n359\n00:15:56.698 --> 00:15:58.602\nRaw data here.\n\n360\n00:15:58.602 --> 00:16:00.162\nThis is like looking at the matrix, right?\n\n361\n00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:02.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just getting bleary-eyed kinda just\n\n362\n00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:03.600\nwatching it.\n\n363\n00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.540\nBut you can see,\nwe do get the raw data back,\n\n364\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.040\nwe get the formatted\nversion of it as well.\n\n365\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.300\nAnd again, a little bit more impressive\nwhen we're going out to a live website,\n\n366\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.830\nremote, from somewhere,\n\n367\n00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.840\nnot locally, internally on the same\nmachine, looking at a directory.\n\n368\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.940\nBut we actually go out to a live website.\n\n369\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.920\nWe hit that from outside, and we see it.\n\n370\n00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.872\nThis would have a lot more data in it.\n\n371\n00:16:22.872 --> 00:16:26.500\nSo, there would be a lot more substance to\nthis full report that we're looking at.\n\n372\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.550\nBut it is kinda nice,\ncuz it does give us a lot of detail.\n\n373\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.572\nNow, keep in mind,\na lot of this data may be valuable not so\n\n374\n00:16:32.572 --> 00:16:37.020\nmuch to us as administrators, but more to\napp-dev people that are doing development\n\n375\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.357\nwork that are looking to optimize\nthe application, looking for\n\n376\n00:16:40.357 --> 00:16:44.536\nresponse information, looking for\npotential errors or concerns in the code.\n\n377\n00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:48.112\nAnd we will be sharing this information\nwith them potentially, right?\n\n378\n00:16:48.112 --> 00:16:49.031\nCuz this gonna be important for them.\n\n379\n00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:52.597\nWhen I say them, I mean the developers and\nthe administrators both, right?\n\n380\n00:16:52.597 --> 00:16:53.368\nTo be able to see.\n\n381\n00:16:53.368 --> 00:16:56.220\nSo, it's not just one.\n\n382\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.290\n&gt;&gt; One sided, here.\nYou gotta work together.\n\n383\n00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.330\n&gt;&gt; One group or\none entity that's gonna use this, right?\n\n384\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n385\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.310\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be obviously be both.\n\n386\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.920\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n387\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.810\nNow, we could also go out\nunder web request here, right?\n\n388\n00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.800\nAnd you'll see we could go in and\nstart a capture.\n\n389\n00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.687\nLet's just go in and\ndo this just to show you.\n\n390\n00:17:09.687 --> 00:17:11.360\nI talked about the capture here.\n\n391\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.710\nThis is essentially a macro-recorder.\n\n392\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.780\nWe're going out, and\nwe're gonna start capturing data\n\n393\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.010\nabout how we interact with this-\n&gt;&gt; Those responses-\n\n394\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.820\n&gt;&gt; Website and everything.\n\n395\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.680\nWe're gonna record all\nthat information and\n\n396\n00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.040\nbe able to take apart all of\nthat information and examine it.\n\n397\n00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.080\nNow, we don't really have\na live website here, so\n\n398\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.990\nI'm not gonna be able to go very far.\n\n399\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.710\nBut the idea would be that we could\nactually go in, capture all of this.\n\n400\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.472\nSo if we did something like\n\n401\n00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:43.214\nMicrosoft.com, right, or something.\n\n402\n00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:50.302\n[COUGH] And we went through,\n\n403\n00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:54.500\nand we clicked through,\nwanna buy a Surface Pro 4?\n\n404\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.340\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n&gt;&gt; We could go in and do one of those.\n\n405\n00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.230\nGot Don's credit card?\n\n406\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.390\nWe could probably make\na purchase right now, right?\n\n407\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.620\nSo we could go ahead and\nwe could go ahead and grab something,\n\n408\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.510\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n409\n00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.540\nLooks like they're running a special,\n$200 off.\n\n410\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.370\nSo we could do all this.\n\n411\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:14.230\nSo when we are done with all this, right,\nwe could stop our capture as you can see.\n\n412\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.570\nAnd once we've done the capture,\nwe then can go in and we can examine\n\n413\n00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.600\ndata that may come back and help us to\neven better understand what's going on.\n\n414\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.140\nAnd we can see more information and\na variety of things can be done with that.\n\n415\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.880\nWe didn't really go out to the actual\nwebsite, we just kinda showed you\n\n416\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.400\nthe thought process of starting and\nstopping a capture.\n\n417\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.500\nBut the idea is that we\ncould then use that data\n\n418\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.090\nto help us better understand what\nthe user experience would be.\n\n419\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.297\nHey, when I connect, I get this or\nI get that, or it takes [CROSSTALK].\n\n420\n00:18:45.297 --> 00:18:46.231\nThings like that.\n\n421\n00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:47.826\nSo just to keep that in mind.\n\n422\n00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:50.042\nWe also have configure setting here.\n\n423\n00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:53.696\nSo if you wanna go into the web app\njust bring this over real quick while\n\n424\n00:18:53.696 --> 00:18:54.470\nwe're here.\n\n425\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.630\nAnd we can go in and we can see\nthe name of the web app monitor.\n\n426\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.040\nThis is the monitor itself\nthat we're setting up, right?\n\n427\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.160\nSo we can go in, specify the watcher maybe\nmake changes, any performance criteria,\n\n428\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.920\nany performance counters\nthat we want to grab.\n\n429\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.100\nWe could actually take\na look at all this and\n\n430\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.350\ngo deeper into the configuration of the\nmonitor and actually interact with that if\n\n431\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:19.140\nwe need to change it in some way or\ndo something like that.\n\n432\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.950\nWe actually can go in and\nwe can get information, right?\n\n433\n00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:28.889\nAnd we did talk about it,\ndid take a look at our full results.\n\n434\n00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:31.656\nAnd just the impact of what these\nwould be in terms of the data,\n\n435\n00:19:31.656 --> 00:19:33.320\nand all the stuff we're looking at.\n\n436\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.415\nI think we already went through and\ntook a look at all this.\n\n437\n00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:39.900\nSo we do have a lot of information\nhere that we can interact with.\n\n438\n00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.190\nA lot of stuff that may be valuable\nto us that we wanna think about and\n\n439\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.970\npotentially wanna be able to use or\nutilize.\n\n440\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.650\nWe'll close out of that real quick.\n\n441\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.790\nBut you could see here that once we have\nour monitor set up, we can go in and\n\n442\n00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.080\nwe can then use this as often as\nnecessary to run the tests, and\n\n443\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.740\nor if necessary, as I showed you,\nrecord a browser session.\n\n444\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.853\nLet's just show you what the record\nbrowser session looks like when you launch\n\n445\n00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:05.900\nthe wizard from outside.\n\n446\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.420\nYou'll see here we can go in.\n\n447\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.190\nYou'll name your web app, right?\n\n448\n00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.138\nSo whatever it is.\n\n449\n00:20:11.138 --> 00:20:13.005\nChoose our management pack.\n\n450\n00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:22.129\nThen start our capture, right?\n\n451\n00:20:22.129 --> 00:20:25.129\nSo we're courting that session\nlike we were just doing.\n\n452\n00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:26.902\nSo, start our capture one more time.\n\n453\n00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:29.741\nAnd\n\n454\n00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:47.070\nLet me get out of Try that one more,\nthere we go.\n\n455\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.780\nJust gotta have a backspace key that\nworks the right way for that to work.\n\n456\n00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.020\nAll right, so\nlet me try that one more time.\n\n457\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.680\nSo if we go out and\ndo something like that.\n\n458\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.390\nThat should be there from before, right?\n\n459\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.976\nAll right, so we'll just click\nback through there one more time.\n\n460\n00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:13.814\nLook at reviews.\n\n461\n00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.153\nSomething like that.\n\n462\n00:21:15.153 --> 00:21:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Just generating that traffic and\nresponses.\n\n463\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just clicking.\nJust whatever the case may be.\n\n464\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.816\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n465\n00:21:19.816 --> 00:21:21.650\nAll right, so\nthen when we've done all that,\n\n466\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.280\nyou see it just takes us to the same\nplace if we launch it from outside.\n\n467\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.920\nWe can see and take a look at.\n\n468\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.290\nWe finished the capture and\nthen at that point we don't have,\n\n469\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.080\ncuz we're not going to the site\nthat's set up for monitoring.\n\n470\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.670\nRemember, when I did the capture this way,\n\n471\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.590\nI'm not really going to the real site\nwe've programmed the Web App Monitor for.\n\n472\n00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not really gathering any data.\n\n473\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.940\nRequests, groups,\nall that kind of information.\n\n474\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.750\nI'm not seeing that.\n\n475\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.790\nBut in the real world,\n\n476\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.870\nif I was actually doing this, then what\nI would see is I would see the requests.\n\n477\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.990\nI'd be able to see the tracking of all\nthat information and be able to interact\n\n478\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.590\nwith it against the real site that\nI've setup the monitoring for.\n\n479\n00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:01.400\nI'm just using essentially a proxy site to\nshow you the idea of starting the monitor\n\n480\n00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.180\njust so you could see what\nthe capture would look like.\n\n481\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.240\nBut you'll see,\nif we launch it from outside,\n\n482\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.280\nessentially done the same way,\ntakes us back to the same place.\n\n483\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.655\nWe run the capture, and then we're able to\nview the results when we're done, right?\n\n484\n00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:13.875\nSo that's what we just\nwanted to show you quickly.\n\n485\n00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:17.921\nJust let me not save our changes there,\nand just come back out to our default,\n\n486\n00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:19.614\nor rather our standard viewer.\n\n487\n00:22:19.614 --> 00:22:20.735\nWe see our web app monitor.\n\n488\n00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:22.585\nAnd we could just stack these monitors up,\n\n489\n00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:26.455\nobviously name them in a way that makes\nsense for you so that you can see them.\n\n490\n00:22:26.455 --> 00:22:29.435\nAnd then we're able to do our\nend to end service monitoring.\n\n491\n00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:33.280\nBut in this particular case, we're\nfocusing on the synthetic transaction\n\n492\n00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.530\nmonitoring, our ability to\nset up a web app monitor.\n\n493\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.560\nAnd to then look at the interaction with\nthe website from the user's perspective\n\n494\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.710\nand test their response time, and all\nthe different things that go with that.\n\n495\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.525\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of different monitoring\ncapabilities within this particular\n\n496\n00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:48.755\nutility, so thank you for\ntaking the time to show use that.\n\n497\n00:22:48.755 --> 00:22:52.515\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\nfor joining us on this wonderful day.\n\n498\n00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:55.205\nBut stay tuned, we do have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n499\n00:22:55.205 --> 00:22:57.126\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n500\n00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:58.765\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n501\n00:22:58.765 --> 00:22:59.639\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n502\n00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:02.498\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n503\n00:23:02.498 --> 00:23:08.501\n[MUSIC]\n\n504\n00:23:08.501 -->

00:00:07.992\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:11.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to Your Configuring and\nDeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.150\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.180\nSo far, throughout this series we've\ncovered a lot of different topics and\n\n8\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.530\ndifferent concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.460\nBut in this particular episode\nwe're really gonna focus on well,\n\n10\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.910\nhow we can monitor our\nparticular cloud infrastructure.\n\n11\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.660\nBack with us today in studios we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.000\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n13\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.750\n&gt;&gt; You are welcome.\n\n14\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.250\nAlways a pleasure to be here and\nspend time with you and\n\n15\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.512\nall of our lovely studio audience folk,\nout there in ITProTV land.\n\n16\n00:00:39.512 --> 00:00:43.401\nHopefully, we'll be able to do some\nthought process sharing discussion, etc.,\n\n17\n00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:46.492\nknowledge transfer,\nwhatever you'd like to call it.\n\n18\n00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:49.947\nWe're gonna talk about how you actually\nmonitor this crazy thing called the cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:49.947 --> 00:00:52.150\nWe're gonna use one of\nthe other system center parts.\n\n20\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.056\nWe've alluded to this before in prior\nepisodes you've heard me talk about\n\n21\n00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.548\nSystem Center Ops Manager.\n\n22\n00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:02.186\nAnd we've certainly discussed why\nOps Manager is important at various\n\n23\n00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:05.600\npoints up until now in our\ndifferent areas of focus.\n\n24\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000\nWe've spent a lot of time\nin prior episodes on SCVMM,\n\n25\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.170\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n26\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.478\nAnd the interaction between hosts\nrunning Hyper-V, SCVMM, and the ability\n\n27\n00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:20.048\nto integrate that whole thought process to\nhost and provide the infrastructure for\n\n28\n00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:24.897\nvirtualization, which is the underlying,\nunderpinning architecture of the cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:27.627\nWe talked about the role,\nnot only of Hyper-V and\n\n30\n00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:31.527\nSystem Center Virtual Machine Manager,\nbut the role of WSUS in terms of\n\n31\n00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:35.949\ndoing integration to do patch management,\nthe favorite topic of our lovely Ms.\n\n32\n00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:40.175\nCherokee here who loves to talk about\npatch management and security in many,\n\n33\n00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:41.550\nmany different areas.\n\n34\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.210\n&gt;&gt; Wahoo.\n\n35\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.853\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Exciting, right?\n\n37\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.970\nSo she's excited about that.\n\n38\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.220\nBut we've also talked about\nthe orchestrator product for automation.\n\n39\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.210\nWe'll have more to say\nabout that coming up.\n\n40\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.820\nWe've talked about\nSystem Center Config Manager.\n\n41\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.287\nYou've heard me mention that product and\nsome of the things we do there in terms of\n\n42\n00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:02.706\nmanaging our physical, our actual\ninfrastructure that's not virtualized.\n\n43\n00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:06.937\nAnd our virtual infrastructure from\na configuration management database and\n\n44\n00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:11.250\nconfiguration management reporting and\nmonitoring standpoint there.\n\n45\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.240\nWe have our operating\nsystem deployment and\n\n46\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.960\npatch management capabilities\nintegrated there to do our pushes and\n\n47\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.935\nour deployments and patch management of\nour VMs, our guest operating systems,\n\n48\n00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.930\nas well as perhaps physical\ninfrastructure and a combination of both.\n\n49\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.647\nWe talked about that,\nwe've talked about Service Manager.\n\n50\n00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.845\nWe'll have more to say\nabout that coming up again.\n\n51\n00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:34.482\nSome future episodes about how we\nintegrate our SLA thought process, our\n\n52\n00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:38.882\nService Level Agreement process, and the\nthought process of overseeing incident and\n\n53\n00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:43.592\nproblem and configuration management\nthrough service management and SLAs.\n\n54\n00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:45.734\nSo we'll be talking about that.\n\n55\n00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:47.676\nWe've talked about\nEndpoint Protection Manager,\n\n56\n00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:52.036\nwhich is just our ability to be able to\nbring scanning and virus remediation and\n\n57\n00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:56.946\nmalware remediation into the System\nCenter Suite by connecting the two and\n\n58\n00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:59.216\nrunning it through\nSystem Center Config Manager.\n\n59\n00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:02.456\nSo we've talked about these different\npieces that make up the puzzle\n\n60\n00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:03.666\nof System Center.\n\n61\n00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.106\nWe've also talked about\nData Protection Manager.\n\n62\n00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:09.490\nOur DPM product is our\nEnterprise backup capability,\n\n63\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.830\nand our ability to be able to drive BCDR,\nBusiness Continuity and\n\n64\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.950\nDisaster Recovery,\ncapabilities both through the cloud and\n\n65\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.320\nlocally on hosted infrastructure using our\nbackup and our restore capabilities there.\n\n66\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.214\nAs well as things like Hyper-V Replica,\nand\n\n67\n00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:29.250\nall sorts of additional capabilities\nthat we have for disaster remediation.\n\n68\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.720\nWe've talked about some of those.\n\n69\n00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.620\nWe have the ability to be able\nto use another product, called\n\n70\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.970\nSystem Center Advisor, which has recently\nbecome part of the System Center suite.\n\n71\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.220\nThis is our online service, utilizing the\nMicrosoft Du Jour Fabric, and being able\n\n72\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.065\nto use that to analyze the configuration\nof our servers and our applications and\n\n73\n00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.865\nthen be able to get recommendations\nabout how to optimize them.\n\n74\n00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:54.255\nIf you're familiar with the old Best\nPractice Analyzers that Microsoft still,\n\n75\n00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:57.137\nand I shouldn't say old because there's\nstill in market in many respects,\n\n76\n00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:01.287\nwe talked about one back in some of\nthe beginning episodes as we went through.\n\n77\n00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:05.157\nWe talked about how to deploy SCVMM\nspecifically, and the fact that we needed\n\n78\n00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:10.357\nthe Application Deployment Kit, the ADK,\nand the fact that we downloaded that.\n\n79\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.700\nAnd that we said hey,\nthat's a prereq to actually installing and\n\n80\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.630\nconfiguring a SCVMM.\n\n81\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.750\nAnd when we went out on the website and\nshowed you where to find it,\n\n82\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.590\nwe pointed out, or I pointed out, the fact\nthat it's listed as a best practice\n\n83\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.220\nanalyzer along with MOP and along with\nthe Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.\n\n84\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.400\nAnd a bunch of other best practice\nsolutions that Microsoft currently has or\n\n85\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.590\ncontinues to maintain in market\nto help us to optimize and\n\n86\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.250\nmanage our infrastructure from a variety\nof different vantage points and sources.\n\n87\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.930\nSo System Center Advisor's just\nthe latest in a long line, historically,\n\n88\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.910\nof these particular tools and\nresources Microsoft makes available.\n\n89\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.040\nIt does leverage the Windows Azure Fabric,\nmeaning we use it through the web,\n\n90\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.630\nover the Internet, over\nthe World Wide Web, up to the cloud and\n\n91\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.330\nwe use it to be able to monitor and\nto understand how to optimize our systems.\n\n92\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.960\nSo all these moving parts and\n\n93\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.760\npieces along with the app controller\nthat you've heard me talk about as well,\n\n94\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.320\nwhich is gonna provide our service or\nself-service portal for SCVMM.\n\n95\n00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.574\nAnd lets us deploy services and\napplications, and virtual machines\n\n96\n00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:15.566\nacross public and private clouds by being\nable to manage, configure, and do that.\n\n97\n00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.460\nAnd we've talked about all these\ndifferent moving parts and pieces.\n\n98\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.300\nJust high level reminding you of what\nis in the System Center Suite as we\n\n99\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.890\nget started.\n\n100\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.910\nBut we're gonna drill down and\nfocus on SCOM,\n\n101\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.880\non the System Center Ops Manager product.\n\n102\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.220\nTake a look at what it does and give you\nover our conversations in this episode and\n\n103\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.520\nin the upcoming episodes that we're\ngonna spend devoted to this product.\n\n104\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.881\nReally helps for a good idea of\nwhat it means to be able to do,\n\n105\n00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.044\nin this case,\ndata center based cloud monitoring, and\n\n106\n00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:46.437\nhow we use a product like SCOM\nto be able to accomplish that.\n\n107\n00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:49.502\nIf you wanna join me over here for\njust a minute, or I should say right up,\n\n108\n00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:50.440\nover there.\n\n109\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.125\nI got that right on the first try.\n\n110\n00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:52.012\n&gt;&gt; Good job, yeah.\n\n111\n00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:53.090\n&gt;&gt; That is so awesome.\n\n112\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.330\nI didn't need my L and R gloves to be\nable to tell which hand I should use and\n\n113\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.810\nbe able to figure out where to go,\nso I'm getting better at that.\n\n114\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.010\nThe more I spend time doing\nthis the better I get.\n\n115\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.738\nSo getting started with\nSystem Center 2012 Ops Manager,\n\n116\n00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:07.761\ndon't let the 2012 fool\nyou there by the way.\n\n117\n00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:12.391\n2012, 2012 R2, 2012 SP1, this is just\ngonna speak to the idea of what we\n\n118\n00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:15.850\ndo to deploy the product and\nwhat it's made up of and how it works.\n\n119\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.480\nSo just general overview,\n\n120\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.190\nthat's why I'm not too concerned\nabout the versioning going on there.\n\n121\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.680\nBut you'll see that we\nget some basic concepts,\n\n122\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.938\nsome basic information about what's new.\n\n123\n00:06:24.938 --> 00:06:27.200\nWe're gonna take a look at\na picture I've put together for\n\n124\n00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.500\nus just about the architecture.\n\n125\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.650\nAnd then I'm gonna talk\nabout the components that\n\n126\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.193\nmake up System Center Ops Manager.\n\n127\n00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:36.067\nBut this website will give you just\na general idea of some of the things that\n\n128\n00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.895\nmay be helpful for you to focus on.\n\n129\n00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.125\nSo I encourage you to\ntake a look of those.\n\n130\n00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:44.423\nWe do have a link to the TechNet library\npage for SCOM, so you can drill down and\n\n131\n00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:48.675\nget more detail there on how we\nare supporting and configuring it.\n\n132\n00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:51.185\nWe also have a link to\nwhat's new specifically with\n\n133\n00:06:51.185 --> 00:06:55.030\nSystem Center Ops Manager 2012 R2.\n\n134\n00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.960\nAnd we see that we have a lot of\ncapabilities that are in this product.\n\n135\n00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.941\nRemember, you may be using an earlier\nversion, 2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2.\n\n136\n00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:07.641\nMay even be on a real old version 2007 and\nbe looking to upgrade, and\n\n137\n00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.770\nthat's certainly a possibility.\n\n138\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.110\nWe could also, or migrate depending on\nwhat you're doing, what version you're on.\n\n139\n00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.450\nYou may be using a newer version, 2016 for\ninstance, which is currently in market.\n\n140\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.420\nDoesn't matter what you're using, but\nyou always wanna look to the web,\n\n141\n00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.200\nget the latest information,\nunderstand the features and\n\n142\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.560\ncapabilities of the particular\nversion in question.\n\n143\n00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.354\nAnd this site will give you\nthe most recent information for\n\n144\n00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:32.247\nwhat 12 R2 is gonna provide for you.\n\n145\n00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:35.490\nAnd we're gonna be talking about some of\nthe key features and components here.\n\n146\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.395\nAnd I'll just use the website on\nthe back end here that we have up and\n\n147\n00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:41.190\nrunning to give you a sense\nof what these things are.\n\n148\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.985\nBut we do have the ability\nto do what's called APM,\n\n149\n00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:47.696\nApplication Performance Monitoring,\nwith 12 or SCOM 12 R2.\n\n150\n00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:49.105\nAPM allows us to go in and\n\n151\n00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:54.039\nto look at applications that have been\ncustom developed in-house or Externally,\n\n152\n00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:59.042\nbut link back to our organization either\non the .NET platform, Sony web services,\n\n153\n00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:03.834\nor Windows Base Service Development would\ndo there, and/or Java Enterprise so\n\n154\n00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.550\nJEE, or Java EE,\nthe Java Enterprise Edition platform.\n\n155\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.233\nSo we can monitor both Windows-based and\nJava-based applications using APM which is\n\n156\n00:08:12.233 --> 00:08:16.677\na really big thought process for us in\nterms of web services and cloud services.\n\n157\n00:08:16.677 --> 00:08:20.950\nBecause although your Microsoft solution,\nMicrosoft centric would like to think\n\n158\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.760\nthat the majority of our monitoring\nis gonna focus on Microsoft products.\n\n159\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.740\nWe have to be realistic and\n\n160\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.540\nunderstand that while Microsoft does\nhave very large share of that market,\n\n161\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.010\nthere are many other solutions for web\nservices that are not Microsoft-centric.\n\n162\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.920\nWe'd be fooling ourselves if we\ndon't figure out that we have\n\n163\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.900\nto monitor those equally alongside of all\nthe other stuff we do in our data center.\n\n164\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.860\nAnd this new feature,\n\n165\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.610\nthis ability in 12 R2 gives us that\ncapability to be able to do that.\n\n166\n00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.390\nSo be aware of that, performance and\n\n167\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.260\navailability monitoring, both on the\nserver side and the client side, with APM.\n\n168\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.400\nSo we get a complete picture of what's\ngoing on on the server in the web form or\n\n169\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.200\nwherever it is in the data center\nwith regards to our resources,\n\n170\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.650\nour ability to access databases, present\ninformation, whatever that may be, but\n\n171\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.940\nalso the client side experience.\n\n172\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.250\nHow is the client being able to\ncommunicate with that web server?\n\n173\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.320\nHow responsive is it?\n\n174\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.730\nIs there a lot of latency?\n\n175\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.276\nHow quickly are we able\nto do what we need to do?\n\n176\n00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:17.624\nAnd we can do synthetic transaction\nmonitoring, we can look at all sorts of\n\n177\n00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:20.350\ndifferent ways of doing this,\nand we have that capability.\n\n178\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.550\nSo we have two new web consoles that\nalso provide deep introspection and\n\n179\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.690\nmonitoring capabilities in this area.\n\n180\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.750\nRoot cause analysis and\n\n181\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.840\nreporting on exception events\nwill be what we get out of those.\n\n182\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.720\nSo we'll be taking a look at some of\nthose and talking about those as we go.\n\n183\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.820\nWe also have Fabric Monitoring, as you\ncan see on the screen behind you here,\n\n184\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.720\nbehind me I should say, but\non the screen right there.\n\n185\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.130\nThe Fabric Health Dashboard,\nthis allows us to go in and\n\n186\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.130\nlook at the health of private clouds.\n\n187\n00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.830\nThis is one of the key things\nwe are also gonna be able to do.\n\n188\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.550\nAnd we're linking this back to the idea\nof the clouds that are created in\n\n189\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.820\nSCBMM potentially, and hosted there.\n\n190\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.650\nThat is gonna be our private\ncloud that we're doing on-prem.\n\n191\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.580\nIf we're running in the Azure Fabric and\nhosting our clouds at Microsoft,\n\n192\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.970\nin their data centers.\n\n193\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.303\nAnd we're doing private cloud but\noff prem, hosted through a third party.\n\n194\n00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:09.630\nWe still can leverage the Azure, our\nfabric, and the Azure Fabric Monitoring,\n\n195\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.888\nthe Azure Monitoring Packs to\nbe able to do that monitoring.\n\n196\n00:10:12.888 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd we can either do it from on-prem from\nour SCOM instances in our data centers\n\n197\n00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:21.048\nand/or through the cloud now because\nMicrosoft offers complete analytics and\n\n198\n00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:24.424\ninsight capabilities in monitoring\nthrough the Azure Fabric for\n\n199\n00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:28.540\nthose cloud-based resources, and\nwe can do it directly through there.\n\n200\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.534\nSo we have a lot of different\noptions now as we move forward and\n\n201\n00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:34.427\ncontinue to see the platform evolve,\nwhich is very nice.\n\n202\n00:10:34.427 --> 00:10:36.006\nSo we have those capabilities.\n\n203\n00:10:36.006 --> 00:10:38.016\nWe have Fabric Monitoring diagram view.\n\n204\n00:10:38.016 --> 00:10:40.911\nWe'll talk about that and\nsee what's going on, both for\n\n205\n00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:44.670\nhealth state of cloud and on-prem\nenvironments, as I mentioned to you.\n\n206\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.360\nWe do use a monitoring agent that\nhas been re-branded, renamed.\n\n207\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.239\nIn SCOM 2007, we had a different scenario,\n\n208\n00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:54.390\ndifferent thought process\naround monitoring.\n\n209\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.960\nWe did have an agent but\nit was called something different.\n\n210\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.560\nThen re-branded as the Microsoft\nMonitoring Agent, this is what gives us\n\n211\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.740\nthe additional capabilities of doing our\n.NET application performance monitoring.\n\n212\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.810\nWhat I just mentioned, our APM, as well as\nour system center functionality monitoring\n\n213\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.470\nfor SCOM overall on the endpoint.\n\n214\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.050\nSo just a rebranded, renamed, updated,\nnewly integrated agent is now being\n\n215\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.790\ndeployed, so you could see\nthe Microsoft Monitoring Agent is there.\n\n216\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.260\nIn addition, we do have the ability\nto be able to do integration\n\n217\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.820\nwith DevOps as a thought process.\n\n218\n00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.870\nWe do have the ability now to drive\na learning and work item creation through\n\n219\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:36.960\nTFS, Team Foundation Services, and drive\nthat back into Service Manager as well.\n\n220\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.650\nSo that way we can spin up change and\nrequest tickets for\n\n221\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.440\nchange and instant tracking problem,\ntracking and service manager.\n\n222\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.790\nBut we can also alert our dev team\nwe're having an issue and create and\n\n223\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.440\nlink to work items in TFS.\n\n224\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.293\nAnd reference those when\nwe have an alert or\n\n225\n00:11:52.293 --> 00:11:55.170\na problem that's generated\nthrough SCOM monitoring.\n\n226\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.550\nSo we really are broadening our abilities\nwith SCOM, system center ops manager,\n\n227\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.995\nto be able to deploy far and wide and\nleverage the knowledge we get from\n\n228\n00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:08.155\nbeing able to monitor and to understand\ninfrastructure, and link through our\n\n229\n00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:12.185\nconnectivity and our dependencies to\nall other areas of the ecosystem.\n\n230\n00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:16.005\nAnd be able to alert and/or use that\nknowledge in various ways to drive\n\n231\n00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:20.212\nremediation, to drive optimization and\nto drive performance enhancements.\n\n232\n00:12:20.212 --> 00:12:24.062\nSo these are good features and\ngood capabilities that we are getting.\n\n233\n00:12:24.062 --> 00:12:28.182\nWe do have support, as I mentioned,\nfor APM Monitoring.\n\n234\n00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:33.522\nWe convert that into IntelliTrace format,\nso we can link it back directly to TFS.\n\n235\n00:12:33.522 --> 00:12:35.557\nThat's the time we were\ntalking about there.\n\n236\n00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:40.211\nSo we've talked a bit about that,\nsupport for IPv6, fully instantiated in\n\n237\n00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:44.900\nthe stack now with 12 R2 so\nwe can do both IPv4 and IPv6 capabilities.\n\n238\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.260\nI mentioned System Center Advisor already.\n\n239\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.605\nI mentioned Java Application\nPerformance Monitoring already.\n\n240\n00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:54.260\nWe also have Unix and Linux Monitoring\ndown at the bottom here as you can see.\n\n241\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.520\nFull stack capabilities across\nthe Unix and Linux platforms.\n\n242\n00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.263\nNot for every distribution known\nout there, but for the main ones,\n\n243\n00:13:01.263 --> 00:13:02.781\nmain line ones obviously.\n\n244\n00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:07.395\nWe were able to go in and based on our\nability to be able to bring in management\n\n245\n00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:12.700\npacks for the mainstream vendors, we're\nable to use and drive that monitoring.\n\n246\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.680\nSo if you're running a standard enterprise\ncapable stack, Red Hat for instance,\n\n247\n00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.150\nDebian, Ubuntu, something like that,\nwe're gonna be able to monitor it.\n\n248\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.160\nIf you're running an off in the corner\ndistribution that may not be\n\n249\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.710\na mainstream supported one, we may\nstruggle to do that still because maybe we\n\n250\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.560\ndon't have the tie in with management and\nmonitoring capabilities.\n\n251\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.070\nBut keep in mind that\nwe are able to do that.\n\n252\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.210\nCentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Oracle Linux,\n\n253\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.192\nStandard Enterprise level distros are\ngonna be supported there as some examples,\n\n254\n00:13:40.192 --> 00:13:42.780\nand you'll wanna think about that and\nhave a sense of that.\n\n255\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.890\nBut that's what we're doing and the kind\nof things that we're seeing there.\n\n256\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.536\nWith regards to what\nSystem Center Ops Manager, SCOM,\n\n257\n00:13:49.536 --> 00:13:54.346\nactually looks like, let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look at the thought\n\n258\n00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:59.174\nprocess around the infrastructure and\nthe components that make up SCOM.\n\n259\n00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:04.050\nIf we could go full screen here, just so\nwe can see all the picture, so to speak.\n\n260\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.630\nAnd let me see if I, oop,\nthat's probably a little too much.\n\n261\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.770\nLet's zoom back out there.\n\n262\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.140\nSo let's do that, and make that full size.\n\n263\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.120\nAnd hopefully that will allow us to have\na good conversation about what's going on,\n\n264\n00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.440\non the screen.\n\n265\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.320\nAnd you could see up top there,\nthat we do have our ops and\n\n266\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.500\nweb consoles off to the left.\n\n267\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.410\nA little black bar at\nthe bottom will disappear,\n\n268\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.020\nas long as I don't touch the diagram.\n\n269\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.475\nWe could see that we have external\nconsoles, like many of our products.\n\n270\n00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:33.670\nAnd we're able to go ahead and\ninteract with them.\n\n271\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.210\nAnd I'll explain what the consoles do and\nhow they work in a moment.\n\n272\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.754\nWe see off to the right at the upper\nright-hand corner, a reporting server.\n\n273\n00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:44.282\nThat's gonna be where we're gonna be able\nto aggregate and interact with our data,\n\n274\n00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:48.426\nin a graphical format where we can run\nreports, queries against one of our two\n\n275\n00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:53.470\ndatabases, the Ops Manager Data Warehouse,\nwhich is where our reporting takes place.\n\n276\n00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.137\nWe have our Ops Manager Database, where\nall of our configuration data is stored,\n\n277\n00:14:57.137 --> 00:14:59.760\nso we have two distinct\ndatabases we deal with.\n\n278\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.280\nWe do have, in the center stack there in\nblue right below our two gray ovals for\n\n279\n00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.930\ndatabases, our Resource Pool\nof Management Servers.\n\n280\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.895\nThe resource pool concept is\ngonna be just a management and\n\n281\n00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:15.550\nan administrative concept for us.\n\n282\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.580\nWe pool together management\nservers that are added in so\n\n283\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.430\nthat way we can scale up and\nscale out in terms of high availability.\n\n284\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.550\nThis is how we then survive a failure on\none of more of our management servers.\n\n285\n00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.770\nBut also from a management perspective,\nadministration perspective, allows us to\n\n286\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.380\nbe able to configure and manage more\nthan one server simultaneously for\n\n287\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.130\npolicy based solutions,\nthings like that that become important.\n\n288\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.236\nSo we have our resource pool there,\ndifferent from what we would have seen\n\n289\n00:15:43.236 --> 00:15:46.494\nin SCOM 2007,\nwhere we didn't have a resource pool.\n\n290\n00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:49.855\nWe have a different thought process and\nwe've rebranded that, renamed that,\n\n291\n00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:52.125\nupdated that and\nchanged that thought process here.\n\n292\n00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:54.345\nSo that we now have our resource pools.\n\n293\n00:15:54.345 --> 00:15:55.715\nSo we just wanna think about that.\n\n294\n00:15:55.715 --> 00:16:00.060\nWe do have some sort of network\ncapabilities down there, just showing you\n\n295\n00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.690\na little switch and/or some sort of\nload balancing that would take place.\n\n296\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.155\nNot really important,\njust identifying what's on the diagram for\n\n297\n00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:09.685\nus from a shape perspective.\n\n298\n00:16:09.685 --> 00:16:13.105\nAs we move down towards the bottom\nthere where we see our agents.\n\n299\n00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:16.635\nOur agents are gonna be the Microsoft\nmonitoring agents that are installed on\n\n300\n00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:20.405\ninfrastructure that our resource pool\nof servers are going to be managing.\n\n301\n00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:24.335\nSo those are far flung systems, who\nknows what they are and where they are.\n\n302\n00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:29.270\nBut they're gonna be file and\nprint servers, SQL databases,\n\n303\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.150\nweb servers, SharePoint servers,\nExchange servers, Unix and\n\n304\n00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.540\nLinux servers, all sorts of\ninfrastructure whatever it may be.\n\n305\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.150\nAnd the agents are installed and\nmanaging there so\n\n306\n00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.512\nthat way we're then able to pull\nthe data off those systems,\n\n307\n00:16:44.512 --> 00:16:49.320\nfeed it back up through our network into\nour resource pool of management servers.\n\n308\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.590\nAnd we're then able to throw that\ninformation through the resource\n\n309\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.770\npool of management servers\ninto our databases,\n\n310\n00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.300\naccess that information through\neither our ops and/or web consoles.\n\n311\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.480\nOur ops console is the application\nconsole we typically will use for\n\n312\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.640\nfull administration capabilities.\n\n313\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.560\nNot typically we will use I should\nsay because the web console is not\n\n314\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.680\na full admin capable console.\n\n315\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.970\nBut it's the application that we deploy\nand run on one of our endpoint systems,\n\n316\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.010\ntypically your desktop wherever\nyou're going to manage from.\n\n317\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.050\nAnd you'll use that to interact\nwith the SCOM product.\n\n318\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.330\nWe'll be taking a look at that\nin upcoming conversations and\n\n319\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.450\nepisodes as we demo through all\nthe features and capabilities.\n\n320\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.550\nYou'll see, when we use our web console\nthat our web console is going to be,\n\n321\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.310\nas the name implies, a web console.\n\n322\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.800\nServer like driven, so\nwe do have a dependency and\n\n323\n00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.550\na requirement there for Silverlight.\n\n324\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.950\nWe'll be using that, you'll install that,\nyou'll be able to use the web console\n\n325\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.490\navailable through your browser\npointed at the resource pool.\n\n326\n00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.210\nAnd that will give us capabilities to\ngo in and look at certain aspects of\n\n327\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.240\nthe System Center Ops Manger product,\nbut not full management capabilities.\n\n328\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.050\nSo we're gonna have a limited view of the\nworld there, really just our management,\n\n329\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.060\nrather our oversight of\nmonitoring will take place there.\n\n330\n00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.089\nWe'll talk more about what\nthe web console does and\n\n331\n00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:06.703\nhow it works as we get further into this.\n\n332\n00:18:06.703 --> 00:18:08.266\nAnd then off to the left there,\n\n333\n00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:11.710\nyou'll see we have some agent that\nare down on the left-hand side.\n\n334\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.793\nThey're gonna be connecting not\ndirectly to the management pool.\n\n335\n00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:18.700\nBut rather through a gateway server and\na firewall indicating they're probably\n\n336\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.114\noutside of the organization\ncoming in remotely,\n\n337\n00:18:21.114 --> 00:18:25.000\nwhich is what we would take away,\nhopefully, from that conversation.\n\n338\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.860\nAnd you'll see that we have our\nresource pool of management servers\n\n339\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.250\nthat is accepting that inbound connection.\n\n340\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.410\nThe line and the arrow kind of indicating\nwe're coming inbound with traffic.\n\n341\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:38.680\nSo we can monitor external systems,\nif we have low latency.\n\n342\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.180\nOr excuse me, high latency low bandwidth\nconnections, that will be one of the key\n\n343\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.970\ncriteria for gateway servers to be used to\naggregate up all of the agent-based data.\n\n344\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:51.080\nAnd then send it in over hopefully\nwhat will be a single conversation and\n\n345\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.160\nsingle connection.\n\n346\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.280\nInstead of multiple agents trying\nto reproduce that connection and\n\n347\n00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.150\nstress that bandwidth and\nthat latency even more.\n\n348\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.590\nAnd if we have, our breakaway\nnumber here is typically five.\n\n349\n00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.460\nBut if we have more than five\nof these remote servers,\n\n350\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.480\nthen we're gonna wanna do that.\n\n351\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.979\nAlso if they're not domain-joined.\n\n352\n00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:11.788\nIf they're external stand alone systems,\nand a lot of times they will not be domain\n\n353\n00:19:11.788 --> 00:19:15.032\njoined, then we may use\nthe monitoring capabilities.\n\n354\n00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:19.187\nBut we'll use the gateway server to\nessentially proxy on their behalf and\n\n355\n00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:20.660\nsend the data back in.\n\n356\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.980\nBecause the gateway server will be setup\nwith certificates that will allow it to\n\n357\n00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.340\ntrust and be trusted by and\nit'll wrap securely and\n\n358\n00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.650\nidentify itself securely with\nthe resource pool of management servers.\n\n359\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.410\nSo that way we could securely communicate\nand authenticate ourselves, but do so\n\n360\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.830\nwith resources that are not\ndirectly domain joined.\n\n361\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.190\nSo we have a lot of reasons why\nthe gateway server will be there.\n\n362\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.810\nNo Kerberos authentication for\nnon domain-joined systems,\n\n363\n00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.730\nthen the primary job will be to deploy\na gateway server and use that so\n\n364\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.060\nthat way we're able to do the mutual\nauthentication that's required.\n\n365\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.110\nBut to use a PKI, a Public Key\nInfrastructure, certificate-driven\n\n366\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.600\nsolution anchored at the gateway server,\nanchored on the other side inside\n\n367\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.860\nthe domain, behind the firewall with\nthe resource pool of management servers.\n\n368\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.737\nAnd by creating that trust relationship\nthere, that allows our non domain-joined,\n\n369\n00:20:09.737 --> 00:20:13.920\nnon-trusted systems, to connect,\nto communicate through the gateway server,\n\n370\n00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.260\nand to be able to be seen then and\nto be monitored.\n\n371\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.810\nSo, this is gonna be very important for\nus.\n\n372\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.735\nSo, this is what our high level\narchitecture is going to look like for\n\n373\n00:20:21.735 --> 00:20:24.285\nSCOM, for System Center Ops Manager.\n\n374\n00:20:24.285 --> 00:20:27.165\nOverall, that reporting server up\nat the right is going to be running\n\n375\n00:20:27.165 --> 00:20:29.375\nSQL Server Reporting Services and\n\n376\n00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:34.147\nis gonna be able to then drive our\nreporting capabilities coming out of SCOM.\n\n377\n00:20:34.147 --> 00:20:38.167\nNow we'll talk more as we get into\nthis further in future episodes\n\n378\n00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:42.227\nabout the thought process of reporting\nbeing linked to the idea of being\n\n379\n00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:47.183\nable to deploy management packs that\nwill allow us to have the overall\n\n380\n00:20:47.183 --> 00:20:51.493\nmonitoring capabilities defined for\nresources and infrastructure.\n\n381\n00:20:51.493 --> 00:20:55.733\nAnd part of that definition will\ntypically be reports that are generated\n\n382\n00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:56.963\nas a result of monitoring.\n\n383\n00:20:56.963 --> 00:20:59.453\nAnd so management packs\nbecome very important, and\n\n384\n00:20:59.453 --> 00:21:03.253\nthey're deployed onto the resource\npool management servers and\n\n385\n00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:08.640\nare used to drive centralized monitoring,\nmanagement, and then aggregation of data.\n\n386\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.190\nAnd then that data gets flowed into both\nour ops manager database on the left,\n\n387\n00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.710\nour ops manager data\nwarehouse on the right.\n\n388\n00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.040\nAnd then we'd run our reports against\nthe ops manager data warehouse\n\n389\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.410\nto pull that data in.\n\n390\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.300\nAnd based on a set of queries we're\ngonna be using T-SQL, Transact-SQL.\n\n391\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.710\nSo we're gonna be doing\nstandard SQL queries.\n\n392\n00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.120\nWe'll then be able to draw that data\nout and present it in report form.\n\n393\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.940\nBut those reports are gonna be typically\nassociated with management packs and\n\n394\n00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.170\ngenerated as part of the creation\nof management packs.\n\n395\n00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.340\nA lot of management\npacks are predetermined.\n\n396\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.030\nThey come in in what's called\na locked down or locked out mode.\n\n397\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.260\nSo they are already sealed,\nis the formal term we use.\n\n398\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.720\nThey are sealed because they\nare generated by either Microsoft or\n\n399\n00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.110\na third party vendor.\n\n400\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.420\nAnd we import them sealed so\nthat we're not able to edit them directly.\n\n401\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.120\nWe use them centrally as is,\n\n402\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.530\noff the shelf, preconfigured to monitor\nthe infrastructure in question.\n\n403\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.740\nWhether it's our VMWare infrastructure,\nwe can monitor V-Center,\n\n404\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.650\nwe can monitor our Horizon View VDI\ninstances for virtual desktop.\n\n405\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.020\nMaybe it's our Citrix infrastructure,\nmaybe it's Office 365.\n\n406\n00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.410\nWhatever it may be,\n\n407\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.540\nwe'll get those sealed management packs\nfrom the vendor that creates them.\n\n408\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.124\nBut rest assured, no problem,\n\n409\n00:22:22.124 --> 00:22:25.656\nwe have our own way of dealing with\nthat if we want to customize, right?\n\n410\n00:22:25.656 --> 00:22:28.876\nBecause it's good to know that we have\na baseline that we can lay down with that\n\n411\n00:22:28.876 --> 00:22:29.680\nmanagement pack.\n\n412\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.000\nBut what if we want to create\nour own additional monitors?\n\n413\n00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.790\nWe can customize and\nauthor our own management packs,\n\n414\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.910\neither by choosing to copy that\nmanagement pack and creating an unsealed\n\n415\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.900\nversion of it that we can then create\noverrides on essentially, right?\n\n416\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.480\nOr we can just create our own management\npacks from scratch and we can add in all\n\n417\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.340\nthe different moving parts and pieces,\nall the components of the management pack.\n\n418\n00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.371\nThe monitors, the rules,\nthe reports, all that stuff.\n\n419\n00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:58.060\nAnd we're able to put all that in and\ncreate our own management packs that\n\n420\n00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.040\nare unsealed,\nopened that we can then use as well.\n\n421\n00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.140\nSo we'll have the capabilities and\nthe options to do this.\n\n422\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.600\nAnd we'll talk more about this and\nhow this works.\n\n423\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.520\nYou'll see how to import management packs.\n\n424\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.090\nWe'll see how to create a custom one.\n\n425\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.301\nWe'll be going through\nall those skills and\n\n426\n00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:12.090\nmaking sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n427\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:17.670\nBut we want to make sure as we begin to\nreally lay out the foundational knowledge,\n\n428\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:22.100\nthe overview of SCOM, what it looks like\nas you can see, what these parts are,\n\n429\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.022\nwhy they're important,\n\n430\n00:23:23.022 --> 00:23:26.225\nwhy we we have to take the time to\nunderstand what happens with each one.\n\n431\n00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:29.485\nWe wanna make sure that we understand\nthe logic of what we're seeing.\n\n432\n00:23:29.485 --> 00:23:33.224\nAnd I talked about the high\navailability of SCOM 2012,\n\n433\n00:23:33.224 --> 00:23:36.904\nstarting with 2012, 2012 SP 1, 2012 R2.\n\n434\n00:23:36.904 --> 00:23:41.785\nThis break with the past in 2007 where\nwe now create this resource pool to\n\n435\n00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:45.369\ngive us the ability to survive\nthe failure of a server and\n\n436\n00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:48.285\nstill maintain continuity and monitoring.\n\n437\n00:23:48.285 --> 00:23:51.604\nWe've gotten away from this\nidea of what's called the RMS,\n\n438\n00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:53.243\nthe Root Management Server.\n\n439\n00:23:53.243 --> 00:23:57.855\nWhich was the primary management server\nin the older versions of SCOM that,\n\n440\n00:23:57.855 --> 00:24:02.520\nif that failed, we had significant\nproblems associated with recovery.\n\n441\n00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.030\nWe could recover, but\nit took a long time to deal with that.\n\n442\n00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:10.640\nWe now have this idea of what I label in\nmy notes as co-equality among all servers.\n\n443\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.440\nAll management servers\nare now essentially equal.\n\n444\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.140\nThey all host all the functionality roles,\n\n445\n00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.040\ncapabilities, that are not unique but\nspread out across all management servers.\n\n446\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.444\nAnd as a result, that pool,\nany server in that pool,\n\n447\n00:24:24.444 --> 00:24:27.711\ncan essentially function\nlike all other servers.\n\n448\n00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:31.562\nAnd because of that, if we lose one, we're\nno longer worried about losing the primary\n\n449\n00:24:31.562 --> 00:24:33.660\nserver, or the root management server.\n\n450\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.840\nBut rather, we spread that out so\nthat everybody is equal.\n\n451\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.680\nAnd because of that,\n\n452\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.760\nwe're highly available right out of\nthe box by design and by default.\n\n453\n00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.230\nThe only thing we have to do\nis scale up by adding multiple\n\n454\n00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.680\nmanagement servers into the pool.\n\n455\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.220\nMeaning, if you still deploy with\nonly a single management server,\n\n456\n00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.200\nclearly not very highly available\nif we lose that server.\n\n457\n00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.470\nBut assuming we have at least two or more,\nwe're going to automatically be highly\n\n458\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.960\navailable and we can survive the loss of\na server or perhaps multiple servers and\n\n459\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.820\nstill be able to do what we need to do.\n\n460\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.310\nSo keep that in mind,\n\n461\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.000\nall management servers\nare essentially equal going forward.\n\n462\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.790\nAnd we've done away with that role,\nno longer required,\n\n463\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.210\nI would say obsolete only in\nthe sense we no longer deploy it.\n\n464\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.230\nBut what we used to call the RMS,\nor the root management server.\n\n465\n00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.080\nSo if you're used to that or\nhave seen that,\n\n466\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.330\nyou're not gonna see that any longer\ncuz we no longer are using that.\n\n467\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.290\nSo just something to consider and be aware\nof as we look at our capabilities and\n\n468\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.170\nwe look at our thought process here.\n\n469\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.270\nWe do create other resource pools outside\nof the route one that is created, or\n\n470\n00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.100\nexcuse me, the general one's created\nautomatically out of the box.\n\n471\n00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.660\nIf we want to scale up and\nscale out, we can do that.\n\n472\n00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.570\nThink about, for instance,\n\n473\n00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.660\nthe idea of having a resource pool\nspecific to monitoring Windows and\n\n474\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.680\na separate one specific to monitoring\nLinux or Unix infrastructure.\n\n475\n00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.900\nAnd that is what a lot of my customers\nhave asked for, and we have been doing for\n\n476\n00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:56.090\nthem with deployments in this space in the\n2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2 thought process.\n\n477\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.130\nCarries forward into 2016 as well,\njust so you know.\n\n478\n00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.690\nSo a lot of my customers will say,\nhey, we have fixed infrastructure,\n\n479\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.010\nhow do we monitor that,\ncan we scale a resource pool for each one,\n\n480\n00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.700\ndedicating servers to specifically\ndealing with those capabilities?\n\n481\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.530\nThe answer is yes.\n\n482\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.570\nLet's just create a separate resource\npool and put our resources there for\n\n483\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.560\nmonitoring those with those agents and\n\n484\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.805\nthose management packs specific\nto that kind of infrastructure.\n\n485\n00:26:19.805 --> 00:26:21.665\nAnd so, we can do that,\nno big deal at all.\n\n486\n00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:25.715\nWe can do that also for\nWeb application availability monitoring.\n\n487\n00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:30.045\nSo, traditionally, the three different\nthought processes are scalable areas\n\n488\n00:26:30.045 --> 00:26:32.000\nthat we look at to build\nour resource pools.\n\n489\n00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.277\nWindows-based infrastructure, Linux, Unix\nand/or Web Application Availability and\n\n490\n00:26:36.277 --> 00:26:37.340\nmonitoring for that.\n\n491\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.460\nIt's kind of hard to see that's three,\n\n492\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.232\nbut that's probably a little\nbit easier to see if I do that.\n\n493\n00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:43.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's like a wave, a mini wave.\n\n494\n00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.050\nAll right, so you can see all that.\n\n495\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.230\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n496\n00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.880\nAnd remember also connecting\nmanagement servers.\n\n497\n00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.340\nWe wanna make sure we have\nlow-latency network connectivity.\n\n498\n00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.480\nSo, relatively responsive,\n\n499\n00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.110\nalmost instantaneous\ncommunication is very important.\n\n500\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.060\nAnd we have to at least have two\nmanagement servers available in that pool\n\n501\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.000\nto create redundancy.\n\n502\n00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.750\nWe talked about that and\nwhy that's so important.\n\n503\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.020\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n504\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.470\nIf we could go back to the diagram for\n\n505\n00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.620\na minute,\nwe're not done talking about that yet.\n\n506\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.360\nOne other thing I want to point out there.\n\n507\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.000\nWe do create a backwards and maintain\na backwards compatibility capability here.\n\n508\n00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.040\nWe have what's called\nan RMS emulator role.\n\n509\n00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.840\nIt's assigned to the first\nmanagement server stood up and\n\n510\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.210\ninstalled into that pool automatically.\n\n511\n00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.350\nWe can modify that and move that and\nreassign that using PowerShell.\n\n512\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:31.220\nSo we can move it around, but\nwe maintain this emulator,\n\n513\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.720\nthis RMS Emulator role, specifically\nto ensure that if we are running\n\n514\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.150\nmixed infrastructure with SCOM 2007 that\nwe still are able to communicate and\n\n515\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.370\nhave the capacity to talk that\nlanguage around that old role.\n\n516\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.420\nSo it's important just to\nbe aware of this as well.\n\n517\n00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.500\nAgain, we call it the RMS emulator role.\n\n518\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.030\nIt does exist and\nwill be there automatically.\n\n519\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.946\nIf you want to move it or manipulate it,\nwe can move it using PowerShell.\n\n520\n00:27:54.946 --> 00:27:59.050\nGet-SCOMManagementServer is\nthe commandlet that we would use.\n\n521\n00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.840\nThe name parameter would specify the name\nof the server we want to target.\n\n522\n00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.800\nOr rather, that it's on.\n\n523\n00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.190\nAnd then we would simply, excuse me, that\nwe want to target is what I mean to say,\n\n524\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.530\nthe first time I was right.\n\n525\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.160\nPipe that to set SCOM emulator,\nand that lets us shift that or\n\n526\n00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.460\nmove that between various\nservers if needed.\n\n527\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.150\nBut we do that from the either SCOM\noperations management shell or\n\n528\n00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.570\nfrom PowerShell with\nthe appropriate module loaded.\n\n529\n00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.390\nWe've had that conversation in prior\nearlier episodes around how we can load\n\n530\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.100\nmodules to create functionality\nin PowerShell generically, or\n\n531\n00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.300\nuse the platform specific,\n\n532\n00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.350\nproduct specific shell that is\nalready pre-loaded with those modules.\n\n533\n00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.480\nIt's up to you to decide what to do there.\n\n534\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.810\nBut just keep that in mind.\n\n535\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.370\nWill be up to you to think about\nhow you wanna approach that.\n\n536\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.350\nBut I did mention that Ops Manager is\nfully integrated, Cloud capable, both,\n\n537\n00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.260\nwith the Azure Management Pack and\nother capabilities.\n\n538\n00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.440\nWe can monitor public and private Clouds.\n\n539\n00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.470\nWe could do that from OnPrem,\ndo it through the Cloud, Offprem, etc..\n\n540\n00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.590\nHowever we choose to do that,\nwe do support the monitoring\n\n541\n00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:02.030\nof web application and service based\ndelivery today for our Cloud environment.\n\n542\n00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.810\nSo, we do have full integration to\nfull monitoring capabilities here\n\n543\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.640\nto be able to integrate with\nour Cloud thought process\n\n544\n00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.780\nprovided from other areas in System\nCenter, and integrated fully here for\n\n545\n00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.300\nour data center level monitoring\ncapabilities across the enterprise.\n\n546\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.190\nSo I wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that as we wrap up our initial\n\n547\n00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:25.260\nconversations around what it takes to be\nable to look at System Center Ops Manager,\n\n548\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.190\nsee the various components,\nand understand what they do.\n\n549\n00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.920\nAnd then, as a result of that,\nin future episodes,\n\n550\n00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.055\nwe'll talk about what does it take to\nstand up this product, how do we do that?\n\n551\n00:29:34.055 --> 00:29:35.545\nShow you how to install it.\n\n552\n00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:37.145\nWhat's required as prereq's.\n\n553\n00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:40.475\nPretty standard prereq's along the lines\nof all the other stuff we've talked about.\n\n554\n00:29:40.475 --> 00:29:43.745\nBut we'll remind you about what those are,\nand then we'll go in and take a guided\n\n555\n00:29:43.745 --> 00:29:46.940\ntour of the interface and start talking\nabout how we make all the stuff happen and\n\n556\n00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.190\nessentially create the connectivity\nthat allows us to do the monitoring.\n\n557\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.870\n&gt;&gt; Well, Adam, thank you so much for that\nmyriad of tools that you explained and\n\n558\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.970\nshowed us different options\nthat we do have available, and\n\n559\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.420\nthat high level overview of SCOM.\n\n560\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.350\nIt looks like a pretty powerful tool,\nand I can't wait til we go ahead and\n\n561\n00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.680\ndive further with that.\n\n562\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.770\nBut for this particular episode, we\nare out of time, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n563\n00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.740\nsign out.\n\n564\n00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.980\nAs your host, remember,\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n565\n00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.630\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n566\n00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:13.129\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro TV.\n\n567\n00:30:13.129 --> 00:30:18.889\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:21.967\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:08.413\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:12.070\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.276\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Configuring and\nDeploying a Private Cloud Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.016\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.770\nSo, this is actually a part two,\n\n8\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.226\na continuation of a previous conversation\nthat we were having where we we're really\n\n9\n00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:25.750\nlooking at well how to\nmonitor a private cloud.\n\n10\n00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.778\nWith us today back in studios\nwe have mister Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.150\nThank you for joining us today Adam.\n\n12\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, always glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.749\nSCOM, SCOM, SCOM,\nwe're gonna talk more about SCOM.\n\n14\n00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:37.460\nBecause it's so\ngood it can't just have a part one.\n\n15\n00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.120\nIt has to have a part two.\n\n16\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.377\n&gt;&gt; That's right Adam, we were talking\nabout it in a previous episode and\n\n17\n00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:44.210\nthat conversation kind of wrapped up.\n\n18\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.350\nLooking at the overview, the architecture.\n\n19\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.160\nSo what are we really going to\nbe looking at in this show?\n\n20\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.560\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna continue with\nwhat we were talking about.\n\n21\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.944\nWe are going to do a little bit\nmore broader wider thought process,\n\n22\n00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:55.644\nexpanding out into the console.\n\n23\n00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:57.517\nActually taking you on\na little guided tour,\n\n24\n00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:00.040\nthe way we tried to do with all\nthe tools as we introduce them.\n\n25\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.270\nAnd we'll be talking about what we need to\nprepare to actually get SCOM stood up and\n\n26\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.190\nhow its gonna be configured.\n\n27\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.774\nWe'll remind ourselves what the\narchitecture looks like with that drawing\n\n28\n00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:13.526\nback up and refer to the different moving\nparts, say we need SQL, we need ops and\n\n29\n00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:14.260\nweb consoles.\n\n30\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.460\nWe need a couple of databases running.\n\n31\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.860\nWe need maybe a gateway server.\n\n32\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.000\nWe need some agents both Windows-based,\nUNIX, Linux-based.\n\n33\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.020\nAnd we'll just talk through\nthe logic of all those things.\n\n34\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.600\nWe're also gonna start,\nin addition to all that,\n\n35\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.000\nby actually defining some vocabulary for\nyou.\n\n36\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.341\nBecause as we've stressed in some of\nthe other conversations, it's important to\n\n37\n00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:38.185\nunderstand what we are talking about and\nhow we're referring to things to\n\n38\n00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:42.589\nensure that as we, as IT professionals,\nas individuals that are using products and\n\n39\n00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:46.580\ntalking about them and interacting with\nthem with our peers or colleagues.\n\n40\n00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.727\nPeople we work with and work for\nthat we try to maintain consistency and\n\n41\n00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:55.250\nstandardization about how we talk\nabout things, and what we refer to.\n\n42\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.921\nBecause language is so important when\nI referred to for instance, a role\n\n43\n00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.010\nassignment or a user role or profile or a\nscope, we need to be on the same page, and\n\n44\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.281\nunderstand what we're talking about with\nregards to the context of the SCOM tools,\n\n45\n00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.410\nSystem Center Operations Manager tool.\n\n46\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.903\nBecause a user role,\nwhile generically is defined, essentially,\n\n47\n00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.903\nthe same way across our product stack.\n\n48\n00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:17.798\nWe talked about user roles,\nfor instance, in SCVMM and\n\n49\n00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:20.480\ntalked about why they were important.\n\n50\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.822\nRemember we have the delegated\nadministration capability there for\n\n51\n00:02:23.822 --> 00:02:26.190\nfabric administrator as\na delegated user role.\n\n52\n00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.313\nBut generically while the idea\nof user role is the same,\n\n53\n00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:31.306\nput users into a predefined group or\n\n54\n00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:36.150\ntemplate that's got assigned privileges\nand responsibilities linked to it.\n\n55\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.370\nUse that as the mechanism to allow them or\nenable them to do their job.\n\n56\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.821\nThe roles themselves will vary by tool,\nand\n\n57\n00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:47.050\nwill be unique to that particular\ncontext or the tool specification.\n\n58\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.568\nAnd so we wanna understand the basic idea,\nbut then we also wanna localize that\n\n59\n00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:53.360\nlanguage and we're gonna be doing\nall that as we get started.\n\n60\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.800\nSo having shown you my cards so\nto speak, laid them on the table,\n\n61\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.987\nlet's actually start by taking a look.\n\n62\n00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:03.886\nIf you join me here in the Web, you'll see\nthat we have the prepping your environment\n\n63\n00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:07.490\nfor, in this case,\nSystem Center 2012 R2 Ops manager.\n\n64\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.665\nWe've talked before about the fact we\ndo have prior versions of this suite of\n\n65\n00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:13.700\nproducts and or the tools we may use.\n\n66\n00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.257\nWe have 2012, 2012 SP1, 2012 R2 and\nthis current area that we're discussing,\n\n67\n00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:23.994\nwe're looking ahead after 2016,\nlooking backwards the 2007 version of\n\n68\n00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:27.239\nSCOM in the system center\nproducts that will go with it.\n\n69\n00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.290\nSo, we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that we're focusing\n\n70\n00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.477\nin right now on 12R2.\n\n71\n00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:34.945\nAnd as we look and we see what's\ninvolved in preparing here and\n\n72\n00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:36.820\nwe'll just kind of scroll down.\n\n73\n00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.599\nYou'll see that we can virtualize, scroll\ndown a little too far, we can virtualize\n\n74\n00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.108\nthe SCOM products, as we can with all\nthe products that we're installing, and\n\n75\n00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:50.647\nwe can run literally this entire stack and\nall of our infrastructure in theory.\n\n76\n00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.690\nAlmost without exception,\nat least in this discussion we're having.\n\n77\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.230\nAll of it can be virtualized,\nand so we can think about that.\n\n78\n00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.233\nWe can run this up on\nthe Microsoft Azure Fabric.\n\n79\n00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:04.489\nWe’ve talked a little bit about that with\nsystem center virtual machine manager,\n\n80\n00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.970\nthe use of the Windows Azure pack,\nthe creation of private clouds.\n\n81\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.604\nIf you haven't seen us go through those\nconversations earlier in some of the prior\n\n82\n00:04:11.604 --> 00:04:15.040\nepisodes, I encourage you to go back,\ntake a look at our discussions there.\n\n83\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.880\nLooking ahead,\nwe'll have some future discussions.\n\n84\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.990\nA little bit more in depth\non the Windows Azure pack.\n\n85\n00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.979\nThe management of and the use of the\nWindows Azure platform interacting with\n\n86\n00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.656\nthe provisioning of private cloud\nboth through SCVMM and with SCOM and\n\n87\n00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:32.039\nsome of the other products as we\nlook to link them up to the cloud.\n\n88\n00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.666\nSo, we have options, run this private\ncloud and the monitoring of it,\n\n89\n00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:36.580\nprivate on prem.\n\n90\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.180\nWe host the, the infrastructure.\n\n91\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.460\nWe maintain it.\n\n92\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.760\nWe could virtualize our stack and\nrun it locally in our data center.\n\n93\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.185\nOr, we can throw this out into the cloud,\ndo private cloud, but\n\n94\n00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:50.560\nhost it off-prem with a third\nparty provider like Microsoft.\n\n95\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.030\nWe don't want to leave\nother providers out.\n\n96\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.465\nYou can run all this on AWS,\n\n97\n00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:58.213\non Amazon Web Services in the Amazon\nfabric because we're just running\n\n98\n00:04:58.213 --> 00:05:02.280\nvirtual machine instances that are then\ngonna be used to do what we need done.\n\n99\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.690\nSo, we can do this a variety of ways.\n\n100\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.922\nThe thing I like about the webpage we're\nlooking at here you have a nav area\n\n101\n00:05:08.922 --> 00:05:10.020\non the right here.\n\n102\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.502\nAs you see, I'm looking at virtualization.\n\n103\n00:05:11.502 --> 00:05:15.910\nYou'll notice we kind of are tracking\nacross and we see the item highlighted.\n\n104\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.992\nAnd as I scroll down just a little bit,\nyou'll see we switched to minimum screen\n\n105\n00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:21.351\nresolution down at the bottom,\nright, it's kinda there.\n\n106\n00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:24.266\nSo as we go through, we could see\nall the topics laid out for us, so\n\n107\n00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:26.819\nit's really nice and easy,\nright, to see where we are.\n\n108\n00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.100\nSo I'm gonna let you, obviously,\ntake a look at this on your own.\n\n109\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.038\nWe're not gonna through and hit\nthe highlights in everyone of them, but\n\n110\n00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:36.044\nI do wanna point out just a couple of\nthings that would be of interest to us.\n\n111\n00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.360\nAnd we've noted this since some of\nour other discussions in other areas.\n\n112\n00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.610\nMinimum requirements always\nimportant to know what they are.\n\n113\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.460\nOne of the reasons we take\nyou out to the web and\n\n114\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.823\nshow you some of this stuff here and say\nhey, this is the most recent information,\n\n115\n00:05:47.823 --> 00:05:49.268\nwe'll put the episode together.\n\n116\n00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:49.983\nAnd by the way,\n\n117\n00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:53.458\nhere's the URLs, so when you wanna\nreference it later go back take a look.\n\n118\n00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:58.306\nYou know, some of this stuff may change\nover time, as we put our new versions of\n\n119\n00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:02.860\nthis product as we do a change maybe in\nterms of the amount of memory or CPU or\n\n120\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.607\namount of disk space required,\nminimum number of virtual or\n\n121\n00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:08.760\nphysical cores things like that.\n\n122\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.457\nYou always want to check for\nthe most recent information because,\n\n123\n00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:14.442\nyou don't wanna go and install something,\nbased on what you think will be\n\n124\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:17.933\nthe minimum requirements, or in this case\nbased off the requirements to make it run.\n\n125\n00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:21.641\nAnd all of the sudden, find out you've\neither done this in a way that wont work\n\n126\n00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:24.380\nor you've done it, but\nyou're gonna be limping along in\n\n127\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.880\nproduction cuz you're not really\nproviding the right configuration.\n\n128\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.480\nIt's gonna take you a lot of extra\ntime and effort to go back and\n\n129\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.590\nunwind that and fix that.\n\n130\n00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.526\nAnd the other issue associated there is,\nremember,\n\n131\n00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:38.520\na lot of these products are burrowing\ninto AD into the Active Directory.\n\n132\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.550\nCreating accounts, service accounts,\nrun as accounts things like that.\n\n133\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.091\nThey may be extending the schema\nto add functionality and\n\n134\n00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:50.900\nwe may be creating containers,\nmanagement containers, site references.\n\n135\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.503\nThere's a variety of things that go\non depending on the product we're\n\n136\n00:06:53.503 --> 00:06:54.740\ntalking about.\n\n137\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.836\nOnce we start installing and\nconfiguring some of this stuff,\n\n138\n00:06:57.836 --> 00:07:01.643\nit may be difficult to unwind that and\npull that back because we may not be able\n\n139\n00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:04.937\nto cleanly remove those things and\nit becomes more complicated.\n\n140\n00:07:04.937 --> 00:07:07.713\nSo the thought process is\nget it right the first time,\n\n141\n00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:10.243\nright because the more\nplanning you do up front,\n\n142\n00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:13.410\nthe less likely it is your going\nto have issues and concerns.\n\n143\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.530\nThe rule of thumb with AD is you can\nput stuff in you can't take stuff out.\n\n144\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.122\nWhat I mean by that is, we add and\nremove user accounts and groups,\n\n145\n00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:25.375\ncomputer accounts and all sorts of stuff\nin AD all the time as administrators.\n\n146\n00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:29.317\nMost of you, if not all of you,\nhave I'm sure have this experience, or\n\n147\n00:07:29.317 --> 00:07:33.595\nseen this done heard various people on\nITPro.TV various hosts various means\n\n148\n00:07:33.595 --> 00:07:37.188\ntalk about this in other episodes for\nother areas of knowledge.\n\n149\n00:07:37.188 --> 00:07:40.021\nAnd you, I'm sure have probable\ndone this on your own and\n\n150\n00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:42.770\npracticed it if your\ncertifying to take exams.\n\n151\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.558\nBut what you may not realise or\nthought about is,\n\n152\n00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:50.318\non the backend inside the schema, those\ndefinitions, those object references,\n\n153\n00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:52.090\nthey don't actually go away.\n\n154\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.128\nYou delete the user but they're still\na reference to it in the schema.\n\n155\n00:07:56.128 --> 00:07:59.427\nAnd so, the problem becomes,\nthat if you create an account,\n\n156\n00:07:59.427 --> 00:08:03.871\nif you create an instance, a container,\nsomething as a definition in the schema We\n\n157\n00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:06.680\nput that stuff in, but\nit's a one-way operation.\n\n158\n00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.580\nWe could turn it off and\nhide it, so you don't see it.\n\n159\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.410\nSo it's not bothering you,\nbut it's still there.\n\n160\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.290\nAnd if we have to move\nthat by removing it,\n\n161\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.360\nand then put it back in, while we can\ncertainly add back in a machine and\n\n162\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.060\nrename it or add back in the same\ninstance after we clean it up.\n\n163\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.800\nThere are ways to do that, but\nit becomes more complicated.\n\n164\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.680\nSo you just wanna make sure you try\nto plan and get it right upfront.\n\n165\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.190\nThat'll be fairly important for\nyou to consider.\n\n166\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.830\n&gt;&gt; That is almost invaluable\nadvice that Adam just gave you.\n\n167\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Almost?\n\n168\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.860\nAlmost invaluable.\n\n169\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.780\nIt's not quite valuable, but\nit's on the cusp of being valuable.\n\n170\n00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.220\n&gt;&gt; I think I should attach a dollar\namounts to it, how about that?\n\n171\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.090\nBecause it's not just for this particular\ntool that we're looking at here, but\n\n172\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.010\nin IT in general.\n\n173\n00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.620\nThe more work you put up up front,\n\n174\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.490\nthen the more successful your\nentire project should be.\n\n175\n00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.045\n&gt;&gt; Will be, absolutely, no doubt about it.\n\n176\n00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:53.749\nThe other thing I just want to\npoint out here, real quick, and\n\n177\n00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:56.630\nI'm just scrolling down just to get to it,\njust give me a second.\n\n178\n00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.480\nCuz it's kind of a long,\nlong list here before we get to the area,\n\n179\n00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.610\nthere we are right there.\n\n180\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.810\nFirewalls, just didn't wanna zoom\npast it while I was talking to you.\n\n181\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.790\nAnother area, I'd say hey you just\nprobably wanna spend a few minutes looking\n\n182\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.020\nat in here at some point,\nis the firewall chart.\n\n183\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.440\nWe've got a detailed matrix laid out\nwith the number of ports required,\n\n184\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.920\nthe protocols associated with them, the\ntraffic flow, where we're going from in\n\n185\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.340\nthis case the first example here,\nops manager feature, management server.\n\n186\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.020\nHow we are doing port number and\ndirection.\n\n187\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.150\nFeature B what are we\ntalking to in other words.\n\n188\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.830\nSo management server talking to\nthe operational database and\n\n189\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.790\nthen the ports involved and\nany notes and configuration items.\n\n190\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.040\nSo this goes on for\n\n191\n00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.700\na bit as you can see as we scroll\ndown we got quite a bit of this here.\n\n192\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.980\nAnd it's very valuable for\nus to have access to this information.\n\n193\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.080\nBecause this allows us to understand\nhow firewalls have to be configured\n\n194\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.170\ndepending on where we are and\nwhat we are communicating with.\n\n195\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.570\nWe will go back to our architectural\ndiagram here for just a second.\n\n196\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.860\nRemember that in the diagram I\nhad a firewall sitting here.\n\n197\n00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.470\nBecause clearly we wanted to differentiate\nthe fact that anything using the gateway\n\n198\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.690\noutside of the domain not trusted,\nno Kerberos authentication.\n\n199\n00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.620\nEssentially external remote machines\nwe have no direct knowledge of\n\n200\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.200\nwill certainly communicate\ninbound through the firewall.\n\n201\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.000\nBut keep in mind that we don't\nalways traditionally have firewalls\n\n202\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.710\nrunning inside on the LAN\nbetween various areas.\n\n203\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.930\nWe may VLAN, we may subnet we may do\na variety of things to logically and\n\n204\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.140\nphysically isolate network traffic.\n\n205\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.340\nBut it may not be a firewall\nthat's used to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.720\nBut that doesn't mean won't be,\nit just means that it's normally not.\n\n207\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.420\nSo while we may not need to pay attention\nto firewall ports within the LAN,\n\n208\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.700\nyou have to keep in mind that,\nnumber one, there is a possibility,\n\n209\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.140\ndepending on what we call the ESA,\n\n210\n00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.840\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture that\nwe may be putting firewalls in place\n\n211\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.860\nto block off and to control access\nto certain areas of our network.\n\n212\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.490\nAnd if we are we just have to be aware\nof that, work with our security team and\n\n213\n00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.530\nour firewall management\nfunction whatever that\n\n214\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.650\nis to make sure the appropriate\nports are open.\n\n215\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.120\nNumber two remember that every Windows\nhost and indeed every host running Linux,\n\n216\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.950\nUnix whatever it is has firewalls\nrunning locally in the OS most likely.\n\n217\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.300\nWe may not use them.\n\n218\n00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.680\nThey may be turned off.\n\n219\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.590\nWe may be able to program them on\nthe fly for a local install for\n\n220\n00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.700\ninstance when we install let's\nsay the management server\n\n221\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.790\nright here on one of\nthe members of the pool.\n\n222\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.910\nWe're configuring the Windows\nadvanced firewall and\n\n223\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.670\nopening up the firewall ports\nnecessary to allow traffic\n\n224\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.680\nas part of that installation\ntraditionally locally on the machine.\n\n225\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.050\nBut between the reporting server and\nthe ops data manager warehouse up here.\n\n226\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.290\nBetween the web console which\nin theory it's just not really\n\n227\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.160\nset up this way in the diagram in the\nsense that we're not distinctly showing it\n\n228\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.070\nIn the DMZ outside on the external\nportion of the network.\n\n229\n00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.190\nBut web consoles, traditionally,\nare going to be coming in from outside,\n\n230\n00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.360\nconnecting from outside the firewall.\n\n231\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.660\nAlthough, they certainly can be\nused inside the LAN, as well,\n\n232\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.920\nthere's no distinction there either way.\n\n233\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.310\nBut the point would be,\nthat if we're using the ops or\n\n234\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.300\nweb console from outside the firewall, the\nports required to connect those have to be\n\n235\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.510\nopen inbound through this DMZ-based\nfirewall to allow connectivity.\n\n236\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.653\nSo we do need to understand to manage\nfirewall, information, configuration and\n\n237\n00:12:13.653 --> 00:12:17.674\ntraffic because otherwise we got a lot of\ninfrastructure sitting in one area and\n\n238\n00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.414\na lot of people on the other side and\n\n239\n00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:22.013\nsystems on the other side\nlooking to communicate.\n\n240\n00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:24.979\nAnd there's probably not a lot of stuff\nhappening between the two because we're\n\n241\n00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:26.600\nnot able to pass the traffic back and\nforth.\n\n242\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.930\nSo this can prove to be\na bit of a challenge for us.\n\n243\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.420\nSo I just want to point out some of\nthe things that are gonna be important for\n\n244\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.720\nyou to look at in a document like this.\n\n245\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.680\nThere's a wealth of information up there.\n\n246\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.630\nMake sure you're familiar with,\ncomfortable with, and\n\n247\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.640\nknow where to reference it because it\nwill prove to be valuable for you.\n\n248\n00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.180\nHaving said that, thought it would\nbe helpful for us to go in and\n\n249\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.040\nalso take a look at the console.\n\n250\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.690\nJust extend our lab timer a little\nbit while we're doing that.\n\n251\n00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.910\nAnd just give you a quick overview,\n\n252\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.410\nby way of talking about some\nof the vocabulary items and\n\n253\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.910\nthings we were discussing, mention that\nwe have user roles in the ops manager.\n\n254\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.880\nWe're gonna take a look at those\nright now in the administration area.\n\n255\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.440\nWe've got a whole collection of different\nthings we wanna be aware of, and\n\n256\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.610\nstart to think about how\nwe're gonna manage, and,\n\n257\n00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.310\nultimately, use to our advantage,\nas we use this product.\n\n258\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.130\nSo, in the administration area, we have a\nbunch of different things that will become\n\n259\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.350\nimportant to us throughout\nour time together.\n\n260\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.280\nWe do have the ability, under here,\nas you can see, to do device management.\n\n261\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.067\nWe have our agent managed devices,\n\n262\n00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:24.464\ndevices that have the Microsoft\nmonitoring agent installed on them\n\n263\n00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:28.111\nwill be listed here once the agent\nhas been installed and is configured.\n\n264\n00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:31.456\nWe could do that through a push or we\ncan do that just by manually installing,\n\n265\n00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:33.616\nwith different ways of deploying that.\n\n266\n00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:36.800\nWe have agentless managed\nagents are used primarily to\n\n267\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.310\nmanage systems that are inside the network\nthat we have control over that we trust,\n\n268\n00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.190\nthings like that.\n\n269\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.200\nBut there may be certain machines\nthat we can't install an agent on.\n\n270\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.860\nThen we're not allowed to put software on.\n\n271\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.160\nFor a variety of reasons we're locked\ndown and may not have that luxury.\n\n272\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.740\nWe can manage them without installing\nthe agent and so we could do this and\n\n273\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.080\nwe'll see these here.\n\n274\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.730\nThe management servers themselves,\nwhatever management servers are being used\n\n275\n00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.870\nso if we have multiple servers in\nthe pool, we'll see them listed here.\n\n276\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.570\nRight now I've only got one management\nserver on the machine that I'm running\n\n277\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.830\nthe console off of, and\nwe could see it here.\n\n278\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.000\nWe'll see that it's in the practice\nlabs domain for instance.\n\n279\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.430\nRemember we talked about in the first\nepisode the RMS emulator role,\n\n280\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.640\nthat role that gives us the backwards\ncompatibility to the root management\n\n281\n00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.610\nserver in the 2007 version\nof this product so\n\n282\n00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.920\nthat we can link backwards if\nwe run mixed environments.\n\n283\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.920\nBecause we switch from that idea of\nthe RMS being the main server, and\n\n284\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.650\nthen all the submanagement\nservers that are part of that\n\n285\n00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.970\nhierarchy into now in 2012, 12 SP1,\n12 R2, the idea of the resource pool.\n\n286\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.920\nAll the servers are essentially co-equal,\nright.\n\n287\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.400\nThey're all gonna have the same\ncapabilities, same functionality.\n\n288\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.260\nThis way we load balance,\nwe're highly available,\n\n289\n00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.830\nis we scale out the pool vertically, or\nexcuse me, horizontally as opposed to in\n\n290\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.070\nthe 2017 thought process where we had\na vertical architecture for hierarchy.\n\n291\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.672\nWe now have a flat, horizontal\narchitectural for scalability and for\n\n292\n00:14:57.672 --> 00:15:00.914\nreliability, in terms of management and\nhigh availability.\n\n293\n00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:04.279\nAnd so as a result the first server\ninstalled in the pool is gonna\n\n294\n00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:08.560\nautomatically be assigned the RMS\nemulator role, you'll see it there.\n\n295\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.240\nI taught you about the fact we can use\nPowerShell to move that role around if we\n\n296\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.870\nwant to, I shared with you\nthe thought process about\n\n297\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.125\nhow that could be done through\nthe ops manager shell.\n\n298\n00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.985\nJust pointing that out to you here,\nany of the systems that are brought up\n\n299\n00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:24.565\nthat we install agents on to will show\nup in the pending management area.\n\n300\n00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:25.850\nWe'll see them here.\n\n301\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.367\nPending management means that\nthe agent has been installed but\n\n302\n00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:34.067\nit's not essentially been authorized for\noperation by default and by design.\n\n303\n00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:37.947\nWe do not allow you to install agents\nthat automatically authorize them.\n\n304\n00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:41.967\nWe have essentially breaking the process\nhere where you have to come in and\n\n305\n00:15:41.967 --> 00:15:44.757\nauthorize those agents in\norder to allow them to work.\n\n306\n00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:48.117\nThat way we're just not adding\ninfrastructure in here randomly without\n\n307\n00:15:48.117 --> 00:15:52.200\nany knowledge or forethought as what's\ngonna get managed and how it's gonna work.\n\n308\n00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.311\nAnd this controls or gives us the ability\nto tightly control what systems are being\n\n309\n00:15:56.311 --> 00:16:00.781\nmonitored, who's adding them under what\nconditions, to what end, for what reasons,\n\n310\n00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:02.111\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n311\n00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:05.851\nSo we see all these here, we see Unix and\nLinux computers so we're gonna be able to\n\n312\n00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:09.433\nmanage those, we'd seen an indication\nof them sitting here in the console.\n\n313\n00:16:09.433 --> 00:16:11.237\nAll of this, along with management packs,\n\n314\n00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:13.492\nwe're gonna have a lot to\nsay about management packs.\n\n315\n00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:18.120\nTo preview demo ready, talked about\nthe idea of the last episode in our\n\n316\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.240\noverview of the sealed versus\nunsealed management packs.\n\n317\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.750\nThe idea that the management pack is\nthe container that will have inside of it,\n\n318\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.730\nor the entity that is created and\nhas inside of it.\n\n319\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.000\nAll of the operation information\nrequired for SCOM to do its job.\n\n320\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.254\nIt's gonna have the rules, the monitors,\nthe overrides, the reports,\n\n321\n00:16:39.254 --> 00:16:43.859\nthe accounts associated with, that so\nwe could do the things required to go out.\n\n322\n00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:45.470\nAnd run the management pack.\n\n323\n00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.638\nAll the moving parts and pieces are gonna\nbe built into this framework and\n\n324\n00:16:49.638 --> 00:16:51.971\nthis shell called the management pack.\n\n325\n00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:54.888\nAnd the management pack's\nnothing more than a container,\n\n326\n00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:57.120\nit's empty by design when we create it.\n\n327\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.460\nWhat we then do is, we add pieces into it.\n\n328\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.587\nAnd so the ones that we create\nfrom scratch are unsealed,\n\n329\n00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:05.976\nthe ones that are open essentially,\nthat are customizable,\n\n330\n00:17:05.976 --> 00:17:07.552\nthat we can add to or modify.\n\n331\n00:17:07.552 --> 00:17:11.163\nThe ones that are created by somebody\nelse, cuz somewhere at some point,\n\n332\n00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:15.080\nsome time, somehow, some way, somebody\nhas to create a management package.\n\n333\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.840\nJust may not be us, it's usually\na third party vendor, Microsoft,\n\n334\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.060\nCisco, VMWare, Citrix.\n\n335\n00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.370\nWhoever is the vendor that's gonna give\nyou the management pack to manage their\n\n336\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.280\ninfrastructure, doesn't matter who it is.\n\n337\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.650\nThey're gonna create the management pack,\nthey'll have a console like this.\n\n338\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.750\nThey'll have the capabilities to do\nthe addition of the various moving\n\n339\n00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.800\nparts and pieces.\n\n340\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.513\nThey may be using a management pack\nauthoring tool like Visual Studio.\n\n341\n00:17:39.513 --> 00:17:42.470\nWe can actually create management\npacks in Visual Studio.\n\n342\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.033\nA little bit beyond the concepts and\nthe discussion we're having here, but\n\n343\n00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.600\nif you're a programmer,\n\n344\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.150\nif you know how to use basically\na GUI based dev environment an IDE.\n\n345\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.640\nWhat we call an Integrated\nDevelopment Environment tool.\n\n346\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.682\nLike Visual Studio, you can write your\nmanagement packs there, link it back\n\n347\n00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:03.991\nto the interface here, download all the\ninformation required to make it happen.\n\n348\n00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:06.430\nYou could put all your\nmanagement packs together there.\n\n349\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.000\nExport them, seal them up.\n\n350\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.050\nAnd then import them here,\nand they're ready to go, and\n\n351\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.390\na lot of vendors do it that way.\n\n352\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.850\nSo, depends on what you do, but\n\n353\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.450\njust creating a management pack is nothing\nmore than really right clicking here.\n\n354\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.980\nAs you could see, create management pack,\nwe give this a name.\n\n355\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.240\nWe're gonna call this one,\n\n356\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.110\nCherokee with two e's not one\nbecause she has two e's in her name.\n\n357\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:30.506\nCherokee management pack,\nif I could spell that correctly.\n\n358\n00:18:30.506 --> 00:18:35.971\nManagement pack.\n\n359\n00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.522\n[LAUGH] All right I'm not quickest,\nI'm not the swiftest, but\n\n360\n00:18:39.522 --> 00:18:41.550\nI get the job done eventually.\n\n361\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.170\nAll right, so, Cherokee management pack.\n\n362\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.480\nWe'll just click Next.\n\n363\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.880\nThe knowledge area here is just about\nany documentation we wanna add.\n\n364\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.210\nThis may be notes for\nthe user of the management pack, maybe,\n\n365\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.260\nreferences to tools and\nthings that we wanna make them aware of.\n\n366\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.468\nSo we're not gonna bother to notate here\nright now, but we'll just click Create.\n\n367\n00:18:57.468 --> 00:19:00.466\nAnd once we've done that,\ntake just a minute, but\n\n368\n00:19:00.466 --> 00:19:05.030\nonce that management pack gets\ncreated then we'll be able to see.\n\n369\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.230\nAnd let's just do a quick filter and\n\n370\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.310\nsort there,\njust to bring it back up the right way.\n\n371\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.030\nWhen we do that, we'll see that our\nCherokee management pack right there\n\n372\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.130\nis sitting up near the top.\n\n373\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.090\nAnd if we can go full screen for\n\n374\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.000\njust a second so you could see this,\ncuz it's kinda hard to see.\n\n375\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.750\nIt's probably still hard to\nsee cuz it's really small.\n\n376\n00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.930\nIt's a little bit hard to see when\nwe're doing screen-in-screen.\n\n377\n00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.260\nThe icon at the lower-right hand corner\nof the management pack that's created,\n\n378\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.080\nlooks like a little gray padlock almost.\n\n379\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.910\nThat indicates that\nthe management pack is unsealed.\n\n380\n00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.310\nThe management packs surrounded,\nthe two above or\n\n381\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.760\nbelow have a goldish kind\nof icon at the lower-right.\n\n382\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.870\nThat indicates a padlock that is sealed,\nessentially locked.\n\n383\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.570\nNow we could do this just by\nlooking at the column here.\n\n384\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.460\nYou'll see the sealed column,\nand the value here of, yes,\n\n385\n00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.420\nit is sealed or blank for\nno, it's not sealed.\n\n386\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.850\nAnd we can tell easily just\nby looking there as well.\n\n387\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.470\nNow that's all we do to create\nthe management pack, but\n\n388\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.960\nwe haven't populated it with anything.\n\n389\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.560\nAll we've done is said, hey, we want the\nmanagement pack object, but it's empty.\n\n390\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.630\nThere's nothing in there.\n\n391\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.310\nFor us to populate it, we're gonna\nhave to go into the authoring space.\n\n392\n00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.568\nWe'll take a look at this in a moment.\n\n393\n00:20:08.568 --> 00:20:11.678\nAnd we'll add a bunch of the objects I\nwas mentioning, and start populating,\n\n394\n00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:12.910\nputting them in there.\n\n395\n00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.630\nWe're not gonna do all that\nright now in this walk through,\n\n396\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.080\nwe're just gonna give you the high level\nthought process of how this works.\n\n397\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.920\nWe'll be coming back and showing\nyou how to create management packs.\n\n398\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.860\nDo a bunch of other stuff,\nas we go through and\n\n399\n00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.370\nhave some additional discussions\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n400\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.620\nBut, we create the management pack first.\n\n401\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.330\nThen we populate it through\nthe authoring area second.\n\n402\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.220\nThat's how we are gonna do this.\n\n403\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.490\nSo, we have all this happening here.\n\n404\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.600\nWe also have, as we scroll down,\nNetwork Management and\n\n405\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.250\nthe ability to run discovery\nto find various resources.\n\n406\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.569\nWe can manage not just infrastructure\nthat are computer items, end points, but\n\n407\n00:20:46.569 --> 00:20:49.124\nwe can manage network\ninfrastructure as well.\n\n408\n00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:53.320\nRouters, switches,\ndevices that run SNMP can be discovered,\n\n409\n00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.740\nbrought in and managed here as well.\n\n410\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.540\nSo, just wanna be aware of that,\nand think about that.\n\n411\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.670\nSo we have the capabilities\nhere to do that.\n\n412\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.220\nWe'll see our network devices,\nif there are any.\n\n413\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.000\nWe'll be able to run through and see them.\n\n414\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.350\nAnd any that are pending management\nthat have to be approved,\n\n415\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.660\nwill show up here as well.\n\n416\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.620\nWe have notifications, the ability to\nbe able to work with subscriptions and\n\n417\n00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.090\nto be able to provide information out to\n\n418\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.050\nindividuals that wanna consume\nit through a variety of methods.\n\n419\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:23.106\nWe can use email to deliver information,\nperhaps SMS message.\n\n420\n00:21:23.106 --> 00:21:24.950\nA dashboard can be created.\n\n421\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.570\nWe could use web parts in SharePoint.\n\n422\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.480\nThere's all sorts of different stuff\nwe could do to consume the output of\n\n423\n00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.840\ninformation here.\n\n424\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.110\nWe have our product connector category.\n\n425\n00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.170\nOur product connectors,\n\n426\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.790\nwhere we have connectors that will\nallow us to create pathways or\n\n427\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.490\nbridges, pipes that move information\nback and forth between products.\n\n428\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.421\nSCOM is gonna be able to be linked\nto other products that we can send\n\n429\n00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:48.210\ninformation back and forth.\n\n430\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.908\nThe orchestrator product for instance,\nwill have connectors into a lot of\n\n431\n00:21:51.908 --> 00:21:54.795\nthese products, so\nwe could do our work flow automation.\n\n432\n00:21:54.795 --> 00:21:59.004\nAnd we can create our runbooks which\nare what we call our workflow automation\n\n433\n00:21:59.004 --> 00:22:01.300\nelements inside of orchestrator.\n\n434\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.849\nand we will then be able to link\norchestrator to other products so\n\n435\n00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:07.347\nthat we can run those\nautomation solutions or\n\n436\n00:22:07.347 --> 00:22:11.176\nrunbooks in these products based\non trigger events that will occur.\n\n437\n00:22:11.176 --> 00:22:14.117\nAnd we can then actually kick off,\nthink of these almost as macros,\n\n438\n00:22:14.117 --> 00:22:16.890\nif you're familiar with the concept\nof a macro, or workflow.\n\n439\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.860\nWe can kick that off in response\nto some sort of activity.\n\n440\n00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.860\nAnd so\nconnectors help us to do these things.\n\n441\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.213\nWe have the run as configuration area.\n\n442\n00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:27.160\nWe have our accounts here that\nare used as run as accounts.\n\n443\n00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.801\nWe create the accounts and\nwe can then populate them.\n\n444\n00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:31.420\nYou'll see we have some\nthat are here already.\n\n445\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.930\nSome action accounts,\nsome Windows-based accounts.\n\n446\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.640\nWe create a Run As account just by\nusing the little wizard over here.\n\n447\n00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.270\nWe have our profiles over here, as well.\n\n448\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.931\nAnd we do have our\nbuilt-in profiles types.\n\n449\n00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:45.841\nSo there are quite a few of them,\nas you can see there,\n\n450\n00:22:45.841 --> 00:22:49.283\n37 profiles that are sitting\nthere in the console right now.\n\n451\n00:22:49.283 --> 00:22:52.877\nBut, we have eight profile types that\nreally are built-in that we start with\n\n452\n00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:55.032\nthat are gonna be important\nto us to consider,\n\n453\n00:22:55.032 --> 00:22:58.850\nthe administrator, and you can probably\ntell what the administrator does.\n\n454\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.930\nThe administrator is in here somewhere.\n\n455\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.090\nWe have the Advanced Operator.\n\n456\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.381\nWe have the Application Monitoring\nOperator, an Author and\n\n457\n00:23:07.381 --> 00:23:09.325\nOperator for the console overall.\n\n458\n00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:13.380\nRead-Only Operator, Report Operator and\nReport Security Administrator.\n\n459\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.790\nWe can create any profiles that we want,\nby mixing and matching here.\n\n460\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.390\nAnd the idea is that, remember,\n\n461\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:24.390\na profile is gonna give us the ability to\npreconfigure assigned responsibilities and\n\n462\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.560\nrights that we can use in\nthe console to accomplish a job.\n\n463\n00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.690\nAnd then we give users that profile or\nlink them so that that's what they can do.\n\n464\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.266\nThis is a mechanism that allows us to\nessentially delegate authority and\n\n465\n00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:36.683\ndelegate responsibility.\n\n466\n00:23:36.683 --> 00:23:39.653\nIf we wanna create a run ASP profile,\nwe'll see right over here,\n\n467\n00:23:39.653 --> 00:23:40.520\nwe can click here.\n\n468\n00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.690\nWe have a little wizard, just move this\nover so you can see this real quick, and\n\n469\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.855\nlet me just get the task\nbar out of the way.\n\n470\n00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:50.690\nBecause we have to be able to\nsee the bottom there to hit OK\n\n471\n00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.150\nto go to the next screen.\n\n472\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:56.045\nSo we'll click Next, and\nyou'll see, we give this a name.\n\n473\n00:23:57.773 --> 00:24:02.630\nLet's call this, Cherokee Pro 1, right,\njust so we can keep track of it.\n\n474\n00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.624\nWe select the management pack.\n\n475\n00:24:03.624 --> 00:24:06.219\nWe wanna create a profile assigned to.\n\n476\n00:24:06.219 --> 00:24:06.757\nI'm gonna put it\n\n477\n00:24:06.757 --> 00:24:08.843\ninto my Cherokee management pack\nthat we've already created.\n\n478\n00:24:08.843 --> 00:24:10.868\n&gt;&gt; Next, management pack is gonna be Adam.\n\n479\n00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:12.595\nThe what?\n&gt;&gt; The next management pack we'll\n\n480\n00:24:12.595 --> 00:24:13.176\nname it Adam.\n\n481\n00:24:13.176 --> 00:24:14.174\n&gt;&gt; We'll name it Adam.\n\n482\n00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:14.997\nThat's awfully kind of you.\n\n483\n00:24:14.997 --> 00:24:16.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n484\n00:24:16.027 --> 00:24:18.537\n&gt;&gt; Okay I was just going to call\nit Cherokee management pack too.\n\n485\n00:24:18.537 --> 00:24:19.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, so add run as accounts will\nsee the profile requires a run as account.\n\n487\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.230\nNow we do have run as accounts\nwe'd solve them up above.\n\n488\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.020\nSo I can either create\na new run as account or\n\n489\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.700\nI can just pull down a local\none when it's sort of created.\n\n490\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.960\nI'll just choose the local\nWindows system account.\n\n491\n00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.500\nSo we're not really gonna use this\n[INAUDIBLE] in the orders demo with it.\n\n492\n00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.130\nAnd then we specify where\nthis account will be used.\n\n493\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.940\nIn other words, will it be able to operate\non all of the objects that are in SKAM in\n\n494\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.360\nthe console here that are available to us,\nor are we gonna narrow this and\n\n495\n00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.110\nselect a subset of objects, this is\nwhere the narrowing of the profile and\n\n496\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.310\nthe idea of scoping to a certain\nfunction will come in.\n\n497\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.210\nSo let's select here either a class or\ngroup or an object.\n\n498\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.010\nLet's just select objects and\n\n499\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.550\nwe'll just search here to give\nyou a sense of what comes up and\n\n500\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:07.690\nwe'll be able to go in, be able to grab\nwhatever kind of objects are here.\n\n501\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.790\nSo, let's just scroll down and\ntake a look and\n\n502\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:16.770\nlet's say that we want ddown\ntowards the bottom here.\n\n503\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.690\nWe wanna operate on\nWindow Server 2012 Computers.\n\n504\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.910\nNow we want to use the ones that\nare in the core computer group\n\n505\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.860\nmeaning 2012 Core Installs, right.\n\n506\n00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.360\nInstances running the OS on\nsystems that are being monitored,\n\n507\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.310\nthat are running Windows Server\n2012 Core as their OS.\n\n508\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.340\nWell, we have an object for that.\n\n509\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.260\nWe can essentially as a category,\nsay I want those systems.\n\n510\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.180\nSo we are going to grab those.\n\n511\n00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.210\nWe've got to click Add here.\n\n512\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.620\nThis is one of those things you've\ngot to be aware of in this interface.\n\n513\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.250\nA lot of people will select and\nforget to click Add, and\n\n514\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.030\nthey don't make the selection drop\ndown and actually get the value of it.\n\n515\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.640\nSo just make sure you click Add.\n\n516\n00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.690\nWe'll click okay, we've got that there.\n\n517\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.820\nAnd then we could stack these up,\nobviously,\n\n518\n00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.880\nadd more if we need to,\nClick create to complete.\n\n519\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.940\nAnd now we have our profile that we can\nuse with our management pack to be able to\n\n520\n00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.600\nin this case operate on specifically\nWindows Server 12 Core instances\n\n521\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.430\nin the computer group and so this is\nhow we go through we create a profile.\n\n522\n00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.840\nLink this with a run as account.\n\n523\n00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.500\n&gt;&gt; So Adam if we run this wizard\nis it going to auto detect\n\n524\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.210\nlike in previously you talked\nabout the discovery process.\n\n525\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.340\nIs it going to be looking for\n\n526\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.570\nthose particular machines if\nthey exist in our environment?\n\n527\n00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.090\n&gt;&gt; No, we're not discovering\nthose machines right now.\n\n528\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:31.410\nAll we're doing is using an object\nthat is referring to those machines.\n\n529\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.350\nSo this is the concept of\nthe object class model.\n\n530\n00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.690\nWe're using the object which represents\na collection of those machines\n\n531\n00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.350\nanywhere in the console in theory.\n\n532\n00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.880\nBut we're not going to actually\nvalidate whether that object\n\n533\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.480\nis gonna have substance and\nis populated here.\n\n534\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.240\nAll we're doing is saying\nwe wanna bind that object.\n\n535\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.780\nAs a reference point to the profiles,\nso when we go to use it,\n\n536\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.800\nany objects in that particular\ncategory will then become manageable.\n\n537\n00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.360\nSo whatever's in that set, at some point\nin the future, will become important,\n\n538\n00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.400\nbut not right now.\n\n539\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.180\nAll right, so we're just gonna go ahead.\n\n540\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.810\nWe're gonna click close just so\nyou can see that that's done.\n\n541\n00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.620\nAnd we have, there we go, right there,\nwe have our little profile there.\n\n542\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.620\nAnd there's our profile.\n\n543\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.950\nSo we're able to create that, set that up.\n\n544\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.040\nCould also do this from\nPowerShell by the way.\n\n545\n00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.870\nWe can use the add SCOM user role\ncmdlet to be able to go in and\n\n546\n00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.240\ncreate user roles,and or profiles, and\n\n547\n00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.070\ndo a variety of different things\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n548\n00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.050\nThese are profiles, but\nwe could also operate on user roles and\n\n549\n00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.860\ncreate a user role in here as well.\n\n550\n00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.770\nUser roles are right down here and\nwhen we talk about using user roles,\n\n551\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.320\nthe idea here somewhat to the profile\nlet's just take a look real quick is we're\n\n552\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.220\ngetting ready to wrap up our conversation\non the admin area of the console.\n\n553\n00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.215\nLet me just right here, show you.\n\n554\n00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:45.685\nNew user role, and you'll see that\nwhen we go through we talk about\n\n555\n00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:49.895\nall the different areas or\nthing we are thinking of.\n\n556\n00:27:49.895 --> 00:27:55.410\nWe can go in and say, hey you know what,\nI want, lets say read only operator.\n\n557\n00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:55.975\nLet's go ahead and\n\n558\n00:27:55.975 --> 00:28:00.065\ncreate this as a user role,\nlets call this set to use Adam, right?\n\n559\n00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:02.165\nSo, lets say Adam1 for that one, so\n\n560\n00:28:02.165 --> 00:28:07.130\nits up to the top of the list,\nuser role members Add them in.\n\n561\n00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.500\nWe would have to populate the users\nwe wanna put into this role.\n\n562\n00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.230\nWe'll use our guest group\ncuz we know guest is there.\n\n563\n00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.420\nWe can always rely on the fact we'll be\nable to get the guest, bring them in.\n\n564\n00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.140\nSo let's just drop that in there.\n\n565\n00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.190\nWe have our read-only profile as you could\nsee here for the role that we're using.\n\n566\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.550\nAnd if you look down here below,\n\n567\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.130\nthe nice thing about this is, everyone\nof them gets a little description.\n\n568\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.560\nSo if you're not 100% comfortable with\nhey what's that read only user role and\n\n569\n00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.890\nthe profile for\nread only gonna actually look like?\n\n570\n00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.210\nIt tells you essentially, you can look but\nyou can't do anything, right?\n\n571\n00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.870\nSo, yeah, you're gonna be able to look at\nsettings, but you're not gonna be able to\n\n572\n00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.925\nchange them cuz that's what we\nusually imply with read-only.\n\n573\n00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:45.675\nSo we have that there.\n\n574\n00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:47.925\nWe have our group scope,\n\n575\n00:28:47.925 --> 00:28:50.255\nagain we have to think about\nwhat we're going to use, right?\n\n576\n00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:53.395\nWhat can we monitor, and what can we\ninteract with in terms of objects?\n\n577\n00:28:53.395 --> 00:28:56.385\nWe saw this when we created\nthe profile just a minute ago.\n\n578\n00:28:56.385 --> 00:28:57.575\nSimilar idea.\n\n579\n00:28:57.575 --> 00:28:59.465\nSo right now we've selected everything.\n\n580\n00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:02.795\nIf we want to unselect and only limit\nit to, like we did in the profile,\n\n581\n00:29:02.795 --> 00:29:06.830\nmaybe one specific item, we can just\nunselect and check off what we want here.\n\n582\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:12.170\nI'll say in this case we're gonna\ndo the IIS Computer groups so\n\n583\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.140\nit's just gonna be able to interact with\nweb servers, right, something like that.\n\n584\n00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.390\n&gt;&gt; And you had advised us before\nsometimes there's default\n\n585\n00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.680\nparameters that are selected.\n\n586\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.580\nShould we select all and\nuncheck here or is that the case?\n\n587\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.220\n&gt;&gt; Usually a good idea if you\nwanna make a sub-selection.\n\n588\n00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.650\nI'd just uncheck the plaid check mark at\nthe top, clearing everything, and I'd just\n\n589\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.320\nselect one item, because the only way to\ndo it on this screen, if you are going to.\n\n590\n00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Go through and expand them all out.\n\n591\n00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.160\n&gt;&gt; When it's like this, right, when it's\nlike this it's all, maybe hard to see, but\n\n592\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.290\nit's all grayed out.\n\n593\n00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.690\nSo you can't actually interact with any of\nthese sub-settings unless you do this and\n\n594\n00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.780\nunselect so then it clears everything and\nthen you can go on and\n\n595\n00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.480\nmake your selection.\n\n596\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.090\nSo you're kind of forced to do it that\n\n597\n00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.602\nway here,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n598\n00:29:49.602 --> 00:29:52.040\n&gt;&gt; It's just, no way to get in\nthere otherwise, it's locked out,\n\n599\n00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.220\nbecause it's all grayed out because of\nthe fact that that's how the checkmark\n\n600\n00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.660\nshows up, so\nwe'll just put whatever we have there.\n\n601\n00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.340\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n602\n00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.400\nAgain, all dashboards and\n\n603\n00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.890\nviews are going to give you access\nto everything in the console.\n\n604\n00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.840\nOr are we going to limit you with\nthis role, only do certain things,\n\n605\n00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.220\nmaybe we are just going to\nshow you active alerts.\n\n606\n00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.750\nAnd that's all we want you to see.\n\n607\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.655\nSo we strain the user that has\nthis role assigned to them or\n\n608\n00:30:16.655 --> 00:30:20.715\nprofile which you saw in\nthe other area as they log in.\n\n609\n00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:24.565\nAnd as the user gets this role assigned,\nwe will security trim the UI.\n\n610\n00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:28.685\nWe will centre trim the console and\nthey will only see, in this case,\n\n611\n00:30:28.685 --> 00:30:30.505\nactive alerts based on web servers.\n\n612\n00:30:30.505 --> 00:30:35.270\nNothing else based on setting this\nparticular role up and that would be it.\n\n613\n00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:39.270\nYou may have all this other stuff going\non as a different user with more advanced\n\n614\n00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.320\npermissions or a different role that's\nscoped a little more broadly, but\n\n615\n00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.345\nthis user would be limited or constrained\nonly to alerts based on, in this case,\n\n616\n00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:50.065\nactive alerts based on a web server group,\nthe IS 7 group or\n\n617\n00:30:50.065 --> 00:30:52.465\nwhatever we chose on the prior screen.\n\n618\n00:30:52.465 --> 00:30:55.605\nSo, we can specify that and\nset that up here.\n\n619\n00:30:55.605 --> 00:30:57.765\nAnd then, we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll finish, click Create.\n\n620\n00:30:57.765 --> 00:31:02.015\nIt takes just a minute and then,\nwe see right down there under read only,\n\n621\n00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:04.385\nit goes into the category\nthat we specified.\n\n622\n00:31:04.385 --> 00:31:05.775\nSo it's gonna be set up there and\n\n623\n00:31:05.775 --> 00:31:08.725\nyou could see that our\nuser role's been created.\n\n624\n00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:13.670\nSo we're able to set up our user roles,\nwe're able to go in and take a look\n\n625\n00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.770\nat all the different moving parts and\npieces in the admin area of the console.\n\n626\n00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.250\nSo we do have some other\nworkspaces we alluded to.\n\n627\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.180\nWe'll come back,\nwe'll take a look at authoring,\n\n628\n00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.780\nkind of a part two of that quick\nhigh-level, what do we do with that\n\n629\n00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.190\nmanagement pack once we actually create\nthe shell, how do we populate it?\n\n630\n00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.980\nWe'll walk you through that and\nlet you see what that looks like here\n\n631\n00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.780\nin an upcoming episode,\ncuz we're gonna finish up this discussion.\n\n632\n00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.980\nBut just keep in mind,\nthat in the various workspaces,\n\n633\n00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.030\nwe have contextual information,\nitems that are gonna be pathed towards,\n\n634\n00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.260\nor grouped towards, the idea that\nthe workspace represents, administration.\n\n635\n00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.020\nNamely security configuration, overview,\n\n636\n00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.240\nbehind the scenes settings\nthings like that.\n\n637\n00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.740\nMonitoring hopefully self evident based\non the name it's where we go to see\n\n638\n00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.490\nthe output of all the things we're doing.\n\n639\n00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.970\nAuthoring what we're going to add and\n\n640\n00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:03.020\ncreate things like populating management\npacks, and reporting is where we're gonna\n\n641\n00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:08.420\ngo to see the longer term historical views\nof that data stored in our data warehouse.\n\n642\n00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.370\nAnd pulled that out through a SQL\nserver reporting service and be able\n\n643\n00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.740\nto present that data, that information, in\na variety of ways that gives us meaning.\n\n644\n00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.440\nRight, to help us to understand\nthe value of the monitoring we're doing.\n\n645\n00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.870\nSo we're gonna be looking at those,\n\n646\n00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:23.380\ntalking about those high level\nhere in upcoming episodes.\n\n647\n00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.485\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good,\nyou showed us a lot so far Adam.\n\n648\n00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:27.725\nJust navigating through\nthe SCOM interface.\n\n649\n00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:29.195\nBut ladies and gentlemen stay tuned.\n\n650\n00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:31.215\nWe do have more information\nheaded your way.\n\n651\n00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.645\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n652\n00:32:32.645 --> 00:32:34.575\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n653\n00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:35.355\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

00:00:12.007\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.037\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying in private clouds series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.037 --> 00:00:16.872\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:20.156\nSo we've actually made it to part three\nwhere we're gonna continue looking at our\n\n7\n00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.500\nmonitoring tools here within\nthe cloud infrastructure.\n\n8\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.448\nBack with us in studios we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:27.986\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.334\n&gt;&gt; Hello, how's everybody doing?\n\n11\n00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:30.670\nHopefully, you're doing well.\n\n12\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.447\nI'm back, exciting stuff, and I'm also\nnot looking at you for just one second.\n\n13\n00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:36.480\n[LAUGH] Cuz I'm just trying to find\nsomething in my notes that I wanna\n\n14\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.100\nshow you real quick.\n\n15\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.180\nBut we'll do with that in just one moment.\n\n16\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.010\nSo we're gonna continue our\nconversations here walking through\n\n17\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.890\nthe System Center Ops Manager console,\nwe'll take a look at some of\n\n18\n00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.150\nthe functionality and talk about things\nthat are important to us along the way.\n\n19\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.220\nWe'll try to, in addition, maybe hint at\nsome things you could do with PowerShell.\n\n20\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.684\nI've been talking about the fact here and\nthere that we have PowerShell commands you\n\n21\n00:00:55.684 --> 00:00:57.752\nmay want to throw at\nthe console to do some things.\n\n22\n00:00:57.752 --> 00:01:00.630\nAlways important to think about\nPowerShell and how we can leverage it.\n\n23\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.150\nThe ability to be able to automate\nstuff through the console,\n\n24\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.000\nit's always gonna be valuable to us.\n\n25\n00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.110\nWe can do that a lot of times in the\nconsole directly by setting up a task or\n\n26\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.300\nusing some sort of a scheduled interface.\n\n27\n00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.960\nBut PowerShell does provide\nthat capability as well.\n\n28\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.820\nAnd we usually have dedicated\nPowerShell consoles, right?\n\n29\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.741\nThat are preloaded with the modules\nspecific to the product in question.\n\n30\n00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:24.095\nWe talked about that before with some\nof the products in other episodes and\n\n31\n00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:25.839\nwe have the same thing here with SCOM.\n\n32\n00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:30.747\nAnd so we can leverage that if we feel\nthat's gonna be valuable to us to make\n\n33\n00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:35.101\nsure that we're comfortable with\nthe idea behind how we can use or\n\n34\n00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.770\ncreate this ability to use\nautomation as we do things.\n\n35\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.827\nSo you'll hear me refer\nto it from time to time.\n\n36\n00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:44.200\nI'm gonna start off by talking a little\nbit about it with regards to the ability\n\n37\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.450\nto deploy the agents.\n\n38\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.355\nI mentioned in the,\n\n39\n00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:50.042\nlet me just minimize that first second,\ncuz that's not what I was gonna show you.\n\n40\n00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.603\nI'm just gonna bring the console back up,\nand\n\n41\n00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:54.530\nI'll bring up my notes here in just a\nsecond to show you the PowerShell script.\n\n42\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.766\nBut I mentioned in our last episode as we\nwalked through, that when we are doing or\n\n43\n00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.195\nthinking about doing agent deployments,\nthat we can go ahead and\n\n44\n00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.248\nwe can use either an agent-managed system,\nwhere we will\n\n45\n00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:09.145\ndeploy the Microsoft Monitoring Agent,\nthe new name for the SCOM agent.\n\n46\n00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.692\nRemember the agent in earlier versions,\nyou may or may not know,\n\n47\n00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:13.817\nI shouldn't say remember\ncuz you may not know.\n\n48\n00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:17.817\nBut if you used earlier versions of SCOM\nit was called the ops manager operations\n\n49\n00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:18.367\nmanager agent.\n\n50\n00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.937\nThat's what we called the monitoring\nagent in prior versions of SCOM,\n\n51\n00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:27.000\nthen re-branded, renamed, updated and\nrevised starting with SCOM 12.\n\n52\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.160\nIt's now called the Microsoft Monitoring\nAgent, so just be aware of that.\n\n53\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.470\nWe could do a console push,\nit's very simple.\n\n54\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.750\nWe could just go ahead and use\nthe discovery wizard to drive discovery of\n\n55\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.650\nany infrastructure sitting out there.\n\n56\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.440\nAnd through the discovery wizard,\n\n57\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.040\nwe push the agent into that\nsystem assuming we have rights,\n\n58\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.800\nthe right account, the right permissions,\nstandard stuff we'd wanna think about.\n\n59\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.690\nThe biggest issue there, if we don't\nhave the appropriate permissions for\n\n60\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.490\nthe console discovery method and\nthe agent push to work on that machine.\n\n61\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.620\nMeaning we don't have local rights\nnecessary to do the install.\n\n62\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.160\nIf we don't have a management\nserver action account\n\n63\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.320\nset up to do this the right way,\nwe may run into a permission issue.\n\n64\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.895\nNot a big deal, if we do we'll\nget a common error traditionally.\n\n65\n00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:13.858\nThe error code is 80070005.\n\n66\n00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:15.584\nSo,\n&gt;&gt; Do we have to memorize that, Adam?\n\n67\n00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit would be a good thing to know it.\n\n68\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.010\nI wouldn't bother to tell you if\nI didn't think it was important.\n\n69\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say you run out and\n\n70\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.030\nget a tattoo of it and\nput it on your forearm or\n\n71\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.800\nanything, but it would be good to know.\n\n72\n00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.778\nBut 800, 8-0-0, 7-0-0-0, or 7,000, 5.\n\n73\n00:03:29.778 --> 00:03:33.661\nSo we're gonna have 8, two zeros,\n7, three zeros, then a 5.\n\n74\n00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:36.309\nThe error code's in the show notes,\nso you'll be able to find it there.\n\n75\n00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.922\nBut that's usually the one that you'll\nsee displayed in the event logs,\n\n76\n00:03:39.922 --> 00:03:43.591\nif you have a problem fall into an issue\nwhere the client pushed us not work,\n\n77\n00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:45.860\nthat's the error code you wanna reference.\n\n78\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.940\nJust be aware of that.\n\n79\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.440\nAs I also mentioned we can use\nPowerShell to do a client,\n\n80\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.392\nagent installer\nMicrosoft Monitoring agent install.\n\n81\n00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:56.610\nInstall SCOM agent would be the PowerShell\ncommand that we wanna use there.\n\n82\n00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.260\nAnd when we do the install, PowerShell,\nexcuse me, install SCOM agent,\n\n83\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.490\nif you give me just half a second,\nI'm going to bring up for us\n\n84\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.020\nthe PowerShell script that we need\nto be able to just show you that.\n\n85\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.437\nAnd I have it right here.\n\n86\n00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:16.404\nAll right so,\njust move is back just a little bit so\n\n87\n00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:20.572\nyou can get a sense of this does cuz\nthe lines are kind of screwed up when I\n\n88\n00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.272\ntransfer it over to this\nmachine in notepad.\n\n89\n00:04:23.272 --> 00:04:27.094\nJust want you to be able to see the whole\nthing, see how is actually set up,\n\n90\n00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.060\nlike this.\n\n91\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.840\nAll right, so when we use, right here,\nif we wanna use, I should say,\n\n92\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.457\nthe command shell and/or PowerShell,\neither way.\n\n93\n00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:40.944\nYou'll see that we can go in the install\naccount variable's set to get credential\n\n94\n00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:43.505\nhere, that's what this first line does.\n\n95\n00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:47.415\nThis will allow us to get the credential\nof the person that's running\n\n96\n00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:50.655\nthe PowerShell script or\nprompt for a credential.\n\n97\n00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.988\nHave it provided by the person\nrunning the PowerShell scripts,\n\n98\n00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:54.466\nprobably a better way of phrasing that.\n\n99\n00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:57.537\nWe'll store that in a variable\ncalled install account and\n\n100\n00:04:57.537 --> 00:05:01.322\nwe'll be able to use that and\nreference that as we run the script.\n\n101\n00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:04.797\nWe then go ahead, create a variable for\nprimary management server.\n\n102\n00:05:04.797 --> 00:05:06.630\nThat will be this piece, right here.\n\n103\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.460\nWe set that equal to\nthe Get SCOMManagementServer commandlet\n\n104\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.780\nwith the ComputerName parameter.\n\n105\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.491\nAnd we say the value for\nComputerName in this case is,\n\n106\n00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:19.966\nwe just move over there,\nAdam MMS3ITProd.tv.\n\n107\n00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:23.204\nObviously you can call this whatever the\nactual name is of the management server\n\n108\n00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:24.620\nthat you're targeting, right.\n\n109\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.550\nSo you provide that variable\nin the real world and\n\n110\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.250\nit would be localized to whatever\nsystem you're gonna be using.\n\n111\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.650\nBut we're just using this as\nan example in a placeholder.\n\n112\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.000\nThought it was better to give\nyou a real name than to say,\n\n113\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.203\nhey put computer name here.\n\n114\n00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:39.127\nCuz I actually had that happen a couple\nof times, where I've talked to clients,\n\n115\n00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:42.465\nwe've been going over something on the\nphone or I've talked to students in class.\n\n116\n00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:44.365\nI didn't, they did, not me.\n\n117\n00:05:44.365 --> 00:05:45.945\n&gt;&gt; I mean just having that experience.\n\n118\n00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.546\n&gt;&gt; I've actually had that\nexperience where I've said, okay,\n\n119\n00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:50.596\nwe're rattling off a script or\nwe're in class,\n\n120\n00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:53.812\nwe're talking about how you write\nascripts, whatever the context may be.\n\n121\n00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.954\nAnd I've had a couple of people,\nand I can get this,\n\n122\n00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.527\nI mean I understand why this happens.\n\n123\n00:05:57.527 --> 00:05:59.607\nYou're in the zone,\nyou're kinda literal, right.\n\n124\n00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:03.117\nAnd you're typing and\nsomebody's saying okay, and your name is.\n\n125\n00:06:03.117 --> 00:06:04.124\nAnd you type and your name is.\n\n126\n00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:06.610\nYou're probably not\ngoing to remember this,\n\n127\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.440\nbecause every time I ask you've\nnever seen anything I reference.\n\n128\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.350\nBut I'm just gonna simply reference it,\njust because you never know.\n\n129\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.310\nI'm thinking one day I'll get lucky and\nCherokee will turn to me and\n\n130\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.250\nsay, of course I've seen that, Adam.\n\n131\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.370\nHow could you not watch that.\n\n132\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.590\nThat's the most awesome\nthing in the world.\n\n133\n00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.320\nIt's probably not gonna\nbe this time though.\n\n134\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.579\nSo have you ever seen\nthe movie Animal House?\n\n135\n00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.900\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.310\n&gt;&gt; And there you have it, boys and girls.\n\n137\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.240\nYet another scientific proof of the fact\nthat Cherokee does not own or watch TV.\n\n138\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.210\nAll right, so the movie Animal House,\nvery famous movie for many, many reasons.\n\n139\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.430\nBut in that movie at one point\nwhere they're swearing in the Delta\n\n140\n00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.080\npledge class.\n\n141\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.600\nThey have that whole scene where they're\nin the basement, they're all drunk,\n\n142\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.950\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n143\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.820\nAnd the whole thing is like,\nI, state your name.\n\n144\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.171\nIt's a literal resuscitation.\n\n145\n00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n146\n00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.150\n&gt;&gt; It's funny if you watch it.\n\n147\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.900\nIt's not funny here because\nshe doesn't know what TV is.\n\n148\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.140\n&gt;&gt; Watch out for the little carrots.\n\n149\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.090\nYou put anything in those little carrots\nare gonna field to data input and fill in.\n\n150\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.009\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so I had somebody literally,\n\n151\n00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.517\nat one point I said computer name\nplaceholder or something in the script.\n\n152\n00:07:06.517 --> 00:07:09.066\nAnd they type that in exactly and\nthen they call me and they go,\n\n153\n00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.060\nhey it's not working.\n\n154\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.320\nAnd I said, well what did you do?\n\n155\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.250\nRead back to me what you did.\n\n156\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.920\nAnd I said, okay, just so you're clear,\nwhere it says insert here,\n\n157\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.930\nI actually meant insert here,\nnot use that phrase.\n\n158\n00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.710\nAnyway, so\nback to what we're talking about.\n\n159\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.595\nPrimary management server,\nyou'll put the name in there.\n\n160\n00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:23.950\nInstall SCOM agent.\n\n161\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.940\nYou can hopefully tell what\nthat commandlet will do.\n\n162\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.720\nThat's gonna create the magic for us.\n\n163\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.070\nDNS hostname parameter, we are gonna\nspecify what our DNS hostname is.\n\n164\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.860\nYou'll see that right there,\nAdam one IT Pro TV.\n\n165\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.910\nPrimary management server,\nthe perimeter for that.\n\n166\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.820\nWhat's our value gonna be?\n\n167\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.622\nIt's the value of our Primary\nmanagement server variable.\n\n168\n00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:43.638\nThat's gonna be the output of\nGET SCOM management server.\n\n169\n00:07:43.638 --> 00:07:47.440\nAnd that's gonna be Adam MS3, so\nwe're going to insert that there.\n\n170\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.600\nWith the action account, and what's\nthe action account parameter going to use?\n\n171\n00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.491\nThe install account variable\nwhich is get credentials.\n\n172\n00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:55.930\nSo I'm gonna get prompted on\nthe screen for get credential.\n\n173\n00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.092\nAnd then put that in,\nit's gonna be translated into this and\n\n174\n00:07:59.092 --> 00:08:01.387\nI'll be able to install using this script.\n\n175\n00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:03.018\nSo you're roughly three lines and\n\n176\n00:08:03.018 --> 00:08:06.901\nyou've got yourself a little PowerShell\nscript that'll actually go through and\n\n177\n00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:10.109\nload the Account or rather provide\nthe credentials as the account to\n\n178\n00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:13.788\nload the management agent onto\nthe machine that you're targeting, right?\n\n179\n00:08:13.788 --> 00:08:15.875\nSo that will be allowing you to do that.\n\n180\n00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:17.724\nAll right, so\nthat's what we would do here.\n\n181\n00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:20.992\nNow this installs the Ops Manager\nagent onto a server, right?\n\n182\n00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:24.642\nNamed your ATOM1 ITPro.Tv, right?\n\n183\n00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:28.264\nNumber Op Management server that we're\nusing as the target to start this process\n\n184\n00:08:28.264 --> 00:08:29.284\nfrom is the first one.\n\n185\n00:08:29.284 --> 00:08:30.989\nWe're actually gonna\ninstall this SCOM agent,\n\n186\n00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:32.579\nit's gonna be on this machine, right here.\n\n187\n00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.797\nYou would just substitute the value for\nthe machine you wanna target there and\n\n188\n00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:37.593\nthat's the machine that gets installed.\n\n189\n00:08:37.593 --> 00:08:40.625\nIf you wanna provide multiple computers,\nright?\n\n190\n00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:44.048\nAnd do this on 3, 4, 5, 100 at once,\nwe could scale that script and\n\n191\n00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:44.836\ndo that easily.\n\n192\n00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:46.928\nWe changed the parameters\nin the script a little bit.\n\n193\n00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:49.995\nWe would probably put those\nnames into a file, and\n\n194\n00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:52.050\nthen we would just load the file.\n\n195\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.023\nAnd then we'd be able to iterate\nthrough them one at a time.\n\n196\n00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.216\nSo there's a lot of ways we\ncould extend this out and\n\n197\n00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:58.002\nmake this a little bit easier for\nus to do.\n\n198\n00:08:58.002 --> 00:09:01.314\nWe could also do a manual install,\nuse the MOMAgent.MSI,\n\n199\n00:09:01.314 --> 00:09:03.179\nwhich is the MSI file to install.\n\n200\n00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:07.085\nAnd we could script that, so you can\nkinda go back and forwards here, and\n\n201\n00:09:07.085 --> 00:09:08.186\ndo this either way.\n\n202\n00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:11.249\nSo just think about the fact\nthat we do have options for\n\n203\n00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:13.712\nour ability to push the management agent.\n\n204\n00:09:13.712 --> 00:09:16.938\nIt's important to know that we can\ndo these things, because we're gonna\n\n205\n00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:20.476\nultimately have to figure out how to get\nthese agents out onto these machines, so\n\n206\n00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:21.430\nwe can monitor them.\n\n207\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.008\nNow once we have the agent out there, this\nis really not a big deal cuz we're not\n\n208\n00:09:24.008 --> 00:09:25.703\ngonna have to go back and\ndo this on a regular basis.\n\n209\n00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:29.622\nBut during that initial push to bring\ninfrastructure in and start to manage it.\n\n210\n00:09:29.622 --> 00:09:32.507\nIt will be important to think\nabout the best way to do this and\n\n211\n00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:35.640\nprobably the quickest way to do this,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n212\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.263\nMaybe import it in for you,\nto think about whether or\n\n213\n00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:42.150\nnot that's something that we wanna be\nable to ultimately engage in, right?\n\n214\n00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.405\nJust so you're aware of that.\n\n215\n00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:47.176\nAll right, so we've talked about the logic\nof how we can deploy those agents.\n\n216\n00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:49.639\nWe've been through most of\nthe other areas here already.\n\n217\n00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:53.375\nWanted to jump up to the authoring\narea and turn our attention or\n\n218\n00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:58.097\nfocus a little bit here towards the idea\nof just the management pack objects that\n\n219\n00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.450\nwill be put into that.\n\n220\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.501\nIn this case, unsealed management pack\nthat we created in the container,\n\n221\n00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:05.381\nwe did in our last demonstration.\n\n222\n00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:09.335\nIn the last episode, we went into\nthe Management Pack area here.\n\n223\n00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:13.151\nJust roll up here, so\nwe can see that real quick.\n\n224\n00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:15.943\nWe went through and\ncreated our Cherokee Management Pack.\n\n225\n00:10:15.943 --> 00:10:17.812\nIt's just sitting right there,\nyou can see it.\n\n226\n00:10:17.812 --> 00:10:20.724\nSo what we have to do now,\nis think what we want to put in there,\n\n227\n00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:23.598\nas objects become part of\nthe Management Pack, and help us.\n\n228\n00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:26.548\nNow we did link our profile,\nif you remember to the Management Pack.\n\n229\n00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:30.054\nSo we did create a profile on the fly\nreal quick and put it in there.\n\n230\n00:10:30.054 --> 00:10:32.216\nBut other than that there's\nnothing in there right now, so\n\n231\n00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:34.132\nwe have to populate it with\nsome additional things.\n\n232\n00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:36.495\nSo we can go in here,\nwe can go to Authoring, and\n\n233\n00:10:36.495 --> 00:10:39.353\nif you take a look here up\nunder Management Pack Objects.\n\n234\n00:10:39.353 --> 00:10:41.214\nLet's bring this down,\nso you can see this.\n\n235\n00:10:41.214 --> 00:10:44.367\nWe do have a list of all the different\nobjects that will be part of\n\n236\n00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:47.915\na Management Pack, potentially that\nwe could add in and we can use.\n\n237\n00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:52.030\nWe have attributes, monitors, we have\nobject discoveries, we have overrides.\n\n238\n00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.510\nThis lets us create overrides or\n\n239\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.940\nessentially use the sealed\nManagement Pack and override it.\n\n240\n00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.310\nSay we wanna do something\nelse in an open or\n\n241\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.160\nunsealed Management Pack\nthat we then we will apply.\n\n242\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.250\nSo in other word overrides,\n\n243\n00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.560\nlet us change the behavior of\na Management Pack, that's what they do.\n\n244\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.940\nWe have Rules with service Level Tracking,\nwe have Past, we have Views.\n\n245\n00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.750\nAll these things are very important and\nthings that we're gonna wanna look at and\n\n246\n00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.530\nultimately understand.\n\n247\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.254\nBecause all of these objects,\nall these things in here,\n\n248\n00:11:19.254 --> 00:11:22.389\nare ultimately what gets used in\nthe monitoring area as we go in a.\n\n249\n00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:25.429\nWe look at the output of these\nManagement Packs when we're doing things.\n\n250\n00:11:25.429 --> 00:11:30.030\nSo for instance,\nwe take a look at the view here, right?\n\n251\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.323\nFor Discovered Inventory, I see that I\nhave one machine [COUGH] on my SCOM server\n\n252\n00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:37.220\nright now that's actually been discovered.\n\n253\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.170\nI can see if I look at actually alerts,\nI have an actual alert view.\n\n254\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.440\nI can see alerts both warnings and\n\n255\n00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.420\ncritical alerts that may\nbe of interest to me.\n\n256\n00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.886\nSo these are all different\nways to see things.\n\n257\n00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:49.761\nI have Task Status view, if I have\nany tasks I'll be able to see these.\n\n258\n00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:52.577\nIf I have Linux unit view computers,\nI have a view for that.\n\n259\n00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:54.641\nIf I have Windows computers,\nI have a view for that.\n\n260\n00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.353\nI can see that\nthe SCOM ManagementServer is here and\n\n261\n00:11:57.353 --> 00:11:59.800\nit gives us some information about.\n\n262\n00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.230\nSo when I drill in to some of\nthe management packs that I create,\n\n263\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.320\nyou can see on the left the list here,\n\n264\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.090\nthe folders right below\nthe initial objects for the view.\n\n265\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.800\nAll of these with the folder icon even\nwith the padlock on them or down below\n\n266\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.080\njust the plain folder without the padlock,\nwhich was the unsealed management pack.\n\n267\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.716\nIn this case,\nthe one we created for Cherokee.\n\n268\n00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:19.641\nAll of these are management packs.\n\n269\n00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:23.090\nThey represent our management packs\nlisted in the admin workspace.\n\n270\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.531\nAnd all the objects with components to\nmake them up and all the functionality,\n\n271\n00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:28.264\nis associated with them here, right?\n\n272\n00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:31.668\nSo we can see, if we go into\nthe Cherokee management Pack,\n\n273\n00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.806\nit just takes a moment to update,\nso give it a second.\n\n274\n00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:38.326\nIt's still thinking, it's looking at\nthe other view, hasn't switched over yet.\n\n275\n00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:42.987\nBut once we do that,\nlet's go here for instance.\n\n276\n00:12:42.987 --> 00:12:47.482\nYou'll see that under Data Warehouse,\nI'm changing the view and\n\n277\n00:12:47.482 --> 00:12:51.731\nI have in this case, an Event view,\nor an Active Alert view, or\n\n278\n00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.878\na performance monitor\nview that I can create.\n\n279\n00:12:54.878 --> 00:12:58.217\nThese are all just different items that\nget associated with the management pack.\n\n280\n00:12:58.217 --> 00:13:01.638\nAnd I can see any and\nall of these things under the SQL view.\n\n281\n00:13:01.638 --> 00:13:06.266\nI can go in and I can look at\n\n282\n00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:11.125\nunder SQL, as I drill in.\n\n283\n00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:16.687\nLet's just go down here, look at our\ndatabases and look at our file groups.\n\n284\n00:13:16.687 --> 00:13:19.478\nAnd I can see the health status\nof all the databases and\n\n285\n00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:22.530\nthe file groups in the database\nwith the Monitor view.\n\n286\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.210\nSo these are all the objects in components\nthat make up a Management Pack.\n\n287\n00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.780\nWhere we add them to Management Pack and\n\n288\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.560\nhow we create them is back\non the authoring work space.\n\n289\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.402\nWe have the network view that you've\nlooked at before that you like.\n\n290\n00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:34.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the graphical representation,\nI do like that.\n\n291\n00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:38.506\n&gt;&gt; Right, the animated one, we can look\nat that actually lets you drill down and\n\n292\n00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:39.916\nsee real time status updates.\n\n293\n00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:45.899\nIt's called the NetworkView and or\nthe Network Vicinity Dashboard.\n\n294\n00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:46.662\nSo that's what I was trying to remember.\n\n295\n00:13:46.662 --> 00:13:48.306\n&gt;&gt; It's VDI,\nyou just mentioned that, right.\n\n296\n00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:52.547\nIs that the same tool that you mentioned\na few moments ago at the end of the last\n\n297\n00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:54.085\nepisode for programming?\n\n298\n00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:55.049\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n299\n00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:56.285\n[CROSSTALK] The ID, that's the IDE.\n\n300\n00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry.\n\n301\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.420\n&gt;&gt; That's the integrated,\nthat's Visual Studio.\n\n302\n00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.593\n&gt;&gt; Mixing up my acronyms.\n&gt;&gt; No, this is just the network.\n\n303\n00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:01.494\nI couldn't remember the name\nspecifically of the object.\n\n304\n00:14:01.494 --> 00:14:03.272\nIt's called the Network Vicinity view, and\n\n305\n00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:06.281\nyou can see although this one is not\ngoing to have everything hanging off it.\n\n306\n00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:09.893\nI've shown Cherokee some in other episodes\nwhere we have like literally the entire\n\n307\n00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:12.128\nstructure of SCOM laid out\nwith all the databases.\n\n308\n00:14:12.128 --> 00:14:15.627\nYou drill down five or ten levels, we can\nactually see the health of everything.\n\n309\n00:14:15.627 --> 00:14:17.776\nBut we have this view where we go and\nwe can see.\n\n310\n00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:21.703\nThis one is just focused just on the one\nmachine, just being able to drill into it.\n\n311\n00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:24.563\nBut the Network Vicinity\nview also gives us\n\n312\n00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:28.462\nan interactive granular view\nof components and objects.\n\n313\n00:14:28.462 --> 00:14:30.914\nIt's almost like using Vizio, right?\n\n314\n00:14:30.914 --> 00:14:32.107\nIt's very close to using a Vizio concept.\n\n315\n00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:35.054\n&gt;&gt; I think I like it,\nespecially if someone's a visual learner,\n\n316\n00:14:35.054 --> 00:14:37.233\nthey might relate more\nto that kind of layout.\n\n317\n00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:39.092\n&gt;&gt; Because they can see the objects-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n318\n00:14:39.092 --> 00:14:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Click on them,\nsee the status look at properties and\n\n319\n00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.827\ndetailed information below\nabout how the object function.\n\n320\n00:14:43.827 --> 00:14:48.043\nSo these are all the components of\nobjects that make up Management Packs.\n\n321\n00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:51.909\nAnd we find a map here up in the Authoring\nspace, and as soon as we go through start\n\n322\n00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:54.531\nto look, and\nthere are quite a number of attributes.\n\n323\n00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:55.727\nIt'll take just a moment to load.\n\n324\n00:14:55.727 --> 00:14:58.416\nWe have almost 10,000\nof them as you can see.\n\n325\n00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:00.907\nWe can see any one of these attributes,\nfor instance.\n\n326\n00:15:00.907 --> 00:15:04.209\nAnd we can go in and\nwe can create a new attribute and\n\n327\n00:15:04.209 --> 00:15:06.024\nadd it in here if we want to.\n\n328\n00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:09.512\nYou'll see we have monitors,\nwe can drill through here and\n\n329\n00:15:09.512 --> 00:15:11.129\nwe can open up by category.\n\n330\n00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:14.814\nLet's just look at .NET\nWindows Service for instance.\n\n331\n00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:17.619\nWe have entity health Just\nkind of drill down here for\n\n332\n00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:19.411\none second so you could see this.\n\n333\n00:15:19.411 --> 00:15:25.080\nAnd we have Availability, Configuration,\nPerformance and Security.\n\n334\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.570\nAnd up underneath these areas,\nsome of them will have additional items.\n\n335\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.428\nWe have a performance monitor for the .NET\nWindows service that is available,\n\n336\n00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:34.704\nthat's being used here.\n\n337\n00:15:34.704 --> 00:15:38.770\nAnd we can go in and we can create\nmonitors related to this one.\n\n338\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.580\nWe can do an Override and\neither Disable an Existing Override or\n\n339\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.360\nOverride the Existing Monitor\nwith a different change.\n\n340\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.170\nSo we have the ability to go in and\nprogram functionality.\n\n341\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.687\nWe have the ability to look at Rules,\n\n342\n00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:56.658\nwe have the ability to look at Tasks,\nwe have the ability to look a Views.\n\n343\n00:15:56.658 --> 00:15:59.267\nThe Views I was showing you\nwill allow us to go in and\n\n344\n00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:03.511\nbe able to create different ways of seeing\ninformation in the Management Packs.\n\n345\n00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:07.622\nAnd then pass through into the console,\ngiving us the ability to uniquely tailor\n\n346\n00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:11.308\nhow the consumers of this information,\nthe people who use the console,\n\n347\n00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.954\nthe Professionals that are monitoring or\nthe line of business owners.\n\n348\n00:16:14.954 --> 00:16:18.380\nPeople that own the databases or\nown the web source or whatever.\n\n349\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.280\nHow they are going to be able to interact\nwith, and see their information.\n\n350\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.780\nSo all the views that we use are created\nas objects that exist here that we can\n\n351\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.720\nthen bind and\nadd into our management pack.\n\n352\n00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.000\nWe can see the current\ninformation about it,\n\n353\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.890\nwe can see these are already created\nas you are able to see right here.\n\n354\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.360\nAnd we can go in.\n\n355\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.550\nSame thing with tasks, we can go in\ncreate a new task if we want to.\n\n356\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.940\nLets just take a look at this real quick,\nmove this over so\n\n357\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.490\nyou can see this while we're working.\n\n358\n00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.420\nSo we have agent based tasks or\nconsult based tasks, two categories.\n\n359\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.470\nAnd under agent task with things like hey,\n\n360\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.510\nrun something in the command line,\nrun the equivalent as the Unix Linux shell\n\n361\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.470\ncommand cuz the command line will be\na Windows function for the agent.\n\n362\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.990\nThis would be the second one would be\na Linux units equivalent for that.\n\n363\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.000\nRun a script, maybe a PowerShell script,\nmaybe a match file.\n\n364\n00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.990\nSomething like that would run here.\n\n365\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.880\nAnd then we can do from the console\nan event command line different option.\n\n366\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.330\nSo if we just say we're\ngoing to go in let's say and\n\n367\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.480\nwe'll just choose command line\nhere agent task no big deal.\n\n368\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.465\nThis is where we bind\nto the management pack.\n\n369\n00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:25.985\nThis is the part I wanna show you.\n\n370\n00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:28.985\nWe bind either to our uniquely\ncreated management pack.\n\n371\n00:17:28.985 --> 00:17:34.735\nShare a key management pack, or we\ncombine to the generic catch all unsealed\n\n372\n00:17:34.735 --> 00:17:38.750\nmanagement pack if you don't create your\nown which typically is gonna be either\n\n373\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.780\nthe default management pack or the client\nmonitoring overrides management pack.\n\n374\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.970\nWe have two that are normally gonna\nbe used for most of our overrides, or\n\n375\n00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.830\nmost of our customizations.\n\n376\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.220\nA lot of times you wanna create your own.\n\n377\n00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.900\nRight, your own management\npack like we did.\n\n378\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.380\nSo you can put everything there and\nkind of know where they are.\n\n379\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.610\nBut a lot of times you will\nalso want to go ahead and\n\n380\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.400\njust have them in a standard\ndefault configuration.\n\n381\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.820\nSo that way they can be applied to any and\n\n382\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.890\nall systems by anybody\nwho wants to use them.\n\n383\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.770\nAnd they don't have to know about this\nspecial management pack you created and\n\n384\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.030\nthen you don't have to go into\nthat management pack to use it.\n\n385\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.230\nJust gonna be part of standard\nmonitoring that takes place\n\n386\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.250\nat any level in the console.\n\n387\n00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.270\nSo it's up to you ultimately\nto decide how to do this.\n\n388\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.860\nBut we do have options,\nwe'll just attach it to the one\n\n389\n00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.370\nthat we created cuz we throw\nour other objects in there.\n\n390\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.030\nSo the Cherokee Management Pack.\n\n391\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:31.690\nWe then specify the name of-\nWhatever we're gonna call this.\n\n392\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.720\nAny description that may be required.\n\n393\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.050\nOur Task Targets, so we'll select in here.\n\n394\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:36.910\nWhat we're gonna target.\n\n395\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.520\nAnd we can see common targets,\nthis is a filtered list.\n\n396\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.280\nWe'll do all targets, we'll see literally\nevery targeted object that's available.\n\n397\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.720\nSo we can.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is quite a big list there.\n\n398\n00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.590\n&gt;&gt; It does get a lot bigger.\n\n399\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, obviously.\n\n400\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:47.860\nSo, you know,\n\n401\n00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.680\nlet's just say hypothetically, we're just\ngonna do an Active Directory printer.\n\n402\n00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.200\nWe're not gonna make this complicated\ncuz I'm not really worried about\n\n403\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.840\nwhat this is right now,\nso we have that there.\n\n404\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.970\nWe then would specify the path\nto the file, the parameters,\n\n405\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.750\nthe actual working directory and\nthe timeout values for the script.\n\n406\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.490\nI'm not gonna populate that cuz we don't\nhave anything to work with right now,\n\n407\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.870\nit's just a quick off-the-cuff\nkind of walk through.\n\n408\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.040\nTo show you this, but\nyou could see we'd add these values in.\n\n409\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.412\nHit create, once we are done, and\nthen we would have this bound to that\n\n410\n00:19:15.412 --> 00:19:18.957\ndefinition will ultimately wind up\nbeing bound to the management pack and\n\n411\n00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:22.408\nwe could then use that when we go into\nthe management pack at that point.\n\n412\n00:19:24.128 --> 00:19:27.180\nAs you saw just get out of this.\n\n413\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.590\nWhen we go back into our management\npack we would then be able to up\n\n414\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.770\nin the monitoring area if we open\nit up and look at it, we would\n\n415\n00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.240\nthen have access to all of that stuff\nthat we're creating and piling in there.\n\n416\n00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.120\nAnd we would then be able, when we go,\nactually execute that script and\n\n417\n00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.280\nhave it target whatever we used.\n\n418\n00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.060\nAnd every time Cherokee wanted\nto see the output of that,\n\n419\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.430\nshe would just go to her management pack.\n\n420\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.160\nIsn't that cool?\nWe can say your management pack.\n\n421\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.710\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; You have your own management pack.\n\n422\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.520\nWe can go to Cherokee's management pack,\n&gt;&gt; Should I trademark that?\n\n423\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.350\n&gt;&gt; You should, let's call it\nthe Cherokee Management Pack.\n\n424\n00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.230\nThe CMP.\n\n425\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.710\nAnd we could go ahead and then whoever's\nusing it can just run that script or\n\n426\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.040\nthat task driven function by using\nit from the management pack.\n\n427\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.180\nThey'd be able to see the output of it.\n\n428\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.930\nMaybe since we said in theory\nwe're targeting printers.\n\n429\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.910\nMaybe it's a task that goes out and\n\n430\n00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.210\nverifies whether the printers\nare installed correctly.\n\n431\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.370\nMaybe it prints a test page to the printer\nafter we install it to make sure that\n\n432\n00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.680\nthe drivers are there or\nsomething like that,\n\n433\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.730\nwe could easily write a script that\ndoes that, wouldn't be very complicated.\n\n434\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.850\nSo the nice thing about SCOM is that\nwe're not just monitoring passively,\n\n435\n00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.570\nbut we have the ability\nto take action as well.\n\n436\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.470\nAnd we can ping a machine, we can look at\na log file, we can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n437\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.910\nPut a machine into maintenance,\ntake it offline so\n\n438\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.090\nwe can work with it in response\nto monitoring that we're doing.\n\n439\n00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:41.130\nSo we have full on capabilities\nto interact with systems through\n\n440\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.760\ntasks in the console as well as just\npassively recording information\n\n441\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.020\nabout their status from here.\n\n442\n00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.960\nSo we have the capabilities to go and\ndo quite a number of things in here\n\n443\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.990\nboth in the authoring space and linking\nthat to settings and the admin space.\n\n444\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.870\nWe've gone ahead and\ntalked about how to discover Information,\n\n445\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.240\nwe've talked about how to deploy agents\nboth manually and in an automated fashion.\n\n446\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.390\nWe've talked about via using of console\nto do that during the manual install,\n\n447\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.530\nusing the discovery mechanism to be able\nto go out and find it into a call console\n\n448\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.035\npush to deploy the agentt, so we've been\nthrough all that and talked about that.\n\n449\n00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:15.165\nIf we're gonna do manual agent installs,\njust returning to that idea for\n\n450\n00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:16.485\njust a moment.\n\n451\n00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:21.515\nI talked to you about the fact that\nwhen we do an agent install it may or\n\n452\n00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:23.497\nmay not be preapproved for, right?\n\n453\n00:21:23.497 --> 00:21:26.727\nIf we do a console push\nthrough a discovery,\n\n454\n00:21:26.727 --> 00:21:29.677\nthen we'll see that the agent\nwill show up, assuming of course,\n\n455\n00:21:29.677 --> 00:21:31.697\nthat we have the right permissions,\nas we talked about.\n\n456\n00:21:31.697 --> 00:21:34.877\nAnd the agent managed system will get\npopulated here and we'll see it and\n\n457\n00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.000\nit will be ready to go.\n\n458\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.600\nWhen we talk about the idea that under\npending management, we would see systems\n\n459\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.810\nthat are gonna have agents on them but\nhave not been approved yet.\n\n460\n00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.070\nWhen do a manual systems in\nthe last episode by the way.\n\n461\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.285\nWhen we do a manual age and install,\nwe're doing an age and install that is not\n\n462\n00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:55.330\npre-approved and so those manual installed\nagents mom agent dot msi, right?\n\n463\n00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.630\nThe manual package.\n\n464\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.140\nWhen we do that they will show up here.\n\n465\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.960\nWe have to then go in and\n\n466\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.920\napprove them because by default we don't\nallow manual agents to be installed.\n\n467\n00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.855\nAnd approved in one step.\n\n468\n00:22:05.855 --> 00:22:07.605\nNow I know it's kind of hard to\nsee cuz they're grayed out but\n\n469\n00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:11.425\njust over here imagine for\na minute there was a machine here right?\n\n470\n00:22:11.425 --> 00:22:16.505\nYou know, let's say desktop one and\nwe highlight it than these options become\n\n471\n00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:21.690\navailable and it says up here approve with\na green check, or reject with an x, right?\n\n472\n00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.230\nAnd so we could then approve or\ndeny that installation.\n\n473\n00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.480\nIf we approve it the agent goes\nactive we start monitoring.\n\n474\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.850\nIt moves from pending management up\ninto agent managed by doing that.\n\n475\n00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:38.080\nIf we deny it, we essentially say,\nhey sorry its not gonna go live and\n\n476\n00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.210\nwe then remove the system from here,\nwe're not gonna be able to monitor it,\n\n477\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.740\nthat doesn't mean we can't re-install and\ndo it again,just\n\n478\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.350\nmeans we have to know that it wont\nbe approved by default, right?\n\n479\n00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.870\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be limited by\ndifferent types of rules, so\n\n480\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.199\nthat just not anyone can approve or allow\nthese particular functions as well, right?\n\n481\n00:22:55.585 --> 00:23:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Well, we would normally want to\n\n482\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.060\nuse delegated role to give\nusers rights to the console.\n\n483\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.110\nSo if we follow the normal best practice\nrecommendations about administering and\n\n484\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.340\nthe way in which we'd normally do those\nthings, then the answer is, yeah,\n\n485\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.910\nassuming that they've been\ngiven the right role.\n\n486\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Be careful that we're not\ngiving out these rights to this.\n\n487\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.040\nBut it seems like a pretty\npowerful capability and\n\n488\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.220\nwe're not just doling them out left and\nright.\n\n489\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.130\n&gt;&gt; Well it depends on your thought process\nwith regards to how you just manage.\n\n490\n00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.590\nI mean we say as a best practice,\nyou should use delegated authority.\n\n491\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.850\nYou should assign roles.\n\n492\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.010\nYou should constrain users, not allow them\nfull rein in any product for any reason.\n\n493\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.710\nThat's just the standing best practice,\n\n494\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.700\nbut keep in mind not a lot\nof administrators do that.\n\n495\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.860\nMany do, many don't.\n\n496\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.480\nTo be fair in the real world,\nI've seen it both ways.\n\n497\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.300\nIn big organizations with very\ndistributed architectures,\n\n498\n00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.210\nlots of people doing this kind of stuff\nmakes a lot of sense to be doing that,\n\n499\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.460\nsmall organizations where you may,\nliterally, be an army of one.\n\n500\n00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.875\nIt may just be you and\nyou're the only person doing this.\n\n501\n00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:56.067\nYou may not go to the trouble of having\na login there's five different users to do\n\n502\n00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:56.840\nyour job, right?\n\n503\n00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.468\nYou just may have full access rights,\nfull console rights as an admin and\n\n504\n00:24:00.468 --> 00:24:03.038\nyou just go in and\ndo everything with that account.\n\n505\n00:24:03.038 --> 00:24:06.956\nSo it really depends on the nature\nof how you choose to view the world.\n\n506\n00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:10.480\nTotally up to you, but you have to\ndecide whether or not that makes sense.\n\n507\n00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.620\n&gt;&gt; That makes me sound like\nI'm a paranoid pessimist now.\n\n508\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.239\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I'm just trying to be-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:17.183\n&gt;&gt; Realistic about how you see this occur\n\n510\n00:24:17.183 --> 00:24:20.402\nin the real world, because if\neverybody did the right thing and\n\n511\n00:24:20.402 --> 00:24:23.635\nfollowed the best practice and\ndid the way we told you to.\n\n512\n00:24:23.635 --> 00:24:26.155\nThen the answer will be unequivocally\nabsolutely that's exactly what we do and\n\n513\n00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:26.855\nwhat we expect.\n\n514\n00:24:26.855 --> 00:24:29.915\nBut I'd be lying to you if I said that's\nwhat I see every day in the real world.\n\n515\n00:24:29.915 --> 00:24:33.482\nBecause while a lot of people do that,\nas I said a lot of people don't,\n\n516\n00:24:33.482 --> 00:24:34.182\nthey should do it.\n\n517\n00:24:34.182 --> 00:24:36.851\nThat doesn't always mean that\nwe're all gonna do it, right?\n\n518\n00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:39.272\nSo it's a good point to bring out,\na good thing to think about.\n\n519\n00:24:39.272 --> 00:24:42.052\nBut it just may not always happen\nthat way, just so you know.\n\n520\n00:24:42.052 --> 00:24:45.259\nAll right, so\nwhen we think about just going in here,\n\n521\n00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:47.408\nbuilding on this thought process.\n\n522\n00:24:47.408 --> 00:24:51.493\nLet me share with you about\nmanual approval of or rather,\n\n523\n00:24:51.493 --> 00:24:56.260\napproval of manual installed agents,\nwhat I was trying to say.\n\n524\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.960\nThe way we modify that setting,\nif you're interested in changing that and\n\n525\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.890\nsaying, you know what?\n\n526\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.310\nManually install, no problem, let's just\ngo ahead and let's either reject them.\n\n527\n00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.636\nWhich is the default setting, as I said,\ndon't allow them or change it.\n\n528\n00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:10.520\nCuz we wanna be able to review them,\nas I showed you we could do.\n\n529\n00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.700\nAnd by the way,\nautomatically approve them,\n\n530\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.115\ndon't even bother me with the need\nto go do that, just approve them.\n\n531\n00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:18.615\nI have to come in and modify the setting\nhere, as I've just been doing and\n\n532\n00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:20.915\nshowing you, and\nunder global management settings.\n\n533\n00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:25.525\nSo in the settings area right down\nhere in administration under security,\n\n534\n00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:26.645\nwhich is where I am.\n\n535\n00:25:26.645 --> 00:25:27.835\nI went to the settings area,\n\n536\n00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:32.145\nand I'm just right down here on\nsecurity under the server area.\n\n537\n00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:34.975\nThis is a category here,\nand I just pull that up,\n\n538\n00:25:34.975 --> 00:25:36.855\njust click on it to bring up the box.\n\n539\n00:25:36.855 --> 00:25:40.740\nAnd you can see that I can modify and\nmanipulate these settings as needed.\n\n540\n00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.845\nSo I can change that\nbehavior if I choose to.\n\n541\n00:25:42.845 --> 00:25:45.695\nThe default is reject new\nmanual agent installations, but\n\n542\n00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:47.170\nI can modify that if I want to.\n\n543\n00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.110\nSo it will be up to you to go in and\nchange that if you would like.\n\n544\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.360\nJust wanted to show that to you so\nyou know where we are.\n\n545\n00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.675\nAnd the fact that we can modify\nthat setting if necessary, so\n\n546\n00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:56.980\njust keep that in mind.\n\n547\n00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.020\nAll right, having said that, we talked\nabout scripting the agent install,\n\n548\n00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.270\ntalked about how to do\nthat with PowerShell.\n\n549\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:07.260\nWe can use a variety of different\napproaches to get this done.\n\n550\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.940\nSo just keep in mind that PowerShell\nis probably gonna be the most likely\n\n551\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.100\ncandidate for us, and\nthat would be hopeful for us to do.\n\n552\n00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.100\nBut scripting doesn't\nalways mean PowerShell,\n\n553\n00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.536\nwe tend to use those\nterms interchangeably.\n\n554\n00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:22.394\nWe can also use a different kind\nof script to do the install.\n\n555\n00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:25.030\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nwhat I mean by that here.\n\n556\n00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.890\nSo right here scripting\nthe install of the agent.\n\n557\n00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.650\nWe can go from a command prompt in the DOS\nshell in other words not from PowerShell,\n\n558\n00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.570\nbut in other words in just\na traditional command prompt.\n\n559\n00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.750\nAnd we can run a script of a different\ntype, not a PowerShell script but more of\n\n560\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.790\na traditional Windows script if you\nwill or just a normal batch file script.\n\n561\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.480\nWe can use that if we're interested\nin installing the agent also, and\n\n562\n00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.880\nyou can see it here.\n\n563\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.360\nThis one is a little bit more involved got\nmore lines to a little bit more going on.\n\n564\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.010\nBut a lot of the parameters are similar,\n\n565\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.102\nyou just have to read\nthem to figure them out.\n\n566\n00:26:58.102 --> 00:27:01.360\nBut percent win directory percent\nplace order for the installation\n\n567\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.200\non the local machine of windows, typically\nsee colon, backslash Windows, right?\n\n568\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.620\nBut you would specify that,\nSystem 32 MSI exact,\n\n569\n00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.480\nthat's the Windows installer .exe/i for\ninteractive.\n\n570\n00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.106\nAnd then specify the path that you're\ngonna install into where MOMAgent.install\n\n571\n00:27:18.106 --> 00:27:21.159\nfrom, I should say, or\nMOMAgent.MSI will be found.\n\n572\n00:27:21.159 --> 00:27:24.015\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and\nuse settings from ad and\n\n573\n00:27:24.015 --> 00:27:26.620\na bunch of other switches\nthat will be set here.\n\n574\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.408\nEither on or off zero or one is on or off.\n\n575\n00:27:29.408 --> 00:27:33.283\nUse manual specified settings\nmanagement group, specify the name,\n\n576\n00:27:33.283 --> 00:27:38.040\nmanagement server, specify the DNS name,\nmanagement server AD name, right?\n\n577\n00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.730\nYou can see here secure port,\nactions used computer account yes or no.\n\n578\n00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:47.090\nAction user what's the name,\naction domain what's the domain name,\n\n579\n00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.940\nactions password what's the password.\n\n580\n00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.930\nIf we go ahead and\nspecify all these things and\n\n581\n00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.010\nrun this script as a different\nkind of script, but\n\n582\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.580\nstill allowing us to automate\nthe install we can do this as well.\n\n583\n00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.250\nSo when I say we can script the install\n\n584\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.900\nof MOMAgent.MSI as a manual\ninstall trying to automate it.\n\n585\n00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.930\nI'm talking more about a script,\n\n586\n00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.490\nI'm talking more about a script like\nthat as opposed to a PowerShell script.\n\n587\n00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.596\nWhere we're just gonna\ntype in the cmdlets and\n\n588\n00:28:09.596 --> 00:28:13.334\nessentially run through that installation\ntargeted as we talked right up above.\n\n589\n00:28:13.334 --> 00:28:16.751\nYou could do it either way, just pointing\nout that scripting may mean different\n\n590\n00:28:16.751 --> 00:28:18.485\nthings depending on whose doing it, and\n\n591\n00:28:18.485 --> 00:28:20.740\nwhat your vision of a script\nmay look like this days.\n\n592\n00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.480\nBecause its not always PowerShell,\n\n593\n00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.150\nwe wanna pay homeage to the fact\nthat that where we come from\n\n594\n00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.340\nwith this kind of a script initially\ncuz these are the old school scripts.\n\n595\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.796\nThis is essentially just a Windows\nscript that we would use as a batch or\n\n596\n00:28:31.796 --> 00:28:34.564\nrun from a command line, but\nit still gets the job done.\n\n597\n00:28:34.564 --> 00:28:36.490\nThere's absolutely nothing\nwrong with using that.\n\n598\n00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.858\nIt's just not as cool and\nperhaps as forward thinking,\n\n599\n00:28:39.858 --> 00:28:43.570\nnot as forward friendly and\nfashion friendly as our new scripts are.\n\n600\n00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.940\nBut it doesn't mean you can't\nuse them if you want to.\n\n601\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.930\nJust calling the Windows\ninstaller the MSI exec or\n\n602\n00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:53.740\nMSI installer, and using that\n.exe would get the job done also.\n\n603\n00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.800\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n604\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll even get lucky and\n\n605\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.880\nbe able to use those old school\nscripts within PowerShell if they're\n\n606\n00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.060\nnot completely deprecated,\nso that's pretty cool too.\n\n607\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.075\n&gt;&gt; You may be able to pull\nthose in absolutely and\n\n608\n00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.737\nsometimes you can definitely do that and\nget an advantage.\n\n609\n00:29:05.737 --> 00:29:07.587\nBecause we already have\nthe script written, so\n\n610\n00:29:07.587 --> 00:29:09.450\nwhy do the work twice in theory, right?\n\n611\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.500\nSo there are value adds there to\nunderstanding the I guess I'll\n\n612\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.188\ncopy inventory, right?\n\n613\n00:29:15.188 --> 00:29:18.334\nOf all the prior knowledge organized\nin the organization that you may have\n\n614\n00:29:18.334 --> 00:29:19.602\naccess to these scripts, and\n\n615\n00:29:19.602 --> 00:29:22.890\nthings like that that are floating\nround that you may wanna leverage.\n\n616\n00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.429\nSo let's just take a look on the web for\na couple of minutes of some things we've\n\n617\n00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:27.058\nall ready done or\nat least clean up and talk about.\n\n618\n00:29:27.058 --> 00:29:30.360\nAnd give you some guidance on some\nthings you may wanna take a look at.\n\n619\n00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.860\nWe talked about implementing user roles.\n\n620\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.030\nWe have a little website,\n\n621\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.270\nguidance from Microsoft TechNet\nthat'll show us how to do this.\n\n622\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.290\nWe talked about the idea that the user\nrole was made up from the profile\n\n623\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:39.870\nand the scope.\n\n624\n00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.800\nI showed you this when we created one.\n\n625\n00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.040\nWe took a look at profiles and\n\n626\n00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.020\nthen used the user role with\nthe profile to be able to create that.\n\n627\n00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.930\nSo we kind of did that whole thing and\nhad that conversation.\n\n628\n00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.887\nSo nice little how to here from Microsoft.\n\n629\n00:29:52.887 --> 00:29:57.606\nUsing the Active Directory Services Domain\nto Assign Computers to Ops Manager Groups,\n\n630\n00:29:57.606 --> 00:30:01.580\nwe talked through the logic of how to\ndo the agent push and the install.\n\n631\n00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.730\nWe can use AD,\nI mentioned we may create container\n\n632\n00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.090\ninformation in AD in the beginning\nof this conversation.\n\n633\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.070\nIf we're modifying things,\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n634\n00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.314\nWe can use automatic assignment through\nAD, if we are linked to the domains.\n\n635\n00:30:13.314 --> 00:30:16.232\nSo this would obviously pertain\nto putting systems into\n\n636\n00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:19.337\nOps Manager management groups\nthat are inside the domain,\n\n637\n00:30:19.337 --> 00:30:23.690\nthat are domain joined not the ones that\nare using the gateway server outside.\n\n638\n00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.000\nThat are not gonna be managed directly,\ncuz we don't trust them.\n\n639\n00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.020\nWe go back here to our picture.\n\n640\n00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.640\nWe couldn't use that for a system sitting\nout here, but we could use it for\n\n641\n00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.750\nthe system on the inside that are part\nof the domain that are joined, right?\n\n642\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.890\nThat's just what we wanna make\nsure that we're thinking about,\n\n643\n00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.800\nso just be aware of that.\n\n644\n00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.180\nWe have a little how to\nif you wanna do that.\n\n645\n00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.720\nWe talked about Management Packs.\n\n646\n00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.890\nWe have a nice little list\non the TechNet website.\n\n647\n00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.818\nIt's kept up to date by Microsoft, so\nit's actually a pretty authoritative list.\n\n648\n00:30:49.818 --> 00:30:53.870\nIt's not gonna be like every management\npack in the world that's available.\n\n649\n00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.350\nBut it's pretty good in terms of\nthe Management Packs Microsoft has and\n\n650\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.830\nthat they manage specifically.\n\n651\n00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.860\nRemember there are a lot\nof third party vendors.\n\n652\n00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.720\nThey may provide Management Packs,\nthey may not all show up on this list.\n\n653\n00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.550\nBut this is gonna provide\na Management Pack list for\n\n654\n00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.840\nyou with what Management Packs\nare available.\n\n655\n00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.003\nAnd you can see,\njust as I scroll down here randomly.\n\n656\n00:31:14.003 --> 00:31:17.298\nIf I go down a little bit here,\nlet's go down towards the bottom.\n\n657\n00:31:19.459 --> 00:31:24.227\nAnd let's say hey, Windows Server Active\nDirectory Certificate Services for\n\n658\n00:31:24.227 --> 00:31:28.797\n2012, and there is one for\nFederation Services for 2016, right?\n\n659\n00:31:28.797 --> 00:31:30.162\nSo it's a relatively new one.\n\n660\n00:31:30.162 --> 00:31:33.040\nAll you have to do is click\non the appropriate link.\n\n661\n00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.710\nIt'll open up and\ntake you right to the download site for\n\n662\n00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.580\nthe Management Pack, whatever that is.\n\n663\n00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.590\nAnd you can just go ahead and\ndownload that Management Pack.\n\n664\n00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.920\nAnd then import it, and\nwe haven't talked about how to do that.\n\n665\n00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.970\nBut you'll see how to do that\nin one of our upcoming episodes,\n\n666\n00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.750\nhow you bring Management Pack in and\nadd them into the console.\n\n667\n00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.160\nSo you could go through and\nget a list right here.\n\n668\n00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.870\nMost Management Packs as we talked about,\ncome in sealed.\n\n669\n00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.710\nBut we've been through that,\n\n670\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.530\nyou can obviously then go through and\ncreate overrides on them.\n\n671\n00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.413\nIf you wanna modify them, or create an\nunsealed Management Pack and essentially,\n\n672\n00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:02.028\nbuild it from scratch on your own.\n\n673\n00:32:02.028 --> 00:32:03.609\nAnd you can decide how to do that, but\n\n674\n00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.859\nwe import those Management Packs\ninto the console.\n\n675\n00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:08.379\nYou add them either from the local disk,\nwhen you've download and\n\n676\n00:32:08.379 --> 00:32:09.237\nthey're available.\n\n677\n00:32:09.237 --> 00:32:12.931\nOr you could go out if you're connected\nto the web and add them from the catalog,\n\n678\n00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:15.416\nessentially go shopping at\nMicrosoft's website and\n\n679\n00:32:15.416 --> 00:32:19.600\npull them down using the management pack\ncatalog web service to be able to do that.\n\n680\n00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.720\nAnd most, if not all, management packs\nfrom Microsoft, pretty much without\n\n681\n00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.700\nexception, their management packs\nare available through the catalog.\n\n682\n00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.780\nYou can download them.\n\n683\n00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.930\nRemember third party management packs may\nnot be published and available directly.\n\n684\n00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.450\nYou may have to download\nthem from a vendor site.\n\n685\n00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.450\nAnd then after that import\nthem from the disc,\n\n686\n00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.960\nmeaning just bring them down\nlocally on the machine.\n\n687\n00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.930\nThey come down as, essentially, zip file.\n\n688\n00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.088\nYou just open them up.\n\n689\n00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:47.170\nAnd then you're able to import them,\nright, directly import the MP file,\n\n690\n00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.230\nthe definition files.\n\n691\n00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.320\nYou bring them into the console.\n\n692\n00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.860\nAnd before you ask, cuz I know you\nwanna ask questions real quick.\n\n693\n00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.400\nYou could also use PowerShell to do that.\n\n694\n00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.800\nImport SCOM management pack is the cmdlet\nthat you can use from PowerShell to import\n\n695\n00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.350\nmanagement packs directly from\nthe shell if you want to.\n\n696\n00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.920\nSo you could do that as well, yeah.\n\n697\n00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.190\n&gt;&gt; Cool, so I was just thinking,\n\n698\n00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.760\nAdam, what if I do see a management\npack that I wanna use and\n\n699\n00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.010\nbring in and the source is not necessarily\na reputable or well known source?\n\n700\n00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.540\nDo we use hashing algorithms\nto verify these files?\n\n701\n00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.195\nOr what would be the best way to verify\nthe authenticity of those particular\n\n702\n00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:20.187\nmanagement packs?\n\n703\n00:33:20.187 --> 00:33:24.183\n&gt;&gt; So 1-800 am I about to get hacked?\n\n704\n00:33:24.183 --> 00:33:26.767\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, so we do use what Cherokee is\n\n705\n00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:30.740\nalluding to is are we essentially\nsigning our software, right?\n\n706\n00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.565\nWhen you say we're using\nhashing algorithms.\n\n707\n00:33:32.565 --> 00:33:33.800\nCan we verify the integrity?\n\n708\n00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.750\nAnd the proof of origin\nof the manufacturer, or\n\n709\n00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.740\nthe person that's purporting\nto provide this to you.\n\n710\n00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.950\nWe would traditionally say that we\nare digitally signing software,\n\n711\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.860\nhashing algorithms are used to do that.\n\n712\n00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.227\nAnd the answer is absolutely.\n\n713\n00:33:45.227 --> 00:33:48.640\nAny of the downloads that come to us,\nand again this is relative.\n\n714\n00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.080\nDownloads that come from Microsoft\nare signed by Microsoft, right?\n\n715\n00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.270\nSo traditionally their\nsoftware's digitally signed.\n\n716\n00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.210\nWe could validate that if we chose to,\n\n717\n00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.590\nbut you specifically said hey\nit's coming from a third party.\n\n718\n00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.410\nMay or may not be reputable, I think you\nmay have even hinted at the fact that\n\n719\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.200\nthey're a little shady and\nmay not be trustworthy.\n\n720\n00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.990\nSo it may be hard to know because\nremember, if a non-reputable, essentially\n\n721\n00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:13.431\na third party, that shady character\nkind of person, signs [CROSSTALK].\n\n722\n00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:15.869\nWe'll put that in quotes,\nsigns their software, but\n\n723\n00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:19.070\nyou don't have a clue who they are and\nwhether you can trust them.\n\n724\n00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.410\nIt may be signed, so\n\n725\n00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:23.970\nit is legitimately gonna have\nthe thought process we wanna see.\n\n726\n00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.140\nBut can we trust the signature\nwould be the question, right?\n\n727\n00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.617\nAnd if they're smart about it and\nthey're really looking to trick us but\n\n728\n00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:33.493\nthey've done their homework they're\nprobably gonna be digitally signing with\n\n729\n00:34:33.493 --> 00:34:36.691\na certificate that we could validate,\nright, with a hash value.\n\n730\n00:34:36.691 --> 00:34:42.541\nEither a signature what's called\na hash value and or a message digest,\n\n731\n00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:47.160\nwhen we're doing with email\nwhen we digitally sign.\n\n732\n00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.860\nBut we're just doing software, we refer to\nit as the hash value traditionally, right?\n\n733\n00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.620\nSo we would look for the hash value.\n\n734\n00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.400\nWe could probably go out to\na quote unquote vendor website,\n\n735\n00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.400\nwhich is probably fake,\nright, as you would know.\n\n736\n00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.820\nAnd everything looks legitimate.\n\n737\n00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.780\nSo we say, well yeah, I guess in theory,\nkind of looks like they're legitimate.\n\n738\n00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.790\nI'll probably trust them,\nbut we don't really know.\n\n739\n00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.100\nThat's part of the problem,\nwe just don't really know.\n\n740\n00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.633\nSo when you get a management\npack from shadycorp.com,\n\n741\n00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:13.497\nthey may not be the people\nthey purport to be.\n\n742\n00:35:13.497 --> 00:35:17.809\nBut then again, and I'm not suggesting at\nall for a minute, even hinting at the fact\n\n743\n00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:21.823\nthat you do or don't download software\nfrom commonly accessible websites all\n\n744\n00:35:21.823 --> 00:35:25.591\nthe time, where you may not necessarily\nknow the vendor intimately, but\n\n745\n00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:27.120\nyou have knowledge of them.\n\n746\n00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.210\nCuz we all do that, you download stuff\nfrom Microsoft, from Adobe, from VMware,\n\n747\n00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.390\nfrom Cisco, you name it, right?\n\n748\n00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.590\nAnd we don't really, if you think\nabout it at the end of the day,\n\n749\n00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.900\ndon't really have any knowledge of who\nthey are either, but they're reputable.\n\n750\n00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.080\nWe trust them and obviously we go\nthrough the process to use it.\n\n751\n00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.890\nSo you want to exercise good judgement,\nright?\n\n752\n00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.480\nA little due diligence definitely\nas Cherokee suggested.\n\n753\n00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.385\nReally good idea to stop and\nthink about it.\n\n754\n00:35:48.385 --> 00:35:50.970\nLet's at least pause and\ntry to validate them if we can.\n\n755\n00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.760\nLet's make sure we have a sense of\nwho they are before we just blindly\n\n756\n00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.620\ntrust them.\n\n757\n00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.480\nBut you know at the end of the day, it is\nwhat it is, I mean they could be good,\n\n758\n00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.100\nthey could be bad.\n\n759\n00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.000\nIt would be hard to say definitively.\n\n760\n00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.580\nSo sticking to the main stream, right?\n\n761\n00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.080\nSticking to vendors you know,\nyou trust, are recommended to you.\n\n762\n00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.520\nEven if they are third party vendors,\nit's probably a good idea.\n\n763\n00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.190\nYou'll probably be a lot less likely\nto have problems if you do that.\n\n764\n00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.470\nI think that is fair to say to your point.\n\n765\n00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.404\nBut there are some really small\ndevelopment houses out there that put out\n\n766\n00:36:19.404 --> 00:36:20.898\na lot of really cool stuff.\n\n767\n00:36:20.898 --> 00:36:24.375\nNot necessarily in this space, but I'm\nthinking for instance about share parts,\n\n768\n00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.300\nshare parts.\n\n769\n00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.603\nI'm combining web parts and\nSharePoint together and\n\n770\n00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:29.554\ncreating something new called share parts.\n\n771\n00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:31.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Coming soon to a toy store near you.\n\n772\n00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.030\nSo for SharePoint, if you're familiar with\nSharePoint, you know about web parts,\n\n773\n00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.570\na little applet-like functional elements\nthat we essentially apply to a page and\n\n774\n00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.100\ngive us the ability to interact and\ncreate program-like functionality.\n\n775\n00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.036\nIf you're familiar with web parts,\nyou'll know that there\n\n776\n00:36:46.036 --> 00:36:50.010\nare a lot of vendors in that space,\nthe eco system that supports SharePoint,\n\n777\n00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.180\nthat create web parts that are not\nrelated to Microsoft in any way.\n\n778\n00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.640\nAnd many of them are very big,\nwell-known reputable firms.\n\n779\n00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.120\nBut a lot of them are very small and\njust really, just are not well-known.\n\n780\n00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.052\nFor some very specific things, yes, but\nin general not very well-known at all.\n\n781\n00:37:04.052 --> 00:37:06.308\nAnd so, it really just depends\non where you're coming from.\n\n782\n00:37:06.308 --> 00:37:10.659\nYou gotta just think about that, think\nabout whether you gonna play the roulette\n\n783\n00:37:10.659 --> 00:37:14.410\nwheel of [INAUDIBLE] packed downloads I\nguess would be the way to put that and\n\n784\n00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.460\nsee whether or not it makes sense.\n\n785\n00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.700\nAll right, so we did talk a little\nbit about object discovery as well.\n\n786\n00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.420\nWent through and showed you\nthe thought process behind that.\n\n787\n00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.357\nI'll have a little bit more to say\nabout that as we come back for\n\n788\n00:37:23.357 --> 00:37:26.805\nanother episode and just continue to\nbuild out our general knowledge and\n\n789\n00:37:26.805 --> 00:37:30.040\noverview of how SCOM is used at\na high level to do management.\n\n790\n00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.280\nAnd remember we'll have upcoming episodes\nwhere we do some hands on walkthroughs.\n\n791\n00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.000\nI've just been nibbling away here and\n\n792\n00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.490\nthere at some very high level stuff\njust to really give you a context.\n\n793\n00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.100\nWe're gonna do some deeper dives and\n\n794\n00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.330\nactually show you how to do\nthings start to finish and\n\n795\n00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:46.510\nactually stand up management packs and\ncreate monitors and do all sorts of stuff.\n\n796\n00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.040\nStart, end-to-end really with\nthe appropriate steps, and\n\n797\n00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.755\nreally taking our time\nto explain that to you.\n\n798\n00:37:50.755 --> 00:37:53.310\nBut, that'll be coming up in\nsome future episodes, okay?\n\n799\n00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:55.010\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nI'm gonna hold you to that Adam.\n\n800\n00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But for this show we are out of time.\n\n801\n00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.900\nSo we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n802\n00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.909\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n803\n00:37:59.909 --> 00:38:00.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n804\n00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.438\n&gt;&gt; See

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Coming to you live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:08.074\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.731\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:15.445\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.335\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.025\nSo we've actually reached a part four.\n\n9\n00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.445\nWe're gonna continue to look at different\ntypes of monitoring utilities that we\n\n10\n00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:24.375\nhave available to us.\n\n11\n00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.835\nAnd back in studio today we have Mr.\nAdam Gordon, if I can even get it out.\n\n12\n00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:28.680\nHow are you today, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.455\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:33.480\nAlways, always fun and\na pleasure to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.000\nSo we're gonna continue talking, part\nfour which means we've had three prior or\n\n16\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.490\nprevious episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.320\nAnd it may be helpful for you to go back,\n\n18\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.120\ntake a look at some of the stuff\nwe've been discussing.\n\n19\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.864\nWe're jumping around on\nthe console a little,\n\n20\n00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:46.396\nshowing you how things are put together.\n\n21\n00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:50.472\nExplaining some of the specific functions\nof areas that will be valuable for\n\n22\n00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:54.864\nyou to have a better sense of with regards\nto how SCOM, System Center Ops Manager is\n\n23\n00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:59.003\nused to be able to help us manage the\nprivate cloud infrastructure that we're\n\n24\n00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:03.560\ngonna be deploying, our web servers,\nour databases, all that kind of stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.370\nAnd so\nwe're gonna continue in that vein, or\n\n26\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.950\nwe're gonna revisit some of the things we\njust talked about in some prior episodes,\n\n27\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.680\njust to give you a little\nmore more detail there.\n\n28\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.187\nAlso, go back in, take a look at\nmanagement packs in a little bit more\n\n29\n00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:16.511\ndepth in the sense of just showing\nyou how we do object discovery or\n\n30\n00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.002\ntalking about the concept\nof object discovery.\n\n31\n00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.969\nWhat management pack rules are, just some\nof those building blocks that I spoke\n\n32\n00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.110\nabout and went through with you last time.\n\n33\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.450\nWe'll just remind you about those\nthings and why they're important.\n\n34\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.680\nLet's start out, if again, we'll just\njump in here real quick and take a look.\n\n35\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.630\nBecause it's always good to talk, but it's\nalso better to see while we're talking.\n\n36\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.346\nHelps you to have a good\nsense of what we're doing and\n\n37\n00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:38.683\nlink that to where we are in the console.\n\n38\n00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.007\nI mentioned that we do a console push for\n\n39\n00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:43.620\nthe agent over the last\ncouple of episodes.\n\n40\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.820\nJust wanted to show you the discovery\nmethods that are available to us\n\n41\n00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.550\nwhen we do this.\n\n42\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.407\nRight-clicking on\nthe Network Management area here inside\n\n43\n00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:53.383\nthe Administration workspace,\njust so you know where we are.\n\n44\n00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:56.902\nAnd when we do Discovery Wizard,\nlet me just move this over so\n\n45\n00:01:56.902 --> 00:02:00.697\nyou could see that while we're talking,\nthat we could do this for\n\n46\n00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:03.810\nWindows or Linux based systems and\nnetwork devices.\n\n47\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.530\nAnd you can see that I have an option\nhere for any or all of those.\n\n48\n00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350\nWe'll do, let's say, Windows computers.\n\n49\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.440\nI then go ahead and say, are we gonna\ndo automatic computer discovery, select\n\n50\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.970\nthe practice labs domain and scan that\none cuz that's our domain that we're in.\n\n51\n00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.270\nLooking for any and all computers\nthat may be targets of opportunity\n\n52\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.946\nthat can have an agent installed on them.\n\n53\n00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:26.095\nAre we going to use what's called advanced\ndiscovery and specify a category?\n\n54\n00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.961\nServers and clients,\nservers only, clients only.\n\n55\n00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:33.359\nClients are considered not servers,\nmeaning desktop operating systems,\n\n56\n00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.810\nright, just so we know.\n\n57\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.780\nAnd then what's the management\nserver that we're gonna use?\n\n58\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.840\nSo we may have more than one.\n\n59\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.520\nRemember, if we have our pool,\nwe have more than one management server in\n\n60\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.219\nthe pool, so\nwe would choose what we wanna do.\n\n61\n00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.890\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo an automatic computer discovery.\n\n62\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.200\nWe'll just let that go through,\ndo its job there.\n\n63\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.810\nUse the select and\nmanagement server action account.\n\n64\n00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.780\nWe're specifying an account that\nhas rights to do this again,\n\n65\n00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.180\nyou could do this either way,\nbe up to us to decide.\n\n66\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.224\nIf we hit discover, takes just a minute,\ngoes through, wait for it to back.\n\n67\n00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:02.552\nIt's essentially talking to\nthe Active Directory right now.\n\n68\n00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:03.817\nIt's looking to see whether or\n\n69\n00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.791\nnot there are any computers that we may\nbe able to install the agent on to.\n\n70\n00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.270\nIf there are, it's gonna give a quick\nupdate as to what those may look like.\n\n71\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.780\nWe're gonna be able to choose one or\nmore of them out of the list and\n\n72\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290\nselect that we wanna install\nthe Microsoft monitoring agent on it.\n\n73\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.860\nThat will then make it an agent\nmanaged computer once we actually\n\n74\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.670\nfinish that install.\n\n75\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.869\nSo we'll be able to go in and\ndo that if we would like.\n\n76\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.700\nRemember that, as we're doing this,\nwe do have agents for\n\n77\n00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.240\nthe Linux Unix systems as well.\n\n78\n00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.220\nI talked about the fact\nwe can monitor those.\n\n79\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.780\nAnd so we have the appropriate agents\nthat we can deploy there and remember for\n\n80\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.460\nthe network devices, so\nwe do have our list there.\n\n81\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.150\nWe'll take a look in just a second.\n\n82\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.340\nFor our network devices,\nwe're using S and MP to discover those.\n\n83\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.280\nRemember we said things like routers, that\nwould be hardware that we're monitoring,\n\n84\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.850\nand wanna get a usage profile on.\n\n85\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.310\nCPU usage, memory, things like that.\n\n86\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.499\nThat's the kinda stuff we\nmonitor on network devices,\n\n87\n00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.800\nswitches can be monitored,\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n88\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.130\nSo let's say here we have four machines,\nright, that came back.\n\n89\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.940\nLet's say I wanna target\nmaybe my domain controller.\n\n90\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.650\nDoesn't really matter\nwhich one I wanna target.\n\n91\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.970\nSo I could specify that, click Next,\nagain what account am I gonna use?\n\n92\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.992\nIn this case, agent install, right,\n\n93\n00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:11.319\n[COUGH] account in the directory\nthat we're gonna install into.\n\n94\n00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.714\nThis job monitor here or\ntasks data monitor is running,\n\n95\n00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:16.603\nyou'll see that's started.\n\n96\n00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:20.601\nOnce it's done, we'll then be able to\nsee that is completed successfully.\n\n97\n00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:24.118\nJust like if you remember, if you've\nseen the prior episodes we did on SCVNM,\n\n98\n00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:27.280\nwhenever we did something we have\nthat job status window that came up.\n\n99\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.552\nShowed us the status of the job, right,\nand told us, hey, this is going.\n\n100\n00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:34.701\nAnd we could minimize it, bring it back\nand look at it over time if we want to.\n\n101\n00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:37.630\nSame idea here,\nit's just our running tasks.\n\n102\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.990\nSo we'll just let that run.\n\n103\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.760\nWe can take a look,\nsee the task has started.\n\n104\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.660\nIt's gonna run for a bit,\nI'm not gonna sit here and wait for it.\n\n105\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.110\nI'm just showing you that it would run.\n\n106\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.927\nAnd eventually,\nwe will see that is does finish.\n\n107\n00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:50.361\nAnd we will be able to\nultimately go in and\n\n108\n00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:53.021\nsee that that machine\nhas an agent put on it.\n\n109\n00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.949\nAnd we'll take a look at that and\ngo back into that at some point and\n\n110\n00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.630\nmaybe just check to make\nsure that it did finish up.\n\n111\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.500\nAnd so\nwe mentioned we'd wanna go back in and\n\n112\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.900\njust take a look at the management packs,\nthe objects associated with them.\n\n113\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.850\nJust discuss them here with\na little bit more depth.\n\n114\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.781\nI just wanna talk about object\ndiscoveries for just a minute.\n\n115\n00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:14.669\nWe have different ways of doing object\ndiscovering as an object component or\n\n116\n00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.637\na component of the management packs.\n\n117\n00:05:16.637 --> 00:05:19.203\nObject discovery's essentially\nhow do we go out and\n\n118\n00:05:19.203 --> 00:05:20.961\ndiscover either the application?\n\n119\n00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:24.900\nRemember we can monitor both\napplications and components.\n\n120\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.900\nSo we can monitor the server that's\nrunning the web services, and\n\n121\n00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.600\nwe can monitor the web service or\napplication it's providing.\n\n122\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.060\nWe can monitor both through SCOM,\nand we see up here\n\n123\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.620\nthat we have distributed applications\nup here in the authoring space.\n\n124\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.480\nThat's where we can profile out and\n\n125\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.460\ndiscuss how we're gonna do\nmonitoring on the application side.\n\n126\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.400\nWe have this concept of the APM,\nthe advanced monitoring that we can use to\n\n127\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.565\nmonitor web services and applications,\nand so we have that capability.\n\n128\n00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:55.416\nHow do we discover them and how do we know\nthat the management pack can monitor them,\n\n129\n00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.565\nis really what object\ndiscoveries are all about.\n\n130\n00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.755\nWe have three methods, registry base.\n\n131\n00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:00.825\nWe can go in,\n\n132\n00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:04.570\nwe can essentially probe the registry\nof the machine that we're targeting.\n\n133\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.358\nIt's the least impactful.\n\n134\n00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:12.644\nIt's the most effective but\nit's also the least impactful,\n\n135\n00:06:12.644 --> 00:06:18.637\nmeaning it does not stress the CPU or RAM\non the machine we're targeting very much.\n\n136\n00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:21.857\nCuz all we're doing is scanning\nthe registry of the machine looking for\n\n137\n00:06:21.857 --> 00:06:25.367\ninstall keys that we've specified to say,\nyeah, this program is there or\n\n138\n00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:28.057\nthis setting is turned on if\nyou wanna think of it that way.\n\n139\n00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:34.328\nIf we do something more invasive,\neither a WMI query, so essentially a WQL,\n\n140\n00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:40.129\na Windows WMI query language query,\nwe call those WQLs or WMI queries.\n\n141\n00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.771\nA WMI query or a script, we talked\nabout different kinds of scripts,\n\n142\n00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.150\ncan also be run.\n\n143\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.920\nBut remember,\nthose are typically more intensive.\n\n144\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.050\nThey take more memory,\n\n145\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.840\nmore CPU cycles to load the script\ninto memory, execute locally.\n\n146\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.390\nWe burn processor cycles to do that and\nwait for that to come back.\n\n147\n00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.880\nSo of the three methods, registry\nscanning is the least invasive, and\n\n148\n00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.080\nis usually going to be the most, I keep\ntripping over the word, effective here.\n\n149\n00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.690\nI wanna say it's the most effective.\n\n150\n00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.370\nLet me just stop there before I yet\nagain say it the wrong way.\n\n151\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.950\nBut it's the most effective method.\n\n152\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.400\nSpecifically, because it's the least\nimpactful, is what I was trying to say.\n\n153\n00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.962\nIt is not going to tax the local\nsystem inordinately, and,\n\n154\n00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:21.897\ntherefore, chew up a lot of resources\nwhile we're trying to scan.\n\n155\n00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:24.268\nSo, we just wanna keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n156\n00:07:24.268 --> 00:07:26.127\nIt is what we would say,\nthe preferred method.\n\n157\n00:07:26.127 --> 00:07:29.880\nMeaning, if we had an option, we would try\nto use that, if at all possible, right?\n\n158\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.300\nSo, just wanna think about that,\nand be aware of that.\n\n159\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.534\nIf we look at any one of these items,\nsuch standard objects, discoveries here,\n\n160\n00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:40.602\ndiscovery of .NET EPM agent, for\ninstance, and we look at the properties.\n\n161\n00:07:40.602 --> 00:07:43.669\nWe can either go over here and bring\nup the properties or just right-click.\n\n162\n00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:48.029\nIf we go in and we take a look,\nlet's just move this over so can see this,\n\n163\n00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:49.145\njust one second.\n\n164\n00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:52.811\nPull this us up there just so\nwe could see what's going on.\n\n165\n00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:55.806\nWe could see the classes that are of\nobjects that are being targeted.\n\n166\n00:07:55.806 --> 00:08:00.264\nSo we can see here, for instance, this is\ngonna look at enable monitoring of all Web\n\n167\n00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:04.102\napplications, performance thresholds,\nsensitivity thresholds.\n\n168\n00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:07.270\nFor all web systems,\nmonitor only official exceptions, etc.\n\n169\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.060\nIt's got a list of things\nthat we're gonna do.\n\n170\n00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.060\nWe have the configuration here.\n\n171\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.070\nSo kinda tells us,\nin XML code, what's going on.\n\n172\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.210\nWe've got our, if we do our product\nknowledge, or company knowledge,\n\n173\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.660\nany of that would be there.\n\n174\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.410\nAnd we have our ability to override here.\n\n175\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.960\nNow remember, these are already prebuilt.\n\n176\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.530\nSo in other words,\n\n177\n00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:30.492\nthese are generic object discovery items\nthat we can deploy into a management pack.\n\n178\n00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:32.810\nThey're pre-configured for\nus, in other words.\n\n179\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.940\nAnd the idea about that, and\n\n180\n00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.800\nthe reason we know that is,\nif you look here under, where was I?\n\n181\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.860\nUnder general, right?\n\n182\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.750\nAnd we see that this is set up.\n\n183\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.390\nIt is, object discovery is enabled,\nit's turned on.\n\n184\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.490\nWe look at the classes,\nthey're all built out.\n\n185\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.890\nWe look at configuration,\nrather, excuse me, on overrides.\n\n186\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.670\nAnd we can go in here, and\n\n187\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.630\nwe can see, that we actually are able to\ndisable or modify these, if necessary.\n\n188\n00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.680\nSo we can change these out, remember, and\n\n189\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.880\nthen attach them to one\nof our management paths.\n\n190\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.770\nLike the unsealed one we've created.\n\n191\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.740\nCreate our own ability to go in and\ndiscover applications and hardware.\n\n192\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.710\nAnd then monitor, specifically\nbased on how we choose to see it.\n\n193\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.130\nAnd that's what this does.\n\n194\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.550\nAnd so if I go in here, and\ndisable the discovery through overrides.\n\n195\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.080\nI can go in, and scable it for individual\nobjects, or some subset of them.\n\n196\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.460\nAnd I can override one or more parameters\nof discovery through overrides.\n\n197\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.210\nI can change the way it is discovered,\nlet's just say, for all objects or\n\n198\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.660\nclasses of a Windows system.\n\n199\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.250\nAnd I can go in, and\nI can then select what I'm gonna do here.\n\n200\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.630\nChoose Override, and all of a sudden then,\nyou'll see, right there.\n\n201\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.300\nI can choose the management pack\nI wanna bind this to, right?\n\n202\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.630\nSo as I create overrides,\n\n203\n00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.840\nremember, we store the overrides\nin the management pack.\n\n204\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.392\nAnd what the management pack,\nthe open management pack,\n\n205\n00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.173\nthe unsealed management pack gives us.\n\n206\n00:09:53.173 --> 00:09:58.400\nIs a container to collect up all of the\nobjects, and the ways we wanna use them.\n\n207\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.864\nAnd the overrides on the existing objects.\n\n208\n00:10:00.864 --> 00:10:05.569\nAnd then, we apply those as a unique\nspecial set of characteristics we\n\n209\n00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:07.496\nwanna gather up and manage.\n\n210\n00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.420\nSpecifically, in whatever\nthe management pack is called.\n\n211\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.320\nAnd those overrides simply go\nfind the original object, and\n\n212\n00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.340\nget applied as transforms.\n\n213\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.300\nThey change the original object,\nleaving it intact.\n\n214\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.760\nBut for the instance of the management\npack that we using, the override with.\n\n215\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.467\nWe essentially take the original object,\n\n216\n00:10:24.467 --> 00:10:28.611\nthe object of discovery we're using here,\nfor .NET APM Agent.\n\n217\n00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:33.620\nAnd we're going to use that original,\nwith the transforms we created here.\n\n218\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.831\nTo create a brand new\nobject discovery method,\n\n219\n00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:39.269\nthat will be unique to that custom\nmanagement pack that we're creating.\n\n220\n00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:41.820\nLeaving the original intact,\nso we don't screw it up for\n\n221\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.160\nall the other dependencies.\n\n222\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.109\nAll the other management packs that\nmay be relying on it as well, right?\n\n223\n00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:47.706\nSo we're gonna be able to use it uniquely,\nin other words, but\n\n224\n00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:49.110\nstill keep the original intact.\n\n225\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.610\nSo this is kind of an interesting\nthought process that we go through here,\n\n226\n00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.420\nwhen we're using this.\n\n227\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.258\nAnd we just create these overrides.\n\n228\n00:10:55.258 --> 00:10:59.480\nWait, I said no,\nI don't want to save that, there we go.\n\n229\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.620\nNot paying attention to what yes and\nno means here.\n\n230\n00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.840\nSo when we go through and\ndo the overrides.\n\n231\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.460\nWe have the registry, or excuse me, the\nobject discovery rather through overrides.\n\n232\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.250\nWe can do registry,\nmy end or script-based.\n\n233\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.700\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n234\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.210\nWe also have management pack rules here,\n\n235\n00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.410\nwe've talked about these and\nI'll have gone through.\n\n236\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.300\nI just want to show you the different\ntypes of rules that we have.\n\n237\n00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.790\nI stopped on them before, I think in\nthe last discussion we were having.\n\n238\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.270\nBut we didn't really spend any time on it.\n\n239\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.190\nIf I just go here in\ncreate a rule real quick.\n\n240\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.480\nAgain, just using the wizard to do this.\n\n241\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.910\nAnd move this over, select the type\nof rule that we wanna create.\n\n242\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.800\nAnd we have some options here.\n\n243\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.260\nAnd then, let's say that we wanna go in.\n\n244\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.150\nAnd let's just look here\nin the categories, right?\n\n245\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.640\nSo we have Collection Rules,\nwe have Alert Generating Rules.\n\n246\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.430\nWe have, essentially,\ntimed commands rules.\n\n247\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.050\nThis are the few categories I wanted to\njust stop on for a moment, explain to you.\n\n248\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.770\nWe looked at or have talked a little bit\nabout, I'm just gonna open these up, so,\n\n249\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.020\nyou can see one of these.\n\n250\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.548\nWe talked about some of\nthese things already.\n\n251\n00:11:56.548 --> 00:12:00.515\nWe talked about running scripts, and\nthe different ways we can approach that.\n\n252\n00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:02.830\nGenerating rules, or\nto be based on the occurrence of an event.\n\n253\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.870\nThat something happens,\nI want to be made aware of that.\n\n254\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.155\nI want to be able to fire off a task,\nand take some sort of action.\n\n255\n00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:13.084\nWanna enter some sort of data into a log.\n\n256\n00:12:13.084 --> 00:12:16.340\nMaybe generate information\nthat can be reported on later.\n\n257\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.380\nPut stuff up on the dashboard.\n\n258\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.720\nWho knows what I'm going to do?\n\n259\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.860\nBut based on events occurring, I then want\nthat to be the trigger for some action.\n\n260\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.720\nOr awareness to be created\non the part of the system.\n\n261\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.640\nAnd then ultimately, communicate it\nto people and/or other entities.\n\n262\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.890\nSo, maybe the event is,\nthat a system starts up,\n\n263\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.690\nmaybe we can spin up a new server.\n\n264\n00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.940\nAnd I wanna be made aware of that, so\n\n265\n00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.930\nI can make sure that it's\nrunning the right way.\n\n266\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.490\nMaybe a server shuts off.\n\n267\n00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.080\nMaybe a server's running out of\nfree space on their hard drive.\n\n268\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.440\nWho knows what the case is?\n\n269\n00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.210\nBut any one of those things could be\nevents that we could use as triggers, so\n\n270\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.450\njust keep that in mind.\n\n271\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.230\nCollection, which is down here in\nthe middle, under Collection Rules.\n\n272\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.470\nLet me just bring this up here.\n\n273\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.910\nAnd let's say, you'll see we have\ndifferent types of collection rules.\n\n274\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.440\nOf event-based, performance-based,\nand probe-based.\n\n275\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.670\nEvent-based, same idea, right?\n\n276\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.470\nEvents occur, right, so\nwe can look at a log entry.\n\n277\n00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.390\nWe can look at a WMI or SNMP-based event.\n\n278\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.680\nAny kind of event that can be recorded\ncan be used as a trigger here.\n\n279\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.590\nIt's the same for alert generating rules.\n\n280\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.100\nUnder performance-based,\nwe can look at SNMP, WMI,\n\n281\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.410\nor Windows-based performance indicators.\n\n282\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.820\nThink PerfMon, performance monitoring.\n\n283\n00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.870\nAnd think about objects\nthat are monitored,\n\n284\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.290\nand things that are going on there.\n\n285\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.595\nWe could set up rules for\nany and all of these.\n\n286\n00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:27.655\nThey create capacity or\nhelp us create capacity planning reports.\n\n287\n00:13:27.655 --> 00:13:30.405\nWe'll take a look at reporting,\nand talk about that at some point.\n\n288\n00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:33.155\nSo just keep in mind that we could do\nthis based on the actual performance\n\n289\n00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:34.005\nof the system.\n\n290\n00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:36.182\nAlso timed commands, here.\n\n291\n00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.862\nJust bring this up here.\n\n292\n00:13:37.862 --> 00:13:40.542\nTime commands, execute a command and\ngo execute a script.\n\n293\n00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:42.132\nRun this on a certain schedule.\n\n294\n00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:45.892\nWouldn't be great to say, at 2:00 in\nthe morning, run this batch file.\n\n295\n00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:46.502\nThat goes out and\n\n296\n00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:50.460\npulls the list of all active web servers\nthat are currently being load-balanced.\n\n297\n00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.310\nAnd report that out, so\nI know how the farm is doing,\n\n298\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.870\nor something to that effect, right?\n\n299\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.070\nAnd I could do that based on\nsimply using a timed command.\n\n300\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.170\nBecause I can say at a certain point\nin time, day and time specification.\n\n301\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.770\nI could then program that rule to run or\nexecute that rule at that time.\n\n302\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.640\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like Task Scheduler on steroids,\nhere.\n\n303\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.340\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, yeah.\n\n304\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.750\nIt's just Task Scheduler with\nthe ability to feed the rules,\n\n305\n00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.510\nto the specificity that we would like.\n\n306\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.201\nAnd notice here again, right, bind that\nto my management pack that's unsealed,\n\n307\n00:14:15.201 --> 00:14:16.900\nthat I wanna add this rule to, right?\n\n308\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.171\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n309\n00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:20.520\nSo I can go in and I can create rules.\n\n310\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.410\nAnd I can do that based\non three different types.\n\n311\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.330\nAlert-generation, collection,\nand/or timed commands, right?\n\n312\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.880\nWe also have the ability to use monitors,\nthese are also sitting in here.\n\n313\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.720\nAgain, just give this\na second just to populate.\n\n314\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.030\nSo up under Monitors, as you can see,\nI can create a monitor.\n\n315\n00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.490\nWe have different types,\nI can create unit monitors,\n\n316\n00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.810\ndependecy rollup monitors,\nand/or aggregate rollup monitors.\n\n317\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:43.950\nWe have different options.\n\n318\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.530\nBut monitors,\n\n319\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.480\ngenerically, show the health or\nthe state of an application or an object.\n\n320\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.420\nHey, I'm monitoring,\nI wanna see if you're healthy.\n\n321\n00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.390\nI wanna see if you're in a warning state,\nor a critical state, or\n\n322\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.140\nsomething like that.\n\n323\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.920\nTraditional red,\n\n324\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.790\nyellow, or green stoplight KPIs that\nwe're often familiar with, for instance.\n\n325\n00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.420\nWould be built on health monitors,\nis one example.\n\n326\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.460\nThe health state of a monitored\nobject can either be,\n\n327\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.250\nwe have two different ways of doing this.\n\n328\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.960\nEither two-state, green or\nred, as I mentioned.\n\n329\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.120\nOr, which is just healthy or critical.\n\n330\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.740\nOr what we call a three-state monitor,\nwhich I just described, green,\n\n331\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.630\nred, yellow.\n\n332\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.320\nHealthy, green.\n\n333\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.175\nCaution, yellow, trending towards not\nbeing healthy, but not there yet.\n\n334\n00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:22.360\nAnd/or red, or\nyou can think of it the other way.\n\n335\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.460\nYellow could also be\ncoming out of critical,\n\n336\n00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.080\nred, treading back towards healthy.\n\n337\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.350\nDepending on which way we're monitoring,\nwhat our trajectory looks like.\n\n338\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.180\nBut three-stage, right?\n\n339\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.010\nThere are three stages,\nyellow, red, green.\n\n340\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.360\nSo we have the ability to be able to do,\nand use these monitors,\n\n341\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.390\nto be able to indicate and\ndo an assessment of health.\n\n342\n00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.870\nWe want to make sure we're aware of that,\nand we're thinking about that.\n\n343\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.815\nRules and monitors both collect data.\n\n344\n00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:48.141\nIt's just a matter of how we are using the\ndata, whether we store the data or not.\n\n345\n00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:49.457\nMonitors don't store and\n\n346\n00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:52.453\ncollect any monitoring data\nin the OpsManager databases.\n\n347\n00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:56.061\nMonitors only store the health state\nchanges and alert information.\n\n348\n00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:57.710\nAnd the ops manage your database.\n\n349\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.650\nWhereas rules will actually store\nthe data in the ops manager database.\n\n350\n00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.730\nSo there is a different usage of the data\non the back end in terms of how we consume\n\n351\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.970\nit and where we find it.\n\n352\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.660\nAnd so there is a distinct difference\nbetween rules and monitors.\n\n353\n00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.860\nWe just wanna be aware of that and make\nsure we're thinking about that, right?\n\n354\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.910\nSo we have three types of monitors,\nas I suggested to you.\n\n355\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.430\nYou can see them on the screen,\nas I was talking about right there.\n\n356\n00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.860\nUnit monitors, they monitor things\nlike specific counters, events,\n\n357\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.630\nscript services, things like that.\n\n358\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.140\nThey typically would generate alerts.\n\n359\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.210\nThat's more often than\nnot what we use them for.\n\n360\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.130\nAggregate roll up monitors show\nthe health state of other monitors.\n\n361\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.200\nThey're rolling things up,\nand averaging them.\n\n362\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.350\nThat's what aggregated roll up\nmonitors do down there at the bottom.\n\n363\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.470\nThey're targeted, or\nare targeted at an object.\n\n364\n00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.470\nFour different top level aggregate roll\nup monitors we have there, availability,\n\n365\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.400\nconfiguration, performance, and security.\n\n366\n00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.280\nYou saw these when I opened them up and\nactually showed you what they were.\n\n367\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.460\nWe looked at the performance monitor for\n\n368\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.900\nweb servers in the other\ndiscussion we were having.\n\n369\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.030\nAnd dependency roll up monitors,\nthey roll up health for\n\n370\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.120\nobjects that are linked by some\nsort of hosting relationship.\n\n371\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.010\nDependency, the idea of that I depend\non this in order to do my job.\n\n372\n00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.500\nNow we have to look at both, and\n\n373\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.140\nwe average the health across both\nthose systems and show you that.\n\n374\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.690\nSo we are not just showing you,\nhey this system.\n\n375\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.100\nBut we are showing you this system and\n\n376\n00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.370\nwhat it depends on to be healthy,\nin other words with dependency roll up.\n\n377\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.320\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n378\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.610\nWhen we look at any of these, and\n\n379\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.330\nagain we will just open one up,\nthere's a health monitor.\n\n380\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.350\nThere's those four top-level aggregates\nfor the rollup that I just described-\n\n381\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.750\navailability, configuration,\nperformance, and security.\n\n382\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.710\nThose are the ones that are part of the\naggregate roll up that we talked about,\n\n383\n00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.940\nthe different categories\nthat we would be looking at.\n\n384\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.860\nI just want to make sure we're aware\nof that, you can see them there.\n\n385\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.920\nJust right here, availability,\nconfiguration, performance, and security,\n\n386\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.680\neach one of them just listed in.\n\n387\n00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.530\nYet when we look underneath, we can see\nthat there are different items that may or\n\n388\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.440\nmay not be monitored under one or\nmore of these to specifically give us,\n\n389\n00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.325\nin this case,\nthese are linked to Configuration.\n\n390\n00:17:52.325 --> 00:17:55.020\nRight, availability doesn't seem\nto have anything in this one.\n\n391\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.140\nNeither does performance or security.\n\n392\n00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.470\nBut specifically for Entity Health,\nunder .NET Application Monitoring,\n\n393\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.930\nAPM Agent,\nwe're seeing the configuration items.\n\n394\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.710\nAnd we're looking at availability,\nor excuse me,\n\n395\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.290\nwe're looking at configuration for\nIS restart, is that required?\n\n396\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.190\nYes or no?\n\n397\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.915\nWe're looking at application\npool recycles required.\n\n398\n00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:18.940\n[INAUDIBLE] look at very specific things\nfrom a configuration perspective.\n\n399\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.090\nAnd that's what we will be\nmonitoring in this particular one.\n\n400\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.840\nRemember there's hundreds\nof these in the console.\n\n401\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.760\nWe're just looking at one little\nslice of one item, just to show you\n\n402\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.970\nthe logic of the discussion that we're\nhaving and the terms we're defining.\n\n403\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.345\nJust to show you where they live and\nkinda how they come together.\n\n404\n00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:33.376\nYou look like you wanted to ask something.\n\n405\n00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:34.520\nYou've got that pondering\nlook on your face.\n\n406\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've kinda been thinking.\n\n407\n00:18:35.752 --> 00:18:40.726\nMicrosoft specifically Microsoft spend\na lot of time with, what is it, the sys\n\n408\n00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:44.590\ninternals tool to help with different\ntypes of monitoring capabilities, and\n\n409\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.130\nI just, when you clicked on that-\n&gt;&gt; Winternals.\n\n410\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.690\nNow winternals.\n\n411\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.270\n&gt;&gt; Winternals?\nOkay.\n\n412\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.511\n&gt;&gt; When they got they got bought out,\nthey become winternals.\n\n413\n00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:53.172\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAnd, I'm just wondering,\n\n414\n00:18:53.172 --> 00:18:55.247\nis there any kind of, connection there,\n\n415\n00:18:55.247 --> 00:18:56.270\nare we able-\n&gt;&gt; Don't wonder.\n\n416\n00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Were we able to pull those in?\n\n417\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.710\n&gt;&gt; Don't wonder.\n\n418\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:58.950\n&gt;&gt; No, don't do that?\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna wonder.\n\n419\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.535\nCuriosity kills things, right?\n\n420\n00:19:00.535 --> 00:19:03.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I mean they've\nobviously spent a lot of time in this\n\n421\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.060\nparticular tool, and\nthen the other as well, and\n\n422\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.090\nI'm just kind of seeing if\nthere's any relationship.\n\n423\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, right,\n&gt;&gt; So let's step back.\n\n424\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.600\nAnd just quickly, for everybody out there\nwho may or may not have the context for\n\n425\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.760\nthis conversation,\n\n426\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.360\nlet's just give everybody a quick\nidea of what we're talking about.\n\n427\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.830\nAnd then let's coordinate that\nknowledge so it makes sense.\n\n428\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.840\nSo The gentleman that Cherokee mentioned,\n\n429\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.840\nMark very well known in many,\nmany circles.\n\n430\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.410\nYou may very well know his name, if you\ndon't you should find out more about him.\n\n431\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.440\nHe's a very incredible individual in terms\nof his knowledge and what he does, for\n\n432\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.870\nus in the Windows community.\n\n433\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.790\nThese days, one of the key thought\nleaders in Microsoft has been for\n\n434\n00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.790\nmany, many moons.\n\n435\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.860\nBut used to have a separate company, that\ncreated a very interesting set of tools,\n\n436\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.620\ncalled the Syst internals tool set.\n\n437\n00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.700\nWhich is what you originally were\nthinking about and referencing it as.\n\n438\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.350\nMicrosoft acquired his company\na while back, and he became part of\n\n439\n00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:58.890\nthe Microsoft engineering efforts\naround these server product lines.\n\n440\n00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.160\nAnd he is now, as I said.\n\n441\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.380\nyou know, a senior leader there.\n\n442\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.090\nBut he now heads up a team\nthat deals with what's\n\n443\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.890\nbeen re-branded as\nthe Winternals Tool Set.\n\n444\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.879\nWhich is essentially just those tools, but\n\n445\n00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:12.060\nre-branded for\nspecifically the Microsoft environment.\n\n446\n00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.320\nYou could download those\ntools through Tech Net.\n\n447\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.520\nYou could find them on\nthe Tech Net website.\n\n448\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.150\nThere's about 20 something megs in the\npackage approximately that you download.\n\n449\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.560\nThere's 30 or 40 tools in there.\n\n450\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.800\nAnd a lot of them are specifically\neither command line tools or\n\n451\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.890\nadd ons to existing functions in Windows\nthat could be used to extract data.\n\n452\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.280\nSo, for instance,\nwe're used to using Task Manager,\n\n453\n00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.330\nmany of us probably, to look at a\ngraphical interface to see the process ID,\n\n454\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.240\nwhat we call the PID for running process,\nand a bunch of information about it.\n\n455\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.200\nIn Linux and Unix, you're not used to\nusing something like Task Manager cuz it\n\n456\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.280\ndoesn't exist, you use a program or rather\na command line function called top or\n\n457\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.480\nproc or list,\nthere are different ways you can do this.\n\n458\n00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.650\nSo Mark developed a tool called\nPS List which essentially\n\n459\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.120\nis one of the tools in that set you're\ntalking about that gives us that\n\n460\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.530\ncommand line vision of what List would\ndo for us, but in the windows world,\n\n461\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:09.590\npulling in a lot more data that is there\nin the windows stack performance data from\n\n462\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:14.320\na windows system, but is hidden by the in\nTask Manager, it's just not exposed.\n\n463\n00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.960\nSo when we talk about his tools and\nthe development [INAUDIBLE] them 100%.\n\n464\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.580\nWhen we talk about is that there\na link between these two stacks and\n\n465\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.508\ntools, conceptually yes, practically no.\n\n466\n00:21:26.508 --> 00:21:30.170\nThe tools do similar things, but\nthey're operated differently,\n\n467\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.400\nthey're independent of each other.\n\n468\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.450\nThose tools do not exist in Scon.\n\n469\n00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:38.500\nScon does not work inside those tools or\nreference those tools in any way, but\n\n470\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.210\nthe fundamental underline architecture\nof the Windows platform that let's\n\n471\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.890\nboth those sets of tools pull data\nin Is independent of the tools and\n\n472\n00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.810\ntherefore is referenced by both.\n\n473\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:53.010\nMark's genius in his ability to do this,\nis the fact that he understands\n\n474\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.630\nthe Window's programmatic\nmodel at such a deep level and\n\n475\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.060\nhas such understanding of how things\ncommunicated work, that him and\n\n476\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.700\nhis teams are able to do these great\nthings outside of the structure of\n\n477\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.640\na huge investment of time, energy,\nresources, and money, to build a platform\n\n478\n00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.650\nlike System Center, and put it into\nthe enterprise, so that, you know,\n\n479\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.920\nyou have $100,000 monitoring suite of\nproducts that you can deploy and use.\n\n480\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.780\nYou could download his tools for free,\nuse them on an individual machine,\n\n481\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.700\nvery effective but they're not enterprise\nscalable in the sense that they give us\n\n482\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.320\nthis kind of monitoring across web form,\nlet's say, hypothetically.\n\n483\n00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.480\nWe could use them one on one, one system\nat a time to probably achieve similar\n\n484\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.400\nresults in some respects, but his tool\nsets are not as robust in the sense of\n\n485\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.130\ngiving us the same kind of deep monitoring\ncapabilities that these tools do.\n\n486\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.060\nSo, there's definitely a thought\nprocess there, but I wanna be clear,\n\n487\n00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.120\nthey're not linked in the way you\nwere thinking that they may be.\n\n488\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.520\nThey're not gonna be connected that way,\nright?\n\n489\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.550\n&gt;&gt; Good to know.\n&gt;&gt; Not directly.\n\n490\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.060\nBut you can download them and I would\ndefinitely encourage you to take a look at\n\n491\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.030\nthem I know I've talked about them\nin other episodes, other shows,\n\n492\n00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.540\nnot in this area, but in some security\ncourses that we've done, we've mentioned\n\n493\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.810\nthem there, and some of the General\nWindows Administration courses, I'm sure\n\n494\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.240\nyou heard about them there, because\nthey are a very valuable set of tools,\n\n495\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.260\ndefinitely something to consider and\nthink about.\n\n496\n00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.080\nAll right, so we were talking about just\nmonitors and just a little bit of a deeper\n\n497\n00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.100\ndive into some of the objects\nassociated with the management pack.\n\n498\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.840\nMaking sure we're familiar\nwith how they work,\n\n499\n00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.760\nthis could be a sense of\nhow they come together.\n\n500\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.600\nHow are we doing for\ntime there, Ms. Cherokee?\n\n501\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.430\n&gt;&gt; We're getting close, Adam.\n\n502\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.120\n&gt;&gt; Does that mean I have to stop talking?\n\n503\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Well I think we have enough\nto go ahead and create.\n\n504\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.000\nI don't even know what part we are on,\nlike part five.\n\n505\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.959\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; I think it's like part 222.\n\n506\n00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:27.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dana's just waving at us,\n\n507\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000\npart four she's saying.\n\n508\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.610\nPart four out there.\n\n509\n00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.030\nThis is a part four.\n\n510\n00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.130\nThis may just be a good place for us to\nactually stop and maybe come back for\n\n511\n00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:33.720\na part five.\n\n512\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.760\nBecause I have five fingers, and\nwe always wanna do things rounded out.\n\n513\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.530\nBut we may wanna do a part five\njust on Run As accounts and\n\n514\n00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.470\nthe other stuff I mentioned.\n\n515\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.410\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But then we'll just go back,\n\n516\n00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.510\ntake a look at those real quick.\n\n517\n00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.100\nAnd wrap up some of that other\nknowledge that we've put together for\n\n518\n00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.580\nyou in this section.\n\n519\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.490\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nwe have got a lot of knowledge, so far.\n\n520\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.510\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; But you know, Adam,\n\n521\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.390\nyou are making SCOM less intimidating for\nme, and I do appreciate that.\n\n522\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.900\nAnd I also appreciate you for\nsticking with us.\n\n523\n00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.770\nBut, stay tuned, we do have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n524\n00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n525\n00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.280\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n526\n00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.150\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n527\n00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.510\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n528\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.311\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n529\n00:24:08.311 --> 00:24:14.196\n[MUSIC]\n\n530\n00:24:14.196 --> 00:24:17.667\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:15.168\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your configuring and\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.096\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:20.350\nYou may think that there's nothing\nleft to cover, but guess what, we do.\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.000\nWe have a part five that we\nneed to go ahead and get into.\n\n8\n00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.100\nSo back with us today, in the studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.560\nThank you for joining us, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.593\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for inviting me back,\nI was hoping we could do a part five,\n\n11\n00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.363\nI was actually shooting for a part ten.\n\n12\n00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:33.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we'll see how far we get,\n\n13\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.890\nand whether we get there or not will\nbe a TBD, a to be determined part item.\n\n14\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.260\nYou'll have to tune in in\nthe future to watch and see.\n\n15\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.280\nSo we're gonna continue\ntalking about SCOM.\n\n16\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.240\nWe are talking about monitoring how\nusing the System Center Ops Manager,\n\n17\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.620\nin this case infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.870\nAllows us to reach out and\nmonitor elements of the private cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.120\nWe've been talking about how to\nconfigure aspects in areas of SCOM.\n\n20\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.129\nWe're gonna go back in continue\nthat drive through the interface,\n\n21\n00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.204\ntalking about some things,\nsetting up the foundational elements.\n\n22\n00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:03.091\nIt occurred to me as we were\ndoing the other [COUGH] episodes,\n\n23\n00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.890\nparts one through four in\nthis particular series.\n\n24\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.410\nAnd how we had just kinda\nthrown SCOM out there.\n\n25\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.980\nGiving you some general context,\ncertainly, but\n\n26\n00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.220\ntalked a little bit about it.\n\n27\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.660\nBut hadn't really spent a lot of time\nincorporating it into the broader theme\n\n28\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.140\nof system center and\nwhere it is, and what it does?\n\n29\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.770\nWe talked about how we link it to\nother products that's certainly made\n\n30\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.150\nthose references for you.\n\n31\n00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.108\nBut I wanted to remind you that we have\nthe 7246 content the part one if you\n\n32\n00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:30.459\nwill of MCSC private cloud,\nalong with 7247.\n\n33\n00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.130\nThe material we're going through now.\n\n34\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.380\nAnd those shows and\n\n35\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.160\nepisodes in the other area where we deal\nwith looking at private cloud as well.\n\n36\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.540\nWe do a deep dive on SCOM there also, and\n\n37\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.160\ndeeper actually, in many respects\nthan what we're doing here.\n\n38\n00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.290\nAnd so, you may wanna look at that,\nyou may have already seen that content.\n\n39\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.310\nBut in case you haven't, just reminding\nyou there's a bunch of stuff there.\n\n40\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490\nCherokee joins me for\nsome of those episodes, so does Daniel.\n\n41\n00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.590\nSpend a lot of time putting\nthat stuff together for you.\n\n42\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.330\nAnd we do provide a very\nnice panoramic view of SCOM\n\n43\n00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.050\nwithin the middle of the data center,\nreally how it's used to monitor.\n\n44\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.436\nWe also have the 10964 content, right?\n\n45\n00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:09.290\nThe 109, the data center\noptimizing managing with SCOM.\n\n46\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.300\nWhich is really just an entire set of\nshows dedicated to how we use SCOM,\n\n47\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490\nset it up and manage it.\n\n48\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.410\nAnd use it to manage the infrastructure\nof your data center.\n\n49\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.290\nSo there's a lot of additional\nmaterial is my point.\n\n50\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.540\nAnd you can look certainly look to build\nout your knowledge of the product there.\n\n51\n00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.880\nWe're really scratching the surface\nhere going through some key thoughts and\n\n52\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.040\nobjectives for you.\n\n53\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760\nBut there is more material, want to just\nencourage you to think about looking there\n\n54\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.330\nto get some additional depth.\n\n55\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.470\nAnd some of that additional knowledge,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.140\nThat may be valuable for you,\nthat you may wanna have under your belt,\n\n57\n00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.030\nas you go to use this\nstuff in the real world.\n\n58\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.690\nSo if you join me back here in\nthe console, wanna talk a bit about, or\n\n59\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.020\ndevelop this idea about\nmonitoring a little bit more.\n\n60\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.170\nShow you some of these cool little\ndashboard feature views we have.\n\n61\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.600\nI want to talk about run as accounts\nwe've spoken about it already.\n\n62\n00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.020\nI want to show you the different\nkinds of accounts we support news for\n\n63\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.420\nthe run as configuration.\n\n64\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.240\nAlso want to make sure we go through and\nwe take a look at just a few of\n\n65\n00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.980\nthe additional areas we haven't quite\ngotten a chance to touch on yet.\n\n66\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.570\nWe'll sneak into the reporting\nwork space there for a minute.\n\n67\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.870\nJust take a look at some of the stuff\nthat goes on there to get a better view\n\n68\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.190\nof how we can use information long-term.\n\n69\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.610\nSo let's start,\nsince we're in the monitoring area,\n\n70\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.420\nlet's just quickly take a look\nat what's going on in here.\n\n71\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.410\nI am just in one of the work spaces.\n\n72\n00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.400\nThe monitor work space in\none of the management packs.\n\n73\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.140\nI just thought that it would nice\nto show you what a dashboard\n\n74\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.040\ntrending view may look like.\n\n75\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.930\nThis takes data,\n\n76\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.560\nin this case monitoring the health of\nour management pool resource groups.\n\n77\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.120\nSo, all the different management\nservers that are in there and looks at.\n\n78\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.770\nAs you can see over the last seven days\nalert trending and health state trending.\n\n79\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.091\nYou could see we're going up and\nrunning in green as an overall trend.\n\n80\n00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.830\nYou could see here that we've had some\nalerts occur over the last seven days.\n\n81\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.480\nSo we could see some trending in data\nwhen we look at a view like this.\n\n82\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.585\nAnd as we scroll down we just see\nthe key that helps us to understand what\n\n83\n00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:58.475\nthe information on the charts may mean.\n\n84\n00:03:58.475 --> 00:03:59.615\nSo we could decipher that,\n\n85\n00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:01.685\nlooks very similar to\na performance monitor view right?\n\n86\n00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.985\nIf you're used to using the performance\nmonitor looking what are the chart views\n\n87\n00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:07.741\nor the graph use-\n&gt;&gt; You already know I love these graphical\n\n88\n00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:10.760\nrepresentations, I think kind of\nanalysis here is great to help me.\n\n89\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.470\n&gt;&gt; You do, this is not the one-\n&gt;&gt; Identify these trends and correlations.\n\n90\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.467\nI know, this is not-\n&gt;&gt; The one you like's coming up.\n\n91\n00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:16.137\nI'm gonna show you the one you like.\n\n92\n00:04:16.137 --> 00:04:16.793\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; I made it up and\n\n93\n00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:18.470\nput it together specifically for you.\n\n94\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you mentioned it last episode and\n\n95\n00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:21.314\nI disappointed you, I know.\n\n96\n00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:23.781\nCuz when we got done, you didn't tell me,\nbut I saw the look in your eye,\n\n97\n00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.120\ncuz I didn't actually show-\n&gt;&gt; I actually cried.\n\n98\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.940\n&gt;&gt; A full-featured one.\n\n99\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.180\nOff camera when I wasn't looking.\n\n100\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.040\nIs good you have my napkin so\nyou could dub your eyes if you needed to.\n\n101\n00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.340\nI'm gonna show you the one you like,\nI actually have that set up and\n\n102\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.340\nit is the normal form when you like,\nwe can click through.\n\n103\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.075\nSo we're gonna take\na look at that as well.\n\n104\n00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.580\nBut you'll see here we have\nthe ability to do trending.\n\n105\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.820\nSee we also have the ability\njust to overall look at group\n\n106\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.050\nof function group health from\nan alert view perspective.\n\n107\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.818\nAnd a monitoring perspective\nin terms of health,\n\n108\n00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:49.920\nkind of combining some\ndifferent options together.\n\n109\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.310\nWhen we create dashboards and\nwe put together different views,\n\n110\n00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.950\nwe are programming what we call widgets.\n\n111\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.170\nThese little boxes,\nareas of functionality,\n\n112\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.790\nand we're able to drop different items\nin to provide different views and\n\n113\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.600\ndifferent ways of consuming information.\n\n114\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.190\nAnd so sometimes combining alerts and\nthen management or\n\n115\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.390\nmonitoring group infrastructure,\nalong with health status.\n\n116\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.310\nLets me get a lot of\ninformation in one place.\n\n117\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.350\nThat they might have to go to three or\n\n118\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.660\nfour different views to see if\nI'm doing it incrementally.\n\n119\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.590\nSo it's nice to be able to do this.\n\n120\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.912\nWe could see all the management servers in\nthe resource pool appear to be healthy.\n\n121\n00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:23.730\nI've actually added a few servers\nsince we did the initial demo.\n\n122\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.413\nWe did the client push to install\nthe initial agent from the console.\n\n123\n00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:29.670\nSo I've got three or\nfour servers under management now.\n\n124\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.097\nThey all appear to be healthy, I've got\njust different items that I can see here.\n\n125\n00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:36.606\nAnd you'll notice that on any one\nof these I can right-click and\n\n126\n00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:37.725\nI can pull up information.\n\n127\n00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:41.495\nProperties, Health Explorer,\nI can look at the navigation.\n\n128\n00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:44.090\nThe view that Cherokee likes,\nwe'll take a look at here in a minute.\n\n129\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.860\nSo I can go, drill down and see all this.\n\n130\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.140\nSo if I wanted to, I can right click here.\n\n131\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.601\nI can open up the Health Explorer,\njust to bring up a separate pane,\n\n132\n00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.502\njust to show you an additional view.\n\n133\n00:05:53.502 --> 00:05:58.270\nAnd I can go in, and I can click here to\nsee if there are state change events.\n\n134\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.170\nAnd what's happening in\nsee historical record\n\n135\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.970\nof all the faces of\nthe systems been doing from.\n\n136\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.080\nYes I'm healthy and perhaps I have\na problem to back to healthy again.\n\n137\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.256\nI could look individual entries,\nessentially like reading a log.\n\n138\n00:06:11.256 --> 00:06:15.243\nI could see what's been happening\novertime just by immigrating clicking\n\n139\n00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:17.510\nthrough here to tract this view.\n\n140\n00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.510\nSo I can use those capabilities right\nout of this dashboard view, right?\n\n141\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.030\nThis portal,\nI can use the integrated tools right here.\n\n142\n00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.710\nThese are interactive elements, they're\nnot just flat reflecting information\n\n143\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.860\nwithout the ability to interact.\n\n144\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.540\nBut rather, they are interactive, and\n\n145\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.750\nwe have the ability to drill\ndown here as a result.\n\n146\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.543\nSo are you ready?\n\n147\n00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:37.965\n&gt;&gt; I'm ready.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, are you excited?\n\n148\n00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:39.536\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go.\n\n149\n00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:41.755\nSo this is the view that Cherokee likes,\nright?\n\n150\n00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:43.100\nThe one that we were talking about.\n\n151\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.198\nThis is the all up view for\nthe management group.\n\n152\n00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:47.163\n&gt;&gt; But there is so much more to that,\nit's not just kinda-\n\n153\n00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:48.172\n&gt;&gt; I'm just really, you got it.\n\n154\n00:06:48.172 --> 00:06:51.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, but I'm like there,\nlooking at it, no like wait, what?\n\n155\n00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:53.810\n&gt;&gt; You got it, you got it right.\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm segwaying into this.\n\n156\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.559\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n157\n00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.290\nWould you like to drive, perhaps I could.\n\n158\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.415\n&gt;&gt; No, you're the expert.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you wanna, no,\n\n159\n00:06:57.415 --> 00:06:59.000\ncome over here really, I insist.\n\n160\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.716\nLet's have you do this,\nbecause you're so excited.\n\n161\n00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So why don't you come over here.\n\n162\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.286\n&gt;&gt; Okay, my microphone is barely reaching.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't go all the way, okay?\n\n163\n00:07:04.286 --> 00:07:05.832\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm good.\n&gt;&gt; So wait, let me do this, all right, so\n\n164\n00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:07.000\nnow you're gonna be able to click.\n\n165\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.303\nThat's right, I got it, go ahead,\na little extra slack there.\n\n166\n00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:12.256\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if I can do it then that\nmeans, you guys, you can do this.\n\n167\n00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:13.470\n&gt;&gt; So now I'm wrapped around you,\nso you're not gonna move.\n\n168\n00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.080\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm definitely not\na system center administrator.\n\n169\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.654\n&gt;&gt; So just click on one of\nthe things to show them what we do.\n\n170\n00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:18.608\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, so\n\n171\n00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:22.800\nyou can get all kind of different\ntypes of analytic information here.\n\n172\n00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.339\n&gt;&gt; Hi, mom.\n\n173\n00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.847\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:07:23.847 --> 00:07:25.718\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna stand here cuz\n\n175\n00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.710\nI'm wrapping my microphone cord\naround you if I [INAUDIBLE].\n\n176\n00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.408\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nI see our individual machines here.\n\n177\n00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.100\nI'm still drilling down.\n\n178\n00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.258\n&gt;&gt; So you can drill down.\n\n179\n00:07:32.258 --> 00:07:36.214\n&gt;&gt; And scrolling down here, all right.\n\n180\n00:07:36.214 --> 00:07:38.380\nLet me see can I make this a full view?\n\n181\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.144\nJust keep drilling down here.\n\n182\n00:07:40.144 --> 00:07:41.804\nWhat kind of information\nare we going to get, okay.\n\n183\n00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.908\nAll right.\n\n184\n00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:50.639\nAdam's trying to whisper, but you guys-\n&gt;&gt; So I will narrate while Cherokee\n\n185\n00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.772\ndrives, so what we're seeing\nis that she drills through.\n\n186\n00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:56.490\nWhat you're watching is you can\nsee she's clicking on the items.\n\n187\n00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.188\nBut you can see that as\nwe look down below, and\n\n188\n00:07:58.188 --> 00:07:59.931\nwe're looking as she's highlighting them,\n\n189\n00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.987\nwe're seeing the properties of all\nthe information that she's highlighting.\n\n190\n00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:06.458\nAnd the nice thing, Cherokee loves about\nthis view, right, when we've demoed it\n\n191\n00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:09.385\nbefore in some of the other episodes\nis she's able to examine and see,\n\n192\n00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:13.035\nnot just individual components, but the\nholistic view, right, the entire system.\n\n193\n00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:14.445\n&gt;&gt; The relationship, yep.\n\n194\n00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:16.288\n&gt;&gt; You're seeing everything,\nwhich is really kinda cool.\n\n195\n00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:19.362\nAnd if she scrolls around and\nkinda scrolls up, and we different areas.\n\n196\n00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:22.615\nClick under Web User Interfaces there,\nfor instance open that up.\n\n197\n00:08:22.615 --> 00:08:25.815\nYou'll see as you scroll down,\nwe have the reporting server interface.\n\n198\n00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:27.635\nWe've got the web console there.\n\n199\n00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.205\nAnd the green circles with the,\nor the white circle,\n\n200\n00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.130\ngreen check indicates health, right?\n\n201\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.150\nAnd so we could see everything is,\nhopefully anyway, everything is healthy.\n\n202\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.880\nWe can also see, just scroll over a little\nbit to the right if you wanna see it,\n\n203\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.560\nyeah it's at the very end.\n\n204\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.440\nAnd you could see the web console is there\nas well, and each one of these is gonna\n\n205\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.375\ngive us a health status and a component,\nand if we want to, this is the cool part.\n\n206\n00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:49.725\nIf we want to be able to see that she's\ngonna be able to click on that URI,\n\n207\n00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:50.655\nclick Yes.\n\n208\n00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:54.145\nAnd it's gonna open up directly or\nindirectly and launch the console.\n\n209\n00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:56.695\nWe have to sign in but\nit's gonna launch it right from there.\n\n210\n00:08:56.695 --> 00:08:58.607\nSo this is a totally integrated view.\n\n211\n00:08:58.607 --> 00:09:01.918\nThat allows us not just to see,\nthe holistic information, but\n\n212\n00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:05.115\nit allows us to go in,\nthat's the console you're in there.\n\n213\n00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:10.056\nAllows us to see actual moving parts,\ncheck status off in real time, and\n\n214\n00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:11.920\ninteract as you can see.\n\n215\n00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.350\nIn this case with the web console.\n\n216\n00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.419\nDirectly from the property element\nof that object on the screen.\n\n217\n00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:16.956\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hi-five.\n\n218\n00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:19.510\n&gt;&gt; Hi-five, pretty cool stuff,\nright, yeah, you're good,\n\n219\n00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.910\nI made sure we were\ndisentangled before moved over.\n\n220\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.690\nAnd so you can see that one of the reasons\nwe're excited about a view like this is\n\n221\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.570\nit's so interactive we could do so\nmuch with it.\n\n222\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.820\nAnd its got some really cool features,\nright.\n\n223\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.660\nWe know we have to run Silverlight for\nthe console.\n\n224\n00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.640\nIt's just reminding us we may have\nan update out there for Silverlight.\n\n225\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.650\nSo you may go in and find you get a prompt\nlike that if you open the web console,\n\n226\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.710\njust so you know.\n\n227\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.210\nSo we have this kind of view and we can\nobviously move around, interact in there.\n\n228\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.752\nDo a bunch of different stuff.\n\n229\n00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:46.900\nNow we're also talking\nabout just going back and\n\n230\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.310\nquickly reminding ourselves of run as\naccounts and what they're used for.\n\n231\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.790\nSo we're gonna go into\nthe Administration space here,\n\n232\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.170\njust take a look at something we've talked\nabout before, which was the accounts,\n\n233\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.760\nthe profiles, you saw me create these,\nwe went through in some prior episodes.\n\n234\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.190\nWhat I just wanted to show you was,\nif we actually have to create a brand new\n\n235\n00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.720\naccount from scratch, right-click, come\ndown here, we did New User Roles already.\n\n236\n00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.349\nBut if we do a run as account, I just\nwanna show you the different kinds of\n\n237\n00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:14.027\naccounts, the account types\nthat we support here.\n\n238\n00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:16.340\nSo let's just move this over,\nwe'll click Next on our first screen.\n\n239\n00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.721\nAnd then run as account type.\n\n240\n00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.550\nSo we pull down and we look at the list.\n\n241\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.860\nAnd if we can go full-screen for just\na minute it may be easier to see that.\n\n242\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.660\nIt's a little bit hard to see from,\n\n243\n00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.080\nout in the far reaches there of ITProTv\nwatcher land, you could see we have\n\n244\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.560\nthe Window's credential there at\nthe top of the list default choice.\n\n245\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.482\nThat's gonna be used most likely for\nWindow's based computers.\n\n246\n00:10:35.482 --> 00:10:38.035\nWe have a community string\njust going down the list here.\n\n247\n00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:41.865\nThe community string is used for\nSNMP version two systems,\n\n248\n00:10:41.865 --> 00:10:44.875\nmeaning SNMP,\nSimple Network Management Protocol,\n\n249\n00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.835\nwe have different versions\nof the protocol, V1, V2, V3.\n\n250\n00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:52.642\nWe don't use V1 anymore,\nnot secure, transmits in the open,\n\n251\n00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:55.590\nno encryption, don't wanna do that.\n\n252\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.979\nSNMP V2 and or V3,\nyou'll see SNMP V3 at the very bottom,\n\n253\n00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:02.437\nare recommended because there\nis security attached to that,\n\n254\n00:11:02.437 --> 00:11:07.177\nwe do encrypt the traffic it is gonna be\nauthenticated, a little bit more involved.\n\n255\n00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:11.317\nSo SNMPV2 community string is used\nwith version two of the protocol.\n\n256\n00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:14.132\nBasic simple digest and\nbinary authentication,\n\n257\n00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.985\nkinda going in order there.\n\n258\n00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:19.335\nStandard authentication mechanisms\nfrom traditional websites if we're\n\n259\n00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:20.495\nfamiliar with that.\n\n260\n00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:23.693\nBasic authentication,\nstandard basic web based authentication.\n\n261\n00:11:23.693 --> 00:11:26.475\nSimple authentication,\nstandard user name and password.\n\n262\n00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:31.360\nNothing special, digest authentication,\ndigest-based authentication for a web.\n\n263\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.504\nBinary authentication is simply a fancy\nway of saying user-defined authentication,\n\n264\n00:11:35.504 --> 00:11:36.179\nuser choice.\n\n265\n00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:38.866\nIn other words we'll provide credentials,\nmost likely.\n\n266\n00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:39.843\nAction account,\n\n267\n00:11:39.843 --> 00:11:43.955\nWindows credential that's assigned\nonly to the action account profile.\n\n268\n00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:46.545\nIt's used just for\nthe specific thing we're defining.\n\n269\n00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:52.399\nAnd SMPB3 is gonna be used for the use\nof an SNMP3 based monitoring solution.\n\n270\n00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:54.525\nSo depending on what we chose here,\nwe may or\n\n271\n00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:58.086\nmay not be asked to make different\nchoices and provide different things,\n\n272\n00:11:58.086 --> 00:12:01.947\njust as you see I'm kind of clicking\nthrough, making one choice for the other.\n\n273\n00:12:01.947 --> 00:12:03.897\nWe will go in and specify this.\n\n274\n00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:07.093\nWe would then finish the wizard,\nand when we're done,\n\n275\n00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.816\nwe then would be able to\nhave our Run As account.\n\n276\n00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:13.898\nAnd you know that our Run As accounts,\nas you've seen, and some of the other walk\n\n277\n00:12:13.898 --> 00:12:18.003\nthroughs where we have had to provide\na credential to do something like install.\n\n278\n00:12:19.243 --> 00:12:21.143\nWhether it's the monitoring agent,\n\n279\n00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:24.813\nor in the monitoring that we are spinning\nup inside the management packs with\n\n280\n00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:27.893\nthe overrides, perhaps provide\na Run As account to do that.\n\n281\n00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:30.360\nWe use Run As accounts for\na variety of things, so.\n\n282\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.450\nJust make sure you're aware\nof the thought process.\n\n283\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.850\nWe have a sense of that and\nwhy that may be so important.\n\n284\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.060\nwe've talked about overrides extensively.\n\n285\n00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.974\nWe've talked about the ideas of\nthe management pack, gone through, taken\n\n286\n00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:45.088\na look at how to create the objects and\nassociate them with the management pack.\n\n287\n00:12:45.088 --> 00:12:48.703\nWe've also taken a look at and shown you\nin the last episode a little bit about\n\n288\n00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:52.662\ngoing through and doing different kinds of\ndiscovery in terms of Windows computers\n\n289\n00:12:52.662 --> 00:12:54.860\nand those computers on network devices.\n\n290\n00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.740\nWe went through and talked about that.\n\n291\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.410\nLooking at and\nthinking about how to discover and\n\n292\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.540\nto address network devices, right.\n\n293\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.500\nIt's always important.\n\n294\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.509\nI just wanna show you here.\n\n295\n00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:07.700\nI'm just gonna go through, and\nrerun that wizard one more time.\n\n296\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.670\nBut let me focus on and choose The Network\nDiscovery option, Discovery Wizard.\n\n297\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.830\nAnd instead of doing the Windows\ncomputers, which you saw me do,\n\n298\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.450\nto be able to push the Windows console,\nor thorough the Windows console,\n\n299\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.950\npush the managing monitor agent client.\n\n300\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.260\nLet's use Network Devices,\nyou'll see this changes a little bit here.\n\n301\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.876\nWhen we choose this,\nwe'll have to provide a name.\n\n302\n00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:34.259\nWe'll have to choose a network or\nmanagement server.\n\n303\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.800\nYou'll see here we have to\nselect a resource pool.\n\n304\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.440\nWe have our default resource\npools that are available to us.\n\n305\n00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.620\nWe could choose the all management\nservice resource pool or\n\n306\n00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.050\none that's been customized.\n\n307\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.330\nRemember we have, or\n\n308\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.730\nmay have, created a resource pool specific\nto things like Unix and Linux servers.\n\n309\n00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.883\nWe talked about this in one\nof the earlier episodes.\n\n310\n00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:57.602\nWe may have the standard default one for\nthe Windows servers.\n\n311\n00:13:57.602 --> 00:14:01.341\nWe may create a separate one,\nthat will have infrastructures specific to\n\n312\n00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.754\nmonitoring network devices,\nand as a result,\n\n313\n00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:07.575\nWe may have a resource pool called\nnetwork devices and we'll use that one.\n\n314\n00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:11.006\nIt's just a collection of the servers\nthat we're gonna use for monitoring,\n\n315\n00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:12.770\nthat's what we're looking at.\n\n316\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.963\nSo we have our different options here and\nwe'll choose, as I said, the default one.\n\n317\n00:14:16.963 --> 00:14:19.855\nWe'll come In here,\nexplicit over cursive discovery methods.\n\n318\n00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:22.605\nThis is one of the things I just\nwanted to draw you out on and\n\n319\n00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:23.445\nexplain a little bit about.\n\n320\n00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:27.164\nYou'll see operations manager will\ndiscover only the network devices you\n\n321\n00:14:27.164 --> 00:14:31.191\nspecify, explicit, say hey, I want\nthese devices and let's enumerate them.\n\n322\n00:14:31.191 --> 00:14:35.263\nOr recursive, OpsManager discovers\nyour devices that you specify, and\n\n323\n00:14:35.263 --> 00:14:38.820\nall devices that are connected\nto the devices that you specify.\n\n324\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.109\nMeaning, we'll recurse through,\nor iterate through,\n\n325\n00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:44.799\nthe actual discovery of\nthe explicit devices.\n\n326\n00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:47.550\nAnd then we'll actually draw through,\nby doing that,\n\n327\n00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.315\nall the devices connected to them.\n\n328\n00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:54.365\nSo imagine that we're discovering through\nnetwork discovery a switch or a router.\n\n329\n00:14:54.365 --> 00:14:57.030\nIf we do explicit discovery,\nwe would only find that device.\n\n330\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.350\nIf we do recursive discovery\nwe would do the device and\n\n331\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.680\nthen all the downstream objects\nthat are connected around it.\n\n332\n00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.680\nAnd we would build a much broader\npicture of what the network looks like\n\n333\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.420\nas a result.\n\n334\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.290\nWhich gives us obviously a lot more\nflexibility to better understand\n\n335\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.130\nour topology to do monitoring.\n\n336\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.940\nSo we would think through\nthe logic of that.\n\n337\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.970\nThen specify the Run As accounts.\n\n338\n00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.300\nHere's yet another reason\nwhy we need Run As accounts.\n\n339\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.460\nEither create one or we'll have one there.\n\n340\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.190\nWe would select it, obviously.\n\n341\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.446\nSo, let's just go through,\ncreate a Run As account real quick.\n\n342\n00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:28.990\nNo big deal.\n\n343\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.409\nJust specify what it is,\nnotice by the way community string,\n\n344\n00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:36.380\nthat's an SNPV2 running as an account\nremember we talked about that.\n\n345\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.140\nThat'll be for version two.\n\n346\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.020\nThe reason there that we default to\nversion two by the way, all SNPV based\n\n347\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.330\ndevices will support version but they\nmight not all be running version three.\n\n348\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.823\nMeaning the newer devices will\ncertainly support version three but\n\n349\n00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:52.089\nbe able to be compatible\nwith version two But\n\n350\n00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:55.226\nan older device may not have\nversion three support enabled.\n\n351\n00:15:55.226 --> 00:15:59.145\nAnd so if we default it to version three,\nwe may shut out those older devices\n\n352\n00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:02.880\nthat are not able to understand\nthe version three of the protocol.\n\n353\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.950\nBut everything supports version two,\nit's been around forever and a day, right?\n\n354\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.140\nSo we'd specify our community string.\n\n355\n00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.700\nI'm just gonna type in\na generic community string.\n\n356\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.785\n&gt;&gt; And this is kind of like,\nif I am thinking correct,\n\n357\n00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.489\nit's like a rudimentary password here?\n\n358\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.550\n&gt;&gt; It is a password, let's just say that.\n\n359\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.730\nIt's essentially what you just described,\nit's just the connection string we provide\n\n360\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.030\nto be able to authenticate\nin to the device and\n\n361\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.420\nmanage it at whatever\nlevel we're specified at.\n\n362\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.252\nSo whether it's public, private, password,\nMickey Mouse, whatever you specify,\n\n363\n00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:35.180\nthat's what the community string will be.\n\n364\n00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.290\nSo I'm just gonna put something in\nthere for demonstration purposes,\n\n365\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.580\nclick Create here, we now have our account\nwe could specify and use that one.\n\n366\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.010\nIf there was a list of\nrun as accounts dedicated\n\n367\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.470\nunder the community string\ntype that have been created,\n\n368\n00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.730\nI would already see those populated here,\nI just don't have any by default.\n\n369\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.170\nThat's why we're taking the opportunity\nto create one for you really quickly.\n\n370\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.660\nWe'll click Next, specify devices.\n\n371\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.090\nNow this is where because I'm doing\nexplicit, I can import a device list, or\n\n372\n00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.000\nI can add them in,\n\n373\n00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.490\nas you can see here, from a discovery\nthat may have already been done.\n\n374\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.070\nMy choice, my call, right?\n\n375\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.335\nSo if I have the ability or decide that I\nwant to be able to import, I can do this.\n\n376\n00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:15.285\nI just have to go find a text\nfile that is listing all of them,\n\n377\n00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.675\nand it's just a matter of\nimporting device names.\n\n378\n00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:21.523\nIf I decide that I wanna add,\nI'm just gonna go in,\n\n379\n00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:26.446\nI'm gonna specify the IP address or\nname, and then access mode,\n\n380\n00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:31.743\nright, ICMP and SNP, ICMP only,\nSNP only, and what version of SNP.\n\n381\n00:17:31.743 --> 00:17:35.630\nAnd then, what Run As account and\nwhat port, how I'm gonna connect.\n\n382\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.330\nSo this is where I program in\nthe specificity of being able to do that.\n\n383\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.500\nAnd so I'm able to go in and\nspecify all these things here.\n\n384\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.510\nI do have advanced discovery settings.\n\n385\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.290\nI can go in and specify things like\nretry temps and time out values for\n\n386\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.410\nthe SNP connect string,\njust some things I may tweak, right?\n\n387\n00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.400\nSo I just wanted you to see this because\nthen once I've added in my explicit\n\n388\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.700\ndiscovered devices, I simply schedule\nthe discovery for when I want it to run.\n\n389\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.968\nSo I may not want this to run in\nproduction in the middle of the day.\n\n390\n00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:04.790\nMaybe I wanna go out and\ndo this overnight,\n\n391\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.650\nduring a servicing window, where I've\ngot the ability to be able to align this\n\n392\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.760\nwith a downtime in the network, right?\n\n393\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.380\nSo I'm gonna be able to schedule that out,\nand then it will just run, and\n\n394\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.100\nonce it's run, at some point of course,\nwhenever we run it.\n\n395\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.720\nWe then will be able to see up under\nnetwork devices, as we talked about,\n\n396\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.670\nthe output of that discovery, and\nwe would see whatever's there.\n\n397\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.150\nSo we actually can schedule those things\nand have them run when necessary,\n\n398\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.280\nwhen we decide to, and have them populate\nfor us whenever we see the value or\n\n399\n00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.600\nthe need to do so.\n\n400\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.710\nJust be aware of that.\n\n401\n00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.660\nWe can view the network devices that\nare connected there, of course, and\n\n402\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.960\nsee them inside of this area.\n\n403\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.890\nWhat about connecting?\n\n404\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.558\nSpeaking of connecting,\nwhat about connecting [COUGH] SCOMs,\n\n405\n00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:45.325\nthat's not our ops manager, and\nsome of that other real estate,\n\n406\n00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:47.961\nsome of that infrastructure\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n407\n00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.828\nWe spend a lot of time in SCVMM early on,\nwanna go in and show you quickly how to\n\n408\n00:18:51.828 --> 00:18:54.979\nhook up the SCVMM console to SCOM,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n409\n00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:59.200\nAlso what about connecting the cell to\nDPM, Data Protection Manager, right,\n\n410\n00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.602\nthe idea of using another component\nin the System Center Suite,\n\n411\n00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:05.636\nthe one that does our Enterprise\nlevel backups for VCVR.\n\n412\n00:19:05.636 --> 00:19:09.139\nThis is continuity and disaster recovery,\nhow do we connect those things up, and\n\n413\n00:19:09.139 --> 00:19:10.014\nhow do we link them?\n\n414\n00:19:10.014 --> 00:19:11.210\nWe'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n415\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.350\nBefore we do that, I promised you a quick\nlittle peak under the hood at reporting.\n\n416\n00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.016\nSo let's just,\nsince we're in here already,\n\n417\n00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:18.338\nlet's go take a look at the workspace,\nsee what's there.\n\n418\n00:19:18.338 --> 00:19:20.780\nThen we'll just flip over\nto the SCVMM console, and\n\n419\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.550\nwe'll show you how to drive the wizard\nthrough the integration here.\n\n420\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.410\nSo in the reporting piece, so let's\njust take a look at our architecture,\n\n421\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.610\nremind ourselves of what we're doing.\n\n422\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.020\nWe're right over here,\nwe're up in the Ops Console.\n\n423\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.510\nYou saw the web console a couple of\nminutes ago when Cherokee launched\n\n424\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.270\nit for us.\n\n425\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.080\nWe're in the Ops Console, we're connecting\ninto our resource pool, our primary server\n\n426\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.270\nin the resource pool is simply just\nthe first one that we're connected into.\n\n427\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.590\nSo we're connected into this main server.\n\n428\n00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.300\nAnd we're about to look at reportings\nbeing driven through the reporting server.\n\n429\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.250\nSo how are we gonna interact with and\nuse the console to connect to and\n\n430\n00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.510\nrun reports against the reporting server\nout of the Ops Manager Data Warehouse?\n\n431\n00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.378\nThat's what we're looking at right now or\nabout to discuss.\n\n432\n00:20:00.378 --> 00:20:04.173\nAnd you'll see that we have\na variety of different reports here,\n\n433\n00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:07.890\nlet me just kinda move this up and\nsee the categories here.\n\n434\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:14.720\nAnd you can see that we have, The ability\nto look at different kinds of reports.\n\n435\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.069\nI just clicked on the network\nmanagement reports category.\n\n436\n00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:21.140\nAnd I've got five or\nsix different reports listed there.\n\n437\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:26.690\nIf I go in and I look at\nthe Microsoft Generic Report Library,\n\n438\n00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.620\nI've just got all the monitoring reports,\ngenerically things like how\n\n439\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.770\nmany overrides do I have and things of\nthat nature on my management packs.\n\n440\n00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.130\nIf I look at System Center Core Monitoring\nReports, I can look at agent count,\n\n441\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.825\nagents by health state, data volume\nby management pack, things like that.\n\n442\n00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:45.250\nAnd so for instance,\nif I look at agents by health state and\n\n443\n00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.494\nI click on this report, and\nI launch it, it takes just a minute.\n\n444\n00:20:48.494 --> 00:20:50.647\nThese are all the pre made,\npre built reports.\n\n445\n00:20:50.647 --> 00:20:53.738\nWe could build our own reports\nusing the report designer tool.\n\n446\n00:20:53.738 --> 00:20:55.830\nWe can also build them in Visual Studio.\n\n447\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.210\nAnd we're using the backend\nSQL Server Reporting Services interface\n\n448\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.260\nto run reports, so it's standardized\nacross the platform wherever we go.\n\n449\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.260\nAnd so you'll see we have the states\nthat we're looking for here.\n\n450\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.010\nWe have to choose objects on\nthis side to run the report.\n\n451\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.500\nEvery report is a little bit different.\n\n452\n00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.990\nIt has different data elements we\nmay have to pre-populate and, or\n\n453\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.480\nwe may have to select as we go.\n\n454\n00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.880\nSo every report will look slightly\ndifferently while we're going in here.\n\n455\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.750\nSo let's add a group in here real quick.\n\n456\n00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.354\nAnd when we search, we're just looking for\ndifferent elements,\n\n457\n00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:31.615\nwe're gonna wanna go in and\nlet's go down here.\n\n458\n00:21:31.615 --> 00:21:38.622\nAnd let's take a look at,\nAll Windows computers,\n\n459\n00:21:38.622 --> 00:21:43.518\nor actually all management server\nresources in the resource pool.\n\n460\n00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:48.243\nLet's just take a look at that one, and\nyeah, we'll take a look at that one,\n\n461\n00:21:48.243 --> 00:21:50.200\nadd that in there.\n\n462\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.870\nAnd we'll click OK, all right.\n\n463\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.670\nAnd then if we run the report,\ndepending on whether we have enough\n\n464\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.700\ndata in the data warehouse to populate the\nreport, we will get back results or not.\n\n465\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.580\nBut my point is just to show you what\nwe would see and how this would work.\n\n466\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.300\nAgents by health state,\nright, if we scroll down,\n\n467\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.300\nwe have different graded values for\nhealth.\n\n468\n00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:17.521\nHere, we would see unavailable, critical,\nwarning, and down at the bottom, success.\n\n469\n00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:21.379\nAnd depending on again, if we've\ngenerated enough data historically over\n\n470\n00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:24.873\nenough time to be able to query\nthe date warehouse and find that data,\n\n471\n00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:28.640\nreturn it back to the report,\nwe would see indications of that here.\n\n472\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.180\nNow I know for a fact, we do have\nresources in the resource pool servers,\n\n473\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.580\nin other words, that are being monitored.\n\n474\n00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.170\nAnd they are, for the most part, healthy.\n\n475\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.060\nThey've only been running for less than\nan hour inside the demo environment,\n\n476\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.510\neven though we're going episode to\nepisode, you think it takes a while.\n\n477\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.430\nWe've actually just had them up and\nrunning for a few minutes to get ready for\n\n478\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.290\nthis episode.\n\n479\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.210\nSo there's not enough time that's\nelapsed to actually generate data\n\n480\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.720\nto run a report like this.\n\n481\n00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.720\nYou typically have to have at least 24\nhours worth of data sitting in the system\n\n482\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.530\nto start to generate values\nthat will show up in reports.\n\n483\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.510\nBut you get the idea.\n\n484\n00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.430\nWe would easily then be able to\npopulate these, and by category,\n\n485\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.090\nwe'll be able to see what's there.\n\n486\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.210\nSo all of our standard SQL reports\nare gonna be available to us\n\n487\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.808\nfrom within this interface.\n\n488\n00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:11.090\nIf we wanna add our own reports,\ncustomize them in other words, right,\n\n489\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.490\nbuild them out, we could do that as well.\n\n490\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.629\nYou'll see down here, authored reports,\nwe can actually go in and\n\n491\n00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:18.400\nwrite our own reports as I suggested.\n\n492\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.476\nUsing the report builder tool and, or\nVisual Studio or a variety of other tools\n\n493\n00:23:22.476 --> 00:23:25.820\nthat may be valuable for\nus to be able to generate reports.\n\n494\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.080\nImport them here, and\nthen make them available.\n\n495\n00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.700\nYou had wanted to ask something.\n\n496\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Adam, should I be concerned\nwith the amount of traffic\n\n497\n00:23:33.223 --> 00:23:37.510\nthat's being generated from these reports,\ndue to that communication?\n\n498\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.888\n&gt;&gt; The communication between\nthe report server, the SSRS instance,\n\n499\n00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:46.203\nthe data warehouse, and\nthe management server, that's stuff?\n\n500\n00:23:46.203 --> 00:23:46.765\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n501\n00:23:46.765 --> 00:23:50.314\n&gt;&gt; Will I ever see these reports start\nto accumulate and get rather large, and\n\n502\n00:23:50.314 --> 00:23:51.962\nthen start to bog down my network?\n\n503\n00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:55.237\nOr is there anything I should be aware\nof to prevent that from happening,\n\n504\n00:23:55.237 --> 00:23:56.107\nor will it happen?\n\n505\n00:23:56.107 --> 00:23:58.900\nNo, it will not happen,\nthese reports will only run on demand.\n\n506\n00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.779\nMeaning, until I went and\nactually trigger that report and\n\n507\n00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:04.350\nsaid give me this time frame,\nor this range of data.\n\n508\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.150\nFor this object throw\nup in this report and\n\n509\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.270\nshowed to me, the data is\naggregated in the data warehouse.\n\n510\n00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.941\nBut we're not actively-\n&gt;&gt; Constantly\n\n511\n00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:13.444\n&gt;&gt; Running reports behind the scenes\n\n512\n00:24:13.444 --> 00:24:13.963\nconstantly.\n\n513\n00:24:13.963 --> 00:24:15.774\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; So we're not gonna worry about that.\n\n514\n00:24:15.774 --> 00:24:18.881\nThe data warehouse is under load because\nit is constantly being fed data.\n\n515\n00:24:18.881 --> 00:24:22.069\nWe are updating and doing things there but\nuntil we run reports,\n\n516\n00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:24.856\nthe reports themselves are just\nobjects that sit idle.\n\n517\n00:24:24.856 --> 00:24:26.940\nEssentially, until we use them on-demand.\n\n518\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.850\nSo, no,\nthat part we don't need to worry about.\n\n519\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.270\nWhich is a good thing, and obviously\nimportant to be aligned with and aware of.\n\n520\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.160\nAll right, so let's flip over here to\nthe System Center Virtual Machine Manager\n\n521\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.350\ninterface, I got that running right here.\n\n522\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.050\nThis console may look familiar to you,\nthose of you that have been on this\n\n523\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.370\njourney with us through prior episodes,\nyou'll remember FCVMM.\n\n524\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.175\nWe're in our Settings area,\nas you hopefully can see.\n\n525\n00:24:47.175 --> 00:24:51.925\nwe're in the system center settings, and\nwe have the ops manager server item here.\n\n526\n00:24:51.925 --> 00:24:53.545\nWhen we went to integrate SCVM and\n\n527\n00:24:53.545 --> 00:24:57.745\nops manager together we do this\nintegration from the SCVM side.\n\n528\n00:24:57.745 --> 00:25:00.637\nSo we go, you obviously have ops\nmanager stood up and ready to go.\n\n529\n00:25:00.637 --> 00:25:03.647\nWe come over here to the SCVMM side,\nwe see this.\n\n530\n00:25:03.647 --> 00:25:05.527\nWe right click, go to Properties.\n\n531\n00:25:06.807 --> 00:25:09.787\nWe do have, and let me just move\nthis over so you can see it here.\n\n532\n00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:12.397\nWe do have some prereqs that have\nto be installed, configured, and\n\n533\n00:25:12.397 --> 00:25:14.547\navailable on the ops manager side.\n\n534\n00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:17.247\nSo we just wanna make sure we have\ncertain things available to us.\n\n535\n00:25:17.247 --> 00:25:18.837\nWe need to have certain credentials.\n\n536\n00:25:18.837 --> 00:25:21.830\nAn account which is a member of\nthe ops manager admin user role.\n\n537\n00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.860\nSo we'd have to have\nan account that has that,\n\n538\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.820\nan account which is a member of\nthe VMM Admin User role as well.\n\n539\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.400\nSo we need full admin rights on\nboth sides of the divide here to\n\n540\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.360\nbe able to create the connection\nthat links the two.\n\n541\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.480\nSo important for us to know.\n\n542\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.810\nIn terms of management pack on the Ops\nmanager side, there's some specificity\n\n543\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:40.260\nbased on certain build levels\nthat has to be addressed here.\n\n544\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.770\nLook at the interface window\nfull screen for just a second.\n\n545\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.570\nYou'll get a slightly better shot of it.\n\n546\n00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.320\nI've put this in the show notes as well.\n\n547\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.770\nSo It's captured there for you.\n\n548\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.790\nYou can obviously\nreference that there also.\n\n549\n00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:55.520\nBut you'll see SQL Server core\nlibrary version 6.0, 500.0 or later.\n\n550\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.360\nWindows Server IES library version 6 2003,\nand or 2008 IES version 7.\n\n551\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.320\nSo, just wanna make sure you\nhave the specifics there.\n\n552\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.540\nThis is all in the ops manager side.\n\n553\n00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.320\nOps manager console\ninstalled on the VMM server.\n\n554\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.330\nSo we're going to need to make\nsure as I get out of this just for\n\n555\n00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.590\na second,\nthat we have the apps manager console.\n\n556\n00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.290\nYou can see the icon for it right there.\n\n557\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.420\nWe have the ops manager console\nalready installed on the VMM server.\n\n558\n00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.540\nSo that will give us the capabilities and\nthe information and\n\n559\n00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.934\nthe software tie ins that we\nneed to be able to run against.\n\n560\n00:26:27.934 --> 00:26:29.730\nSo that we can administer.\n\n561\n00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.640\nSo we're gonna be able to do this.\n\n562\n00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.853\nSo we'll just go back in here,\nright click Properties, click Next.\n\n563\n00:26:33.853 --> 00:26:36.234\nWe then have to specify\nthe name of the server,\n\n564\n00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:38.260\nthe op server that we wanna connect to.\n\n565\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:44.269\nSo plab sys 01 is practicelabs.com,\n\n566\n00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:48.310\nthe name of the server.\n\n567\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.560\nYou'll see we have to use the VMM server\nservice account or Run As account again.\n\n568\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.200\nValue of the Run As accounts help us to\nunderstand how to do this, specify that.\n\n569\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.380\nThen are we enabling performance and\nresource optimization which is called pro?\n\n570\n00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.940\nAnd are we enabling\nmaintenance mode integration?\n\n571\n00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.190\nMeaning the SCVMN and\nops manager can talk and\n\n572\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.330\nwe can put a system that SCVMN needs\nto deal with into maintenance mode.\n\n573\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.370\nBecause ops management kick that\noff four space on monitoring.\n\n574\n00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.320\nSo we're tying this two\nvery closely together.\n\n575\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.470\nSo when we do this click next,\n\n576\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.510\nwe don't have to specify the configuration\nfrom apps manager to VMM again.\n\n577\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.850\nSpecify the credential\ngoing the other way.\n\n578\n00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:30.360\nSo we would do the same thing here,\npractice labs is our domain.\n\n579\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.240\nForward slash the name of the account,\n\n580\n00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.450\neach account is one side of the divider,\nwe use both.\n\n581\n00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:41.420\nSo it's specify that here, specify our\npassword and then we will click next and\n\n582\n00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.280\nfinish up.\n\n583\n00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.510\nAnd then we're actually able to see\nthese two combined and connect it right,\n\n584\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.610\nso we'd be able to do that.\n\n585\n00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.370\nAnd once that's done again you know\nview the script, take a look at and\n\n586\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.980\nsee what it's like, right?\n\n587\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.090\nThat will take a wall and run.\n\n588\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.140\nNot gonna bother picking them up.\n\n589\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.370\nNow it takes a few minutes to actually\ngo through and do it all but,\n\n590\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.540\nI just wanted to show you the general\nidea about how we link this up.\n\n591\n00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.150\nNow with regards to DPM,\nData Protection Manager, and\n\n592\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.420\nhow we actually are gonna integrate\ndata protection management SCOM.\n\n593\n00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.980\nI wanna say a word about that but before\nwe get there, what about setting up and\n\n594\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.290\nusing the system center management\npack for virtual machine manager?\n\n595\n00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.580\nIn other words,\nwe've connected the two but\n\n596\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.020\nwe can monitor SCVMM itself from\nSCOM to make sure it's healthy.\n\n597\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.830\nWe have a management pack for that,\nit's called the VMM Fabric dashboard or\n\n598\n00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.430\nFabric monitoring pack.\n\n599\n00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.720\nSo let's just, quickly say a few words or\n\n600\n00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.860\nthink about that while we're getting\nready to talk about DPM here.\n\n601\n00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.410\nSo we can go in, we have to have done\nthis integration already VMM and\n\n602\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.440\nSCOM have to be connected for\nus to use this management pack.\n\n603\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.747\nWe then go download the management\npack from Microsoft.\n\n604\n00:28:40.747 --> 00:28:43.060\nWe talk about how do you\ndo that from the catalog.\n\n605\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.670\nWe import it, so either directly import to\nthe console, or download import from disk.\n\n606\n00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.800\nOnce we do that we get some\nadditional views inside SCOM.\n\n607\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.270\nThe cloud health views,\nit gonna monitor the cloud health for\n\n608\n00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.810\nall the clouds that are available here.\n\n609\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:00.010\nIf you remember when we go in,\ntake a look at VMs and services,\n\n610\n00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.999\nI will create a private\nclouds as you seen us do.\n\n611\n00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:05.920\nWe 've talk that in\nprior episodes in SCVMM.\n\n612\n00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.790\nWhen we put together all\nof our resources and\n\n613\n00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.210\nset up the cloud,\nwe can monitor those clouds from SCOM.\n\n614\n00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.670\nFabric health dashboard and\nfabric monitoring will be available to us.\n\n615\n00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:19.025\nSo, remember the fabric, right, over here,\nis made up of three distinct parts.\n\n616\n00:29:19.025 --> 00:29:19.811\nIt's in SCVMM.\n\n617\n00:29:19.811 --> 00:29:24.305\nWe have our servers, we have our\nnetworking, and we have our storage.\n\n618\n00:29:24.305 --> 00:29:26.845\nThose are the three component\nparts that make up the fabric.\n\n619\n00:29:26.845 --> 00:29:30.655\nWe're gonna be able to step through and\nmonitor all those and have dashboard views\n\n620\n00:29:30.655 --> 00:29:34.490\nand monitoring capabilities in SCOM\nwhen we integrate this monitoring pack.\n\n621\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.490\nSo just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n622\n00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:40.130\nThe key catalyst step here would be\nthat integration between SCOM and\n\n623\n00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.450\nSVMM that I was just talking about and\nshowing you how to kick off.\n\n624\n00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.520\nWith regards to data\nprotection monitoring and\n\n625\n00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.140\nintegrating SCOM with DPM we can go\nthrough we can integrate the two.\n\n626\n00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.360\nWe have to install the DPM server and\nclient components\n\n627\n00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.910\non it's own infrastructure\nwherever we're going to run that.\n\n628\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.710\nWe set that up usually separately.\n\n629\n00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.930\nBut if you wanna integrate\nthe two we'll install all that\n\n630\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.870\non the ops manager management server.\n\n631\n00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.780\nIn other words we'll combine\nthese two together and\n\n632\n00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.515\nrun them on the same server when\nwe wanna integrate the two.\n\n633\n00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:13.385\nSo when we go back to our\nSystem Center Ops Manager server,\n\n634\n00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:15.645\nlet me just switch consoles here.\n\n635\n00:30:15.645 --> 00:30:19.805\nAnd we set this up,\nwe would be installing the DPM solution,\n\n636\n00:30:19.805 --> 00:30:23.662\nthe data protection manager solution,\non this box and run it here.\n\n637\n00:30:23.662 --> 00:30:26.262\nNow I don't have it setup here, we're\nnot gonna actually do the integration.\n\n638\n00:30:26.262 --> 00:30:28.802\nI just wanna talk to you about\nthe fact that we can do it.\n\n639\n00:30:28.802 --> 00:30:33.212\nBut you would set it up and install it on\nthe same server that it's running on for\n\n640\n00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:33.892\nops manager.\n\n641\n00:30:33.892 --> 00:30:35.021\nSo the two are together.\n\n642\n00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:37.501\nSo I said normally,\nif we're gonna run these separately and\n\n643\n00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:41.591\nnot integrate the two, we install DPM and\nput it on a separate server.\n\n644\n00:30:41.591 --> 00:30:44.431\nAnd it runs on its own because\nit's gonna centralize backup and\n\n645\n00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:45.811\nrestore functionality.\n\n646\n00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:50.050\nBut when we wanna use the two together and\nuse SCOM to be able to monitor DPM.\n\n647\n00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.780\nAnd to be able to restart backups\nif something goes wrong, and\n\n648\n00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.110\ntake care of all those things.\n\n649\n00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.470\nWe need the two together in the same\nsystem, in order to do that.\n\n650\n00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.440\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n651\n00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.930\nSo the central console component\nlets us set up, monitor, and\n\n652\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:07.370\nmaintain access to DPM, scopes our\nsecurity access for the DPM administrator.\n\n653\n00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.420\nAll that kind of stuff is set up there.\n\n654\n00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.720\nWe have to import the DPM management pack\nso we can manage DPM into SCOM once we,\n\n655\n00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.260\nagain, do the integration first,\nthen import the management pack second.\n\n656\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.540\nSo the management pack lines\nup just like with SCVMM and\n\n657\n00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.470\nwe see all of those capabilities.\n\n658\n00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.560\nOnce we get that set up,\nit will be important for\n\n659\n00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.250\nus to take note of something.\n\n660\n00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.410\nIf we have a certain threshold of\nmonitoring and have activity taking place\n\n661\n00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.800\non the DPM server, we may have to\ngo in and modify settings in SCOM.\n\n662\n00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.100\nAnd, do a little register editing or\ntweaking to adjust SCOM so\n\n663\n00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.010\nthat we know how to monitor.\n\n664\n00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.430\nAnd we don't overwhelm the SCOM system and\ncrash it.\n\n665\n00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.780\nBecause of the the volume of transactional\ndata coming and going between SCOM and\n\n666\n00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.920\nbetween the DPM server.\n\n667\n00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.390\nWhich, if you think about\nthe logical what DPM does,\n\n668\n00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.130\nit's backing up huge volumes of data.\n\n669\n00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.060\nThere's a lot of disk IO going on.\n\n670\n00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.660\nAnd we got a monitor for that and\nmake sure we're aware of that.\n\n671\n00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.620\nSo, one of the things I just wanted\nto take you on quick journey for\n\n672\n00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.120\nis to show you this webpage right here.\n\n673\n00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.290\nIf we can take a look, and\n\n674\n00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:09.030\nyou'll see that when we plan for\nDPM integration with ASCOM.\n\n675\n00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.210\nWhen I was talking about maybe having\nto tweak the registry a little bit.\n\n676\n00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.370\nWhat you'll see is, right down here,\nspecifically this area.\n\n677\n00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.620\nWe'll just take a look real quick.\n\n678\n00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.790\nCan we go full-screen so\nwe can see that a little bit bigger?\n\n679\n00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.180\nAnd I'll un-highlight that so\nyou can see what I'm talking about.\n\n680\n00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.630\nIt says you're working with other\n2000 data sources on the DPM server.\n\n681\n00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.470\nMany are bringing in more that 2000 data\nsource items that have to be monitored,\n\n682\n00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.330\nand maintained.\n\n683\n00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.260\nWe have to edit the registry\na little bit to reflect that and\n\n684\n00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.020\nthere's three keys here\nthat we talk about.\n\n685\n00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.650\nYou can read up on these and\ntake a look at them out on the web and\n\n686\n00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:39.830\njust make sure you're familiar with them.\n\n687\n00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.170\nWhat we're doing is setting\nsome limits here on the volume\n\n688\n00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.450\nof data transactions that are coming in.\n\n689\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.610\nAnd essentially throttling\na little bit to control and\n\n690\n00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.470\nbetter setup our ability to manage and\nmonitor.\n\n691\n00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.480\nWe're setting up queue limits,\nin other words, and things of that nature.\n\n692\n00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.460\nSo in the notes, when I put in hey,\nyou're gonna add registry keys and\n\n693\n00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.850\nmodify them,\nwe're really referring to these keys here.\n\n694\n00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.480\nAnd we're just giving you the information\nso you can take a look and see.\n\n695\n00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.370\nBut I put the URL for this particular\npage in the notes, Cherokee's got it.\n\n696\n00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.910\nSo make sure they show up for you,\nthat way you can see what's going on.\n\n697\n00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:15.380\nAnd then once we integrate this, we can\nthen monitor both DPM and SCVMM from SCOM.\n\n698\n00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.530\nAnd we can use SCOM to brunch\nout as we were suggesting and\n\n699\n00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.670\nintegrate with all of the different\nparts at System Center.\n\n700\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.220\nAnd be able to optimize them through\nmonitoring and management and\n\n701\n00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.650\nthat's really what the goal of\nusing a toolex SCOM is going to be.\n\n702\n00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.050\n&gt;&gt; All right you did such\na great job Adam I think I'll\n\n703\n00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.910\neven give you your napkin back.\n\n704\n00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.340\n&gt;&gt; You are just-\n&gt;&gt; You earned it.\n\n705\n00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; All right thank you so much for it.\n\n706\n00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.220\n&gt;&gt; You didn't use this\nwhile you had it did you?\n\n707\n00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.790\n&gt;&gt; I didn't use it.\n&gt;&gt; It's a little wet I was just\n\n708\n00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.665\nwondering no ok?\n\n709\n00:33:40.665 --> 00:33:43.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] and thank you for\nhanging in there with us but\n\n710\n00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.040\nwe do have additional information.\n\n711\n00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.290\nSo stay tuned.\n\n712\n00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.710\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n713\n00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.980\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n714\n00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.724\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n715\n00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:53.941\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n716\n00:33:53.941 --> 00:33:59.702\n[MUSIC]\n\n717\n00:33:59.702 -->

00:00:11.055\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:15.175\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Configuring and\nDeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.175\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.725\nIn this episode, we'll take a look at how\nto customize our monitoring techniques.\n\n7\n00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:23.665\nThat we have to use,\nwithin our private cloud environment.\n\n8\n00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:26.365\nWith us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:28.130\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.990\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.060\nThank you for bringing me back,\nand inviting me to come and\n\n12\n00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.190\nspend some time with you.\n\n13\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.560\nAnd with all of our people out there\nin Studio Land watching us live.\n\n14\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.840\nAnd also, certainly,\nwatching us after the fact.\n\n15\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.300\nWe want to continue talking about SCOM.\n\n16\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.990\nBut we're going to take\na slightly different tur,\n\n17\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.460\non the way in which SCOM\nis gonna be discussed here.\n\n18\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.500\nWe're gonna be focusing,\n\n19\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.610\nstill in the console, talking about\nthings that are important there.\n\n20\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.950\nWe're gonna broaden out, and\n\n21\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.360\nin the beginning of this conversation\nwe talk about links to the cloud.\n\n22\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970\nWe've been hearing about\nthis mythical cloud.\n\n23\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.560\nWe're gonna talk about things\nlike System Center Advisor.\n\n24\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.740\nWe talked about the Windows Azure\nmanagement pack and\n\n25\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.130\nthe Operations Manager suite.\n\n26\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.600\nThe on-cloud or in-cloud monitoring\ncapabilities that Microsoft provides us,\n\n27\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.930\nthrough the Azure fabric.\n\n28\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.020\nSo we'll take a look at some of\nthe stuff that goes on around\n\n29\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.690\nSystem Center OpsManager.\n\n30\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.660\nWe'll take a look at the management\npacks we have to download and integrate.\n\n31\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.500\nTo monitor and\ninteract with the Azure fabric.\n\n32\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.840\nAnd we'll take a look with\nthe documentation looks like for that.\n\n33\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.774\nWe're also then gonna delve in, and\ntalk that customized monitoring.\n\n34\n00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:26.590\nAs Cherokee was indicating\nin her opening remarks.\n\n35\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.200\nWe'll take a look at management pack\nobjects and monitoring templates.\n\n36\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.650\nThat we can use to further customize and\noptimize our monitoring.\n\n37\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.580\nSo let's begin, if you can,\nand join me over here.\n\n38\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.880\nWe're gonna take a look at\nconfiguring System Center, and\n\n39\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.820\nhow we setup System Center Advisor.\n\n40\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.110\nWe'll also throw in the Windows Azure Pack\nand talk about that.\n\n41\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.900\nI'm in the administration workspace,\nas you can see here.\n\n42\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.700\nI'm down at the bottom,\n\n43\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.780\nwe haven't really gone into this area\nin our walkthroughs up until now.\n\n44\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.000\nIt's been there,\nwe just haven't paid attention to it.\n\n45\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.650\nNow in system center 2012 R2,\nwe've integrated the administration area.\n\n46\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.880\nOr the System Center Advisor Overview\narea, directly into the console.\n\n47\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.640\nSo we can simply go through and configure\nit right from here, which is nice.\n\n48\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.800\nHasn't always been there.\n\n49\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.209\nHad to go out and do some additional work\nto get it in there, in prior versions.\n\n50\n00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.170\nSo we come in here, and you could see, I'm\nin the introduction of the overview area.\n\n51\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.858\nThis is an online service\nthat helps us to actually\n\n52\n00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:16.678\nanalyze the installations\nof different software.\n\n53\n00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.916\nHelp us to better understand\nwhat we're doing with it, and\n\n54\n00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:20.820\ntell us whether we're optimized or not.\n\n55\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.960\nThis is, like the best practice analyzers\nthat we spoke about in the past.\n\n56\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.290\nGives us the ability to understand,\nfrom Microsoft's perspective.\n\n57\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.420\nWhether we're doing something\nin the right or wrong way.\n\n58\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.810\nAnd make recommendations about\nhow we can do that better.\n\n59\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.440\nSo we're gonna be able to do this.\n\n60\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.920\nWe go in, and we actually\nregister to the advisor service,\n\n61\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.500\nyou could see the link right over there.\n\n62\n00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.195\nAnd so we'd have to connect our\nSCOM management group up to\n\n63\n00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.270\nour newer existing advisor account.\n\n64\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.570\nThis is gonna be in the cloud, so\nwe have to integrate with Azure here.\n\n65\n00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.290\nAnd have an account to\nbe able to leverage.\n\n66\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.450\nSo let's actually learn a little bit\nmore about System Center Advisor.\n\n67\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.640\nIf you click through this link right here,\nyou'll see that we go out.\n\n68\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.990\nAnd we'll give it just a second,\nto see if we could see this come up.\n\n69\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.580\nWe'll be able to see\nthe SystemCenterAdvisor.com website.\n\n70\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.924\nWe'll be able to go through.\n\n71\n00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:06.966\nAnd just see some of the documentation\non the thought process and\n\n72\n00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:09.059\nthe overview about System Center Advisor.\n\n73\n00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.810\nYou can obviously go out and\nput this in on your own, and take a look.\n\n74\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.490\nAnd in the meantime,\njust while we're waiting on that.\n\n75\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.640\nNo problem, couldn't resolve it.\n\n76\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.830\nWe'll actually just do it right through\nhere, through the main website.\n\n77\n00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.460\nCuz the lab environment doesn't\nalways have connectivity out.\n\n78\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.630\nSystem Center, or System Advisor.\n\n79\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.130\nSystem\n\n80\n00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.860\nSo we'll bring that up.\n\n81\n00:03:46.363 --> 00:03:49.310\nAnd, we'll wait, and wait,\nand wait, up, there we go.\n\n82\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like the site's\nnot working there, Adam.\n\n83\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.000\n&gt;&gt; No, apparently not.\n\n84\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.710\nI guess Microsoft decided to\nhave the site take the day off.\n\n85\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.690\nIt's probably a holiday for\nwebsites, somewhere in the world.\n\n86\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.190\nBut apparently,\n\n87\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.130\nthe System Center Advisor's website is\nprobably just down for a few minutes.\n\n88\n00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.730\nEvery so often, you have maintenance or\nsomething that goes on behind the scenes.\n\n89\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.970\nAnd maybe we just happened to try to\nget to it when they were working on it.\n\n90\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.355\nSo, no big deal.\n\n91\n00:04:09.355 --> 00:04:13.031\nBut what you would see when you go in,\nand you're actually trying to link up.\n\n92\n00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.450\nHere you can see the console,\nwe're just back where we were.\n\n93\n00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.519\nIf you didn't click on the link, and\n\n94\n00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.530\njust wanted to learn more about it\nwhen the website is up and running?\n\n95\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.245\nYou'll be able to do that, you would click\nhere to register with the advisor service.\n\n96\n00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:26.075\nYou would have to have a Microsoft\naccount if you don't have one.\n\n97\n00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:28.265\nIt'll say, hey, log on field,\nyou'll have to create one.\n\n98\n00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:29.301\nNo big deal, you'll set that up.\n\n99\n00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:32.970\nAnd then once you integrate\nthe System Center Advisor connection here.\n\n100\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.898\nThe account behind the scenes,\nlinking it into, or excuse me,\n\n101\n00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.710\nout to the Fabric, to link SCOM to that.\n\n102\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.518\nThen the System Center Advisor\nsoftware can actually start running,\n\n103\n00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:45.010\nlooking at data with SCOM.\n\n104\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.323\nAnd can start to make some\nrecommendations for you.\n\n105\n00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:50.750\nAnd give you the benefit of\nunderstanding what's going there.\n\n106\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.430\nOnce we run through, we supply the account\ndetails, and we get all registered up.\n\n107\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.240\nWe'll then be able to take a look at\nthe Advisor-managed information here.\n\n108\n00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.800\nThis is not going to\npopulate with anything now,\n\n109\n00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.320\nbecause we don't have anything connected.\n\n110\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.640\nBut we'd be able to see information here.\n\n111\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.310\nBe able to see what recommendations\nare available to us.\n\n112\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.070\nAnd what the system may decide that would\nbe a good idea for us to engage in.\n\n113\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.520\nIn terms of optimization,\nif we choose to go that route.\n\n114\n00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.010\nSo I just wanted to throw that\nout there for you real quick.\n\n115\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.140\nGive you a sense of the fact\nthat that's now integrated.\n\n116\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.725\nAnd that we can leverage\nthe System Center Advisor.\n\n117\n00:05:21.725 --> 00:05:25.400\nAs one of the extensions to SCOM,\nif we choose to do so.\n\n118\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.570\nIf you're interested in it,\nas I said, just go out.\n\n119\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.920\nGoogle for it real quick,\ntake a look at the website.\n\n120\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.230\nI'm sure by the time you see this,\nit'll be up and running.\n\n121\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.430\nYou won't have any problems getting to it.\n\n122\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.460\nYou could read up on it.\n\n123\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.090\nAnd you can interact with it, and see if\nyou wanna hook your SCOM installation up.\n\n124\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.970\nAnd use the Azure fabric\nto do some monitoring,\n\n125\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.910\nbetter understand how\nyou can integrate that.\n\n126\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.270\nWe wanna talk a little bit about\nthe Azure management pack, and\n\n127\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.030\nthe Operations Management Suite.\n\n128\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.600\nWhich is the online monitoring\ncapabilities presented by Azure.\n\n129\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.370\nSo let's take a look, let me just\nbring up the web here for a minute.\n\n130\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.900\nI just went in and\nI just Googled, you can see,\n\n131\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.770\nSystem Center management pack for Azure.\n\n132\n00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.700\nI didn't Google,\nI just typed it in to Bing, right?\n\n133\n00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.770\nAnd same idea, just search for\nit, is what I mean to say.\n\n134\n00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.020\nAnd the first link that comes\nup is just the download link.\n\n135\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.050\nAnd so I went out and\nI set up, and I downloaded, or\n\n136\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.790\nwent to the download site for this.\n\n137\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.210\nNow let's just click here, and this is\njust the download for the management pack.\n\n138\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.470\nAnd you can see here,\nwhen we go to download it.\n\n139\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.970\nThe management pack is made\nup of two distinct files.\n\n140\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.790\nThe MSI file, which is the packaged-up\nmanagement pack material.\n\n141\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.010\nAnd a deployment guide,\na management guide.\n\n142\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.660\nWhich every management pack,\nfor the most part, comes with.\n\n143\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.160\nAnd I downloaded those two items, and\nthey're sitting here on my desktop.\n\n144\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.980\nI just have them right over here.\n\n145\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.170\nLet me just bring them out, so\nyou can see them sitting right there.\n\n146\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.400\nAnd the management pack guide,\nI've just opened up.\n\n147\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.310\nAnd you can see that we have,\npretty detailed set of instructions and\n\n148\n00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.440\nguidance from Microsoft.\n\n149\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.784\nJust scroll down here for\na minute so you can see this.\n\n150\n00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:02.465\nThat gives us information about\nwhat it is, what's the purpose?\n\n151\n00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:04.260\nWhat are the monitoring scenarios,\nhow health rolls up.\n\n152\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.531\nSo look at some of those\nmonitors we talked about earlier,\n\n153\n00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:09.190\nin the prior episodes.\n\n154\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.024\nIn the discussion about\nhow we do the monitoring.\n\n155\n00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:16.710\nRemember, we went through and took a look\nat aggregate monitors, health monitors.\n\n156\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.810\nThings of that nature,\nsome of our prior episodes.\n\n157\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.790\nSo we'll be seeing a little\nbit about that here.\n\n158\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.350\nHow we view the management information,\nonce it's set up in there.\n\n159\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.860\nAlso very important, how we configure the\nmanager pack for the Windows-Azure Fabric.\n\n160\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.450\nHow we actually set it up.\n\n161\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.820\nSo if we go in here, and\nwe go to, let's say,\n\n162\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.680\njust jump to that point for just a minute.\n\n163\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.060\nIt will walk us through the steps\ninvolved, in what we need to do.\n\n164\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.290\nWe have to enable\nthe Windows Azure Diagnostics for\n\n165\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.940\nthe application we want to monitor.\n\n166\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.600\nHow do we do that?\n\n167\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.960\nWe have some links there.\n\n168\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.550\nSet up Windows Azure Diagnostics\nto forward data, right,\n\n169\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.900\ninto our Windows Azure storage.\n\n170\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.760\nUpload a valid x509 certificate for\nmanagement purposes, so\n\n171\n00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.090\nwe have to do that.\n\n172\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.305\nConfigure discovery, and\nmake sure we have that set up.\n\n173\n00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:01.560\nAnd walks us through the step-by-step\nprocess of how to do this.\n\n174\n00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.501\nSo it's actually really nice, got some\nvery detailed Explanations, got a little\n\n175\n00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:09.553\nset of screen captures in here, to see how\nwe add the Windows Azure subscription, and\n\n176\n00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:13.070\nwalk though that for\nthe management server resource pool.\n\n177\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.736\nAnd then, once we're done,\nverify the connectivity.\n\n178\n00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.077\nAnd, the discovery takes a few minutes.\n\n179\n00:08:17.077 --> 00:08:19.425\nIt tells us to be patient\nwhile we're doing that.\n\n180\n00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:22.780\nSends us then, on a journey to set up and\nconfigure monitoring.\n\n181\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.140\nSo, it's got the very detailed\nstep-by-step instructions that we need.\n\n182\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.810\nThe key things to set up and know that we\nhave that in place ahead of time, we have\n\n183\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.130\nto have OPS Manager running at least\nSystem Center Ops Management 2012SP1 or\n\n184\n00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.460\nR2 in order to use this management pack.\n\n185\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.672\nSo, System Center 2012 will\nnot be a candidate for this.\n\n186\n00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:43.680\nMust be 12SP1 or 12R2, just so you know.\n\n187\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.620\nGotta obviously have internet\nconnectivity, meaning we have to have at\n\n188\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.540\nleast one management server in the pool\nconnected up to the Internet, so\n\n189\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.830\nthat we can interact, connect up,\ndownload the management pack,\n\n190\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.040\nconnect to Azure, all that kind of stuff.\n\n191\n00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.970\nWe need Windows Azure diagnostics,\nas you saw at the beginning of the,\n\n192\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.030\nhey, how do I set this up, instructions.\n\n193\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.970\nThe Azure diagnostics must be\nset up on the Azure fabric.\n\n194\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.360\nYou're gonna log in with your account.\n\n195\n00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.440\nSo, you're gonna have to have\nan Azure account and set that up.\n\n196\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.650\nAnd to that end,\nlet's just go back over here for a minute.\n\n197\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.260\nLet me just minimize the document,\ngo back into the web browser really quick.\n\n198\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.430\nAnd, if we want to and\n\n199\n00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.770\nwe will just go right here, and just take\na look real quick while we're doing this.\n\n200\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.537\nIf we go to Windows Azure, and we see the\nfirst link right there, start your free\n\n201\n00:09:25.537 --> 00:09:29.825\ntrial now, you could set up a free\naccount on the Windows Azure portal.\n\n202\n00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.384\nWe've talked about this in other shows,\nin other episodes,\n\n203\n00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:33.995\nin a variety of different scenarios.\n\n204\n00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:37.015\nOn Microsoft these days anyway,\nthis always changes the course and\n\n205\n00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:40.720\nit can't guarantee that a year from\nnow it will be the same thing.\n\n206\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.240\nBut, you could see there, we're giving\n$200 in free credit, and that's been\n\n207\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.810\nthe case for several years now,\nat least about two years on the platform.\n\n208\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.741\nThey're giving away a certain amount of\ncredits for you to be able to on-board.\n\n209\n00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:52.310\nStart using the Azure service.\n\n210\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.380\nI'm sure that will continue.\n\n211\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.960\nI don't imagine that will\nbe a problem going forward.\n\n212\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.683\nSo, you'll be able to get in there for\nfree.\n\n213\n00:09:57.683 --> 00:09:59.960\n$200 in credit give you a sense.\n\n214\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.120\nThis is what you're being\nbilled hourly for usage.\n\n215\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.524\nAnd so, in the normal infrastructure\nscenario, three or four VMs running,\n\n216\n00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:11.048\nmonitoring things like that,\nyou're gonna be able to run for\n\n217\n00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:15.860\nprobably at least 30 days under minimum\nto medium load, with $200 in credit,\n\n218\n00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.655\nwithout running out of money.\n\n219\n00:10:17.655 --> 00:10:19.861\nSo, you're gonna be able to set\nup an account and go in there and\n\n220\n00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:21.190\nplay around a bit for free.\n\n221\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.160\nIt's like Monopoly money, right.\n\n222\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.790\nSo that's kinda cool.\n\n223\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.520\nIt's just funny money.\n\n224\n00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.160\nBut, then you put down a credit card and\nthey'll-\n\n225\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.550\n&gt;&gt; Actually, you get addicted.\n\n226\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.175\n&gt;&gt; To Monopoly or to-\n\n227\n00:10:29.175 --> 00:10:30.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Monitoring.\n\n228\n00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:31.310\n&gt;&gt; To Azure, yeah.\n\n229\n00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.110\n&gt;&gt; To Azure, okay.\n\n230\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.430\nSo, if you get addicted to Azure,\nthen you're gonna have to pay as you go.\n\n231\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.830\nSo, you just put a credit card down.\n\n232\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.340\nYou would obviously, then be able to just\ncontinue to extend your subscription and\n\n233\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.990\nstart to bill as you go for that.\n\n234\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.080\nBut, you'll see,\nyou're able to try the Azure services.\n\n235\n00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.710\nYou're not paying anything, right.\n\n236\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.130\nSo, they're not gonna use, Microsoft's\nup front about this, tells you, hey,\n\n237\n00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.560\nwe're not gonna use your\ncredit cared to bill you,\n\n238\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.100\nunless you say it's okay,\njust using it to identify you, initially.\n\n239\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.980\nBut, to be clear and\n\n240\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.480\nto be fair, you will need a credit\ncared to establish this free account.\n\n241\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.290\nI've had this conversation with a few\nstudents, where we go through it,\n\n242\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.730\ncuz we're in class.\n\n243\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.570\nWe set these up and they're like hey,\nwe don't wanna use the credit card,\n\n244\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.500\nour own credit card.\n\n245\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.685\nWe have vouchers for that.\n\n246\n00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:11.969\nSo, you don't have to worry about that\nwhen you actually do formal training, but\n\n247\n00:11:11.969 --> 00:11:14.966\noutside in the real world, when you go and\ndo this, you will be providing or\n\n248\n00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.610\nhave to provide a credit card.\n\n249\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.940\nPreferably, your own by the way,\ndon't borrow anybody's.\n\n250\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.501\nJust so you know.\n\n251\n00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:22.162\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, any time I have to\nlink a credit card to these types of\n\n252\n00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:24.980\naccounts, well I'm not as-\n&gt;&gt; You need a throw away card like this,\n\n253\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.500\na simple card you use that\nyou don't keep a lot on.\n\n254\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.120\nI have a card for\nthat kind of stuff, as well.\n\n255\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.874\nI have one that's got\nsome very low balance.\n\n256\n00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:32.790\nFew hundred dollars is the limit.\n\n257\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.326\nRather, I should say, I keep it\nspecifically for this kind of stuff, so\n\n258\n00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:37.462\nthat I can set it up and\nI'm not worried about the liability.\n\n259\n00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:40.844\nThat's a really good idea and\nsome good recommendations for\n\n260\n00:11:40.844 --> 00:11:42.243\nyou just to think about.\n\n261\n00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.040\nSo you go in.\n\n262\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.287\nYou start the free trial here.\n\n263\n00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.246\nYou set this up.\n\n264\n00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:49.197\nThen, this is the account that will let\nyou get access to the Azure Fabric and\n\n265\n00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:52.226\nuse the Azure diagnostics and\nthe inside capabilities and\n\n266\n00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:55.030\nall the different things\nthat we're talking about.\n\n267\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.210\nAnd, you can see we have\nquite a bit of stuff here.\n\n268\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.383\nYou have the Log Analytics.\n\n269\n00:11:59.383 --> 00:12:02.804\nYou have the Azure AD Directory,\nthe active directory hosted in the cloud.\n\n270\n00:12:02.804 --> 00:12:06.690\nWe have virtual networking,\napp services, the IoT capabilities.\n\n271\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.670\nThere's a lot of stuff going on\non the platform as you can see.\n\n272\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.650\nSo, you may wanna go in and\ncheck that out.\n\n273\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.650\nWe have the Azure Ops Manager Suite.\n\n274\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.270\nThis is the SCOM capability\nported directly into Azure\n\n275\n00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.630\nthat we can interact with, and\nwe can work with, and we can use online.\n\n276\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.240\nSo, we can monitor from the cloud\ninto the data center or\n\n277\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.010\nmonitor from the data center\nout to the cloud, either way.\n\n278\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.070\nAnd, we have capabilities to do one or the\nother or both so just be aware of that.\n\n279\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.650\nBut, the Ops Manager Suite is gonna\nallow us, as you could see here,\n\n280\n00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:38.400\nMicrosoft's cloud-based IT management\nsolution, helping us manage, monitor, and\n\n281\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.130\nprotect our infrastructure\nthat's cloud-based.\n\n282\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.790\nSo, it's implemented as\na cloud-based service.\n\n283\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.160\nEssentially, this is SCOM as a service,\nI mean, if you think about it.\n\n284\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.112\nCuz, we're buying it and\n\n285\n00:12:47.112 --> 00:12:51.510\nrenting it as we go, directly from\nMicrosoft on the Azure platform.\n\n286\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.518\nInsight and Analytics,\nAutomation &amp; Control, Protection and DR.\n\n287\n00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:58.381\nWe have Azure Backup and\nAzure Site Recovery.\n\n288\n00:12:58.381 --> 00:12:59.751\nAll these capabilities are there.\n\n289\n00:12:59.751 --> 00:13:02.890\nWe have PowerShell for the interface here.\n\n290\n00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.070\nWe have the security\ncompliance capabilities.\n\n291\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.870\nSo, we can drill through, learn a little\nbit more about the individual components\n\n292\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.000\nhere, Azure site recovery backup.\n\n293\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.730\nWe'll talk about some of these in\nsome of our upcoming conversations\n\n294\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.800\na little bit later on,\nin some of the future episodes here,\n\n295\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.720\naround how do we deal with data backup and\ndisaster recovery on the platform.\n\n296\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.304\nSo, we'll have a few things to say\nabout data protection manager, and\n\n297\n00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:26.558\nsome of the other stuff,\n\n298\n00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:30.820\nlike using the Azure Fabric to potentially\ndeal with Azure site recovery to backup.\n\n299\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.998\nSo, we'll certainly talk about those.\n\n300\n00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:35.621\nLog analytics, automation, we could drill\nthrough and see any and all of these,\n\n301\n00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:37.790\njust get a little bit more\ninformation about it.\n\n302\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.560\nSo, it's just another thing for\nus to think about.\n\n303\n00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.300\nThere's a nice little PDF over here\nyou can take a look at as well.\n\n304\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.840\nGot some how to's,\nhow to get started, overviews.\n\n305\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.760\nJust a lot of valuable information just\nsitting out there that we can leverage\n\n306\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.160\nthat would also essentially\ngive us a leg up, and\n\n307\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.690\nhelp us to better understand\nhow to integrate.\n\n308\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.800\nAnd if you take a look,\nwe're on the main Azure website here.\n\n309\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.760\nWe do have a link to the free account just\nlike we did off the other area as well.\n\n310\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.610\nThis actually takes us right back to\nthat other page that I was showing you\n\n311\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.370\na minute ago.\n\n312\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.400\nBut, here we just have\nall the other resources.\n\n313\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.930\nWe have the products, the documentation,\ncurrent pricing, by the way.\n\n314\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.191\nI know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n315\n00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:12.671\nIt's light and\nit's very small up there, but pricing.\n\n316\n00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:16.711\nThere's some online training, so\nthere's e-learning, things like that,\n\n317\n00:14:16.711 --> 00:14:20.508\nwho the partner ecosystem is made up of,\nblog information, resources and\n\n318\n00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:22.760\nsupport around the entire Azure platform.\n\n319\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.705\nSo, it's good for you to be able to go\nout and find these kinds of resources and\n\n320\n00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:30.020\ndelve into them, if you're gonna try to\ndo the integration of this product, and\n\n321\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.530\ngives you a better understanding of what\nthe capabilities and the reliability of\n\n322\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.530\nthe platform like this can be in\nterms of integrating these hybrid or\n\n323\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.610\nmixed solutions that\nyou may wanna spin up.\n\n324\n00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.949\nSo it's actually really nice time for\nus to be doing this kinda work, for\n\n325\n00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:45.412\nyou to be doing this kinda\nwork as IT administrators,\n\n326\n00:14:45.412 --> 00:14:46.805\ncuz you can think about this.\n\n327\n00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:49.934\nA few years ago, and\nnot that long ago to be honest with you,\n\n328\n00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:53.390\nthis kind of stuff was really just\nstarting to become available.\n\n329\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.480\nYou couldn't run Ops Manager in the cloud,\nthree or four years ago.\n\n330\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.780\nIt just didn't exist.\n\n331\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.550\nIt's a relatively recent offering.\n\n332\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.170\nWe didn't have deep analytics and insight\ncapabilities through the Azure platform,\n\n333\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.560\nfor on-prem infrastructure,\nuntil very recently.\n\n334\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.439\nSo, this is really a growth area that\nMicrosoft, and other vendors, to be fair,\n\n335\n00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:15.208\nAWS, certainly, through Amazon,\nVMware, through their vCloud Suite, and\n\n336\n00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:18.607\neverything else, all the vendors\nare really trying to build this out.\n\n337\n00:15:18.607 --> 00:15:23.431\nBecause, they understand that the more of\nthese managed service offerings that they\n\n338\n00:15:23.431 --> 00:15:28.121\ncan integrate and provide for you in this\nhybrid solution, where it's on-prem in\n\n339\n00:15:28.121 --> 00:15:31.940\nthe cloud, and both are gonna open\nup additional possibilities for\n\n340\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.161\nus to further flex and ultimately grow\nour infrastructure and to thrive and\n\n341\n00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:39.450\nsurvive in this case,\nin the new brave world of the cloud.\n\n342\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.210\n&gt;&gt; I feel like we are like Bear Grylls.\n\n343\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.120\nThey're gonna drop us off in\nthe woods with no shoes on,\n\n344\n00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.530\nto survive and thrive here.\n\n345\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.040\n&gt;&gt; And, how would you know about Bear\nGrylls young lady, if you don't watch TV?\n\n346\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.810\n&gt;&gt; I have seen that, one time.\n\n347\n00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you've been holding\nout on me, is what you're saying.\n\n348\n00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.730\nAll right, I got it.\n\n349\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.580\n&gt;&gt; A couple of shows,\nwe'll talk about those.\n\n350\n00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, okay.\n\n351\n00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.472\nSo, I actually watch him sometimes too.\n\n352\n00:15:56.472 --> 00:15:57.510\nThat stuff's pretty cool.\n\n353\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.340\nHow I survived in the woods\nwith a toothpick and\n\n354\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.740\nbasically just a piece of string.\n\n355\n00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.896\nHe's like MacGyver, but\nlike the forest-going MacGyver.\n\n356\n00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.806\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, we have the internet though,\nto help us out with this if we ever get\n\n357\n00:16:06.806 --> 00:16:09.032\nstuck, and all the documentation\nyou've showed us, and\n\n358\n00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:10.542\nall your notes that Adam has given you.\n\n359\n00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:14.100\nSo it's not as serious a stringent here.\n\n360\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.387\n&gt;&gt; No, you're not gonna die a horrible\ndeath if you fall off the cliff here,\n\n361\n00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:18.670\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n362\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.540\nSo I think just to show you some of\nthe resources that were here real quick,\n\n363\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.200\njust to finish up.\n\n364\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.771\nWhat I was actually gonna show you,\nis just right down here.\n\n365\n00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:29.424\nIn addition to obviously all\nthe things we provide here at ITProTV,\n\n366\n00:16:29.424 --> 00:16:33.714\nalways good to look at the vendor and see\nthat they may have and they do have, some\n\n367\n00:16:33.714 --> 00:16:38.120\njust get acquainted kind of infrastructure\nvideos, things like that online.\n\n368\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.065\nThere's a lot of them here,\nyou can go in and take a look.\n\n369\n00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:44.539\nI know a lot of you are always interested,\nand it's very important to be,\n\n370\n00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:45.499\nin certification.\n\n371\n00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:48.949\nAnd you could see there's a link down here\nto certifications through Microsoft for\n\n372\n00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:49.547\nuser fabric.\n\n373\n00:16:49.547 --> 00:16:51.508\nWe have a whole bunch\non the developer side.\n\n374\n00:16:51.508 --> 00:16:53.800\nWe have a whole bunch on\nthe infrastructure side.\n\n375\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.050\nLinks into things like Office\n365 like MCSE Private Cloud\n\n376\n00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.340\nthat we're here talking about over\nthis whole set of shows and episodes.\n\n377\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.578\nSo there's quite a bit of stuff going\non here that you can just delve in and\n\n378\n00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:05.470\ntake a look at.\n\n379\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.870\nWe do have support here.\n\n380\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.220\nYou can go through and see just all\nthe different areas that are set up.\n\n381\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.510\nAnd if you go through, and I always like\nto look at the blog entries as well.\n\n382\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.517\nBecause the blog is where you're gonna\nfind a lot of the infrastructure\n\n383\n00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:21.924\ninformation and the cutting edge stuff\nto Microsoft, or whoever the vendor is,\n\n384\n00:17:21.924 --> 00:17:23.394\nis putting out and talking about.\n\n385\n00:17:23.394 --> 00:17:25.337\nAnd so it's always good to go check-in.\n\n386\n00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.217\nSince we're just talking about Azure,\nthe Fabric, the Cloud here for\n\n387\n00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:29.088\na couple of minutes.\n\n388\n00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:33.463\nYou can go see some of the more popular\nstuff that's trending and what's going on.\n\n389\n00:17:33.463 --> 00:17:35.680\nYou're a big social media-\n&gt;&gt; #Trending.\n\n390\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.051\n&gt;&gt; Maybe even there, right, but you gotta\nput computer science on the end of it.\n\n391\n00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:39.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n392\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.375\n&gt;&gt; So you could see there\nis a new PowerBI pack for\n\n393\n00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.550\nAzure users that we could use for\ndata analytics.\n\n394\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.050\nThere's performance and usage impact,\nrelease information for app, app insights.\n\n395\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.302\nThere's just all sorts of stuff here.\n\n396\n00:17:51.302 --> 00:17:53.874\nSo it's just always interesting\nto check that stuff out and\n\n397\n00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.374\nmaybe drill in there a little bit.\n\n398\n00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:57.996\nYou could obviously check\nout the pricing information,\n\n399\n00:17:57.996 --> 00:17:59.805\nget a better sense of what's going on.\n\n400\n00:17:59.805 --> 00:18:02.470\nAnd just get a better sense\nof how you can adjust or\n\n401\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.845\nthink through the logic of the costs here.\n\n402\n00:18:04.845 --> 00:18:08.581\nThey got a nice little TCO calculator and\npricing calculator out there.\n\n403\n00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.622\nYou can work out, localized to your region\nby the way, wherever you are in the world\n\n404\n00:18:12.622 --> 00:18:16.401\ncuz it takes the standard baseline of\nprice and coverts it to local currency.\n\n405\n00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:19.240\nAnd does it based on data\ncenter hosting in your region.\n\n406\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.910\nSo if you're in Europe, let's say, you're\ngonna get it based in either Euros or\n\n407\n00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.840\nPounds, whatever you may wanna look at.\n\n408\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.870\nBut it's based off hosting in\nthe Microsoft data centers in Europe,\n\n409\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.500\nin Ireland, for instance, and\nin the UK and places like that.\n\n410\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.150\nSo you can see all that and\n\n411\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.690\nreally localize your\ninformation to what you need.\n\n412\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.920\nSo that's always good, and I like that cuz\nI work with customers around the world.\n\n413\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.144\nAnd we'll have to do this sometimes to\nget a sense of what the platform will\n\n414\n00:18:41.144 --> 00:18:41.669\nlook like.\n\n415\n00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:43.971\nAnd it's quick for\nthem to be able to double-check and\n\n416\n00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:46.774\nverify on the spot at that moment\nwhat pricing may look like and what\n\n417\n00:18:46.774 --> 00:18:50.399\ntheir opportunities are based on where\nthey're hosting what they're gonna spend.\n\n418\n00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's nice that you point\nthat out because I think, sometimes,\n\n419\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.606\nI find myself kind of restricted and\njust thinking here within the country.\n\n420\n00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.814\nBut it really is in our national, and-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's global.\n\n421\n00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:02.591\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or\nif you don't have that experience,\n\n422\n00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:04.148\nsometimes you kinda forget about that.\n\n423\n00:19:04.148 --> 00:19:07.020\nBut it's always good to keep\nyour mind open in that way, too.\n\n424\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.480\n&gt;&gt; It is, absolutely, and\nif we just go click quickly on products,\n\n425\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.920\njust to wrap up this little\noverview just so you could see.\n\n426\n00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.860\nJust like with Amazon, there's so many\nproducts out there on the AWS platform.\n\n427\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.250\nAnd there's just an equal number\nof fascinating, really cool, but\n\n428\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.820\nsometimes confusing things that are going\non with the Microsoft platform if you're\n\n429\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.070\nnot familiar with all them.\n\n430\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.289\nIt's always good to go take a look.\n\n431\n00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:30.871\nWe break them into standard categories,\ncompute, networking storage,\n\n432\n00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:35.463\nweb and mobile, database analytics,\nIoT, Internet of Things, right?\n\n433\n00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:39.009\nSo you click on any one of these, and\nyou'll see that we have all sorts of\n\n434\n00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:42.280\ndifferent products,\nofferings categories, the IoT hub.\n\n435\n00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.640\nWhere we can essentially go out and\n\n436\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.770\nmonitor all of the different IoT assets\nthat we have hanging out out there.\n\n437\n00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.000\nWe can go in, and we can look at\nscreen analytics, machine learning,\n\n438\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.220\njust all sorts of stuff.\n\n439\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.003\nSo you could see there's just a lot of\nstuff happening on this platform more and\n\n440\n00:19:56.003 --> 00:19:57.793\nmore, literally almost every day.\n\n441\n00:19:57.793 --> 00:20:01.772\nSo it really is worth your time if you're\ngonna start integrating your own private\n\n442\n00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:04.541\ncloud management capabilities\nthrough System Center,\n\n443\n00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:08.637\ninto the broader fabric of cloud, that\nMicrosoft maintains, that you really spend\n\n444\n00:20:08.637 --> 00:20:12.122\nsome time educating yourself about\noptions here and things you can do.\n\n445\n00:20:12.122 --> 00:20:14.672\nInternet of Things alone,\njust mobile device management.\n\n446\n00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.339\nWho doesn't have mobile devices in the\nenterprise they have to worry about today?\n\n447\n00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:19.120\nWhen you think about the logic of that,\nright?\n\n448\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.730\nEverybody walks around with at least\none or two of these devices personally.\n\n449\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.090\nAnd we often integrate a lot\nof them into the mobile or\n\n450\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.940\nrather through the mobile platform\ninto the corporate space today.\n\n451\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.770\nWho doesn't get their email,\ncorporate email on their private phones?\n\n452\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.180\nMost people do, right,\nif you think about the logic of that.\n\n453\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.052\nAnd so as a result, we wanna be thinking\nabout the fact that we could extend\n\n454\n00:20:38.052 --> 00:20:42.173\nthe management into all these different\nareas using not just our own core set of\n\n455\n00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:44.132\nfunctionality from System Center.\n\n456\n00:20:44.132 --> 00:20:45.733\nBut the extended control and\n\n457\n00:20:45.733 --> 00:20:48.680\nconfigurations sets that\nAzure Fabric provides.\n\n458\n00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.368\nSo hopefully this overview just gives\nyou better ideas of some of the stuff we\n\n459\n00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:51.879\ncan do there.\n\n460\n00:20:51.879 --> 00:20:53.379\nSo a pretty brave new world and\n\n461\n00:20:53.379 --> 00:20:56.150\npretty cool little space\nthat we spent some time in.\n\n462\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.875\nAnd obviously can take advantage of if we\nare interested in seeing what's going on.\n\n463\n00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:01.767\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, Adam.\n\n464\n00:21:01.767 --> 00:21:04.521\nWell, thank you for joining us today and\nthank you, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n465\n00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:08.330\nBut I think that does go ahead and\nending for this particular episode.\n\n466\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.248\nSo we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n467\n00:21:09.248 --> 00:21:11.290\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n468\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n469\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.295\n&gt;&gt; See

--> 00:00:15.380\nWelcome to your Configuring and\nDeploying a Private Cloud series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.520\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390\nSo this is a part two, a continuation of\na previous episode, where we were really\n\n6\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.450\nlooking at how to customize monitoring\nwithin our Cloud infrastructure.\n\n7\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.970\nBack in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.730\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n9\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Hello everybody,\n\n10\n00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.180\nglad to be back, always\n&gt;&gt; Pleasure to spend time with\n\n11\n00:00:33.180 -->

00:00:43.062\nhow we customize and\ntweak monitoring in System Center,\n\n14\n00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:46.170\ncertainly focused on this SCOM product,\nin this case.\n\n15\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.042\nRemember, System Center Ops Manager,\n\n16\n00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:51.565\nthe idea here as we've been talking\nabout throughout the prior episodes and\n\n17\n00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:55.252\nsome of the associated discussions we've\nhad in other areas with system center\n\n18\n00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:59.730\nvirtual machine manager and some of the\nother products we've been talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.622\nSCOM is really the central part of this\nthought process of system center and\n\n20\n00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:04.372\nmonitoring.\n\n21\n00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:08.675\nIt's the tool that allows us to link to\nall of these other areas, pull data in,\n\n22\n00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:12.640\naggregate it as we've been talking\nabout with various monitors.\n\n23\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.469\nThat we build out in our management packs\nand shows us, either in real time or\n\n24\n00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.235\nin, we look backwards from the data\nwarehouse with regards to reporting.\n\n25\n00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.733\nHow our systems have been\nperforming historically or\n\n26\n00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.600\nare actually performing in real time or\nnear real time.\n\n27\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.380\nWe just wanna build on\nthat process a little bit.\n\n28\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.160\nWe talked in a prior episode about\nthe value of looking at the Azure fabric,\n\n29\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.400\nmaybe leveraging the Windows Azure\nManagement pack to be able to\n\n30\n00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.723\nbring in functionality.\n\n31\n00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:41.753\nSo that we can either monitor our\ninfrastructure from Azure down into our\n\n32\n00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:43.217\nprivate cloud on-prem.\n\n33\n00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:46.699\nOr use the System Center Ops Manager\nsuite to\n\n34\n00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:50.380\nbe able to monitor from\nthe cloud as a service.\n\n35\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.760\nSo Ops Manager Service,\n\n36\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.490\nessentially, monitor into the data\ncenter one way or the other.\n\n37\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.420\nOr going out from the data\ncenter up into Azure.\n\n38\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.810\nWe can look at a dataflow that goes\neither way with regards to monitoring or\n\n39\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.730\nboth ways.\n\n40\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.500\nSo if we do private cloud off prem\nhosted with the third party provider,\n\n41\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.680\nin this case with Microsoft.\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.980\nIf we do it on prem,\nwe have additional flexibility and\n\n43\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.300\ncapabilities with regards to\nhow we can approach monitoring.\n\n44\n00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.330\nAnd I think I made the point when we\ntalked about some of this that a few years\n\n45\n00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.540\nago, we would not have\nall of these options.\n\n46\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.550\nWe would have installed and\nconfigured a product like SCOM.\n\n47\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.240\nIf we go back to, for instance,\nthe 2007 version of this product.\n\n48\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.327\nMaybe step back 5, 6, 7, 8 years in time.\n\n49\n00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:33.160\nWe think about what would have been\nhappening in the data center back then.\n\n50\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.188\nThe concept of the cloud existed.\n\n51\n00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.550\nIt certainly wasn't a new idea,\n\n52\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.530\nat least to those of us in IT that\nworked in data center environments.\n\n53\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.980\nWe understood the logic of it.\n\n54\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.840\nVirtualization was certainly well\ninstantiated as a technology.\n\n55\n00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930\nThe building blocks and\nthe enabler technology of the cloud,\n\n56\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.770\nas we've talked about before,\nand the joining of\n\n57\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.160\nthese two technologies to scale massively\nin the enterprise space had begun.\n\n58\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.428\nBut it was still relatively early on,\nit was in its infancy, and we weren't\n\n59\n00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:04.783\nseeing the full extended thought process\nthat cloud has morphed into today.\n\n60\n00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:07.730\nThe internet of things had\nnot become a thing, right?\n\n61\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.190\nMobile device management had really not\n\n62\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.620\ncrested as a wave initially\nin the enterprise yet.\n\n63\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.220\nWe're still struggling with,\nhow do we deal with those things, and\n\n64\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.790\nreally starting to take them on in\nthe Enterprise from a security standpoint.\n\n65\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.070\nThe bring your own app,\nbring your own cloud phenomenon\n\n66\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.540\nthat's occurred over the intervening\nyears hadn't really hit, either.\n\n67\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.650\nAnd so we were really at the beginning\nof this thought process of\n\n68\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.800\nhow do I use the cloud?\n\n69\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.720\nWhat's the proposition from a value\nperspective to an IT professional managing\n\n70\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.830\ninfrastructure?\n\n71\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.560\nStruggling with how we scale up and\n\n72\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.085\nscale out,\nhow do we leverage a cloud to do that?\n\n73\n00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.600\nYeah, we were beginning\nto figure that out,\n\n74\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.610\nbut we certainly weren't using the cloud\nin a significant way, to monitor.\n\n75\n00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.640\nAnd we certainly weren't hosting\nlarge-scale infrastructure there,\n\n76\n00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.450\nand monitoring it there, in real-time from\nour on-prem data centers in a hybrid way.\n\n77\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.030\nThis just wasn't really done back then.\n\n78\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.912\nAnd so as you look at, cuz we progress\nforward and we start to scale up and\n\n79\n00:04:00.912 --> 00:04:01.624\nscale out and\n\n80\n00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:05.674\nwe get into the more modern versions\nof these infrastructure platforms.\n\n81\n00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.275\nAnd our cloud capabilities\nare at a minimum matching and\n\n82\n00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:12.370\nin some cases exceeding\nour abilities on prem.\n\n83\n00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.860\nIt's a very interesting\ntime to be doing this,\n\n84\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.470\nbecause we really see a change In the way\nour architecture's are being envisioned.\n\n85\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.128\nWe see a change in the way our\ndesigns are being implemented, and\n\n86\n00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:26.395\na change in the way our technology is\nbeing used to give us realtime data, or\n\n87\n00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:30.394\nnear realtime data, with regards\nto management, and with regards to\n\n88\n00:04:30.394 --> 00:04:34.840\nthe abilities to be able to use that data\nto optimize and maintain our system.\n\n89\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.220\nSo, it's kind of a cool\ntime to be doing this.\n\n90\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.985\nIt's always a cool time in IT, I mean\nthere's always something cool going on.\n\n91\n00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:43.480\nBut with regards to what the Cloud\nrepresents, with regards to the way\n\n92\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.980\nin which this technology is\nreally changing the nature and\n\n93\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.340\nthe face of the data center today.\n\n94\n00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.480\nWe've talked in other areas about\nsoftware defining things and\n\n95\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.870\nthe idea behind automating and DevOps,\nwhich is kind of the catch phrase for\n\n96\n00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.550\nsoftware definition today.\n\n97\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.540\nWhen we think about those trends,\n\n98\n00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.510\nas I said when we talked about\nthem in earlier episodes.\n\n99\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.240\nFive, six seven,\n\n100\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.290\neight years ago, while you heard\npockets of discussions on these things.\n\n101\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.660\nCuz they were out there and people\nwere starting to use the technology.\n\n102\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.090\nIt was not ubiquitous by any means.\n\n103\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.710\nIt was not widespread and\nit was not consistently applied.\n\n104\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.110\nToday in modern scale data centers\non the enterprise side and\n\n105\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.910\nthese cloud providing solutions,\nyou can't trip over anything,\n\n106\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.727\nbut this kinda technology,\nbecause this is what's taking place.\n\n107\n00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.725\nAnd this is how we run these data centers,\nso\n\n108\n00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:33.040\nit's a very interesting time to\nbe looking at products like this.\n\n109\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.201\nHaving said that, let's actually\nlook at a product like this.\n\n110\n00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.040\nSo if we go back to our interface where\nwe're gonna start talking about things.\n\n111\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.790\nI wanna pick up our thread from our last\nepisode, basically where we left off.\n\n112\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.510\nWe were about to jump back in,\n\n113\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.070\ntalk about management pack\ntemplates in the SCOM space.\n\n114\n00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.751\nLet me come back to\nthe website here just a second.\n\n115\n00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.232\nI just wanna show you\nsomething really quickly here.\n\n116\n00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:53.971\nWe're gonna talk about\nthat critical error,\n\n117\n00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.453\nwhat that represents in just a moment.\n\n118\n00:05:55.453 --> 00:06:00.080\nBut we've been talking about the idea of\nusing the SCOM tool to do a variety of\n\n119\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.840\nthings.\n\n120\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.470\nBeen through the interface with you.\n\n121\n00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.220\nShowed you the different workspaces, went\nthrough a lot of the different items and\n\n122\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.450\nfunctionality that's there.\n\n123\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.450\nGot some hands on demos throughout our\ndiscussions you can leverage to see more\n\n124\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.860\nin depth conversations and how to's.\n\n125\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.400\nThis is a high level\nthought process right now.\n\n126\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.090\nBut in the authoring workspace,\n\n127\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.210\nwe're gonna build on the idea\nof management packs.\n\n128\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.220\nWe've been having that\nunsealed sealed conversation.\n\n129\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.350\nThe unsealed management packs allow\nus to do a variety of things.\n\n130\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.970\nWe're gonna leverage,\ninstead of the management pack objects,\n\n131\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.140\nwhich are right below\nme here down the list.\n\n132\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.484\nIf I go down where we went in earlier and\n\n133\n00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:37.356\nshowed you down here how\nto build out objects.\n\n134\n00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:40.100\nAnd put them into unsealed\nmanagement packs, and leverage them.\n\n135\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.480\nInstead, we're gonna go up to\nthe management pack template area,\n\n136\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.910\nright up here at the top.\n\n137\n00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.510\nWe're gonna look at the fact that we\nhave a bunch of these templates that\n\n138\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.600\nare pre-made.\n\n139\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.180\nAnd these monitoring templates or\n\n140\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.290\nthese management templates are used\nto do a variety of things.\n\n141\n00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.811\nWe're gonna be able to leverage these\nManagement Pack Templates to be able to\n\n142\n00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:02.112\ncreate, through a wizard-driven interface,\na set of monitoring choices will be made.\n\n143\n00:07:02.112 --> 00:07:05.935\nAnd we'll then be able to create a monitor\nthat gets deployed for us automatically.\n\n144\n00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:09.245\nYou'll see the monitor sitting here,\nTCP port monitor for\n\n145\n00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:10.955\ninstance is an example of one I did.\n\n146\n00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:12.955\nDeployed through the default\nmanagement pack.\n\n147\n00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:17.965\nAnd then we can go in and this is what I\nwas just one, in this case for the port\n\n148\n00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:23.080\nmonitor under synthetic transactions\nup here under TCP Port check state.\n\n149\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.028\nI set up a monitor that\nsupposed to go out and\n\n150\n00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.802\nlook at one of my machines\nthat's running in the interface.\n\n151\n00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:31.090\nLook at the status of the port, tell\nus whether it's up and running or not.\n\n152\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.453\nAnd we can see that, given enough time\nas it starts to kick in and monitor,\n\n153\n00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:35.661\nthat port is not running.\n\n154\n00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.530\nWe've got a critical status there,\nso we can see that it's not working.\n\n155\n00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.784\nAnd I picked a random port that I knew\nwould not be available on the machine just\n\n156\n00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:42.995\nto show you what it would do.\n\n157\n00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.980\nAnd so I wanna walk back\nthrough the logic of this for\n\n158\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.560\na minute before I show you how to do this.\n\n159\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.518\nAnd we'll explain what all the various\ntemplates are that are there,\n\n160\n00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:50.732\ncuz there is a bunch of them.\n\n161\n00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:54.557\nBut there's a nice little website here,\nas there often is with TechNet,\n\n162\n00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.667\non management pack templates overall.\n\n163\n00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:59.225\nWe'll make sure you have the URL for\nthis in the show notes.\n\n164\n00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:02.300\nThis gives you just a basic idea of\nwhat Management Pack Templates do.\n\n165\n00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.830\nAnd I've explained the concept to you.\n\n166\n00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.845\nI'm not gonna spend too much time walking\nyou through the logic right here.\n\n167\n00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:09.000\nWe're gonna do this through a show and\ntell in a minute.\n\n168\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.970\nBut the reason I like this is that it\ngives us the authoritative list of\n\n169\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.120\nthe current templates that ship with SCOM,\nso when you install system center ops\n\n170\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.640\nmanager out of the box you get this list\nof templates that are sitting right here.\n\n171\n00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.945\nAnd if we could go full screen for just\na second just so So you could see these.\n\n172\n00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:26.705\nYou'll see, and\nwe'll see them in the interface as well.\n\n173\n00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:30.650\n.NET application performance monitoring\ntemplate tells us what each of\n\n174\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.400\nthe templates does here in the\ndescription, OLOEDB data source template.\n\n175\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.977\nThe process monitoring template,\nthe one I just demoed or\n\n176\n00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:39.563\nI will go back through and explain.\n\n177\n00:08:39.563 --> 00:08:42.590\nAnd we were just looking\nat the TCP port template.\n\n178\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.200\nWe have the ability to monitor Unix and\nLinux systems as well,\n\n179\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.800\ndon't wanna forget about those,\nthey're very important.\n\n180\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.349\nWe have log file monitoring there,\nas well as Linux process, or\n\n181\n00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:51.683\nUnix Linux process monitoring.\n\n182\n00:08:51.683 --> 00:08:56.085\nAnd then we have web app availability and\ntransaction monitoring along with Windows\n\n183\n00:08:56.085 --> 00:09:00.340\nservice templates, to look at the instance\nof a specific Windows service.\n\n184\n00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.580\nSo all of these are gonna\nbe available to us.\n\n185\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.560\nAll nine of them by default.\n\n186\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.610\nAnd the nice thing about this is,\nthe reason I like this particular site is,\n\n187\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.870\njust hypothetically let's say the TCB port\ntemplate, the one we were just looking at.\n\n188\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.060\nClick through any one of those and\nyou'll see it brings up a separate page\n\n189\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.720\nwhere it tells us in depth about\nthe template, gives a little scenario.\n\n190\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.700\nHey, when would you use it, why would\nit be important, how does it work?\n\n191\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.150\nWhat does it do,\nwhere will we view the monitoring data,\n\n192\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.330\nwhere do we go to see it\nonce we instantiate it?\n\n193\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.141\nI showed you, in this case,\nit was in synthetic transactions.\n\n194\n00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:35.578\nWalks you though the wizard, which I'm\nabout to show you, and we'll go through,\n\n195\n00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:37.630\njust to show you what\nthe wizard looks like.\n\n196\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.310\nBut it gives you detail on\nall the pages in the wizards.\n\n197\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.660\nIt'll help you to understand\nwhat choices you would make.\n\n198\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.460\nRemember, the wizard will look\ndifferent by template choice.\n\n199\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.064\nBecause something that's monitoring\ndatabases will obviously,\n\n200\n00:09:48.064 --> 00:09:50.905\nhave to provide database, instance,\nand configuration information.\n\n201\n00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:54.390\nWhere something like this for\nport numbers it's pretty straightforward.\n\n202\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.110\nGive me a machine.\n\n203\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.960\nGive me the port you wanna monitor.\n\n204\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.320\nTell me what the monitor\nserver's gonna be.\n\n205\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.230\nSo what's the remote\nmonitor I'm gonna use and\n\n206\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.340\nthen as a result it's\npretty quick to configure.\n\n207\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.590\nSo it just walks us through the logic\nhere as you can see and going down.\n\n208\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.150\n&gt;&gt; Adam, we might wanna say like, look.\n\n209\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.460\nI wanna be alerted if it's in\nan active state, in a listening state.\n\n210\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.120\nAnd we can really specify that?\n\n211\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.740\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not so much that.\n\n212\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.118\nWe'll take a look at that in just\na second, I'll show you what this does.\n\n213\n00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.074\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n214\n00:10:20.074 --> 00:10:22.500\n&gt;&gt; It's really just whether the port\nis available or not in other words.\n\n215\n00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.350\nIs it on, is it actively being used.\n\n216\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.460\nBut you'll see here, it gives us a step\nby step of how to actually do it.\n\n217\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.773\nSo again,\nreally detailed information by template.\n\n218\n00:10:29.773 --> 00:10:32.250\nBecause there are 9 of them in there.\n\n219\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.870\nYou may or may not use one or\nmore of them on a regular basis and\n\n220\n00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.140\nif you have to figure it out.\n\n221\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.663\nYou don't remember what to do.\n\n222\n00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:40.457\nOr it's your first time setting\nup the OLEDB template for\n\n223\n00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:43.090\ndatabases you're not quite sure.\n\n224\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.420\nTake a look at the steps ahead of time.\n\n225\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.200\nMake sure you have all\nthe information you need,\n\n226\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.770\nmake sure you know what's going on in\nthere, you're comfortable with it.\n\n227\n00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.890\nSo, it gives us a nice way of just\nfiguring all this out, as you can see.\n\n228\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.370\nAnd it shows us, or tells us,\nwhere we can go and actually take a look.\n\n229\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.220\nIt tells us how to read the information,\nunderstand it, and\n\n230\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.460\nexplains a little bit about it.\n\n231\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.210\nIt does this for\nevery one of these, by the way.\n\n232\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.558\nSo all of them are listed over here,\non the left in the nav bar, every one of\n\n233\n00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:08.961\nthe templates has this kind of explanation\nand detail associated with it.\n\n234\n00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.260\nAnd you can go ahead and\nlook it up and see what's there.\n\n235\n00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.480\nAnd we have all these URL's\nin the show notes for\n\n236\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.290\nyou by template, with a brief\nlittle explanation of each one.\n\n237\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.139\nJust a high level explanation as\nto what they are and what they do.\n\n238\n00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:23.675\nSo let's go back in here real quick,\nlet me just go back into our environment,\n\n239\n00:11:23.675 --> 00:11:28.100\nand let's create one of these kinda\nstart to finish, show you the process.\n\n240\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.830\nSo I'm gonna go back here to authoring,\nwhere we just were.\n\n241\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.364\nI'm gonna use the TCP port monitor,\n\n242\n00:11:32.364 --> 00:11:34.940\njust because it doesn't require\na lot of setup information,\n\n243\n00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.125\nI just have to have a machine name and\na port number, so it's very easy to do.\n\n244\n00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:41.435\nSo let's go ahead and let's do this,\nwe'll just right-click here,\n\n245\n00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.795\nadd monitoring wizard.\n\n246\n00:11:42.795 --> 00:11:44.175\nNow it doesn't matter by the way.\n\n247\n00:11:44.175 --> 00:11:46.405\nLet me cancel that all in just\na second and show you something.\n\n248\n00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:50.655\nIt doesn't matter if I click\non the template I wanna use,\n\n249\n00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:55.902\nit doesn't matter if I click up here at\nthe top of the the stack with manage it or\n\n250\n00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:58.452\nthe management pack templates,\nI'm gonna get the same wizard.\n\n251\n00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.030\nI'm gonna have to choose the template\nout of the first screen anyway, so\n\n252\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.029\nit's not like you must select\na template ahead of time.\n\n253\n00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:05.472\nYou start the same place\nregardless of where you are.\n\n254\n00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:07.712\nSo we'll just click up\nhere it's all the same,\n\n255\n00:12:07.712 --> 00:12:11.210\nthere's all of our templates we\njust select the appropriate one.\n\n256\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.750\nNow the nine that are there as I mentioned\nare there by default let me just move this\n\n257\n00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.990\nover while we're talking.\n\n258\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.976\nBut keep in mind that and I didn't talk\nabout this so I just wanna mention it\n\n259\n00:12:18.976 --> 00:12:21.627\nquick while we're doing this that\nthese do come from Microsoft,\n\n260\n00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:22.652\nthey are pre populated.\n\n261\n00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:26.303\nYou will depending on the vendors\nmanagement packs you download,\n\n262\n00:12:26.303 --> 00:12:29.172\npotentially get more of\nthese templates created and\n\n263\n00:12:29.172 --> 00:12:33.430\nloaded as part of bringing in either\nMicrosoft-centric management packs.\n\n264\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.670\nWe've talked about that and the fact\nthat you may go out to the catalog and\n\n265\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.130\ndownload them directly.\n\n266\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.370\nOr install them by downloading to disk and\nthen importing them to disk,\n\n267\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.615\ndifferent options there.\n\n268\n00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:46.146\nBut if you do that with R templates,\nMicrosoft's templates and or\n\n269\n00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:49.562\nthird party templates,\ndoesn't matter who you get them from.\n\n270\n00:12:49.562 --> 00:12:53.876\nI mentioned VMware has management packs\nthat they will provide for managing their\n\n271\n00:12:53.876 --> 00:12:58.140\ninfrastructure, specifically the rise and\nview products, the DVI solution.\n\n272\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:03.230\nCitrix has them, Office365 for\nMicrosoft has it.\n\n273\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.360\nThere's a bunch of different stuff\nthat there some storage vendors\n\n274\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.900\nhave management packs or\nmanagement their infrastructure.\n\n275\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.110\nIf you download those and they've already\ngot templates built out, this list may\n\n276\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.056\nlook different for you in the Enterprise\nwhen you're doing this for real.\n\n277\n00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.383\nCuz you may have 10 or 12 or 15 in there,\n\n278\n00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:21.310\nbased on management packs you've\nbrought in so just keep that in mind.\n\n279\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.105\nBut these are the default ones.\n\n280\n00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:25.448\nObviously, if you're thinking about\npreparing for the exam, I'm going\n\n281\n00:13:25.448 --> 00:13:29.275\nto make sure you're getting the right\nknowledge and focusing the right areas.\n\n282\n00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:33.315\nIt would be important to know the default\nmanagement packs that start out in terms\n\n283\n00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:34.285\nof the template here.\n\n284\n00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:38.155\nThe templates that are there, the nine,\nanything that may show up additionally,\n\n285\n00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:40.885\nprobably not testable cuz who knows\nif it will be there or not, and\n\n286\n00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:42.500\nyou wouldn't really worry about those.\n\n287\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.750\nBut knowledge of the nine that do start\nout probably good idea to know what they\n\n288\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.560\nare, right?\n\n289\n00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.313\nAnd have general idea of what they are and\nwhat they're used for.\n\n290\n00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:52.363\nSo we'll choose TCP port monitor here,\nclick Next,\n\n291\n00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:58.725\ngive this a name I'll call this port1345\nit doesn't matter what we call it.\n\n292\n00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:01.715\nAgain, we always, as we've talked about,\nmake a choice on our management pack.\n\n293\n00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:03.955\nI'm just gonna put this in\nthe default management pack.\n\n294\n00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:07.508\nThis is, remember, one of the management\npacks that's unsealed that we can use as\n\n295\n00:14:07.508 --> 00:14:08.543\na catch all container.\n\n296\n00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:12.807\nWe may create our own custom management\npack, you saw on some prior episodes.\n\n297\n00:14:12.807 --> 00:14:14.829\nWe used our Cherokee management pack and\n\n298\n00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:18.107\nwe used that to contain a lot of\nthe overrides and choices we made.\n\n299\n00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.157\nIt really would be just be up to\nus to decide how to do this, so\n\n300\n00:14:21.157 --> 00:14:22.793\nwe'll do that click Next.\n\n301\n00:14:22.793 --> 00:14:26.956\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll give this a computer name, so\n\n302\n00:14:26.956 --> 00:14:30.148\npubdzname01.practicelabs.com this\n\n303\n00:14:30.148 --> 00:14:35.123\nwill be my domain control that's\nrunning in my test environment.\n\n304\n00:14:35.123 --> 00:14:38.276\nAnd the port number, I think I said 1345.\n\n305\n00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:40.570\nNotice I have the ability to test that.\n\n306\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.980\nSo it'll go out and check to see\nwhether the machine is up and running.\n\n307\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.720\nAnd Cherokee, you were asking about this.\n\n308\n00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.360\nAnd saying, hey, is it gonna be,\ncan I check up time?\n\n309\n00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.132\nCan I check status?\n\n310\n00:14:49.132 --> 00:14:50.212\nIs the port up or not?\n\n311\n00:14:50.212 --> 00:14:53.960\nWe ultimately check whether the port's\navailable and the port's active.\n\n312\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.880\nBut notice we don't have any of the\nconfiguration items in the wizard here.\n\n313\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.650\nWe're just specifying machine and\nport pairing.\n\n314\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.774\nAnd the assumption is, that port on\nthat machine, is it running, yes or no?\n\n315\n00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:06.190\nThat's what the template will set up for\nus to monitor.\n\n316\n00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.160\nAnd the watcher node,\nwhich we'll get to here in a minute,\n\n317\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.460\nwhich is gonna be the remote machine\nthat is gonna do the monitoring.\n\n318\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.830\nWe just specify, hey,\nwhere do we wanna monitor from?\n\n319\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.747\nThat's the extent of what we configure,\nso nothing more than that.\n\n320\n00:15:16.747 --> 00:15:17.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n321\n00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.230\n&gt;&gt; So we're to click Next, at least,\nfor this particular template, anyway,\n\n322\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.450\nit's nothing more than that.\n\n323\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.786\nHere is our watcher note,\nthis is the agent manage computer,\n\n324\n00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:28.327\nthe machine that's got an agent on\nit that can be used to monitor.\n\n325\n00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:32.552\nNow if we have a lot of machines deployed\nin our infrastructure we maybe able to\n\n326\n00:15:32.552 --> 00:15:34.120\nchoose more than one.\n\n327\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.310\nThis is the SCOM machine, or\n\n328\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.530\nthe SCOM server that's sitting\nin the pool right now.\n\n329\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.430\nThe only SCOM server I have set up,\nso I'm using that one.\n\n330\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.698\nBut in a resource pool that's scaled out,\nI'd have multiple servers here.\n\n331\n00:15:45.698 --> 00:15:48.582\nJust choose whichever one would\nmake the most sense for us.\n\n332\n00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:52.459\nRemember, you may have servers in\ndifferent data centers You may have\n\n333\n00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:54.506\nservice in different geographies.\n\n334\n00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:57.532\nSo you may wanna monitor\neither local to this system or\n\n335\n00:15:57.532 --> 00:16:00.770\nperhaps remote depending on\nwhat you're looking to do.\n\n336\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.230\nSo you would have choices.\n\n337\n00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.180\nIt's really just up to you to\ndecide how to configure this.\n\n338\n00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.975\nAll right, so we're just gonna grab that.\n\n339\n00:16:06.975 --> 00:16:11.415\nNow you'll notice down here, run this\nquery every so many minutes and or so\n\n340\n00:16:11.415 --> 00:16:13.185\nmany seconds, hours, days.\n\n341\n00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:17.945\nWe may not wanna run this thing on\na non-stop basis cuz how often do you have\n\n342\n00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:21.480\nto wanna, or how often do you wanna check\nto see if a port is up and running.\n\n343\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.880\nI don't know, it depends on obviously the\nfunctionality of the app associated with\n\n344\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.590\nthe port and what you're doing.\n\n345\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.810\nBut you may not wanna run this\naggressively, maybe you wanna ping\n\n346\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.540\nthis every five minutes,\nsomething like that, whatever it is.\n\n347\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.750\nSo you'll specify what you want there,\nright, so\n\n348\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.310\nI'm gonna leave at\nthe default of two minutes.\n\n349\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.920\nIt's up to you to decide.\n\n350\n00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.270\nThere's no right and wrong.\n\n351\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.330\nThere's no, hey, it's got to be this or\nelse kind of thing.\n\n352\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.750\nEvery one of these templates will\nhave different configurations.\n\n353\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.200\nThis is a one size fits\none thought process.\n\n354\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.560\nYou're taking a generic template\noff the shelf, applying it and\n\n355\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.040\nwrapping it around your needs and\nthe infrastructure and tailor it.\n\n356\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.950\nKinda nipping and tucking.\n\n357\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.970\nWhat we call scoping and tailoring\nthe template in order to make it fit\n\n358\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.240\nthe specificity of what kind of monitoring\nand what kind of information you want.\n\n359\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.400\nSo don't be afraid to make changes here,\nright.\n\n360\n00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.070\nYou're not gonna blow anything up,\nyou're not gonna make a mistake.\n\n361\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.510\nThis is not like, wow, how could you do\nthat for five minutes, and not for two?\n\n362\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.140\nYou decide what makes sense for you.\n\n363\n00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking,\n\n364\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.580\nI wonder if you did decide to make\na significant change in that increment.\n\n365\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.230\nIf you were using some kind of heuristics\nbased intrusion detection system,\n\n366\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.150\nif it may bring up that alert because\nit's a different type of behavior.\n\n367\n00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.280\nWould the checking of the port,\nenumerating those ports and calling out.\n\n368\n00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.000\nSo if you just have an influx,\nan increase of that,\n\n369\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.210\nyour IDS might be alerted to that?\n\n370\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.380\n&gt;&gt; Anything is possible.\n\n371\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.630\nIt would depend on several factors\nincluding the thresholds you've\n\n372\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.615\nspecified in your IDS, or\nmost likely today an IDPS,\n\n373\n00:17:52.615 --> 00:17:57.040\nbecause the way we refer to them these\ndays is just combined all in one device.\n\n374\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.190\nBut you whether it's IDS, IP whatever\nyou know what I'm talking about.\n\n375\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.655\nAny of those devices, right.\n\n376\n00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:05.630\nWhether it's an IDS, an IPS, whether it's-\n&gt;&gt; Parameter protection.\n\n377\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.140\n&gt;&gt; Some sort of parameter protection\ngateway scanning monitoring device.\n\n378\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.540\nIt's always possible\nthere's no doubt about it.\n\n379\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.690\nIt would depend on a lot of variables,\nmonitoring rates, what you're false\n\n380\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.850\npositive thresholds are,\nhow you tuned or tweaked it.\n\n381\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.470\nIt would also depend on,\nas you pointed out,\n\n382\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.380\nthe actual monitoring capabilities and\nthe specificity of monitoring.\n\n383\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.329\nCuz if it's heuristics-\n&gt;&gt; Like the analysis engine?\n\n384\n00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:34.289\n&gt;&gt; Right, well if it's heuristics based it\nwould behave very differently from a rule\n\n385\n00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:35.430\nbased engine, right.\n\n386\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.810\nBecause a rule based engine will\nreally just do a static binary match.\n\n387\n00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.140\nIt's this or it's not.\n\n388\n00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.390\nIf it is, allow or deny.\n\n389\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.960\nIf it's not, allow or deny.\n\n390\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.760\nIf it's looking at real time almost what\nwe would call artificially intelligent\n\n391\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.840\nlearning, which is a derivative\nof what those models do,\n\n392\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.940\nit would behave very differently\ncuz it looks at traffic flows.\n\n393\n00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.460\nIt could be protocol anomaly based,\nit could be traffic anomaly based.\n\n394\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.850\nThere's different ways we\nimplement these systems.\n\n395\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.900\nSo a lot of it would have to depend on\nthe nature of the engine, cuz we may or\n\n396\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.420\nmay not see that behavior based\non the kind of engine it is.\n\n397\n00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.730\nBut there's definitely a possibility\nthere, that that could get in the way.\n\n398\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.490\nYou're right.\nSo it would be just a lateral\n\n399\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.840\nthing to consider and maybe be aware of,\nso it's a good observation.\n\n400\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.810\nA good thought process for\nus to keep in mind as well.\n\n401\n00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.620\nAll right, so\nyou see we have our monitor there.\n\n402\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.720\nAnd now that we've done that\nwe can go back over here.\n\n403\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.154\nIt will show up here under\n\n404\n00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:28.505\nTCP checks state under\nthe Synthetic Transactions Folder.\n\n405\n00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:29.575\nYou notice it's not there yet.\n\n406\n00:19:29.575 --> 00:19:31.445\nThat's the first one we\nhad when we started.\n\n407\n00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:33.955\nWe just wanna right click,\ndo a refresh there.\n\n408\n00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:37.137\nIt will pop in eventually once\nit instantiates and goes live.\n\n409\n00:19:37.137 --> 00:19:39.290\nSo it will take a couple\nof minutes to show up,\n\n410\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.750\nbut eventually it will show up there,\nand then it will start monitoring.\n\n411\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.520\nRemember, although we set it up and\ndeployed it, it doesn't show up right away\n\n412\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.300\nhere because it take a couple of\nminutes to go out, reach out, spin up.\n\n413\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.750\nWe said do that every two minutes, so\n\n414\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.958\nthere will be a little\nlag before it shows up.\n\n415\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.781\nBut I had set the first one up\nbefore we started the episode so\n\n416\n00:19:55.781 --> 00:19:59.113\nyou could actually see it cuz I let\nit run for about 5 or 10 minutes and\n\n417\n00:19:59.113 --> 00:20:01.911\nmade sure it was up and running and\nthat it was monitoring.\n\n418\n00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:06.730\nAnd so when we highlight this one,\nwe can go in, you'll see here.\n\n419\n00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.290\nAnd we can open up,\njust to see what's there, we can open up\n\n420\n00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.630\nthe Health Explorer for the monitor,\nkinda see what's happening with it.\n\n421\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.180\nWe can open up different views here.\n\n422\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.010\nWe've been through these views before and\ntalked about all this stuff and\n\n423\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.150\nwhat the Health Explorer would show us.\n\n424\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.080\nThe state changes on the system and\nhow they're happening and why.\n\n425\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.330\nWe can see Alert View and\nsee what's going on.\n\n426\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.840\nSo we have different options,\nnotice as we always try to call out,\n\n427\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.190\nbut we have a link to\nthe Ops Manager Shell.\n\n428\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.249\nCan actually load PowerShell with\nthe module for Ops Manager for\n\n429\n00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:36.910\nalready preconfigured right here,\nand then jump in and\n\n430\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.190\nmaybe do some administration\nfrom this point.\n\n431\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.460\nSo we have a lot of different options\nhere, we do a lot of different things.\n\n432\n00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.940\nAll right, so this is what our templates\nare, management pack templates look like.\n\n433\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.911\nJust want to make sure you're familiar\nwith this, you have a sense of this.\n\n434\n00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:52.220\nCuz this is one of the key ways that we\ncan leverage customization cuz we have all\n\n435\n00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.798\nthese prebuilt templates.\n\n436\n00:20:53.798 --> 00:20:57.098\nAnd we can jump in and start using\nthem and deploy them to our advantage,\n\n437\n00:20:57.098 --> 00:21:00.740\nvery easily, based on the kind of\nusage profiles we want to achieve.\n\n438\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.520\nAnother way we could customize\nmonitoring would be through something\n\n439\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.040\ncalled Global Service Monitoring.\n\n440\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.500\nLet's just bring this up here, kind of\nput this right up at the top there so\n\n441\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.450\nyou can see this.\n\n442\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.860\nGlobal Service Monitoring is\nthe idea Of being able to go out and\n\n443\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.310\nbeing able to use these watcher notes,\nthose system center machines, that\n\n444\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.250\nare gonna be able to look in, as we were\njust talking about, with our template.\n\n445\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.138\nBut these are special watcher nodes.\n\n446\n00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:26.630\nThese are nodes that\nMicrosoft maintains globally\n\n447\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.260\nin their data centers around the world.\n\n448\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.420\nThere's a list I was just\nshowing you as I scrolled up,\n\n449\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.374\nI'll go back to it in a minute.\n\n450\n00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:35.012\nThere's 16 different nodes maintained\naround the world based on geography.\n\n451\n00:21:35.012 --> 00:21:39.471\nAnd we can leverage those and do inbound\nmonitoring of our traffic flows for\n\n452\n00:21:39.471 --> 00:21:41.110\nweb services and web apps.\n\n453\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.450\nSo we can look at, essentially,\nqueue and transaction and\n\n454\n00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:48.720\nlatency related issues from\nthe customer's perspective from outside\n\n455\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.200\nby using Global Service Monitoring.\n\n456\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.270\nCuz one of the downsides of monitoring\nin enterprise architecture with tools,\n\n457\n00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.449\nany kind of tool,\nnot just this tool but any tool,\n\n458\n00:21:58.449 --> 00:22:03.746\nis 99.999% of the monitoring is done\nfrom inside the data center on the LAN,\n\n459\n00:22:03.746 --> 00:22:08.363\non the infrastructure itself that we\nare serving services up through and\n\n460\n00:22:08.363 --> 00:22:11.944\nwe're looking at all the stuff\nthat's going on there.\n\n461\n00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:14.040\nBut it's all from the server\nside perspective, right.\n\n462\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.950\nWe see it essentially back stage,\nbehind the scenes.\n\n463\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.020\nIt's very rare that we're able to go\nout in front of that infrastructure and\n\n464\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.076\nmonitor inbound to be able to\nsee what the customer sees.\n\n465\n00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:27.680\nSo we wind up, a lot of the times,\nbeing in a reactive\n\n466\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.840\nmode from the customer's perspective\nwhen they complained about performance.\n\n467\n00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.986\nBecause if we didn't pick up the fact that\nthere was a gap in performance on the back\n\n468\n00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:37.740\nend side, on the server side in the stack.\n\n469\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.950\nAnd if the gap is happening in\nthe front where it's a traffic issue,\n\n470\n00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.890\nit's an inbound issue of some kind,\nwe may not be monitoring to pick that up.\n\n471\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.690\nI'm not suggesting we don't, I'm not\nsuggesting we can't, we do, we should,\n\n472\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.890\nand we can.\n\n473\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.860\nI just want to point out\nthat it's not as likely for\n\n474\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.670\nus to be doing that,\nbecause until recently\n\n475\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.960\na lot of these tools were not integrated\nfully to incorporate that capability.\n\n476\n00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.790\nBut we, on the Microsoft side,\ncertainly with SCOM, have this capability.\n\n477\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.405\nThis is not new, but it is newer\nto the 12 version of the product,\n\n478\n00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:12.600\nyou could not have done this in\nSystem Center, SCOM 20, or 2007.\n\n479\n00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.470\nThis is a newer feature for\nus in the 12, 12 R-2 stack.\n\n480\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.910\nMany of the competitive products that we\nhave in market that do what SCOM does,\n\n481\n00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.080\nwhat System Center does,\nhave this capability.\n\n482\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.810\nThe solar Winds product,\nthe Orion product that you\n\n483\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.420\nmay be familiar with if you use there,\nhas this kind of a capability.\n\n484\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.040\nIt's not called Global Service Monitor,\nbut it's something like that.\n\n485\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.796\nAll the different products out there\nthese days are capable of doing\n\n486\n00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:35.721\nsomething like this.\n\n487\n00:23:35.721 --> 00:23:38.021\nSo it is a really important feature, but\n\n488\n00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:41.677\nit's one that gives us the benefit\nof looking from the outside in\n\n489\n00:23:41.677 --> 00:23:45.759\nto monitor that additional piece that\nwe really need to get a handle on.\n\n490\n00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:48.505\nNow, the thing to know about this,\nat least currently,\n\n491\n00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:51.197\nWith the way Microsoft sets this up and\nleverages this,\n\n492\n00:23:51.197 --> 00:23:54.350\nyou will get access to this if\nyou're using System Center.\n\n493\n00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.610\nBut, and there's always a catch, right?\n\n494\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.570\nThere's always a but, customers that\npurchase System Center, normally.\n\n495\n00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.600\nWhen you buy it from Microsoft or buy it\nthrough a VAR or a LAR, value added or\n\n496\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.990\na large account reseller.\n\n497\n00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.578\nSo the CDWs and the software ones and\nsoft marks and soft choices of the world,\n\n498\n00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:13.483\nwhatever those LARs and\nVARs are in your region.\n\n499\n00:24:13.483 --> 00:24:16.756\nWhen you buy it from them or buy direct\nit from Microsoft you always have options\n\n500\n00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:18.545\nwhen you pay for software, right?\n\n501\n00:24:18.545 --> 00:24:22.495\nYou can buy under different agreements and\ndifferent pricing models, so\n\n502\n00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:24.495\nif you have an enterprise agreement,\nwe call it EA,\n\n503\n00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:29.620\nand you have software insurance with your\nlicensing when you buy the software.\n\n504\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.750\nIf you buy with software assurance,\n\n505\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.390\nyou get access to Global Service\nMonitoring as part of the package.\n\n506\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.830\nIt's included in other words.\n\n507\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.580\nAnd you have access to through\nthe Azure fabric to be able to leverage\n\n508\n00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.010\nGlobal Service Monitoring.\n\n509\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.520\nWe can monitor external\nfacing web apps from\n\n510\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.190\nthe cloud to be able to give you that\nperformance data that you're looking for.\n\n511\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.940\nIf you buy System Center\nwithout software assurance,\n\n512\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.310\nno Global Service Monitoring for\nyou, right?\n\n513\n00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.100\n&gt;&gt; Good to know,\nthis is a really cool feature and\n\n514\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.990\nI will definitely want to use it.\n\n515\n00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.380\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; How is working within that\n\n516\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.200\nglobal scope there.\n\n517\n00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.370\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's very cool.\n\n518\n00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.410\nIt's very, very cool feature.\n\n519\n00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.920\nSo we do need to understand that\nessentially leveraging the Azure Fabric\n\n520\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.210\nto do inbound monitoring of our cloud\nfacing web apps, but we have to have\n\n521\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.990\nsoftware assurance attached to our\npurchase to be able to get access to this.\n\n522\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.070\nIf we go back and take a look here,\njust wanna take a look and\n\n523\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.620\nshow you the list of\nwhere these things are.\n\n524\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.640\nYou'll see down here, and again,\nthis list will vary by time.\n\n525\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.960\nIn other words, I'm not suggesting\nthat forever and a day going forward,\n\n526\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.830\nMicrosoft's gonna have these 16 watcher\nnodes stood up in these geographies.\n\n527\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.810\nCurrently when we're shooting this\nepisode this is what you see.\n\n528\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.020\nYou go out to the web, check it.\n\n529\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.910\nYou obviously get an up to date status.\n\n530\n00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.050\nBut you could see scattered around\nthe world based on geography.\n\n531\n00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.270\nWe have a bunch of these notes that can be\nleveraged, and we'll be able to use them.\n\n532\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.750\nYou set this up and\n\n533\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.650\nobviously have to have an Azure Fabric\naccount to be able to leverage this.\n\n534\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.110\nSo you're gonna go ahead and\n\n535\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.079\nthere's instructions here\non how to get started up.\n\n536\n00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.660\nYou go up here just to the, hey how do I\nsign up and how do I get into the system\n\n537\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.150\npage, getting started with global service\nmonitor, signing in and setting up.\n\n538\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.060\nYou follow the information here.\n\n539\n00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.960\nMake sure that you have all the prereqs.\n\n540\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.434\nWe need the Window's Identity Foundation\ninstalled and\n\n541\n00:26:03.434 --> 00:26:06.020\nrunning on the computers that's\ngonna do the monitoring.\n\n542\n00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.090\nSo we have to download that.\n\n543\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.590\nSo there's some information\nabout how to get that here.\n\n544\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.060\nThen you restart the health services.\n\n545\n00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.590\nBunch of stuff you just have to\ngo through and take a look at.\n\n546\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.330\nYou then have to go ahead and import the\nGlobal Service Monitor Management Pack so\n\n547\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.550\nthere are steps involved\nwith setting this up.\n\n548\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.620\nAll the links are here on the pages.\n\n549\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.760\nYou're able to go ahead and just follow\nthe instructions and configure this.\n\n550\n00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.413\nSo it will be important for\nyou to take a look and\n\n551\n00:26:27.413 --> 00:26:31.292\njust make sure you're familiar with this,\nbut this is probably one\n\n552\n00:26:31.292 --> 00:26:36.194\nof the coolest new qoute unquote features\nin the System Center 2012, 12 SP1,\n\n553\n00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:40.514\n12 R2 pack, in the sense of all\nthe different versions of this product.\n\n554\n00:26:40.514 --> 00:26:45.064\nThis is probably one of the newest and\ncoolest features that we point to, if,\n\n555\n00:26:45.064 --> 00:26:47.090\nobviously it's relative.\n\n556\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.450\nIf you are a global enterprise, or\neven a local regional enterprise, but\n\n557\n00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.000\nare serving up applications and services\nthrough the web, and you're struggling\n\n558\n00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.620\nwith what that performance looks like from\nthe customer perspective, boy, have we got\n\n559\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.780\na function for you, cuz this is exactly\nwhat this tool's designed to address.\n\n560\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.470\nSo, it's actually kinda neat,\ndefinitely should check it out.\n\n561\n00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.440\nIt is a valuable addition for\nour ability to be able to customize and\n\n562\n00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.550\nto pull monitoring data in\nto complete that circle\n\n563\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.260\nof knowledge around who\nthe application performs.\n\n564\n00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.810\nGot one more thing I wanna talk about\nwith you as we talk about extending and\n\n565\n00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.230\ncustomizing monitoring.\n\n566\n00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.270\nWe've got the ability.\n\n567\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.061\nActually, two things I like cuz\none is good, but two is better.\n\n568\n00:27:23.061 --> 00:27:23.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're talking\n\n569\n00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.100\nabout two things really quickly.\n\n570\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:25.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We have two things,\n\n571\n00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.550\none is System Center Advisor.\n\n572\n00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.040\nYou may or may not know it by that name.\n\n573\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.310\nLet me just quickly show you the thought\nprocess I'm speaking about here.\n\n574\n00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.960\nAnd just extend our lab monitor real\nquick, so we don't lose our connection.\n\n575\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.920\nSo here, in the admin area,\ndown at the bottom right here.\n\n576\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.940\nSystem Center Advisor has been\nintegrated into the console in 12 R2.\n\n577\n00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.800\nWe don't have to go out and actually\nset this up separately anymore, and\n\n578\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.710\ninstall, configure.\n\n579\n00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.260\nIt's all been integrated for us.\n\n580\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.700\nBut what this really does is let's us\nthrough the Advisor connection here,\n\n581\n00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.030\nyou're able to go out and leverage\nthe Azure Fabric to be able to do in-depth\n\n582\n00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:05.530\nmonitoring and information inside\ngathering on configuration on your system.\n\n583\n00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:11.480\nSo, think SQL Server, think your web\nserver, think your operating system stack.\n\n584\n00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.960\nWe can monitor those and say hey,\n\n585\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.930\nfrom a best practice perspective these\nthings may need to be set up this way.\n\n586\n00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.420\nOr you're not optimized that we\ncan make recommendations to you.\n\n587\n00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.740\nSo, you're gonna have to\nleverage the Azure Fabric and\n\n588\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.380\nthe Azure capabilities to do this.\n\n589\n00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.610\nTalked about this in the prior episode,\n\n590\n00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.400\nI showed you the Azure website, showed you\nhow you could sign up for a free trial.\n\n591\n00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.530\nYou get the $200 in credit\nto start the process off.\n\n592\n00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.990\nSo we've talked about the logic here,\nbut Log Analytics is what the system\n\n593\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:42.420\ncenter advisor on the Azure side is\nessentially morphed into and is linked to.\n\n594\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.380\nAnd so this page right here\njust gives you a little bit\n\n595\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.810\nof information about the concept and how\nwe leverage System Center Advisor today.\n\n596\n00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.500\nYou'll notice here we collect,\nstore, and analyze log data.\n\n597\n00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.340\nWe develop actionable insights,\n\n598\n00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.955\nhence the concept, the name into or\nusing in-built intelligence.\n\n599\n00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:02.080\nEssentially, pre-built filters and\npre-built templates would say,\n\n600\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.270\nhey, your system should look this way,\nif you're running SQL Sever 14,\n\n601\n00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.030\nto be able to do this.\n\n602\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.700\nAnd it doesn't look that that way, here's\nthe recommendations you should follow\n\n603\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.970\nto make it look like this right,\nto reconfigure it.\n\n604\n00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.540\nAnd that's more or less what we're doing.\n\n605\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.118\nSo you can use this, it is integrated, but\n\n606\n00:29:18.118 --> 00:29:22.430\nagain you must have an account on\nAzure Fabric to integrate the two.\n\n607\n00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:26.290\nThat screen that I showed you in\nthe System Center Ops Manger console\n\n608\n00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.640\non the right where it has that little\nlink that says essentially configure.\n\n609\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.050\nYou'll get a log on screen,\n\n610\n00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.800\nyou'll have to sign up and provide your\naccount credentials into the Fabric here.\n\n611\n00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.680\nTo link you to the Azure Fabric and\n\n612\n00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.980\nstart leveraging that to be able to\nmonitor your SCOM infrastructure.\n\n613\n00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.100\nSo you'll need to go in\nto set up an account,\n\n614\n00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.160\nyou can obviously do\nthat right from there.\n\n615\n00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.350\nFollow the information here\nto be able to integrate this.\n\n616\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.110\nBut just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n617\n00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.620\nThe other thing that I just wanted to talk\nabout was the ability to create Visio\n\n618\n00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.000\ndashboards and leverage Visio to\nbe able to use not just Visio, but\n\n619\n00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.140\nSCOM, Visio, and SharePoint.\n\n620\n00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.410\nThree specific products that we can link\ntogether to further extend our ability\n\n621\n00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.920\nto understand and\nconsume our monitoring data.\n\n622\n00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.080\nBut also to customize the ways\nin which we leverage that data,\n\n623\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.400\nto make systems operationally\nbetter over time.\n\n624\n00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.770\nWe can link our output\nfrom our monitoring,\n\n625\n00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.260\ninto a Visio-enabled dashboard.\n\n626\n00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.825\nWe can publish that to SharePoint\nthrough SharePoint web parts.\n\n627\n00:30:20.825 --> 00:30:24.145\nAnd the nice thing about this is,\nthis is real time updates or\n\n628\n00:30:24.145 --> 00:30:25.935\nnear real time meaning\nit's not every second.\n\n629\n00:30:25.935 --> 00:30:28.825\nYou'll specify the data feed and\nhow often it'll pull the data.\n\n630\n00:30:28.825 --> 00:30:31.730\nBut let's say every 30 seconds,\nevery minute, whatever you want.\n\n631\n00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.030\nWe're updating or refreshing this data\nthrough a connection on the back and\n\n632\n00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.680\nback into SharePoint and\n\n633\n00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.000\nthose dashboards now become actionable\nintelligence features force cuz we could\n\n634\n00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.145\nsee our systems updating in real time and\nwe could see the status of them.\n\n635\n00:30:44.145 --> 00:30:47.010\nNow we've talked about\nthis inside SCOM itself.\n\n636\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.090\nOne of the views that Cherokee likes a lot\nthat we've played with and talked about,\n\n637\n00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:54.300\nthe network view where we see all those\nmaps that essentially pull down and\n\n638\n00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.570\nwe see the status of everything.\n\n639\n00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.520\nThat's similar to what\nwe're talking about, but\n\n640\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.530\nimagine taking that to the next level.\n\n641\n00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.230\nCreating that, porting it to Visio.\n\n642\n00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.700\nThen connecting those Visio elements\nback to their objects in SCOM.\n\n643\n00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.920\nFeeding the data that updates the status,\nand\n\n644\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.520\nthen representing them in\nthe web through SharePoint.\n\n645\n00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.310\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat we're going here.\n\n646\n00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.290\nSo this website will give us\njust a little insight into this.\n\n647\n00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.800\nIt gives you all the information about the\nrequired back-end software that's needed,\n\n648\n00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.640\nthe versions, where to download it all,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n649\n00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.545\nYou need SCOM 2012 R2 running,\nwe've got that.\n\n650\n00:31:25.545 --> 00:31:28.175\nSharePoint 2010 or greater,\nhopefully you have that.\n\n651\n00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:30.235\nObviously you need SharePoint\nto be able to do this.\n\n652\n00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:32.845\nWe've got the Visio web part for\nSharePoint, again 2010 or\n\n653\n00:31:32.845 --> 00:31:35.125\nbetter depending on what\nversion you're running.\n\n654\n00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:36.743\nThere's a link to download right there.\n\n655\n00:31:36.743 --> 00:31:40.914\nWe need Visio itself running,\n2010 or better today, may be 2013,\n\n656\n00:31:40.914 --> 00:31:43.522\n2016 but\nyou need this year to actually port\n\n657\n00:31:43.522 --> 00:31:47.044\nthe objects out cuz you'll\nessentialy extract them from SCOM,\n\n658\n00:31:47.044 --> 00:31:51.697\nsave them off, open them in Visio, do some\nediting and then crate the connections.\n\n659\n00:31:51.697 --> 00:31:54.958\nAnd then you need add in for\nSCOM 2012, the Visio add in.\n\n660\n00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:58.864\nAgain, all the links are here to download\nso everything you need is right there.\n\n661\n00:31:58.864 --> 00:32:02.873\nThen you'll see here we go ahead and\nwe create a configure a dashboard, so\n\n662\n00:32:02.873 --> 00:32:06.310\nyou go ahead and\ncreate a dashboard that looks like this.\n\n663\n00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.760\nAnd then, once that's done,\nyou go ahead and set this up and\n\n664\n00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.120\nconfigure the data source, so\npretty straightforward, pretty standard.\n\n665\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.300\nDo all that, then we go ahead and\nwe add our data links in so\n\n666\n00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.140\nthat we can add them in.\n\n667\n00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.770\nAnd you'll see there the add in for sComm.\n\n668\n00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:25.150\nOnce we've done all that, and we save\nthat off, and we specify our information,\n\n669\n00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.210\nrepeat the process for\neverything as we go, map everything.\n\n670\n00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.390\nThen once we're done, we go ahead,\nyou could see edit the data graphic,\n\n671\n00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:35.060\nmake sure we provide all\nthe information for it.\n\n672\n00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.410\nAnd then we've got this nice little\ndashboard that gets set up and\n\n673\n00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.550\nbecomes enabled, and\nI know it's kind of bright and\n\n674\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:44.190\ncrazy cuz it's all green, got one\nlittle lonely red item right there.\n\n675\n00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.720\n&gt;&gt; That is good news, though right, Adam?\n\n676\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.320\n&gt;&gt; That is good news, right?\n\n677\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.120\nAll right, then you see we save it and\n\n678\n00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.410\nnow we're gonna import it into,\nultimately the SharePoint Web Part.\n\n679\n00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.150\nYou can see the Web Part down there.\n\n680\n00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.790\nThere's our Select a Web Drawing Visio Web\nPart running in SharePoint in case you\n\n681\n00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.840\nhaven't seen it before.\n\n682\n00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.060\nPut it out on the SharePoint page,\nlink it so we have the data information.\n\n683\n00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.130\nThat's now what this will\nactually look like, and\n\n684\n00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.270\nyou'll see that now we bring\nup a SharePoint website and\n\n685\n00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:14.490\nwe've got this nice dashboard sitting\nthere that can be refreshed and used.\n\n686\n00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:19.200\nAny senior level manager,\nline of business owner, IT professional\n\n687\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.560\nthat needs to consume this data, think\nabout help desks for instance, right.\n\n688\n00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.610\nThey want to see the status of systems.\n\n689\n00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.284\nI have customers that do this\nin their nocs that are ufc's,\n\n690\n00:33:27.284 --> 00:33:29.620\nwhere they've got them\nup on the huge screens.\n\n691\n00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.852\nAnd they're monitoring their systems,\nright, in real time.\n\n692\n00:33:31.852 --> 00:33:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And they're able to see this.\n\n693\n00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.429\nAnd they're doing it with SharePoint and\nwith sComm and\n\n694\n00:33:35.429 --> 00:33:38.385\nVizio instead of whatever the other\nproducts are out there that do this.\n\n695\n00:33:38.385 --> 00:33:39.960\nAnd again it's a lot of\nproducts that can do this.\n\n696\n00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.320\nBut you will be able to create\nsomething like this and set this up.\n\n697\n00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.300\nSo integrating real time Vizio feeds or\n\n698\n00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.740\ndata feeds into a Vizio\ndashboard in SharePoint.\n\n699\n00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.579\nIt's yet another way we can extend and\ncustomize our monitoring.\n\n700\n00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:52.682\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n701\n00:33:52.682 --> 00:33:53.938\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, hopefully.\n\n702\n00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:56.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I worked all night on that.\n\n703\n00:33:56.897 --> 00:33:59.946\nAll right, but hopefully this is just\na taste for you of different ways we can\n\n704\n00:33:59.946 --> 00:34:03.440\napproach customizing, extending, and\nreally leveraging the monitoring in sComm.\n\n705\n00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.140\n&gt;&gt; We don't have anything like\nthat here currently at ITPro TV.\n\n706\n00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.410\nWe have boards that display\nother analytical information,\n\n707\n00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:14.066\nbut I don't know maybe we\ncan talk them into it.\n\n708\n00:34:14.066 --> 00:34:16.017\n&gt;&gt; We?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n709\n00:34:16.017 --> 00:34:17.800\n&gt;&gt; You conversation I think, but\n\n710\n00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.950\nyes we certainly can look at whether or\nnot we can convince the powers to be that\n\n711\n00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:25.990\nmonitoring infrastructure with\nsomething like this would be valuable.\n\n712\n00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:28.483\nAnd then we could actually put that up and\nhave that running, that would be awesome.\n\n713\n00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:30.268\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n714\n00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Is that it for this particular episode?\n\n715\n00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.060\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Do you have any final thoughts?\n\n716\n00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.720\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n717\n00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n718\n00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm out of words,\nI have nothing left to say.\n\n719\n00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.620\n&gt;&gt; We did cover a lot of different\ntopics here, in looking at how to\n\n720\n00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.720\ncustomize our monitoring within sComm,\nso thank you Adam.\n\n721\n00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.690\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in with us today, but stay tuned,\n\n722\n00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.770\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n723\n00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.370\nWe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n724\n00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.510\nRemember, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n725\n00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam

configuring and\ndeploying a private cloud series.\n\n7\n00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.390\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.880\nIn this episode we'll be talking\nabout our Windows Azure Pack.\n\n9\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.020\nWith us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.560\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.511\n&gt;&gt; They saw me already, [CROSSTALK] was\nnice, I waved, they already know I'm here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:31.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's redundant.\n\n13\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.400\nWe should cut that part out.\n\n14\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.930\n&gt;&gt; Wasting time.\n\n15\n00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nAbsolutely not.\n\n16\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.820\nIt's always important\nwhen you say anything.\n\n17\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.640\nWe always pay attention when you talk.\n\n18\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.420\nAll right, so, let's talk,\nas Cherokee was just suggesting,\n\n19\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.710\nabout the Windows Azure Pack.\n\n20\n00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.540\nIt's kind of an interesting way\nto cap off our conversations and\n\n21\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.760\nround out a lot of the stuff we've\nbeen doing round system center,\n\n22\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.400\nops manager, system center virtual\nmachine manager, the app controller,\n\n23\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.120\nthe orchestrator,\nthe data protection manager.\n\n24\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.740\nWe've taken a look at and gone through\nand, in many cases, actually explored\n\n25\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.660\npretty significantly with these tools\naround how to ultimately control,\n\n26\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.900\nmanage, optimize, and deal with aspects\nof our private cloud in our data center.\n\n27\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.495\nOne of the things we have also\nspent a lot of time talking about\n\n28\n00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:18.225\nhas been the value add that Microsoft\nprovides with the Windows Azure fabric and\n\n29\n00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:21.405\nour capabilities to leverage\nthe Microsoft Cloud fabric.\n\n30\n00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:26.055\nTo be able to either enhance or data\ncenter offerings of private cloud on prem,\n\n31\n00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:31.095\nand or host them out in the cloud directly\nthrough Microsoft and their data centers,\n\n32\n00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:34.505\nas private cloud hosted through\nessentially an off prem solution.\n\n33\n00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.490\nHow to monitor, how to maintain it.\n\n34\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020\nWe talked about the operations manager’s\nsuite, or the OMS suite through Azure.\n\n35\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.385\nWe talked about Azure log analytics and\ninsights.\n\n36\n00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:47.800\nWe've talked about Azure backup and\nAzure Disaster recover capabilities,\n\n37\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.115\nwith site recovery, and a variety of\nthings that the platform provides.\n\n38\n00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.935\nBut one of the other little interesting\npieces that we just haven't really\n\n39\n00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.055\ntalked too much about is the idea\nof the Windows Azure pack.\n\n40\n00:01:57.055 --> 00:01:59.125\nAnd so if we go ahead and take a look, or\n\n41\n00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.410\nI should actually do that\nright up there somewhere.\n\n42\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.900\nWhen we do Windows Azure pack,\nyou'll see on the screen in front of you,\n\n43\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.570\nthe Windows Azure pack comes\nto us again from Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.670\nNo surprise there.\n\n45\n00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.570\nPart of the cloud platform offerings.\n\n46\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.620\nBut we have Azure,\nit says consistent experiences and\n\n47\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.160\nservices in our data center.\n\n48\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.000\nAnd what we really mean is that we have\na set of capabilities that are provided.\n\n49\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.760\nAnd they're provided,\n\n50\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.600\nby the way, at no cost to you\nif you're a Microsoft customer.\n\n51\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.210\nMeaning you could download and\nuse the Azure pack, assuming of course\n\n52\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.790\nyou have an Azure fabric subscription and\nyou're able to interact.\n\n53\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.000\nBut you can download and\n\n54\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.220\nuse the elements of this as a Microsoft\ncustomer consuming software.\n\n55\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.320\nAnd, we're going to be able to\nhave a framework of components.\n\n56\n00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.890\nWe'll take a look at what they\nare in just a moment here,\n\n57\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.120\nthat gives us the ability to be able\nto create additional capabilities,\n\n58\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.660\nflexibility, and\nmanageability across the cloud stack.\n\n59\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.270\nWhen we come down here you'll see some of\nthe key benefits Microsoft provides to us.\n\n60\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.020\nWe have a database as a service concept.\n\n61\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.370\nIt's called DBAS.\n\n62\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.470\nWe have Web PAAS or\nplatform as a service over the web.\n\n63\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.670\nIt's a developer friendly and\ndeveloper centric thought process.\n\n64\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.385\nWe do provide and have the ability to run\ninfrastructure as a service for hosting,\n\n65\n00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:12.470\nor creating hosting models for VMs,\nas we've talked about in other areas.\n\n66\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.710\nAnd we have the ability to deliver IT\nservices through the self-service portal.\n\n67\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.420\nRemember, I talked to you about\nthe fact that, with the app controller,\n\n68\n00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.840\nwe could create the self service\nportal and make it available to us.\n\n69\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.590\nThe Windows Azure Pack is the other piece\nthat provides that capability as well,\n\n70\n00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.820\non the Azure fabric side.\n\n71\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.650\nAnd so we have these capabilities.\n\n72\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.330\nWe've talked about them.\n\n73\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.820\nWe've looked at the app controller and\nsaw how that gets spun up already.\n\n74\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.690\nWe can do that and actually link that\nto the Azure fabric as we discussed.\n\n75\n00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.815\nAnd you saw that there.\n\n76\n00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:41.564\nLet's take a look at the features.\n\n77\n00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:42.206\nI'll just bring this up.\n\n78\n00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:44.850\nIt'll take just a second\nto roll over here.\n\n79\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.010\nAnd when we take a look,\nand we just come down,\n\n80\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.770\nlet's just expand this out,\nso we can see what's there.\n\n81\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.500\nThe capabilities and\nareas are parts of the Azure fabric or\n\n82\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.930\nthe Azure Management Pack that\nare making this up for us.\n\n83\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.390\nThe management portal for\nthe tenants, you can see here.\n\n84\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.960\nThis is the Azure consistent,\nit says customizable\n\n85\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.710\nself service portal to provision,\nmonitor and manage all of our services.\n\n86\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.170\nThings like as we saw in\nthe app controller, web sites,\n\n87\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.070\nvirtual machines and services.\n\n88\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.130\nThis is the app controller\non the Windows Azure side,\n\n89\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.570\nif you think about the logic of what you\nsaw when we looked at the app controller.\n\n90\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.380\nManagement portal for administrators.\n\n91\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.920\nThis is where we go to configure cloud\nresources, set up user accounts,\n\n92\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.530\nspecify tenants and tenant offerings,\nquotas, pricing, etc.\n\n93\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.270\nThis is where we go to configure\nthe backend administrative capabilities\n\n94\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.120\nto delegate, and\n\n95\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.885\nultimately to slice up Cloud resources\nper tenant in a multi-tenant environment.\n\n96\n00:04:38.885 --> 00:04:42.440\nBecause the piece, or\nthe specific descriptor that we need to\n\n97\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.590\nadd to the Windows Azure pack is the\nconfiguring of a self service multi tenant\n\n98\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.760\nCloud environment with Windows Azure pack,\n\n99\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.030\nbecause that's really what\nthis is designed for.\n\n100\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.550\nThis is not something necessarily\nthat an individual company\n\n101\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.435\njust with private on-prem cloud for\none customer, the company, is gonna need.\n\n102\n00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:04.055\nBecause we have multi-tenant\ncapabilities and management capabilities\n\n103\n00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:07.155\nat the multi-tenant environment\nlevel here with this.\n\n104\n00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:12.385\nThis is really for service providers or IT\norganizations as we suggested in the prior\n\n105\n00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:16.852\nepisodes where we talked about this\nconcept and showed you the app controller,\n\n106\n00:05:16.852 --> 00:05:21.292\ntalked about provisioning the self service\nthought process, the service templates,\n\n107\n00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:23.642\nall that stuff in those earlier episodes.\n\n108\n00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:27.572\nThis is really for that company that's\ndoing charge back and is carving up\n\n109\n00:05:27.572 --> 00:05:32.637\ntheir IT offerings and charging individual\ninternal customers for private cloud.\n\n110\n00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:35.452\nWhen we're doing this,\nthen the Windows Azure Pack for\n\n111\n00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:38.020\nthat multi tenant cloud\nenvironment makes sense.\n\n112\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.860\nBecause then we can set it up, and\ndelegate our specific requirements by\n\n113\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.230\nbusiness unit or delegate our specific\nneeds by internal customer, and\n\n114\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.450\ngive each one of those customers\nthe ability to log into that portal and\n\n115\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.960\nspin up their own infrastructure.\n\n116\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.550\nAnd that's really what we're talking about\nis how do we set up this front end and\n\n117\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.595\nallow customers to then come\nin after we administer it.\n\n118\n00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:01.550\nAnd the management portal for\nadmins lets us do that.\n\n119\n00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.210\nAnd then give the customer access to\nthe management portal for tenants.\n\n120\n00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.360\nTenants are customers, as we've described.\n\n121\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.070\nEach tenant is an owner of their own\ncloud resources, uniquely scoped and\n\n122\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.390\ntailored for them, hidden and filtered,\nessentially secured from all other tenants\n\n123\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.990\nrunning in common backend Infrastructure,\nessentially backend IaaS services, right?\n\n124\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.510\nWe're gonna have a common set,\nor pool of resources running for\n\n125\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.300\nthese individual tenants that\nare consuming the services.\n\n126\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.770\nAnd they're gonna be hosted there,\nisolated from each other, and\n\n127\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.040\nthat's what this does.\n\n128\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.650\nSo it is gonna be that whole concept\nwe keep referring to that I love,\n\n129\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.310\nthat bento box analogy that you gave us,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.520\nIt's gonna be what you said, not just\nin the last time we talked about this.\n\n131\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.040\nNot just the bento box, but\nit's highly modularized, right?\n\n132\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.630\nIt's highly compartmentalized.\n\n133\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.920\nAnd it's really what that thought\nprocess that, at least in my mind,\n\n134\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.890\nthat image that I get when we talk\nabout it, that's what this equates to.\n\n135\n00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.720\nBecause we're gonna give each one of\nthose tenants their own little box\n\n136\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.430\ninside the shell, or inside the bento box,\nits own little area.\n\n137\n00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.400\nAnd each one's gonna be isolated\noff from all the others.\n\n138\n00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.880\nAnd that's what we're going\nto be able to configure\n\n139\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.690\nright here in the management portal, and\n\n140\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.850\nthen give access to each tenant right here\nin the management portal for tenants.\n\n141\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.210\nExcuse me, for tenants.\n\n142\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.630\nAs I sound like Kermit the Frog.\n\n143\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.020\nWe have our service management API,\nor the management APIs.\n\n144\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.930\nThis gives us the ability to be able to\nspecify how we're going to execute our\n\n145\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.240\nwork, and what the conditions are from\na service standpoint to do that.\n\n146\n00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.040\nWe do have our websites here.\n\n147\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.960\nThis provides our scalable\nshared hosting platform for\n\n148\n00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.320\nboth asp.net and php websites.\n\n149\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.110\nWe talked about the support for\nboth of these in prior discussions.\n\n150\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.990\nAlso, no js or\nno .js web applications can be run.\n\n151\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.400\nSo we are going to open\nup our platform and\n\n152\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.450\nbecome more friendly across the, I guess,\ndeveloper ecosystem, if you will.\n\n153\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.570\nKirk, you and I were talking a little\nbit about this between episodes where,\n\n154\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.740\nyou know, Microsoft's really\nchanged that mindset we've seen,\n\n155\n00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.090\nas you were suggesting, right?\n\n156\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a new space and\nnew ideas.\n\n157\n00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.821\n&gt;&gt; And so as a result,\n\n158\n00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.351\nalso the capability to play nice with\nothers in the sand box preferably right?\n\n159\n00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:01.590\nSo we're opening up support for\nopen stack hosting.\n\n160\n00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.141\nWe've got SQL running on Linux and\n\n161\n00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:05.882\nall sorts of stuff that's going\non that just a few years ago.\n\n162\n00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:07.872\nWould never really have been a mindset or\n\n163\n00:08:07.872 --> 00:08:10.155\na thought process we\nwould have entertained,\n\n164\n00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:14.030\nat least not in a way that would have led\nus to believe that it would be possible.\n\n165\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.170\nNot that it couldn't be done,\nbut just that the mindset,\n\n166\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.300\nas you were pointing out, wasn't there\nto support it from the top-down,\n\n167\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.260\nin other words, and new day,\nnew management, new thought process, and\n\n168\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.220\nof course, as a result new capability,\nso that's kinda cool.\n\n169\n00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.990\nWe have our virtual machines there.\n\n170\n00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.370\nThese are going to be\nthe VMs either Linux or\n\n171\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.490\nWindows based as you can see that\nare running on the platform.\n\n172\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.750\nWe've talked about the idea of using VM\ntemplates, be able to drive deployment.\n\n173\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.530\nWe've showed you how to link those to\nservice templates in prior discussions.\n\n174\n00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.386\nSo we've taken a look at all that.\n\n175\n00:08:42.386 --> 00:08:45.757\nRemember, VMs based on Windows Hyper VMs\nsystem center, and we have a template\n\n176\n00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:49.176\ngallery, and we have the capability to be\nable to set up networking for them, and\n\n177\n00:08:49.176 --> 00:08:50.970\nconfigure them and manage them that way.\n\n178\n00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.000\nAnd you've seen a lot of the back-end\nof that on the system center side.\n\n179\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.360\nWe have our service bus here,\nthe service bus is gonna allow us to\n\n180\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.302\nbe able to provide messaging services\nbetween distributed applications.\n\n181\n00:09:01.302 --> 00:09:04.690\nAny kinda service bus, whenever we mention\nthat term, if you're a developer you're\n\n182\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.100\ncertainly probably already,\nyour ears are perking up.\n\n183\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.700\nYou're aware of that,\nyou know what that means.\n\n184\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.120\nThat's or internal plumbing, essentially,\n\n185\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.630\nour pipes, our conduits that allow\nus to move information back, and\n\n186\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.080\nforth in, and among, and between\napplications reliably, and consistently.\n\n187\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.440\nWe get our queued, and\ntoply based subscription, and\n\n188\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.390\nconsumption capabilities through this,\nas we note here.\n\n189\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.050\nWe have automation and extensibility.\n\n190\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.000\nWe've talked a lot about the fact that we\nare gonna have the ability to be able to\n\n191\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.970\nuse orchestrator, to be able to\ndo automation through workbooks.\n\n192\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.760\nWe have PowerShell support\nto standardize and automate.\n\n193\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.640\nWe've talked about a lot of the supporting\nelements that will go in here.\n\n194\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.990\nAnd we have database as a service,\n\n195\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.950\nwhat I mentioned is commonly\nreferred to as DBaaS today.\n\n196\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.900\nAnd database as a service\nallows us to be able to\n\n197\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.390\nleverage the capabilities of\neither SQL Server or MySQL.\n\n198\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.760\nAgain, a nod to that opening up of\nthe platform to alternate providers.\n\n199\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.910\nAnd so, an OpenStack Open Source Database\nprovider.\n\n200\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.370\nSo MySQL and/or Microsoft\nspecific SQL Server.\n\n201\n00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.630\nWe use this on the web app side behind the\nscenes as the databases for web hosting.\n\n202\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.890\nAnd so, we're able to provide that.\n\n203\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.950\nAnd we're able to use these\ncapabilities to be able to drive\n\n204\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.680\nthe use of the Azure Pack.\n\n205\n00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.750\nSo it's actually pretty exciting that\nwe have all these capabilities and\n\n206\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.300\nthe ability to be able to do this.\n\n207\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.330\nReally, this is an extensible framework\nfor lack of better way of describing and\n\n208\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.500\nif you think about it and the extensible\nframework, it's provided here, allows us\n\n209\n00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.130\nto do a variety of things, we could\nregister VM clouds using this technology,\n\n210\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.100\nwe'd log in to the server where\nwe've deployed this solution and\n\n211\n00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.410\nto speak of deployment\njust take a look up here.\n\n212\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.580\nSo when you wanna get this done, you see\ninstall now, it have to go through and\n\n213\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.690\nclick, and follow the prompts here and\ngo through and\n\n214\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.890\ndo all the things required\nto stand this up.\n\n215\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.410\nBut once we've got this\nconfigured we then are gonna have\n\n216\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.600\nthe management portal, remember?\n\n217\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.520\nSo we're gonna log into\nthe management portal.\n\n218\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.950\nTypically that's gonna be, not typically.\n\n219\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.780\nIt is gonna be a HTTPS connection so\nsecure socket.\n\n220\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.677\nA local host whatever the address is,\nIP fully qualified demanding for\n\n221\n00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:07.014\nthe machine so\nyou connect to that machine on port 30091.\n\n222\n00:11:07.014 --> 00:11:10.951\n30,091 important to know that,\nit's in the show notes for you just so\n\n223\n00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:14.260\nyou know cuz those are the kinda\nthings we love to ask about.\n\n224\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.150\nWhen we take exams, whats the URL?\n\n225\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.680\nHow do we get to that particular portal?\n\n226\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.410\nSo you wanna know that,\njust take note of that.\n\n227\n00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.210\nWe'll go in there.\n\n228\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.430\nYou'll then be able to go in and\nclick VM Cloud.\n\n229\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.110\nThere's a quick start view on\nthe Cloud tab you can launch.\n\n230\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.660\nFrom there, you'll register your service\nprovider foundation, the URL for\n\n231\n00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.700\nthe end point provider is gonna\nbe HTTPS server name 8090 for\n\n232\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.030\nthe server provider framework.\n\n233\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.640\nServer name would just\nbe whatever it is for\n\n234\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.740\nyour local machine where\nyou're running that.\n\n235\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.320\nAnd then, once you have that set up,\nwill be able to then, and\n\n236\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.140\nwe've talked about the search provider,\nby the way.\n\n237\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:50.099\nThe search provider foundation in other\ndiscussions throughout the discussion,\n\n238\n00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:55.125\nshows, episodes, the whole thing we're\ndoing here right around system center and\n\n239\n00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:58.413\nspecifically around MCC private cloud and\n7247.\n\n240\n00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:01.283\nWe've mentioned the service provider\nfoundation before so just make sure you're\n\n241\n00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:03.830\naware of that and you're thinking\nabout that but we've talked about it.\n\n242\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.640\nWe'd add our credentials in to be able to\nget into the IIS app pool and to interact\n\n243\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.640\nwith those elements that are necessary\nin the service provider foundation.\n\n244\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.550\nThe virtual machine manager,\nusage, admin provider,\n\n245\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.920\nall those things will be there,\nwe'll just check off and\n\n246\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.070\nregister all of those particular items\nthat we need from the foundation provider.\n\n247\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.340\nAnd once we've set that all up,\n\n248\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.370\nwe then have our core\ncapabilities available to us.\n\n249\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.650\nWe can then add what are called stamps.\n\n250\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.790\nThe stamp is really just the instance\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n251\n00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.690\nThe VMM server is what we\ncommonly refer to as a stamp.\n\n252\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.780\nIt's just a container that we\nkinda think about logically,\n\n253\n00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.960\nthat provides all of our resources for us.\n\n254\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.270\nAnd we refer to the concept in\nthe service provider framework, or\n\n255\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.480\nthe service provider foundation,\nas a stamp.\n\n256\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.550\nThat's how we talk about\nresource blocks and\n\n257\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.490\nhow we allocate them\nbased on where they are.\n\n258\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.150\nAnd so, we'll go into a ladder VM cloud,\n\n259\n00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.820\nwe'll connect out to it,\nwe'll then be able to register it.\n\n260\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.400\nAnd the VMM server, remember, the VMM\nserver is commonly called the stamp,\n\n261\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.980\nthat we specify will then be available\nto us so we'll be able to manage that.\n\n262\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.110\nSo I just want you to hear the language\nand the thought process and\n\n263\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.280\nunderstand a little bit about that.\n\n264\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.000\nBut we do then have the ability to go in,\nand\n\n265\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.450\nbe able to start to manage resources,\nand use them, and interact with them.\n\n266\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.970\nSo we're gonna have those full\ncapabilities available to us when we\n\n267\n00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.930\nare thinking about, just a couple of\nthings that might be valuable for us here.\n\n268\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.230\nLet's just go to the resources\ntab really quickly,\n\n269\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.670\njust to show you a couple of things.\n\n270\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.380\nSo resources around deploying and\nsupporting the Windows Azure Pack.\n\n271\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.160\nWhat do you wanna be able to access?\n\n272\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.320\nWhat do you need to know?\n\n273\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.390\nEverything you'd wanna be\nable to use just right here.\n\n274\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.330\nLet me scroll down so you can see some\ninformation around getting started.\n\n275\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.130\nTerminology like the concept of the stamp\nand the other things I was mentioning.\n\n276\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.590\nServes provider foundation.\n\n277\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.780\nAll that stuff's listed here.\n\n278\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.480\nWe have a whole area in\nthe Windows Azure Pack in TechNet.\n\n279\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.170\nYou can go look.\n\n280\n00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.010\nI'm gonna bring up a couple of web pages\nhere in a second to show you some specific\n\n281\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.630\nthings you wanna be aware of.\n\n282\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.720\nThere's a whole developer kit specified\nhere for the API extensions for\n\n283\n00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.114\nthe Windows Azure Pack, so\nif you're on the developer side,\n\n284\n00:14:00.114 --> 00:14:03.080\nyou wanna be able to write\nadditional functionality and\n\n285\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.440\nleverage the Azure Pack you can use\nthe API developer kit to do that.\n\n286\n00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.160\nHow do we configure\nthe Windows Azure Pack?\n\n287\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.080\nI was just walking you through\nthe first couple of steps involved.\n\n288\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.380\nWe've got a great how to there in\nthe getting started to run through that.\n\n289\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.730\nHow do we deploy it, how do we set it up,\nhow do we go in and make sure that it's up\n\n290\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.986\nand running, how do we use one this\nis your patch scripts and PowerShell.\n\n291\n00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:25.420\nAll the things you wanted\nto know are all right here.\n\n292\n00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.400\nSo all the different elements,\nall the step by step guidance,\n\n293\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.340\nall the how to, all the information\ncould be available for you right there.\n\n294\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.730\nAnd so, if we wanted to, for instance,\njust go in, just this one item,\n\n295\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.110\ntake a look at how to configure\nthe one that says your patch.\n\n296\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.520\nLet me open this one item up.\n\n297\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.345\nYou'll see here when this is your pack for\nWindows Server right off TechNet.\n\n298\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.140\nShows you all the different\nelements of the features.\n\n299\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.820\nI just went through all these with you and\ntalked about what they were.\n\n300\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.010\nAnd you just click on the appropriate one.\n\n301\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.430\nSo we can go in and\n\n302\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.330\nsee here, how we will stand up and\nconfigure one or more of these.\n\n303\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.240\nAnd it walks us through,\nmigrating from the user services, for\n\n304\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.500\nWindows Server if we have a prior\nversion that we're now gonna move to.\n\n305\n00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.980\nDeploy the Windows Azure Pack for\nWindows Server,\n\n306\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.900\nlet's just take a look at that one,\nthat's the one we may be interested in.\n\n307\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.740\nSo we would use the Azure Pack\nsystem requirements overview.\n\n308\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.700\nKnow what we need, what the services are.\n\n309\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.430\nWe would then be able to go ahead and\ndo an express deployment and/or\n\n310\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.580\ndistributed deployment,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n311\n00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.530\nIf we're using a non-production\nsingle-machine install, we do an express.\n\n312\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.370\nIf we're gonna be putting this into\nproduction we scale this out because\n\n313\n00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.810\ndifferent pieces have to be\nhosted in different places,\n\n314\n00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.320\nalong with the production databases,\nthe SQL or MySQL databases to support it.\n\n315\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.535\nWe do use a SQL database to\ndo all the configuration and\n\n316\n00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:38.831\nthe storage of the configuration for\nthe pack itself.\n\n317\n00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:42.140\nBut we do support a number of\nother databases for web hosting.\n\n318\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.390\nSo we may have several different\nkinds of databases available to use.\n\n319\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.205\nSo you would just go through and click\nthrough all the links to be able to do\n\n320\n00:15:48.205 --> 00:15:49.791\nwhatever it is you need to stand this up.\n\n321\n00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:53.879\nBut all the guidance, specifically around\nhow to do it for this particular version,\n\n322\n00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:57.170\nor any version, that's available\nto you when actually go to use it,\n\n323\n00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.573\nit's gonna be right here on the web and\nthis is gonna be the best place for\n\n324\n00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:03.695\nyou to go and define the details,\nspecifics of the unique version\n\n325\n00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:06.910\nthat you may be interacting with,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n326\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.170\nSo we have all of this here,\njust coming back.\n\n327\n00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.900\nAnd you have the ability to be able to\ngo in and leverage all these links.\n\n328\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.690\nOnce you have set this up and\nyou've got everything configured, and\n\n329\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.040\nwanna make sure that you, instead of\nthe Pack, you've done your testing.\n\n330\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.420\nThere's just a couple of other things\nthat may be of interest to you here.\n\n331\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.850\nWe wanna go ahead, I'm just scrolling\ndown just to get down to the idea of\n\n332\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.570\nconfiguring plans and add-ons and\njust talk to you about this for a minute.\n\n333\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.480\nSo let's just take a look here,\nadministering plans and add-ons.\n\n334\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.980\nThe idea of a plan in\nthe Windows Azure Pack is just that\n\n335\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.070\nstructure we created in order to be able\nto give tenants the ability to consume.\n\n336\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.310\nAnd so tenants can't access services\nunless they subscribe to them.\n\n337\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.090\nAnd services can't be made available\nunless we publish a plan that\n\n338\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.130\nbundles them up and makes them\navailable for them to be consumed.\n\n339\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.400\nAnd so the language, again, the\nterminology, becomes important for you and\n\n340\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.700\nI suggest you definitely go out and take\na look at that link I was just pointing\n\n341\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.120\nto on the Resource page to understand\na little bit more about the logic here.\n\n342\n00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.220\nBut plans are essentially service plans,\nit's just what we call them.\n\n343\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.960\nAnd they define the collection\nof services that are offered.\n\n344\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.940\nAnd the tenant then gets to consume\nthem based on subscribing to them\n\n345\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.250\nthrough a hosting service provider.\n\n346\n00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.250\nThat's usually you or\nwhoever is providing the services,\n\n347\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.710\nin this case, Will be the Azure fabric,\nso it's going to be through Microsoft and\n\n348\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.530\nthe Azure platform, but we set a usage\nquote on surfaces traditionally.\n\n349\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.710\nHey, you're going to get\nthis amount of services for\n\n350\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.440\nthis amount of money\nover this amount of time.\n\n351\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.750\nAnd that's what we do.\n\n352\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.000\nThis is how any Azure service\nsolution is offered today.\n\n353\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.650\nYou go out and consume through Amazon,\nthrough Azure, anywhere,\n\n354\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.140\nyou're paying as you go and\nyou're paying for\n\n355\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.860\ncertain services, given a certain amount\nOf essentially service for money, right?\n\n356\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.630\nThis is the exchange that we talk about.\n\n357\n00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.840\nSo, yeah, you were gonna ask something.\n\n358\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so internally I've heard terms\nlike a hard quota or soft quota where hard\n\n359\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.160\nbeing look, you've reached your quota\nlimit, you have been denied service.\n\n360\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.200\nHere, in this environment, would we,\ndo we see elements like that?\n\n361\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.250\nKind of like a warning like, hey,\nyou've reached your quota but\n\n362\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.030\nyou can click continue if you\nwant to pay x amount of dollars.\n\n363\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.290\nIt give us that kind of option?\n\n364\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.960\nOr is that just kind of-\n&gt;&gt; Depends on the service provider\n\n365\n00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.950\nframework we're using.\n\n366\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.290\nSo, what I mean by that is,\nhypothetically,\n\n367\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.590\nwe'd say in Office 365, right?\n\n368\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.790\nOr in OneDrive,\nif you subscribe to OneDrive.\n\n369\n00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.440\nLet's say as a individual\ncustomer on the business side\n\n370\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.370\nversus perhaps on the consumer side.\n\n371\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.140\nYou know you're paying, either\ngetting a certain amount for free, and\n\n372\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.610\nthen you're running up against the storage\nlimit and then you're asked to pay\n\n373\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.510\nwhere you pay for a certain amount,\nand storage is a good example of this.\n\n374\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.120\nYou pay for a certain amount, but when you\nmax that out, you are given an option to\n\n375\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.100\nadd more storage, but as you suggested,\nyou'd have to pay in order to play.\n\n376\n00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which is what we refer to it as, right?\n\n377\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.960\nSo, it's not an automatic\nscaling solution,\n\n378\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.960\nwhere maybe you like that and\nit will be like that.\n\n379\n00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.930\nOn the hosting side,\nwhere we're not gonna shut a VM off\n\n380\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.900\nnecessarily if it runs into a quota limit,\nbut we are gonna warn you.\n\n381\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.140\nAnd you're gonna have to take steps to\nfigure out how you wanna deal with that\n\n382\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.410\nif it's a live VM running in production.\n\n383\n00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.410\nOne of the things that's nice about\nthis platform is your Amazon or\n\n384\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.260\nAWS, Microsoft or on Azure they\nare not gonna kill a running VM\n\n385\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.510\nif you run over your plan consumption\nthey just gonna bump you the next and\n\n386\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.400\nbill you more money Right, I mean,\nessentially, it's what they're gonna do.\n\n387\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.490\nAnd so, it's auto provisioned that way so\n\n388\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.560\nthat we don't shut off\nrunning infrastructure.\n\n389\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.650\nBut you're paying for\nthat mismanagement or that oversight or\n\n390\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.500\nhowever you wanna frame that,\nwhatever you think of that as.\n\n391\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're paying for\n\n392\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.620\nover consumption\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n393\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.180\nwe definitely don't want to get in\nthe way of you being able to run but\n\n394\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.900\nwe also want to make sure you're\naccountable for whatever you assume.\n\n395\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.320\nSo that's kind of the balance\nwe have you often get into here.\n\n396\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.995\nNow, having said that, on the private club\nside, where you the private provider and\n\n397\n00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:39.905\nyou're doing this on your own,\nyou got a limited resource space and\n\n398\n00:19:39.905 --> 00:19:42.376\nlet's do brutally honest about this for\na minute right.\n\n399\n00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:45.093\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You're not Microsoft, you're not Amazon\n\n400\n00:19:45.093 --> 00:19:49.819\nwith just essentially endless data center\nscalability at your fingertips, you know\n\n401\n00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:54.240\nGoogle can scale their data centers\nmassively, all these providers can.\n\n402\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.770\nBut that's probably not you if you're\nrunning private internal on-prem\n\n403\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:58.810\ncloud, right?\n\n404\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.910\nThere is a limit, in other words,\n\n405\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.140\non the amount of servers you\nhave racked and stacked.\n\n406\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.610\nThere's a limit in the amount\nof resources in those servers,\n\n407\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.690\nso we are gonna run into issues.\n\n408\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.480\nAnd even though we may wanna say just keep\ngoing and going we're not going to worry\n\n409\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.330\nabout it, at some point we're gonna\nrun out of physical resources and\n\n410\n00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.430\nas a result capabilities to scale.\n\n411\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.790\nSo, we can run off the cliff using\nthese technologies, I wanna.\n\n412\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.750\nYou'd just be unequivocal about that and\nclear.\n\n413\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.540\nNo guarantee in other words, all right?\n\n414\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.060\nThat even though the mind is willing,\n\n415\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.570\nwe may not be able to\nfulfill that capability.\n\n416\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.320\nAnd so we do have to balance that\nbecause smart administrators,\n\n417\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.780\nas you're kind of implying, are people\nthat pay attention to the warning signs.\n\n418\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.490\nThis is all about the entire middle tier\nof our conversations around SCOM and\n\n419\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.560\nmonitoring and all the things\nthat we've talked about there.\n\n420\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.140\nAnd dependencies from other systems\nas we spin up an alert here and\n\n421\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.890\ntake notice of it there and\ndo something over here to remediate that.\n\n422\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.340\nIf we don't have that technology thought\nprocess and that mindset running and we're\n\n423\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.210\nnot really paying attention, then yeah our\nVMs could actually just crash and burn.\n\n424\n00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:59.590\nCuz we pay literally run out of memory,\nrun out of CPU And the systems just lock.\n\n425\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.990\nAnd it's not obviously a good place\nto find yourself by any means.\n\n426\n00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.930\nAnd we can use a significant portion\nof our service provisioning capability\n\n427\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.030\nif we just take down a single host in\na cluster, let alone a cascading failure\n\n428\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.820\nbecause we have multiple system\nfailures because of resource outages.\n\n429\n00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.370\nSo, it is something to consider,\nwe do have to think about that.\n\n430\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.370\nBut in large scale Multi-tenant cloud\nenterprises that are at the level we\n\n431\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:26.060\ntalk about with Microsoft Azure,\nthe AWS Amazon fabric etc.\n\n432\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.620\nWe're not running into those issues, we're\njust being asked to be good consumers, and\n\n433\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.030\nobviously, pick a plan and\nconsume within it.\n\n434\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.860\nAnd then if we are scaling up,\nwe'll just have to pay as we go.\n\n435\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n436\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.605\n&gt;&gt; As long as you have money,\nin other words, we love you.\n\n437\n00:21:37.605 --> 00:21:38.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll always say, of course,\n\n438\n00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.510\nwe'll give you more, it's never a problem,\nbut when you can't pay, well,\n\n439\n00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.780\nthen\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole other story.\n\n440\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.980\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole other story, exactly.\n\n441\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.230\n&gt;&gt; And you're no longer our favorite.\n\n442\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.620\nWe talk to people that have money.\n\n443\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.350\nAll right, so just keep in mind that\nobviously administering plans and\n\n444\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.740\nadding on becomes important.\n\n445\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.130\nYou can kind of see a thought\nprocess just graphically here.\n\n446\n00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.445\nI mean kind of scroll so you can see here.\n\n447\n00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:58.875\nYou can see we have VM's websites,\n\n448\n00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:03.525\nthe service bots remember the piping\ncommunication pathways, the database.\n\n449\n00:22:03.525 --> 00:22:05.145\nYou'll see, we have that on number one.\n\n450\n00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:09.007\nMaybe we're increasing the VM quota\nmuch like Cherokee was just suggesting,\n\n451\n00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:10.897\ndid you look ahead and\nsee that's what I was talking about there?\n\n452\n00:22:10.897 --> 00:22:11.567\n&gt;&gt; I did not.\nI was serious.\n\n453\n00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:12.877\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but so\nyou could see that's there.\n\n454\n00:22:12.877 --> 00:22:16.887\nSo you know things like backing a VM's\nmaybe just an add on's just another\n\n455\n00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:20.097\nservice or capability we wanna\nthrow in there and make available.\n\n456\n00:22:20.097 --> 00:22:21.770\nSo then you could see plan one.\n\n457\n00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.000\nYou know, plan two,\nplan three of different offerings.\n\n458\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.910\nDifferent mixed and matched offerings.\n\n459\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.220\nHere, I hate those little pop ups\nthat pop up, we have our, whoops,\n\n460\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.780\ngotta stay away from the diagram.\n\n461\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.010\nWe have our VM in the middle\ntier there as you can see.\n\n462\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.020\nWe have our website, service bus.\n\n463\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.960\nSo, plan two is gonna\nbe subscribed here And\n\n464\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.580\nthen here we're going to obviously be\nable to consume under that subscription.\n\n465\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.410\nSo different capabilities are mixed and\nmatched to create through the plans\n\n466\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.440\ndifferent offerings and\nthat's what we will ultimately buy into.\n\n467\n00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.680\nBut then, if we want to add on something,\nwe can obviously, as we kinda go\n\n468\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.880\nthrough and talk here, and we can add on,\nif required, additional capabilities.\n\n469\n00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.160\nSo, it kind of walks us through\nthe logic and there's some good for\n\n470\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.370\nyou to take a look.\n\n471\n00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.840\nWe, also, can go in and create and\nwrite our own plans, or\n\n472\n00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.020\nspecify how they'll come together.\n\n473\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.260\nAnd you can see them here, for instance,\n\n474\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.310\njust one example that I chose,\nhow to do this for websites, specifically.\n\n475\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.530\nAnd, so for website plans,they give us\nsome guidance here, they being Microsoft.\n\n476\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.110\nEach plan should be created with different\nlevels of service, an intro level,\n\n477\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.960\nkind of shared basic level they say and\na reserved level.\n\n478\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.630\nSo, they're giving us some good guidance\non how to really survive and thrive and\n\n479\n00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.660\nthen they walk us through the logic\nof how to create a plan in here.\n\n480\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.840\nWe go into the Azure Management Pack\nportal for Administrators again,\n\n481\n00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.540\nremember behind the scenes,\nbased on our logic and our structure.\n\n482\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.390\nThe Management Pack portal for\nadministrators\n\n483\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:43.340\nis where we structure all the offerings,\nsettings, quotas, as we talked about.\n\n484\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.280\nWe then make them available through\nthe Management Pack portal for\n\n485\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.820\ntenants, for tenants to go in and\nconsume, choose, and self-service.\n\n486\n00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.570\nSo, we're gonna work on the back-end of\nthe Management portal to create the plan.\n\n487\n00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.180\nThat's what they're saying,\nit's where we're gonna go.\n\n488\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.440\nSo, we go in and\nthen we go to the plan so,\n\n489\n00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.031\nwe go to new right then\nauthor a hosting plan and\n\n490\n00:24:00.031 --> 00:24:04.162\nthe dialog box by the information what\nkind of plan services are we doing.\n\n491\n00:24:04.162 --> 00:24:08.177\nThis case, it's a website we're doing say,\ncheese website cloud In the plan add-on\n\n492\n00:24:08.177 --> 00:24:10.542\ndialogue, we include all\nthe optional add-ons,\n\n493\n00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:13.400\nas we saw in the diagram up above,\nthat would be available.\n\n494\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.420\nYou're just literally dragging and\ndropping, and selecting building blocks.\n\n495\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.370\nVery similar to Service Template Designer,\nthat we looked at for service templates.\n\n496\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.520\nIf you remember, back in SCVMM, when I\ncreated the service design template.\n\n497\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.150\nI dragged in the VM template, and we\nkinda built that out in multiple tiers or\n\n498\n00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.230\nlogical elements.\n\n499\n00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.320\nWhere we add applications, things\nlike that, it's very similar to that.\n\n500\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.910\nThen we go ahead, and when we're done.\n\n501\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:38.610\nAnd we go and we see that we can go\ninto the plan, once it's configured.\n\n502\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.920\nWe could change access, we could specify\nits available, and put it out there.\n\n503\n00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.640\nAnd so they just have some quotas\nthat may be associated, in this case,\n\n504\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.763\nwith website plans.\n\n505\n00:24:47.763 --> 00:24:49.908\nThings that you would specify,\nto consume against,\n\n506\n00:24:49.908 --> 00:24:53.350\nand specify how we're gonna constrain\nthose resources, like you were suggesting.\n\n507\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.430\nSubscription time per CPU,\nsubscription CPU burst time.\n\n508\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.280\nThis is where we get into the nitty-gritty\nof really controlling and micromanaging.\n\n509\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.920\nHow a plan's capabilities are then going\nto passed to the tenant, the consumer.\n\n510\n00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.140\nAnd how that's going to\nconstrain their ability,\n\n511\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.570\nas you were suggesting under the plan,\nto consume.\n\n512\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.150\nSo if they run up against this.\n\n513\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.890\nThey are going to be constrained and\nstopped from doing anything.\n\n514\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.670\nUnless we decide to give them more.\n\n515\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.110\nRight, we're not gonna just\nautomatically burst down.\n\n516\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.660\nBut we are gonna say hey,\nby the way, normal subscription,\n\n517\n00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.370\nyou get this amount of CPU time,\nwe get burstable time.\n\n518\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.960\nIf we're smart about this, we give them\nbuffer time, that let's them spike for\n\n519\n00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.930\ncertain periods of time.\n\n520\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.100\nThen come back down,\nwithout just shutting them off.\n\n521\n00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.050\nSo these are kind of the nitty-gritty\nanswers to the very specific question you\n\n522\n00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.000\nasked, about, hey, how does this happen?\n\n523\n00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.240\nWell, it's really about the quota\ntemplates that we put in.\n\n524\n00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.990\nAnd the limits in the quota that we put\nin, that's gonna allow us to modify and\n\n525\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.860\nmanage this.\n\n526\n00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.330\nAnd so,\nyou can see process CPU burst percentage.\n\n527\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:50.630\nThere's memory allocations we deal\nwith here, overall amount of memory,\n\n528\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.830\nburstable amount, things like that.\n\n529\n00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.560\nWe have worker count,\nwhich is the resource pool threads,\n\n530\n00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.700\nthat are gonna spin up.\n\n531\n00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.224\nOr the application pool's threads, rather,\n\n532\n00:25:58.224 --> 00:26:00.600\nthat spin up,\nto be able to actually execute.\n\n533\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.910\nRemember, this is a website, we're\ntalking about web services now, right.\n\n534\n00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.980\nSupport for SSL,\nare you enabling that, yes or no.\n\n535\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.690\nAre we setting up and supporting\ndifferent concurrent request limits?\n\n536\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.020\nHow many simultaneous requests we're gonna\nbe able to deal with and plan for, here.\n\n537\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.970\nIt's got a great deal of\ninformation that we are able to do.\n\n538\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.590\nAlso, process idle timeout.\n\n539\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.777\nHow long do we wait for process idling\nbefore we time it out and say, hey,\n\n540\n00:26:23.777 --> 00:26:24.574\nno good anymore.\n\n541\n00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:26.378\nSo we go in, and we configure all this.\n\n542\n00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:28.732\nAnd then we publish the plan,\nmake it available.\n\n543\n00:26:28.732 --> 00:26:30.793\nAnd then, as we said,\nthe tenant consumes it.\n\n544\n00:26:30.793 --> 00:26:34.389\nAnd this is the thought process, start to\nfinish, of how we actually spin up plans.\n\n545\n00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:37.411\nAnd self-service provide them\nthrough the Windows Azure pack, and\n\n546\n00:26:37.411 --> 00:26:39.020\nmake them available.\n\n547\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.740\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n548\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.121\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's actually very cool,\nactually, when you go and\n\n549\n00:26:42.121 --> 00:26:43.030\ntake a look at in 10.\n\n550\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.474\nIf you haven't had a chance\nto actually play with it?\n\n551\n00:26:45.474 --> 00:26:47.998\nIt obviously is something\nyou'd have to invest time and\n\n552\n00:26:47.998 --> 00:26:49.670\nresources, to go ahead and spin up.\n\n553\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.737\nAnd I understand that a lot of you\nmay never touch this end of things.\n\n554\n00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:55.809\nIt's just something out there,\nthat your business may not scale and use,\n\n555\n00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:56.845\nand, totally get that.\n\n556\n00:26:56.845 --> 00:26:59.546\nBut if you're already in the market,\ndoing this kind of stuff.\n\n557\n00:26:59.546 --> 00:27:02.640\nYou're aware of what it is, and if you're\nusing it, then you're familiar with it.\n\n558\n00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.950\nIf you're not, may worth your\ntime to at least do a trial, and\n\n559\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:05.790\njust see what it looks like.\n\n560\n00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:06.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm kind of curious.\n\n561\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.690\nYou keep mentioning the $200 limit,\nand really, what would that-\n\n562\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Hosting credit, $200 hosting credits.\n\n563\n00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.740\n&gt;&gt; For the hosting, okay, okay.\n\n564\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.420\n&gt;&gt; Specifically, right.\n\n565\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.700\n&gt;&gt; For the hosting credit,\nI'm just kinda curious.\n\n566\n00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.520\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft gives you that funny money to\nessentially play with, on the platform.\n\n567\n00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.180\n&gt;&gt; We would be able to at least maneuver\naround, and get a sense of what to expect.\n\n568\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, yeah, for\nwhatever that, however much.\n\n569\n00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.600\nHowever much time it would take\nyou to consume those resource,\n\n570\n00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.020\nbased on the VMs for spinning up,\nand things like that.\n\n571\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.305\nBut yeah, it's like I talked\nabout in some other episode.\n\n572\n00:27:29.305 --> 00:27:31.920\nYou have $200 in-service\ncredit on the Azure platform,\n\n573\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.700\nor the equivalent on Amazon, or\nany of the platforms out there.\n\n574\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.170\nCuz Amazon does something like that.\n\n575\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.810\nThey give you a free trial subscription,\nfor\n\n576\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.870\na certain amount of hosting hours as well.\n\n577\n00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.320\nRoughly, depending on\nwhether you're a tee-totaler,\n\n578\n00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.410\nyou're just sipping with one or two VMS.\n\n579\n00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.800\nOr, you're just spraying\na firehose of VMs out there,\n\n580\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.320\nand blanketing everything\nrunning at full bore.\n\n581\n00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.810\nYou may only get a couple of days out of\nsomething, if you spin up a whole bunch.\n\n582\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.012\nBut if you only put a few VMs on there,\nand test it?\n\n583\n00:27:56.012 --> 00:27:59.450\n$200 in-service card is probably good for\na month's worth of work on that platform.\n\n584\n00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.038\nIf you're a little bit meticulous, and\nfocused on consuming small amounts.\n\n585\n00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:05.365\nYou should be able to run VMs for\na fair amount of time, and play with them.\n\n586\n00:28:05.365 --> 00:28:08.754\nAnd really get a sense of that,\nbefore you run into the idea of, hey,\n\n587\n00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:10.697\nlet me actually start paying for real.\n\n588\n00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:13.643\nCuz Microsoft's giving you that\ncredit to get you on the platform,\n\n589\n00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:15.620\nto give you a sense of\nhow it's going to work.\n\n590\n00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.560\nSo they want you,\nit's in their best interest, right?\n\n591\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.820\nThey want you to be able to\nfigure out if you're liking it.\n\n592\n00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.470\nAnd then if you are, you're going\nto hopefully continue consuming.\n\n593\n00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:24.610\nAnd so they're giving you\nthe opportunity to figure that out.\n\n594\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.080\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good deal,\nall right.\n\n595\n00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.630\n&gt;&gt; In theory.\n&gt;&gt; Free, free, If it's free it's for\n\n596\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.680\nme, right?\n\n597\n00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.490\nUntil we get hooked.\n\n598\n00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.590\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n599\n00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you Adam.\n\n600\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.600\nAnd thank you for joining us today.\n\n601\n00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.490\nBut we're going to go ahead and\nsign out for this show.\n\n602\n00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.730\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n603\n00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.410\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.190\nWelcome back to your Configure and\nDeploy a Private Cloud series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.360\nIn this episode, we'll really be taking\na look at how to deploy a Gateway server.\n\n8\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.020\nWith us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.570\nThank you for joining us today, Adam.\n\n10\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody,\nhope you're doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.285\nWe're going to, as Cherokee said, talk\nabout how to deploy that Gateway server.\n\n12\n00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:32.520\nYou keep hearing us talk about,\n\n13\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.180\nwe've talked about it\nthroughout our time together.\n\n14\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.920\nBut it is gonna be important for\n\n15\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.698\nus to know how to actually get the gateway\nserver out there, set it up, configure it.\n\n16\n00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:43.010\nIt's a multi-step process,\nnot too difficult,\n\n17\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.500\nbut one we do wanna walk\nthrough with you real quick.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.370\nJust to remind you what the gateway\nserver is, before we get started.\n\n19\n00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.860\nThe Gateway server is that server,\n\n20\n00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.700\nsurprisingly enough,\nin the DMZ, on the sensor.\n\n21\n00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.690\nActually, let me try that again.\n\n22\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.480\nNot in the DMZ, rather, outside the DMZ.\n\n23\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.273\nBut connects through the DMZ, is what\nI meant to say, through the firewall.\n\n24\n00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:05.895\nBut it is used for connecting non-domain\njoined, non-Kerberos-authenticated.\n\n25\n00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:10.963\nNon-trusted machines,\nthat are not connected directly to us.\n\n26\n00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:13.368\nThe agent managment machine sitting\noutside in the LAN somewhere,\n\n27\n00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:15.448\nin other words,\nthat we don't have direct knowledge of.\n\n28\n00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:19.364\nWe're gonna connect those up, and bring\nthose back in through the firewall, and\n\n29\n00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:21.590\nallow them to be managed and\ninteracted with.\n\n30\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.858\nAnd that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n31\n00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:24.539\nSo I wanna talk about how we do this.\n\n32\n00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.207\nWe're gonna walk you through the process,\n\n33\n00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.921\nshow you a couple of the tools that\nare buried inside the install media.\n\n34\n00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.690\nAnd how we have to use those,\nin order to get the job done.\n\n35\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.830\nAnd then when we're done, you'll have a\nsense of how to deploy the Gateway server.\n\n36\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.810\nAnd if you ever have a need to do this,\nor have a desire to do it.\n\n37\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.270\nOr are perhaps, at some point in\nthe future, asked about how to do this.\n\n38\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.120\nAs in, perhaps when you take an exam,\nknowing this would be a good idea.\n\n39\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.580\nYou'll be well-armed for any and\nall of those possibilities.\n\n40\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.480\nSo, join me over here,\nactually right up there,\n\n41\n00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.190\nwe're gonna take a look at the process.\n\n42\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.070\nSo first thing we have to do is, we have\nto figure out that we need a tool called\n\n43\n00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.640\nthe Microsoft Enterprise\nManagement Gateway Approval Tool.\n\n44\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.578\nNow, this tool is going to be available\nto us on the SCOM install media.\n\n45\n00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:04.138\nSo we're going to go and we're,\nexcuse me, on the, yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:05.313\non the SCOM install media,\nwhat am I saying?\n\n47\n00:02:05.313 --> 00:02:09.250\nI'm thinking about Orchestrator in my\nmind, and were talking about SCOM.\n\n48\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.460\nSo we're going to go ahead and take\na look at where to find this real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.220\nSo we're going to go over to our\nmachine that has our SCOM install media\n\n50\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.910\navailable on it.\n\n51\n00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.440\nYou can see it here, and\nI'll just move this over real quick.\n\n52\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.350\nJust so you can see what that is and\nwhere it's coming from.\n\n53\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.492\nActually, a little bit more there,\n\n54\n00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:26.880\ncuz it's still sitting right\non the edge of the window.\n\n55\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.490\nAnd what I did was simply to open up\nthe System Center Option Manager install.\n\n56\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.740\nWe've got the DVD loaded here so\nyou could see that.\n\n57\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.880\nAnd you see we do have an option for\nGateway management server down there.\n\n58\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.370\nSo you could see that we\ncan deploy it from here.\n\n59\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.480\nAnd we'll talk about that and why that's\nimportant in a couple of minutes.\n\n60\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.690\nBut, when we are looking for\nthe tool we need, we go into the media.\n\n61\n00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.289\nSo I just went into the Windows Explorer,\nopened up the root of the DVD, went in,\n\n62\n00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:53.310\nas you could see.\n\n63\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.675\nWent into the support tools directory,\nwent into i386.\n\n64\n00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.125\nAnd found the appropriate version for\nthe solution I'm installing.\n\n65\n00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:03.375\nMicrosoft Enterprise Management\nGateway Approval Tool.\n\n66\n00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.252\nSo you're just gonna copy\nthat right from there.\n\n67\n00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:09.312\nAnd we're gonna take that, and that's\na tool that we're gonna start by using.\n\n68\n00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:13.722\nOnce we have that tool and\nwe've copied it off, as you can see here.\n\n69\n00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:15.222\nWe copy it onto, or\n\n70\n00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:18.470\nmake it available to, the management\nservers where we're gonna need it.\n\n71\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.200\nFrom the target management server,\nwe go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.760\nwe grab that from that\nInstall Support Tools directory.\n\n73\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.970\nCopy it off and make it available, right?\n\n74\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970\nSo we've got that tool, and\nwe could distribute it out as needed.\n\n75\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.250\nAnd that's gonna be one of the very\nfirst things we need to do now.\n\n76\n00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.320\nKeep in mind that before we are doing\nthis, or lateral to doing this,\n\n77\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.370\nyou would pretty much,\nat any point in time.\n\n78\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.670\nBut before we actually formally get\nstarted with clicking on tools,\n\n79\n00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.370\nrunning processes,\nconfiguring and installing.\n\n80\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.850\nWe gotta have all the moving parts and\npieces in place.\n\n81\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.400\nSo we obviously have to have\nan existing SCOM installation,\n\n82\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.570\nwith a resource pool of management\nservers that are already stood up.\n\n83\n00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo want to think about that.\n\n84\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.610\nWe've talked extensively about what\nthat looks like, how you would do that.\n\n85\n00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.930\nAnd the pieces involved in getting\nthat all done, in earlier episodes.\n\n86\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.090\nAnd we've got a lot of\ncontent that will support\n\n87\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.685\nhow to get all of those\nthings accomplished.\n\n88\n00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:10.855\nSo I encourage you to go back,\ntake a look there.\n\n89\n00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.885\nWe've also talked about the fact\nthat you may need certificates\n\n90\n00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:14.845\nto do certain things.\n\n91\n00:04:14.845 --> 00:04:17.465\nBoth in SCOM, as we're doing installs, and\n\n92\n00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.340\nspecifically for\nthe management of the Gateway server.\n\n93\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.510\nAnd the machines, the agent management\nmachines on the other side of the Gateway.\n\n94\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.710\nThey're going to need certificates,\nor access to certificates,\n\n95\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.900\nthrough the Gateway server.\n\n96\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.720\nSo we're going to be talking\nabout using certificates.\n\n97\n00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160\nAnd you're going to want to keep in mind,\n\n98\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.560\nthat we're going to either\nself-sign those certificates.\n\n99\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.638\nGet them from an internal\nWindows-based KPI, PKI.\n\n100\n00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:43.970\nThe backwards-compatible thought\nprocess going on in my head, here.\n\n101\n00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.790\nKPI, not KPI, PKI,\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n102\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.730\nWe're not talking about measuring and\nmonitoring,\n\n103\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.490\nwe're talking about issuing certificates.\n\n104\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.570\nYou gotta keep me honest on this stuff,\nwhen I make mistakes like that.\n\n105\n00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.130\nSo when we talk about PKI,\nwhen we talk about certificates.\n\n106\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.060\nWe're talking about issuing them from,\ntypically,\n\n107\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.330\nthe Active Directory certificate services.\n\n108\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.740\nSo we'll have that stood up,\navailable and running.\n\n109\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.750\nIf you're not familiar with how to deal\nwith that, we do have other episodes,\n\n110\n00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.205\nother shows in other areas.\n\n111\n00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:14.100\nWhat will walk you through the logic of\nhow to set up and install a PKI solution.\n\n112\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.050\nBut just to show you,\none thing that will be important for you.\n\n113\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.400\nNot specific to SCOM,\nper se, in the Gateway.\n\n114\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.710\nBut overall, just generally the idea\nof certificates that are available,\n\n115\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.450\nnecessary.\n\n116\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.970\nAnd things that we should be thinking\nabout for System Center, overall.\n\n117\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.240\nAnd in this case, specific to\nSystem Center Configure Manager.\n\n118\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.890\nBecause that's where certificates\nmay come into play, traditionally.\n\n119\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.950\nWe do have a web page here,\nPKI Certificate Requirements for\n\n120\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.040\nConfiguration Manager.\n\n121\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.760\nMicrosoft's done a great job\nof putting this up for us.\n\n122\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.490\nAnd as we scroll down, you'll see here, we\ndo have PKI Certificates for the servers.\n\n123\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.250\nThey go through and\n\n124\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.190\ntell us what kind of certificates\nwe'll need, what they're used for.\n\n125\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.510\nThey've got, as we scroll down, just keep\ngoing here, down towards the bottom here.\n\n126\n00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.711\nWe have proxy web servers for\n\n127\n00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.360\ninternet-based client management,\ncertificates for them.\n\n128\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.210\nSo it kind of goes all the way down.\n\n129\n00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.400\nAnd talks through and\nshows us the logic of how to set up and\n\n130\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.000\nunderstand certificates.\n\n131\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.730\nBut specific, in this case, its the\nConfig Manager product, the SCCM product.\n\n132\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.270\nSo you may wanna look at that\nas some initial guidance.\n\n133\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.890\nSome initial thought processes around\nwhere certificates will come from.\n\n134\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.430\nWe can use third-party certificates\nissued from an external PKI solution.\n\n135\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.420\nThink VeriSign, think Thwaite, think RSA.\n\n136\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.200\nAny of those third-party\nproviders that are commercial CAs\n\n137\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.570\ncan issue certificates for us.\n\n138\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.350\nIf we're willing to sign up for\nthem, pay for them, and use them.\n\n139\n00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.060\nAnd we can get them from there as well.\n\n140\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.460\nSo, just wanna have those\ncertificates available.\n\n141\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.040\nThat way we can bring them in,\nand manipulate them and use them.\n\n142\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.600\nWe'll talk about where we do that\nin just a minute, and the process.\n\n143\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.869\nI wanna have those available.\n\n144\n00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.998\nWe wanna have the management servers\nalready stood up, ready to go.\n\n145\n00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:49.066\nWanna understand how to manipulate and\nmanage our firewall.\n\n146\n00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:53.278\nCuz we're gonna have to have knowledge of\nhow to insure that we have connectivity,\n\n147\n00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:54.011\nback inside.\n\n148\n00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.904\nComing back through,\ninto the management resource pool.\n\n149\n00:06:57.904 --> 00:06:59.509\nSo we just wanna be thinking\nabout all those things.\n\n150\n00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.819\nAnd as a matter of fact, just while\nwe're talking here, really quickly.\n\n151\n00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.958\nLet me just get all of this open,\nand let me just open this back up.\n\n152\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.752\nBecause we have actually\nshown you in the past, and\n\n153\n00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:15.110\nI just forgot to open it up here.\n\n154\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.880\nOur document,\nthis little picture that I've created for\n\n155\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.740\nus, that we talked about\nwith our architecture.\n\n156\n00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.820\nAnd just to remind you,\n\n157\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.460\nyou have the firewall sitting here, this\nis our Gateway server sitting over here.\n\n158\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.300\nI'm just gonna zoom in real quick,\nso we can see that.\n\n159\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.890\nAnd when we're thinking about it,\nour gateway server right here is\n\n160\n00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.000\nwhat we're looking to actually install and\nconfigure.\n\n161\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.150\nWe're trying to drive that\ncommunication inbound through\n\n162\n00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.440\nthe external part of the DMZ, back inside-\n&gt;&gt; Is there a typical port that we would\n\n163\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.820\nuse here for this communication?\n\n164\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.680\n&gt;&gt; I bet you know what that port is.\n\n165\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.340\n&gt;&gt; I see it in your notes,\nam I allowed to read it?\n\n166\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Of course, you are, cuz you asked.\n\n167\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.970\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nthat's gonna be what, TCP 5723?\n\n168\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat's our port that we're gonna be using.\n\n169\n00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.145\nAnd so, we're gonna be, when I mention\njust having access to the firewall,\n\n170\n00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:57.189\nmaking sure we configure it.\n\n171\n00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:00.702\nWe're gonna need to ensure that port\nis open for inbound connectivity here.\n\n172\n00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:04.244\nComing in from the Gateway server Using\nany and all of those ancient manage\n\n173\n00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:08.091\nmachines that are sitting there that\nare outside, external to our interface.\n\n174\n00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.595\nSo just wanna make sure we're\nthinking about the logic of that and\n\n175\n00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:11.900\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n176\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.950\nAll right, so\nlet's get back to where we were.\n\n177\n00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.665\nJust bring back up our Interface so\nwe know that we're gonna grab this tool,\n\n178\n00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.865\nwe're then gonna go ahead get it set up\nand distributed out so we can use it.\n\n179\n00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:26.792\nNow we only have to run this once it's\nonly have to be on the management server,\n\n180\n00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:28.229\nit's gonna be run one time.\n\n181\n00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:31.742\nSo we're just gonna copy it make sure it's\navailable we're then gonna go ahead and\n\n182\n00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:34.464\nwe're gonna register the gateway\nwith the management groups.\n\n183\n00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:38.364\nSo we're gonna set up the gateway server\nthat we wanna use the instance we're\n\n184\n00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:41.784\ngonna register it and once we do that,\nand we're able to go ahead and\n\n185\n00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:43.880\nregister the Gateway Server.\n\n186\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.210\nOnce we've done this it'll show up\nin our discovered inventory view\n\n187\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.600\nin the Management Group on\nthe Management Servers.\n\n188\n00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.440\nThen we'll actually go through and\n\n189\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.182\ninstall the Gateway Server by using\nthe installation media we just saw,\n\n190\n00:08:55.182 --> 00:08:58.390\nusing that Install Gateway Server\noption off the SCOM Media.\n\n191\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.140\nAnd we'll go through the steps\nassociated with that in just a moment.\n\n192\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.870\nSo running the Gateway Approval tool,\nthe one we were just looking at.\n\n193\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.652\nWe'll go ahead and we will log on with\nthe ops manager administration account,\n\n194\n00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:11.104\nimportant to know there are certain\naccounts that have certain rights.\n\n195\n00:09:11.104 --> 00:09:13.250\nWe've talked about this before so\nwe'll need this.\n\n196\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.627\nWhatever machine we're gonna\ntarget to be the gateway server,\n\n197\n00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:19.639\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nrun this, rather log on there.\n\n198\n00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:23.927\nWe're gonna then go ahead and use this\naccount, open up a command prompt and\n\n199\n00:09:23.927 --> 00:09:27.120\neither go in,\n[INAUDIBLE] I should say navigate to.\n\n200\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.100\nThe directory where we've copied\nthe enterprise management gateway\n\n201\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.020\napproval tool.\n\n202\n00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.395\nSo whatever we're doing,\n\n203\n00:09:32.395 --> 00:09:36.190\nwherever we have put it that tool we just\ntalked about that's where we're gonna go.\n\n204\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.984\nWe're then gonna go ahead here and run as\nyou could see I try to fit it all in but\n\n205\n00:09:39.984 --> 00:09:42.792\nit's obviously so\nbig you can't fit it all on one line.\n\n206\n00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:46.950\nBut this would all be one continuous line,\nthis command and this command right here,\n\n207\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.330\nwhat I'm talking about is this right here.\n\n208\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.328\nYou would type this as one line,\nnot two even though it's broken out here.\n\n209\n00:09:53.328 --> 00:09:56.366\nSo\nMicrosoft.EnterpriseManagement.gatewayApp-\n\n210\n00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:01.312\nrovalTool.exe /ManagementServerName\nequals the managementserverFQDN meaning,\n\n211\n00:10:01.312 --> 00:10:05.949\ninsert there whatever the full name\nthe management server is you're targeting.\n\n212\n00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:08.721\nSpace /GatewayName,\ninsert the GatewayFQDN,\n\n213\n00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:12.090\nthe name of the gateway,\nthere, Action=Create, right?\n\n214\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.530\nSo we have some placeholders there,\n\n215\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.840\njust wanna make sure you understand that's\nwhat we're gonna be using this for.\n\n216\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.466\nIf it is run successfully,\nyou're gonna see the approval of\n\n217\n00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:24.604\nserver whatever the Gateway FQDN was,\nso you'd insert that there.\n\n218\n00:10:24.604 --> 00:10:28.758\nCompleted successfully, so this\nmessage will appear, minus the quotes.\n\n219\n00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.473\nI just put the quotes around it to\noffset it in the list there, so\n\n220\n00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:34.730\nthat you would know what the text\nwould actually look like.\n\n221\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.987\nIf we do need to remove a gateway from\nthe management group for some odd reason,\n\n222\n00:10:38.987 --> 00:10:42.424\nwe run that same command, but\nin the case of changing out here.\n\n223\n00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:45.568\nWe'll substitute Action for,\nas you can see here,\n\n224\n00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:50.110\nCreate at the end, we'll simply\nsubstitute that for /Action=Delete.\n\n225\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.460\nAnd then we'll be ready to go.\n\n226\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.580\nSo just swap out the flag at the end,\nin other words, and\n\n227\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.000\nwe'll be all set to\nremove it if necessary.\n\n228\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.580\nOnce you go in, you have this all done,\nyou go back the OPs console,\n\n229\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.320\nyou'll see it under Discovered Inventory\nView that a gateway server now is present.\n\n230\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.918\nAll right, so once we've done that we're\ngonna install the gateway server on\n\n231\n00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.933\nthe machine that we wanna actually\nmake into the gateway server.\n\n232\n00:11:11.933 --> 00:11:13.426\nThis is gonna be the machine or\n\n233\n00:11:13.426 --> 00:11:17.100\nthe server that will become\nthe gateway that's gonna be added in.\n\n234\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.180\nNow, keep in mind,\nas we looked at in the Diagram.\n\n235\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.080\nLet's go back here for just a second,\njust to remind ourselves of this, and let\n\n236\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.060\nme just zoom out one more click, to make\nit a little bit easier just to see that.\n\n237\n00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.090\nSo, we're about to add\nthe Gateway server by installing\n\n238\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.390\nthe actual guts of the Gateway server\nhere and setting up the software.\n\n239\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.688\nWhat that little note there, and I'll go\nback to it in a minute, reminds you of,\n\n240\n00:11:37.688 --> 00:11:40.869\nis that the Gateway server here\nhas to be in the same domain.\n\n241\n00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:43.560\nOr in the same system here\nassociated with the age and\n\n242\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.000\nmanage machines that are gonna\nbe communicating with it, right.\n\n243\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.500\nSo it's gonna be in the same domain and\n\n244\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.510\nnamespace out here that these\nmachines we wanna manage are part of,\n\n245\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.930\nso that we can bring that information in\nthrough the firewall, and then add it in.\n\n246\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.330\nBut remember, this namespace\ninternally here on the right side,\n\n247\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.390\ninside the firewall, it's distinctly\ndifferent from the namespace in the other\n\n248\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.770\narea outside the firewall.\n\n249\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.180\nAnd so when we say the gateway server\nhas to be a member of that domain,\n\n250\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.940\ndon't get confused.\n\n251\n00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.726\nIt's not a member of this domain.\n\n252\n00:12:11.726 --> 00:12:13.149\nIt's a member of the gateway server.\n\n253\n00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.430\nIt's gonna be a member\nof this area out here.\n\n254\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.820\nBecause it's gonna be joined to whatever\nsystems are gonna be using it for\n\n255\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.160\nor leveraging it for\ncommunication In management.\n\n256\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.240\nSo when I say up here the server is to be,\nthe gateway server should be a member of\n\n257\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.210\nthe same domain as the agent managed\ncomputers that are reporting to it.\n\n258\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.660\nIt's those machines outside\nof the firewall, right,\n\n259\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.000\nthat are going to be reporting\ninto the gateway server.\n\n260\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000\nThat's the domain we're talking\nabout just to be clear.\n\n261\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.216\nSo we don't get confused about that\ncuz a lot of times we say, hey,\n\n262\n00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:40.750\nbe a member of that domain.\n\n263\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.580\nWe don't specify and you're stuck standing\nthere thinking, which one am I joining?\n\n264\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.427\nAnd why does the gateway have to be\na member of the internal domain?\n\n265\n00:12:47.427 --> 00:12:48.800\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n266\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.858\nBecause now we're actually not gonna be\nable to talk to the agent management teams\n\n267\n00:12:51.858 --> 00:12:52.754\nin a different domain.\n\n268\n00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:54.790\nAnd that's actually, absolutely true.\n\n269\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.170\nSo, installing the gateway server.\n\n270\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:56.820\nHow do we do this?\n\n271\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.460\nYou'll see here.\n\n272\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.660\nWe log on to the gateway\nserver with admin rights,\n\n273\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.000\nmeaning administrative rights\non that box in that domain.\n\n274\n00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.438\nFrom the ops manager install media,\nrun setup.exe.\n\n275\n00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:09.970\nLet's just take a look at what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n276\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.200\nSo when we do that what we're saying is we\ngo into the ops manager media which we do\n\n277\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.298\nhave up and running here as you can see.\n\n278\n00:13:16.298 --> 00:13:18.720\nSo we'd have to have that\navailable on that machine.\n\n279\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.980\nWe would run Gateway Management Server\nright here right.\n\n280\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.200\nNow I'm not gonna be able to install it\nhere because obviously I'm already running\n\n281\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.540\nthe scom product on this machine.\n\n282\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.190\nI'm just showing you what you would do.\n\n283\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.030\nYou wouldn't get that\nerror in the real world.\n\n284\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.290\nYou'd be able to run it but\nyou would start that process here.\n\n285\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.483\nAnd then walk through this wizard.\n\n286\n00:13:35.483 --> 00:13:38.472\nAnd the next steps that I'm gonna walk\nthrough with you in the text file,\n\n287\n00:13:38.472 --> 00:13:41.118\nessentially are just gonna detail\nout what the wizard will do and\n\n288\n00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:42.830\nwhat the steps look like, okay?\n\n289\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.180\nBut you would run this solution,\n\n290\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.040\nthis installation, this is what you would\nrun actually on the machine in question.\n\n291\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.410\nAnd so we start that up,\nwe go ahead we click the link,\n\n292\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.890\nwe go through the welcome\nscreen as you can see.\n\n293\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.960\nWe go ahead and accept the default or\n\n294\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.150\nchange to select a different\ninstall directory.\n\n295\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.844\nUp to us to decide where to put that,\n\n296\n00:14:01.844 --> 00:14:04.503\nreally just a question of\nwhat our preferences will be.\n\n297\n00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:08.925\nYou'll see there, in step 6, on\nthe Management Group Configuration page,\n\n298\n00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:13.080\ntype in the target management group\nname for the appropriate field.\n\n299\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.150\nType in the management server\nname,again in the appropriate field.\n\n300\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.883\nPut in the port, and Cherokee all\nready told us what the port is,\n\n301\n00:14:19.883 --> 00:14:22.249\nyou see it right there, Port 5723.\n\n302\n00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:26.227\nThis port can be changed if we want to,\nthat's just the default port that we use,\n\n303\n00:14:26.227 --> 00:14:27.758\nbut we can modify that.\n\n304\n00:14:27.758 --> 00:14:30.270\nIt's up to us,\non the gateway action account page,\n\n305\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.630\nwe select the local system action option,\nunless we've already created\n\n306\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.820\nan action account,\nin which case we'll select that one.\n\n307\n00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.846\nSo again, it's up to us to decide,\nkind of like a dealers choice if you will.\n\n308\n00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:43.000\nWe'll then go ahead and\ndecide whether we want Microsoft updates.\n\n309\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.880\nAgain, you'll make some choices there.\n\n310\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.400\nOnce you're done, ready to install,\nclick Install, and\n\n311\n00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.820\nonce you're done, you'll click Finish\nwhen we see the completed page.\n\n312\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.660\nAnd you're all set, ready to go.\n\n313\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.710\nAnd that will be the or,\nwhen we walk through that and\n\n314\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.690\nfinish, that'll be how we actually\nstand up that gateway server.\n\n315\n00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.539\nNow once we've done that, we can say we're\ndone or if we prefer to do it through\n\n316\n00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:07.590\nthe command window through command prompt,\nwe can do it as well.\n\n317\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.860\nLet me just show you how you do it from\nthe command prompt if you're interested.\n\n318\n00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.060\nSo assume the same idea,\nlogged onto that machine,\n\n319\n00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.380\nadmin rights using the run as\nadministrator option make sure the command\n\n320\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.760\nprompt is got full admin\nrights in other words.\n\n321\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.070\nYou'll be in,\nwhere you have Momgateway.msi, right,\n\n322\n00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.290\nso you're gonna just make\nsure you have access to that.\n\n323\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.810\nThat's the installation item that you're\npulling from that wizard graphically when\n\n324\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.780\nyou click on the link it's Momgateway.msi\nthat actually gets executed.\n\n325\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.030\nYou're providing all\nthe answers in the wizard,\n\n326\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.230\nwe're just giving you the scripted\noptions here that the wizard uses and\n\n327\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.370\nshowing you essentially how to\ndo it from a command prompt.\n\n328\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.200\nSo if you wanted to do it this way\nyou could follow the logic here.\n\n329\n00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.243\nWould it be good to do it\nfrom a command prompt?\n\n330\n00:15:47.243 --> 00:15:48.260\nIt doesn't matter either way.\n\n331\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.360\nTotally up to you.\n\n332\n00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.910\nHow often do you install a gateway server?\n\n333\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.612\nOnce, maybe twice.\n\n334\n00:15:53.612 --> 00:15:55.010\nWe're not talking about a lot of times.\n\n335\n00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.646\nIs it worth your time and\neffort to do it from a scripted install?\n\n336\n00:15:58.646 --> 00:16:01.544\nProbably not unless you're you know,\nsetting this up repetitively and\n\n337\n00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.978\nbuilding these environments out.\n\n338\n00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:05.595\nBut having said that Is it\nimportant to know how to do it,\n\n339\n00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:08.340\nif you're ever asked about it\nat some point in the future?\n\n340\n00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.593\nPerhaps in a room with a computer\nwhile the clock is ticking, and\n\n341\n00:16:11.593 --> 00:16:13.430\nyou're making choices.\n\n342\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.390\nYou never know, right?\n\n343\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.310\nYou may at some point be asked about\nwhether you can do it in a scripted\n\n344\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.540\ninstall, and if so,\nwhat would it look like?\n\n345\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.030\nSo it's always good to have\naccess to that information.\n\n346\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.380\nEven though in the real world we know that\nit's very unlikely that you would use\n\n347\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.370\na scripted install for most of this stuff.\n\n348\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.309\nBut you could see here what the script\nlooks like, it's on the screen.\n\n349\n00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:32.583\nObviously, encourage you\nto take at look at it.\n\n350\n00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:36.620\n&gt;&gt; It's attached as also part of the show\nfiles, so you did provide that, as well.\n\n351\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is-\n&gt;&gt; Just like the other demonstrations that\n\n352\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.980\nwe've gone through, guys.\n\n353\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.740\nSo just don't feel alone whenever\nwe're going through these steps here.\n\n354\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.540\nYou have them.\n\n355\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually these are the show\nnotes, pretty much verbatim.\n\n356\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.070\nI'm just using them broken up into\nblocks to walk through each step with\n\n357\n00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:50.650\nyou to show you.\n\n358\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.250\nCuz obviously way too much stuff to just\ntalk about verbally without being referred\n\n359\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.980\nto it on the screen, because you just\nwon't be able to keep up with it.\n\n360\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.330\nSo you're actually gonna be able to see\nthis exact script sitting in there.\n\n361\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.190\nJust keep in mind, everything is\ngonna have variable placeholders for\n\n362\n00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.500\nthings like names of account\nstuff like that, password.\n\n363\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.010\nYou see them all there, right?\n\n364\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.220\nAny of these things,\n\n365\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.110\nthis just indicates that you would\nput in the appropriate password.\n\n366\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.380\nThis indicates you would put in whatever\nthe action account name would be, etc.\n\n367\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.241\nSo just remember that if you\nare gonna do this for real you gotta\n\n368\n00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:23.763\ninsert real variables there where we've\nput placeholders in the script for\n\n369\n00:17:23.763 --> 00:17:25.320\nyou in order to be able to do that.\n\n370\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.388\nAll right, having said that,\nimporting certificates,\n\n371\n00:17:28.388 --> 00:17:31.510\nwe have a tool called\nthe MOMCertImport.exe Tool.\n\n372\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.230\nThis is where we get into using\nthose certificates I mentioned.\n\n373\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.810\nWe're going to import those on each\ngateway server, on each management server,\n\n374\n00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.930\nand all the computers are agent-managed\nin the domain that is not trusted.\n\n375\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.470\nMeaning, again if we go back\nhere just to reference this.\n\n376\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.230\nEvery machine that is out here\n\n377\n00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.850\nthat is going to the interacting\nhas to have this tool run.\n\n378\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:57.740\nAnd the certificates imported onto them,\nusing the MOMCertImport tool.\n\n379\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.200\nSo just so we know about that.\n\n380\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.090\nSo you'll copy this tool, again,\nfrom the install media support tools.\n\n381\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.490\nJust where we got the other gateway\nagent tool that we were talking about.\n\n382\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.550\nWe'll just show you where\nthis is real quick.\n\n383\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.346\nSo we're gonna go in here,\nit's gonna be the same directory,\n\n384\n00:18:13.346 --> 00:18:18.090\nexcept that it's gonna be in, a little\nbit further, there it is right there.\n\n385\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.813\nMOMCertImport.exe, well it is .exe,\nyou just don't see the extensions there.\n\n386\n00:18:22.813 --> 00:18:24.483\nBut MOMCertImport is right there, so\n\n387\n00:18:24.483 --> 00:18:27.110\nyou could see the tool will\nbe in the support folder.\n\n388\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.610\nJust so you know where to look, right?\n\n389\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.610\nSo you're gonna go grab that and\nthen again as an administrator,\n\n390\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.600\nopen up a command prompt.\n\n391\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.680\nLet me just scroll down so\nyou can see that.\n\n392\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.540\nOpen up a command prompt and\nchange to the directory where the tool is.\n\n393\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.460\nRun it under the admin credentials so\nyou have the rights to do this.\n\n394\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.150\nAnd then you'll bring in\nthe certificate based on using\n\n395\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.330\nthe certificate subject\nname as you can see there.\n\n396\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.030\nAnd then it makes it available to\nthe ops manager, gateway server and\n\n397\n00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.020\nall the other systems\nthat are gonna need it.\n\n398\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.960\nSo you'll have to walk through the steps\nof importing the certificates.\n\n399\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.980\nNow a little extra added information for\nyou here.\n\n400\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.090\nOne of the things we do when we set up\na gateway server, and I don't have it\n\n401\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.260\ndiagrammed in my architecture diagram,\nbut I'll just explain the logic to you.\n\n402\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.540\nWe often talk about the fact\nthat as a standing rule,\n\n403\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.192\nif one is better, two is better than one,\nand three is better than two.\n\n404\n00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:16.820\nAnd you've heard me say\nthat in some shows.\n\n405\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.375\nAnd what we mean by that is, that when\nwe want to build out reliability,\n\n406\n00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:24.190\nand redundancy, and\nscalability to survive a system outage.\n\n407\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.360\nWe want to ensure that we understand\nthat we need more than one instance\n\n408\n00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.650\nof a server, or a service, or whatever we\nmay be talking about in order to scale and\n\n409\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.320\nprovide high availability.\n\n410\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.930\nAnd then the ability to failover,\nterms you've heard us use and\n\n411\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.660\ndiscussion items that\nare important to IT professionals.\n\n412\n00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.740\nWe have that capability now,\nas we've talked about before, in SCOM,\n\n413\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.344\nin the System Center Ops Manager\nproduct in 2012 SP1, and\n\n414\n00:19:48.344 --> 00:19:51.473\n2012 R2,\nbecause we now have the resource pool.\n\n415\n00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:54.310\nYou can see me pointing to it\nright here and circling around it.\n\n416\n00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.010\nMultiple resource servers or\n\n417\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.360\nmanagement servers in\nthe resource pool now are scaled.\n\n418\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.430\nAnd are set up automatically out of\nthe box as we join the resource pool\n\n419\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.460\nto be highly available.\n\n420\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.930\nMeaning they all operate essentially\nas mirrors of one another.\n\n421\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.265\nThey're all equally going to access all\nservices, provide all capabilities.\n\n422\n00:20:13.265 --> 00:20:16.965\nUnlike in earlier versions of\nSCOM where we have the RMS rule,\n\n423\n00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:18.205\nthe Root Management Server and\n\n424\n00:20:18.205 --> 00:20:21.612\nthen all of the other servers\nwere not gonna have full rights.\n\n425\n00:20:21.612 --> 00:20:23.932\nAnd we had a hierarchical solution,\n\n426\n00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:26.212\nwe have a flat model now\nwhere everybody's equal.\n\n427\n00:20:26.212 --> 00:20:30.782\nAnd so we have co-equality and that allows\nus to scale out and we can scale and\n\n428\n00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:35.090\nprovide high availability by scaling\nvertically And adding servers to the pool.\n\n429\n00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.660\nInstead of having to worry\nabout horizontally building.\n\n430\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.440\nSame idea when we wanna think about what's\ngoing on on the gateway server side.\n\n431\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.250\nIf we wanna provide for high availability\nand failover thought processes,\n\n432\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.100\nwe may need more than one gateway server.\n\n433\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.460\nAnd so we wanna think about that.\n\n434\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.782\nAnd if we choose to do that,\n\n435\n00:20:51.782 --> 00:20:54.951\nthere is a little magic behind\nthe scenes that we gotta engage in.\n\n436\n00:20:54.951 --> 00:20:57.090\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of set\nup that we have to do?\n\n437\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.452\n&gt;&gt; A little bit of configuration\nthat we have to engage in.\n\n438\n00:20:58.452 --> 00:20:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Configuration, okay.\n\n439\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that we just wanna\nmake sure we're taking note of.\n\n440\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.870\nAnd so when we come down here,\nsetting up gateway servers for\n\n441\n00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.550\nfailover between management servers.\n\n442\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:12.300\nWhoops, you can see that we can do this,\ngateway servers can be scaled out.\n\n443\n00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.175\nAnd so how do we set this up?\n\n444\n00:21:14.175 --> 00:21:17.530\nThought it would be good just give you\na little idea of how to do this here.\n\n445\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.890\nI'm not actually able to\nscroll down any more.\n\n446\n00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.430\nSo if we could just go full screen for\njust a minute, just so\n\n447\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.660\nthat way we could see the bottom,\nthere we go.\n\n448\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.640\nSo I'm covering over like\na third of the actual script.\n\n449\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.160\nSo you see we logged on again to\nthe management server in this case with\n\n450\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.970\nan account that's a member of the admin\nrole for the management group.\n\n451\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.290\nSo we need to scale out to do that,\nhave the appropriate rights.\n\n452\n00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.130\nWe then go ahead and we open up\nthe System Center Ops Manager, or\n\n453\n00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.410\nSCOM PowerShell Command Shell.\n\n454\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.000\nSo when I say Command Shell here in Step\n3, reference Step 2 and remember it's\n\n455\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.290\nactually the SCOM Command Shell that's\ngot PowerShell capabilities built in.\n\n456\n00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.420\nThe module to support SCOM is\nalready installed and available.\n\n457\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.050\nYou get that from the console\nand/or you can get that from\n\n458\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.150\ngoing to just the applicationary and\nopening it up so it's gonna be there.\n\n459\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.746\nAnd then we would type in\nthe three lines you see here.\n\n460\n00:22:05.746 --> 00:22:08.815\nGatewayServer as declared\nas a variable here equal to\n\n461\n00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:11.755\nthe Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer\ncmdlet.\n\n462\n00:22:11.755 --> 00:22:14.910\nAnd we specify the name of\nthe management server in question.\n\n463\n00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.150\nFor the gateway management server,\n\n464\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.830\nI'm just using some placeholders\nthere in the quotes.\n\n465\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.150\nYou would obviously put in\nthe appropriate server names for\n\n466\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.578\nwhatever you're doing, we have the\nfailover server variable declared here.\n\n467\n00:22:24.578 --> 00:22:28.880\nGet- SCOMManagementServer -Name and\nagain I got two management servers here.\n\n468\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.300\nJust you know ManServer01, ManServer02,\nshort for management server.\n\n469\n00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.310\nYou can call them anything you want.\n\n470\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.100\nWhatever they're actually\nnamed you put those in there.\n\n471\n00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.230\nAnd then the one that we ultimately\nwill then use is a cmdlet,\n\n472\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.650\nthe third one after we use our first two\nstatements to declare our variables and\n\n473\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.383\nload up the names into the variables.\n\n474\n00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:53.150\nWe have Set- SCOMParentManagementServer,\nand then GatewayServer.\n\n475\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.115\nAnd we pull in the variable value for\nGatewayServer set to in my case,\n\n476\n00:22:57.115 --> 00:23:00.790\nADAM01.ITPRO.tv, and then FailoverServer.\n\n477\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:06.515\nThe value, or values for FailoverServer\nset to ManServer01, ManServer02.\n\n478\n00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:11.805\nAnd then we pull those in, run those\nthree lines, substitute the appropriate\n\n479\n00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:17.190\nnamed instances or named servers there\nas necessary in your environment.\n\n480\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.050\nAnd when you do that you'll actually then,\n\n481\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.760\nnow this does assume of course you\nhave the appropriate server setup.\n\n482\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.750\nAnd that you can obviously pull them in,\nmeaning you have to have\n\n483\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.630\nmore than one management server on\nthe inside that you're connecting to.\n\n484\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.750\nAnd you will do this on all\nthe gateway servers that you're using.\n\n485\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.251\nIf you're using more than one,\n\n486\n00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:38.867\nthen obviously you go to each gateway\nserver and you set up each gateway server\n\n487\n00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:42.221\nto failover to a different management\nserver internally one at a time.\n\n488\n00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:45.257\nSo, you may have to run this multiple\ntimes across different gateways,\n\n489\n00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:48.240\nin different geographies to\nconfigure this, it's up to you.\n\n490\n00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.800\nBut as long as we have a resource\npool running with multiple\n\n491\n00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.180\nmanagement servers on the inside, and\ntraditionally we would normally do that.\n\n492\n00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.250\nRemember that's gonna be,\nthe management service or\n\n493\n00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.590\ntarget are gonna be these right here,\ninside the resource pool.\n\n494\n00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.668\nPretend this is Man01,\npretend this is Man02.\n\n495\n00:24:04.668 --> 00:24:07.220\nIn theory Man03, we just didn't\nput it into the demo script.\n\n496\n00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.929\n&gt;&gt; So we could just put a comma and\nthen add the name,\n\n497\n00:24:08.929 --> 00:24:10.651\nlike you did with the other two,\nin that script?\n\n498\n00:24:13.968 --> 00:24:15.220\nOn the script line?\n\n499\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Well we already did that in\nthe script line, that we already have-\n\n500\n00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you had two on the script, but\n\n501\n00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.860\nyou've got three there, so we could\njust add if we had extra resources.\n\n502\n00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.890\nThat's where we would put them, right?\n\n503\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.610\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about adding a third\nmanagement server in for failover?\n\n504\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n505\n00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we would just continue to comma\nseparate them as we go, absolutely.\n\n506\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.650\nSo we would add in whatever\nthe resource pool servers are.\n\n507\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.080\nI'm just pointing out that when we link\nthose thought processes coming out of\n\n508\n00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.050\nthe script back here,\nto show you what we're talking about.\n\n509\n00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.450\nThese are our management\nservers on the inside.\n\n510\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.000\nThis is the gateway server that\nwe're talking about out here, right?\n\n511\n00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.500\nSo, if we had three different gateway\nservers, you'd run those three lines\n\n512\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.950\nonce per gateway server targeting the\ninternal management servers that you want\n\n513\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.380\nthem to communicate with and fail over to\nin the event of a interruption or failure.\n\n514\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.500\nAnd that's how you would scale\nthis out and ensure that we have\n\n515\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.570\nthe ability to have the highly available\nsolution apply to the gateway server.\n\n516\n00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.390\nCuz now it'll continue to be able\nto talk to management servers\n\n517\n00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.520\neven if the primary management\nserver it's connected were to fail.\n\n518\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.970\nThe others in the pool can pick it up and\ncontinue working with it.\n\n519\n00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.290\nSo, just making sure that you have a sense\nof how we configure the gateway server,\n\n520\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.250\nliterally almost start to finish with\nall the different steps involved.\n\n521\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.840\nWalking through them so you understand\nhow to do this both certainly\n\n522\n00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.210\nin the real world if required to.\n\n523\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.865\nAlthough as we said probably not gonna\nhappen too often if you're gonna set up\n\n524\n00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:34.250\na gateway server more than once,\nyou're probably doing it a lot.\n\n525\n00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.085\nCuz once you stand up your\ngateway server initially or\n\n526\n00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:39.875\ngateway servers if you have a need for\nmore than one.\n\n527\n00:25:39.875 --> 00:25:41.556\nYou probably won't messed around them and\n\n528\n00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:44.365\neven interact with them again unless\nthey were to fail for some reason.\n\n529\n00:25:44.365 --> 00:25:45.645\nYou had to reconstitute one.\n\n530\n00:25:45.645 --> 00:25:49.925\nSo it's a very rare event compared\nto the standard day to day\n\n531\n00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:52.565\nopportunities we have to manage and\nmaintain SCOM.\n\n532\n00:25:52.565 --> 00:25:55.770\nBut It is an important one if\nyou have a need to do this.\n\n533\n00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.640\nAnd if you do,\n\n534\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.720\nat least now you have a little how-to\nwalk-through along with some supporting\n\n535\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.080\ndocumentation that will walk you through\nthe logic of how to get the job done.\n\n536\n00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n537\n00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.340\nWell, now we know,\neverything from that pre-staging and\n\n538\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.830\nthen even implying our redundancies\nhere so thank you for that, Adam.\n\n539\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.220\nAnd thank you for joining us, but\n\n540\n00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.630\nstay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n541\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.150\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n542\n00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.150\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n543\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:17.780\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n544\n00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.557\n&gt;&gt; See ya next time here at ITProTV.\n\n545\n00:26:20.557 --> 00:26:27.031\n[MUSIC]\n\n546\n00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
