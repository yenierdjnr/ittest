          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:04,994\n[SOUND] The 70-413 exam is the first\n\n2\n00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:09,102\nexam on the way to completing your\n\n3\n00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:17,188\nMicrosoft Certified Solutions\nExpert Certificate, the MCSE.\n\n4\n00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:20,615\nThe MCSE is one of the most sought\nafter certifications from Microsoft and\n\n5\n00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:24,539\nit's definitely one of the most well known\nIT certifications throughout the entire\n\n6\n00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,110\nindustry so it's definitely\na target people are looking for.\n\n7\n00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,140\nMicrosoft has expanded the MCSE\nquite a bit over the years so\n\n8\n00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,060\nthere's actually more than one track.\n\n9\n00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,590\nLet's start and take a look at that real\nquick before we dive into the nitty gritty\n\n10\n00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,730\ndetails.\n\n11\n00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,830\nI've got the Microsoft certification and\ntraining page pulled up here and\n\n12\n00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,780\nthey're just showing all of\nthe different MCSE's that are available.\n\n13\n00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,770\nThere's the MCSE desktop infrastructure,\nwhich is important for\n\n14\n00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,960\npeople who are going to be\nsupporting Windows 7 or\n\n15\n00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,940\nWindows 8 desktops in a corporate or\nlarge enterprise environment.\n\n16\n00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,110\nThey cover technologies based on deploying\nhundreds of thousands of machines and\n\n17\n00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,490\nmaintaining them.\n\n18\n00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,520\nBut when you have that many desktops you\nneed servers to provide services and\n\n19\n00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,030\nthat's where the MCSE server\ninfrastructure comes in.\n\n20\n00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,460\nNow, there is an MCSE for Windows Server\n2012 as well as Windows Server 2008.\n\n21\n00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,240\nSo depending on which\ncertification you're looking for,\n\n22\n00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,560\nyou'll want to make sure you\nchoose the appropriate one.\n\n23\n00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,390\nThe ones here on IT Pro TV are built\naround Windows Server 2012,\n\n24\n00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,580\nwe choose to do the newer\ncertification as opposed to the older.\n\n25\n00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,520\nBut you'll see that there are other ones\nout there, like the private cloud, for\n\n26\n00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,740\nsetting up the system center solutions\nthat are available through Microsoft.\n\n27\n00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,820\nThere's enterprise devices and apps,\nwhich focuses around mobile and\n\n28\n00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,910\nsome development.\n\n29\n00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,600\nData platform for databases.\n\n30\n00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,420\nBusiness Intelligence for\nusing the data in the databases.\n\n31\n00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,708\nWe've got Messaging, which is for\nMicrosoft Exchange and collaboration.\n\n32\n00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,660\nYou got MSCE: Communication,\n\n33\n00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,790\nwhich is built around the link server and\nsome of the voice over IP technologies.\n\n34\n00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,000\nAnd then good old SharePoint, for\ninformation exchange and handling.\n\n35\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,400\nQuite a few different MCSEs.\n\n36\n00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,610\nWhen someone out there says,\nhey, I'm an MCSE.\n\n37\n00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,100\nWe have to follow it up with a question,\nwith great, what are you an MCSE in?\n\n38\n00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,240\nWhich one are you actually certified in?\n\n39\n00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,660\nWell, we're tackling the most common one,\nand that's server infrastructure.\n\n40\n00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,980\nThese are employees that will be\nresponsible for configuring and\n\n41\n00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,730\nmaintaining servers.\n\n42\n00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,580\nNow, those servers might\nbe providing name look ups.\n\n43\n00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,760\nIt might be authentication, file servers,\nprint servers Email servers,\n\n44\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,250\nwho knows what they're providing.\n\n45\n00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,430\nBut the basic foundation is\nthe Microsoft Windows Server product, and\n\n46\n00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,890\nwe need to know the ins and outs of it,\n\n47\n00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,410\nand that's what the MCSE Server\nInfrastructure is all about.\n\n48\n00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,980\nNow, MSCE Server Infrastructure, that's\nthe generic name for the certification.\n\n49\n00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,960\nThere's specific tests,\nthough, catered to whether or\n\n50\n00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,480\nnot you are doing Windows server 2012 or\nWindows server 2008.\n\n51\n00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,530\nIf you are doing Windows server 2012,\n\n52\n00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,480\nnotice that there's five\ndifferent exams listed here.\n\n53\n00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,500\nMost of these, you should already have.\n\n54\n00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,490\nIf you are pursuing the MCSC,\nyou have to get your MCSA first.\n\n55\n00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,940\nLike the MCSC, there are several MSCAs,\nyou need the MCSA for\n\n56\n00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,870\nServer Infrastructure for\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n57\n00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,010\nWhen you have the MCSA for\n\n58\n00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,540\nWindows Server 2012 that's these three\nexams right here, 410, 411, and 412.\n\n59\n00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,990\nIt's actually 70-410, 70-411, and 70-412.\n\n60\n00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,730\nIf you don't have your MCSA yet,\nstop here.\n\n61\n00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,140\nYou don't need the MSCE videos just yet.\n\n62\n00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,710\nJump back to the MCSA, right?\n\n63\n00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,690\nWe've already filmed them\nright here on ITProTV and\n\n64\n00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,980\nyou can start moving through\nstarting with 70-410.\n\n65\n00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,080\nIf you go out of order one of two\nthings is going to happen, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,260\nOne, you'll get in over\nyour head very fast.\n\n67\n00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,860\nWhen we start right here with 70-413,\n\n68\n00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,380\nit's assumed you already have all the\nknowledge from those first three shows.\n\n69\n00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,940\nSo that's problem number one.\n\n70\n00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,580\nProblem number two is,\nif you start here and\n\n71\n00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,510\nyou go pass this exam,\nyou will not get a certification for it.\n\n72\n00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,880\nYou cannot get your MCSE unless\nyou also have your MCSA.\n\n73\n00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,940\nThat's the starting point,\nbefore you proceed to here.\n\n74\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,970\nNow at 70-413 is this, designing and\nimplementing a server infrastructure and\n\n75\n00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,010\nthis is a really neat one.\n\n76\n00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,230\nIt's different than pretty much any\nother show we've done on IT Pro TV.\n\n77\n00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,990\nIn 410, 411, and 412, you learn how\nto do a ton of different things.\n\n78\n00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,000\nHow to set up the active directory.\n\n79\n00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,810\nHow to configure routing and\nremote access.\n\n80\n00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,850\nHow to do all this stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,750\nBut you never really address the why.\n\n82\n00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,230\nWhy would I choose to use\nIPsec instead of PPTP?\n\n83\n00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,290\nWhy would I choose to use\nnetwork access protection?\n\n84\n00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,250\nWhy would I choose to have four\nactive directory domain controllers\n\n85\n00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,290\ninstead of one?\n\n86\n00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,070\nWhy would I choose to have five\ndomains instead of just having\n\n87\n00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,960\none domain in a single forest.\n\n88\n00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,530\nWhy do we make these decisions?\n\n89\n00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,470\nWell that's what the 70-413 show covers.\n\n90\n00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,540\nWe take a look at a lot of\nthe different infrastructure,\n\n91\n00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,860\nthe things that were covered\nin the other servers.\n\n92\n00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,760\nAnd now we find out the why,\nthe design mechanisms that go behind this.\n\n93\n00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,240\nHow we make the right decisions.\n\n94\n00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,110\nThis is not a responsibility that\nsomebody new to IT is going to be doing.\n\n95\n00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,340\nNobody is going to hire somebody\nright out of college and say,\n\n96\n00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,110\n\"hey can you design my network\".\n\n97\n00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,080\nBecause if you choose a poor design\non day one it's going to have\n\n98\n00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,880\nlasting ramifications for\nthe life of that network.\n\n99\n00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,340\nYou need somebody with experience and\n\n100\n00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,810\na deep understanding of how all\nthe different pieces interact.\n\n101\n00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,850\nWhen you have that understanding,\nyou can create a very stable,\n\n102\n00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,760\nvery reliable design.\n\n103\n00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,710\nThat will give you a much better network\nexperience throughout the life of your\n\n104\n00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,680\ntechnology.\n\n105\n00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,590\nSo, that's what's covered in 70-413.\n\n106\n00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,320\nThere is some implementation.\n\n107\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,050\nThere's a few technologies we cover in\nthere that weren't on the other exams and\n\n108\n00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,530\nso we actually show those.\n\n109\n00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,580\nBut most of it is just discussing designs.\n\n110\n00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,880\nPossible arrangements of technologies to\nprovide the best possible deployment and\n\n111\n00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,260\nthe different things we have to take\ninto account that influence our design.\n\n112\n00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,930\nWe have to make modifications\nbased on our current network.\n\n113\n00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,450\nSo it's really neat,\nit's very conceptual, and\n\n114\n00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,150\nit's all built around stuff you've already\nlearned, so I will just reiterate it here.\n\n115\n00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,070\nIt is really important that you complete\nthose first three certification exams\n\n116\n00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,868\nbefore progressing to here.\n\n117\n00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:09,440\nNow once 413 is done, you are ready to\nmove on to 414 the other part of MCSC for\n\n118\n00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,630\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n119\n00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,890\nAnd it's implementing an advanced\nserver infrastructure.\n\n120\n00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,750\nYou take some of those earlier services\nand you extend them even further with some\n\n121\n00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,690\nadvanced functionality that's in there and\nwe even take a look at some other\n\n122\n00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,250\nones like active directory federation\nservices that are just much more\n\n123\n00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,340\ncomplex than any of the technologies\ndeployed in the earlier shows.\n\n124\n00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,210\nSo, really neat stuff here.\n\n125\n00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,080\nWhen you pass these two exams,\n\n126\n00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,520\nIf you already have your MCSA\nyou'll then be awarded the MCSE.\n\n127\n00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,970\nAnd for most people,\nthat's where they stop with Microsoft.\n\n128\n00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,750\nMicrosoft does have a few\nhigher tier certifications,\n\n129\n00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,590\nlike the Microsoft Certified Architect.\n\n130\n00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,220\nI know they were talking\nabout retiring that one, or\n\n131\n00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,480\nthe Microsoft Certified Master\nwas another one.\n\n132\n00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,280\nBut their still out there,\nyou can still achieve those.\n\n133\n00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,350\nBut they are just not very common they\nare very, very difficult to get and so\n\n134\n00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,260\nmost people stop right\nthere with the M-C-S-E.\n\n135\n00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,380\nBut is that the end if you are learning?\n\n136\n00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,090\nNo, once you've completed that it's\na good idea to broaden your horizons.\n\n137\n00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,030\nYou likely are having to integrate to\nproducts from other vendors like Linux or\n\n138\n00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,650\nMac OS and so you may extend out to\nstart learning about those platforms and\n\n139\n00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,790\ndeploying service with those technologies.\n\n140\n00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,870\nSo just keep that in mind as you move\nthrough, while this might seem like\n\n141\n00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,830\nthe end of your certification path with\nMicrosoft, it may just be the beginning\n\n142\n00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,350\nof you entering into other operating\nsystems, so always pay attention, look for\n\n143\n00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,430\nthe various resources that\nare out there learn all you can.\n\n144\n00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,920\nThat's the piece of advice I always\ngive to people is, learn all you can.\n\n145\n00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,010\nBecause it never hurts to know additional\ninformation it's always going to help.\n\n146\n00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,950\nSo
