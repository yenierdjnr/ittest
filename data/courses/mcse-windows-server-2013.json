          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,105\n[SOUND] The 70-414 exam\nis the final step for\n\n2\n00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:12,056\ncandidates that are looking\nto achieve the MCSE\n\n3\n00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:17,275\nserver infrastructure certification.\n\n4\n00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:18,885\nIt's a long road.\n\n5\n00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There's a lot of stuff that you gotta\n\n6\n00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,540\nlearn along the way.\n\n7\n00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,900\nAnd this is kinda the end.\n\n8\n00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,220\nSo let's take a minute and\njust look at what this entails, and\n\n9\n00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,530\nlet's start really high level.\n\n10\n00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,100\nBy the time you've gotten to this point,\n\n11\n00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,250\nyou more than likely know what\nthe MCSE server infrastructure is.\n\n12\n00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,050\nBut let's just take a glance at it\nreal quick, do a quick overview, and\n\n13\n00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,800\nthen we'll dive into exactly what\nthis exam and certification entail.\n\n14\n00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,002\n>> Cool.\n\n15\n00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:45,930\nAll right now the MCSE server\ninfrastructure it actually starts out\n\n16\n00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,220\nas the MCSA server infrastructure.\n\n17\n00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,551\nSo, by the time you're at this point, you\nshould have already completed the 7410,\n\n18\n00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:56,830\n411 and 412 examinations,\nonce you've achieved those,\n\n19\n00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,430\nyou get the MCSA Server\nAdministrator Certification.\n\n20\n00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,860\nIt's the Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate.\n\n21\n00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,777\nThat's MCSA.\n>> I love the way that they changed\n\n22\n00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,700\nthe name, and left the acronym the same.\n\n23\n00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,794\nIt's a really good for all of us,] right?\n\n24\n00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,391\n>> It's a lot better than the way\nit used to be, you know, for\n\n25\n00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:16,190\na little while it became the MCTS, and\nthe MCITP, and everyone hated that.\n\n26\n00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,660\nSo at least it's back to the original\nacronyms that people like.\n\n27\n00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,735\nYou should already have your MCSA\nbefore moving into the MCSE.\n\n28\n00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:24,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n29\n00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,540\n>> Right?\nIt kinda goes without saying.\n\n30\n00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,040\n>> Yep.\n>> And the main reason is the MCSA\n\n31\n00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,360\nreally focuses on the how to do things.\n\n32\n00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,920\nHow to implement active directory.\n\n33\n00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,610\nHow to install DNS.\n\n34\n00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,490\nHow to set up file replication services.\n\n35\n00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,358\nHow to do all these different things.\n\n36\n00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:40,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n37\n00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,390\nBut you don't get the why side of it.\n\n38\n00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,940\nRight?\nAnd\n\n39\n00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,850\nthat's because somebody at the MCSA\nlevel is not doing designs,\n\n40\n00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,550\nthey're doing implementation.\n\n41\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,790\n>> Right.\n>> They're the grunt-workers,\n\n42\n00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,480\nthe people in the field\nactually making things happen,\n\n43\n00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,860\nwhich is really important work.\n\n44\n00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,680\n>> Right.\n>> Don't let me\n\n45\n00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520\nsound like that's not important.\n\n46\n00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,720\nWhat they do is extremely important, but\n\n47\n00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,650\nsomebody has to be behind the scenes\ngoverning our overall design.\n\n48\n00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,960\n>> Right.\n\n49\n00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,100\nAnd that's when the MCSE comes in.\n\n50\n00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,210\nWhoever has that role,\nthe Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert,\n\n51\n00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,160\nthey're the person that's coming up with\nthe overall, the big picture, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,380\nNot necessarily going into the field and\ndoing the work.\n\n53\n00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,530\nNow, you need to already have that\nexperience because how do you a design if\n\n54\n00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,760\nyou don't know how something works.\n\n55\n00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,530\nBut they need to understand the why.\n\n56\n00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,200\nAnd at this point, you also should\nhave completed the 7413 exam,\n\n57\n00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,730\nwhich was the first one that really\ndived straight into designing and\n\n58\n00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,910\nimplementing a server infrastructure.\n\n59\n00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,510\nWe rehash all of the things in 410,\n411, and 412.\n\n60\n00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,360\nRight here on 413 we're looking at the why\nyou do these things why you might need\n\n61\n00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,730\nfive servers as opposed to four servers\nwhere you would put those servers in\n\n62\n00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,340\nthe global design.\n\n63\n00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,890\nThat leads us to the last one which is\n7414 the show that we're getting prepared\n\n64\n00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,800\nfor right here with\nthis one we dive not so\n\n65\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,410\nmuch into the why of our server\ninfrastructure but how we manage and\n\n66\n00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,140\nmaintain that server infrastructure,\nhow you keep your data center operational?\n\n67\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,970\nAnd it really does build\naround the data center.\n\n68\n00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,870\nWe kind of put workstations\nout of our mind.\n\n69\n00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,270\nAny workstation stuff on this one?\n\n70\n00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,290\n>> I don't think so at all.\n\n71\n00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,430\nReally in your SAs,\nyou're learning how to monitor and\n\n72\n00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,880\nmanage your individual\nservers you're setting up.\n\n73\n00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,110\nYou're the DHCP admin or that DNS admin.\n\n74\n00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,870\nNow you're talking about monitoring your\nwhole solution, and your data center, and\n\n75\n00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,100\nyour virtual machine infrastructure and\nall of that.\n\n76\n00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,350\n>> So whenever it comes to monitoring\nthese days the Microsoft monitoring\n\n77\n00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,270\nmanaging, they have their\nsystem center suite.\n\n78\n00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,980\nAnd so what we're gonna do is\nlook at if you're running your\n\n79\n00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,560\nown data center even if its\ncloud data center right.\n\n80\n00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,830\nYou tied a Windows Azure or whatever.\n\n81\n00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,290\nYou need to monitor and\nmanage those systems and\n\n82\n00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,660\nthere are a number of system center\nsolutions that deal with that.\n\n83\n00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,210\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna take a look at.\n\n84\n00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,880\nThe general best practices for\nhow you should be running your environment\n\n85\n00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,440\nas well as the tools from\nMicrosoft that you can use.\n\n86\n00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,230\nRight?\nYou don't have to in real life.\n\n87\n00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,230\nYou can use whatever you want.\n\n88\n00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,740\nBut if you wanna pass this exam you\nneed to know the system center stuff.\n\n89\n00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,380\nSo we're kinda shifting and\nthat's why this one was designing and\n\n90\n00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,280\nthis one is just implementing.\n\n91\n00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,750\nRight?\nImplementing in advanced server\n\n92\n00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,541\ninfrastructure because we're gonna see,\nwe are going to see a lot of design,\n\n93\n00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,440\nwe'll get to that with\nthe exam objectives.\n\n94\n00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,500\nIt is focused more on what\nyou need to put in place to\n\n95\n00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,460\nkeep your data center running nice and\nsmooth and keep an eye on it.\n\n96\n00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,730\nWhen you've completed that fifth exam,\nyou'll be awarded the MCSE,\n\n97\n00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,090\nthe Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert.\n\n98\n00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,790\nAnd that will designate that you are an\nexpert, that you know how to implement\n\n99\n00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,700\na data center according to\nMicrosoft's best practices, right,\n\n100\n00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,790\na server infrastructure.\n\n101\n00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,780\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at the exam itself.\n\n102\n00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,340\nAll right.\nIf I jump over here to the 7414\n\n103\n00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,250\nexam, it's $150.\n\n104\n00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,060\nRight?\n\n105\n00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,720\nMicrosoft exams are really reasonably\n\n106\n00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,340\npriced compared to other\nvendors these days.\n\n107\n00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,380\nAlthough you do have to\ntake a lot of the exams.\n\n108\n00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,880\n>> And then again every three years or\nsomething.\n\n109\n00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,170\nSo they get their money.\n\n110\n00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,919\n>> Yep.\nSo we do have a new exam, 70-414.\n\n111\n00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,170\nIt's $150.00 to take it.\n\n112\n00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,090\nYou can take it at any\nPearson View Center.\n\n113\n00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,970\nRight today, while we're taping this,\nyou can still take the exam at Sylvan for\n\n114\n00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,010\nMetrics Centers also.\n\n115\n00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,790\nThat ends, I think they make a note of\nthat right here, yeah, January 1st, 2015.\n\n116\n00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,350\nSo, if you're watching this\nJanuary 1st 2015 or later,\n\n117\n00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,750\nwhich is only, two months away.\n\n118\n00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,230\nThen, after that point, you won't be able\nto take it at Prometric anymore, right?\n\n119\n00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,260\nSo you'll need to take it at view, and\n\n120\n00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,341\nI would just plan on taking\nit at view right now.\n\n121\n00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,930\n>> Yea, and\nyou look at there where it says,\n\n122\n00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,700\nI think with Prometric it takes five\nto seven business days I think.\n\n123\n00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,610\nSo they're just not.\n\n124\n00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,000\nVery quick with that stuff or Pearson VUE\nyou can find out that day or the next day,\n\n125\n00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,480\nand get your transcript updated,\nthings like that.\n\n126\n00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,120\n>> You'll always find your pass or fail\nscore right at the end of the exam, so\n\n127\n00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,990\nthey do that.\n\n128\n00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,090\nWhat Mike's talking about is they\n\n129\n00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,970\nhave to get that information\nback to Microsoft, right.\n\n130\n00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,022\nAnd yeah,\nthat's what's pretty bad about that.\n\n131\n00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,450\nAll right, so\nthat's why we see both of them here, but\n\n132\n00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,010\nif I were you I would just plan on view\nand not worry about the record so much.\n\n133\n00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,720\nAll right, so that's the exam cost.\n\n134\n00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,840\nThey give you some basic information but\nthey aren't really detailed about things\n\n135\n00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,270\nlike how many questions you have and\nwhat's the passing score, and so on.\n\n136\n00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,900\nThat's because Microsoft does\nthese performance based exams, and\n\n137\n00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,587\nthat means you could have several\ndifferent amounts of questions.\n\n138\n00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,560\nSo, Mike, you and I could go and\ntake this exam right now and\n\n139\n00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,820\nI might have 50 more questions than you.\n\n140\n00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,200\nThat doesn't mean that\nMike got an easier exam,\n\n141\n00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,980\njust means maybe you got\nmore simulations that I did.\n\n142\n00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,210\n>> Right.\nAn old, drag and drop,\n\n143\n00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,760\nput them in place type questions,\nthings like that.\n\n144\n00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,860\n>> And they do full, it's not flash based.\n\n145\n00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,010\nI forget what they built it on.\n\n146\n00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,950\nProbably silverlight.\n\n147\n00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,535\nThey do these imbedded plug ins that\nactually give you a fake Windows UI so\n\n148\n00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:03,585\nyou can go through and\nconfigure some things.\n\n149\n00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:05,235\nThey're awkward and I\n>> They are.\n\n150\n00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:06,004\n>> But they're in there.\n\n151\n00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's supposed to show that you actually\n\n152\n00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,185\nhave that experience.\n\n153\n00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:12,810\nOn a design exam, though,\none like this you're gonna have a lot more\n\n154\n00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,020\nword problems, a lot of where\nthey describe an environment and\n\n155\n00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,080\nyou make recommended changes\nbased on your knowledge.\n\n156\n00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,950\n>> Yeah, bring your reading\nglasses if you need them.\n\n157\n00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,720\nIt's like reading an essay in there and\nthen going back and\n\n158\n00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,115\nanswering ten questions on\nthis essay they've given you.\n\n159\n00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:27,650\nMm-hm.\n\n160\n00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,770\nAll right, so some of the other things we\nneed to know, the exam objectives, right?\n\n161\n00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,720\nThis one covers what doesn't look\nlike all that much in the beginning.\n\n162\n00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,790\nReally just four objectives,\nnice and small.\n\n163\n00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,370\nWe've got manage and\nmaintain a server infrastructure.\n\n164\n00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,870\nAnd notice how each of these\nare listed as 25 to 30%.\n\n165\n00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,310\nExcept the last one's 20 to 25%.\n\n166\n00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,270\nSo the exam's pretty evenly\ndivided across these four.\n\n167\n00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,660\nAnd the first one is just straight\nup server infrastructure.\n\n168\n00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,160\nSo we're talking about, you've got\na data center, you've got servers,\n\n169\n00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,610\nyou've got physical servers and\nvirtual servers.\n\n170\n00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,440\nWe need to maintain that infrastructure.\n\n171\n00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,700\nAnd if we break that out you'll see they\nbreak it down into quite a few things,\n\n172\n00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,170\nstarting with an administrative model.\n\n173\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,070\nRight?\nAdministrative models are how we\n\n174\n00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,990\nimplement management.\n\n175\n00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,110\nIs it just one person,\nis it multiple people,\n\n176\n00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,720\ndo people have different levels of access?\n\n177\n00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,519\nThose are all different things we think\nabout in our administrative model.\n\n178\n00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,280\nThen we've got our\nmonitoring strategy right?\n\n179\n00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,348\nHow are we going to monitor this.\n\n180\n00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,500\nIf a server fails, if an issue happens,\nhow do we get information?\n\n181\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,460\nIf we're troubleshooting what historical\ndata do we have to collect to be able\n\n182\n00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,150\nto look at and what tools and\nresources are available to us?\n\n183\n00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,760\nAnd that's when we start introducing\nthe viewers into System Center 2012.\n\n184\n00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,720\nAnd we're going to be doing\nSystem Center 2012 R2,\n\n185\n00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,380\nbecause that's what's on\nthe new version of the exam.\n\n186\n00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,070\nSo we'll be using that\nthroughout the whole show,\n\n187\n00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,630\nbut in real life, most of what's\nin 2012 is the same in 2012 R2.\n\n188\n00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,220\nBut there will be a few additional\nfeatures we cover that are new in R2.\n\n189\n00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,800\nAnd then we got plan and\n\n190\n00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,770\nimplement automated remediation, so when\nsomething goes wrong, how can we fix it?\n\n191\n00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,330\nRight?\nWhat's our backup plan?\n\n192\n00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,260\nAnd can we automate that, right?\n\n193\n00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,170\nCan we automate taking\ncare of the problems, and\n\n194\n00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,160\ngetting things back up and running?\n\n195\n00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,920\nSo it's a pretty heavy topic for\njust being one part of the exam.\n\n196\n00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,030\nAfter that we break into plan and\n\n197\n00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,810\nimplement a highly available\nenterprise infrastructure.\n\n198\n00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,620\nA better way to deal with failures is to\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,040\n>> Avoid them in the first place.\n\n200\n00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,730\n>> Exactly.\n>> Right,\n\n201\n00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,490\nso what kind of infrastructure can we put\nin place to make it where failures don't\n\n202\n00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,750\naffect our services.\n\n203\n00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,770\nSo we'll talk about clustering,\nnetwork services, network load balancing,\n\n204\n00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,810\nand other things.\n\n205\n00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,600\nAnd then we'll talk about storage,\nwhich is a big deal.\n\n206\n00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,758\nA lot of people don't properly plan for\nstorage failures.\n\n207\n00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:45,225\nThen we'll take a look at other roles\nthat we might need to make redundant.\n\n208\n00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:48,154\nAnd, by roles,\nI mean things like DHCP, DNS,\n\n209\n00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,189\nthey mention [CROSSTALK]\n>> Basic infrastructure that really keeps\n\n210\n00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,270\neverything else running.\n\n211\n00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,160\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd then lastly we've got\n\n212\n00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,370\na business continuity and\ndisaster recovery solution, all right?\n\n213\n00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,780\nAnd I know it kind of sounds the same,\nbut business continuity,\n\n214\n00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,720\nthat means making sure that we can keep\nworking, even when there's a failure.\n\n215\n00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,100\nDuring the failure we might not be at\nfull capacity, but we're still working.\n\n216\n00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,720\nRight.\n>> Huh.\n\n217\n00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,210\n>> Disaster recovery's getting\nus back to peak performance.\n\n218\n00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,870\n>> Right.\n\n219\n00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,000\n>> So, you know, if on a good day you're\nat 100% and then a failure happens,\n\n220\n00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,260\ninstead of dropping to 0%,\n>> Right\n\n221\n00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,660\n>> Then you drop to 50% or something.\n\n222\n00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,530\n>> Huh.\n>> So you're running at half capacity.\n\n223\n00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,630\nAnd then after you fix the problem\nyou come back up to a 100,\n\n224\n00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,410\nso staying at that 50%,\nthat's business continuity.\n\n225\n00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,420\nYou're continuing to do\nbusiness during the failure,\n\n226\n00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,010\nand after we get back up to 100%,\nthat's disaster recovery, we're recovered.\n\n227\n00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,410\nThat's one of those sections right\nthere that in, real life land.\n\n228\n00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,830\nIt's not a skill you use every day but\n\n229\n00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,640\non the day you do use it\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000\n>> You are glad you have it.\n\n231\n00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n232\n00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,365\n>> I have been there.\n\n233\n00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:56,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right now, I know on most of these\n\n234\n00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,365\nthey say 25 to 30%, but this next one,\nit's pretty much guaranteed to be 30%.\n\n235\n00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:05,415\nThe virtualization push\nis huge at Microsoft.\n\n236\n00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,465\nAnd I'm not just talking about HyperV,\nbut Windows Azure also,\n\n237\n00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:11,970\nwhich is built on HyperV, so\nI guess it's kind of the same, but,\n\n238\n00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,160\nthey pretty much expect every environment\nto use virtualization tools now.\n\n239\n00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,720\nSo we've got a big section on it, and\n\n240\n00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,300\nthis'll actually make up a decent part\nof our show because it is so important.\n\n241\n00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,290\nBut you'll see in here we've got\na plan for our virtualization host.\n\n242\n00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,770\nThat's the physical machines.\n\n243\n00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,190\nWe got a plan for our virtual machines.\n\n244\n00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,920\nThe VM's.\nWe'll take a look at networking and\n\n245\n00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,380\nstorage under virtualization and\ndesign considerations and plans.\n\n246\n00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,030\nNotice how a lot of these say plan and\nimplement.\n\n247\n00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,130\nThe plan side,\nwe've gotta come up with our design.\n\n248\n00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,880\nWe gotta plan and\n\n249\n00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,440\nfigure out exactly what we need to provide\nour network the resources it needs.\n\n250\n00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,740\nBut the implement side,\nwe've usually already learned.\n\n251\n00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,100\nOn the implement side, we've already\nlearned how to implement HyperV.\n\n252\n00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,460\nWe already know how to bring up VMs.\n\n253\n00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,910\nThat's not new.\n\n254\n00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,490\nSo what we're adding on are some\nof the System Center Utilities.\n\n255\n00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,100\nThings like\nthe System Center Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n256\n00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100\nSCVMM.\n\n257\n00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,810\nAnd so we'll see some additional things.\n\n258\n00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,660\nYeah, right here.\nVirtual Machine Manager.\n\n259\n00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,100\nSo we'll see bringing system center\ninto the mix to implement these.\n\n260\n00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,450\nWhereas before we might have\ndone it directly in HyperV.\n\n261\n00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,350\nAnd that's essential.\n\n262\n00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,950\nThe larger your data center gets,\n\n263\n00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,610\nthe less practical it is to manage\nthings on an individual server basis.\n\n264\n00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,750\nAnd our last section is design and\nimplement identity and access solutions.\n\n265\n00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,770\n>> Mm.\n>> Mike, this is your favorite section.\n\n266\n00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,990\n>> Oh yeah, we love this stuff.\n\n267\n00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,080\nCertificate services.\n\n268\n00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,780\nLove those.\n\n269\n00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,500\nWe get to dive into that.\n\n270\n00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,700\nSetting up the whole hierarchy.\n\n271\n00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,700\nIt's not just setting up a certificate\nserver, but planning for that the root and\n\n272\n00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,950\nthen your subordinates and\ndeciding how you want to play that out.\n\n273\n00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,570\nAre you doing different subordinates for\ndifferent locations or\n\n274\n00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,790\ndifferent purposes and things like that?\n\n275\n00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,450\nAnd I think we'll end up tying into\nmanaging the certificates themselves and\n\n276\n00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,740\nthen extending our authentication\nbeyond our boundaries.\n\n277\n00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,260\nTaking it out into the cloud or\nwith extranets.\n\n278\n00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,030\nOur business partners doing,\nour federation identity solution.\n\n279\n00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,590\nWe'll take a peak at how\nwe set that up either\n\n280\n00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,170\nwith a business partner or Microsoft.\n\n281\n00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,060\nMicrosoft provides that federation\nservices that we can tie into there.\n\n282\n00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,930\nThen getting into RMS and\neverybody uses RMS right Don?\n\n283\n00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,150\nOh yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n284\n00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,545\nIt's widely deployed.\n\n285\n00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> We make fun of it.\n\n286\n00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,800\nThe right's management service, it's\n>> It is good because we've talked\n\n287\n00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,720\na little bit about it before, but\nit does give you the ability to take those\n\n288\n00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,510\npermissions and tie them to the document\nitself, not to the file system.\n\n289\n00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,330\nSo we can extend our control over those\nresources beyond our boundaries and\n\n290\n00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,920\nbeyond our file systems.\n\n291\n00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,870\n>> It does have a good place in it.\n\n292\n00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,990\n>> Yeah.\nIf you're an all Microsoft shop,\n\n293\n00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,940\nRMS is a great way to do\ndigital rights management, DRM.\n\n294\n00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,130\nRight?\n\n295\n00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,850\nBut if you've got users that are external\nto your organization there's a good bit of\n\n296\n00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,360\nplanning that has to go into that.\n\n297\n00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,770\nAnd if you're not a Microsoft shop,\nif you have a mixture of platforms,\n\n298\n00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,340\nthere's a lot of planning\nthat has to go in there.\n\n299\n00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,640\nSo So we kinda tackled that, but this last\nsection here, they do downplay a bit,\n\n300\n00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,470\nsee how they say 20%- 25%, so a smaller\nportion of the exam comes from there, but\n\n301\n00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,350\nit is important, it's good information\nto know, especially if you're gonna be\n\n302\n00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,810\nextending your data center into the cloud,\ninto Windows Azure or\n\n303\n00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,320\nwhatever, you'll want to be able\nto link credentials between those.\n\n304\n00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,890\nAnd that's the type of stuff\nthat we'll tackle down there.\n\n305\n00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,500\nSo those are the overall objectives that's\ngonna be covered in this certification.\n\n306\n00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,340\nEven if you're not seeking\nthe certification a lot of this is good\n\n307\n00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,840\nknowledge to have.\n\n308\n00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,520\nBut I will say this.\n\n309\n00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,880\nIf you're just getting\nstarted in IT the MCSE is\n\n310\n00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,070\nnot the certification\nyou should be seeking.\n\n311\n00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,450\nThe MCSE is designed for\npeople who have been in the field for\n\n312\n00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,150\nmany years at this point.\n\n313\n00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,200\nThat have already implemented\nthe technologies,\n\n314\n00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,730\nthey already understand the how's and\nso on, and\n\n315\n00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,070\nthey've seen enough different environments\nto start to understand the why's.\n\n316\n00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,850\nSo what we're really doing is applying\nMicrosoft's best practices to those why's\n\n317\n00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,850\nand getting ready for\nthat more of a management position.\n\n318\n00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,160\nSo if you are,\n\n319\n00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,505\nif you have a goal of becoming a system\nadmin manager or a network manager.\n\n320\n00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or something like that.\n\n321\n00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,910\nThat is the type of person that the MCSE\nis really designed for and consultants.\n\n322\n00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,720\nRight, people that are roaming\nconsultants, need to have these\n\n323\n00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,210\nskills because you're dealing with so\nmany different environments.\n\n324\n00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,130\nHow do you make sure they are properly\nset up and ready to grow in scale.\n\n325\n00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,410\nYou don't want a solution for today,\nyou need a solution that lasts for\n\n326\n00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,610\ntomorrow and beyond.\n\n327\n00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,280\nThat sounds like marketing.\n\n328\n00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,160\nTomorrow and beyond.\n\n329\n00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,960\nAll right, so\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n330\n00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,690\nThe exam itself is a pretty\nfair exam I think.\n\n331\n00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,340\nMicrosoft of all the exam\nvendors out there.\n\n332\n00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,276\nMicrosoft has one of\nthe best grammar checkers.\n\n333\n00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:38,857\n>> Right.\n\n334\n00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:42,290\n>> I know I get so frustrated\nsometimes at the other vendors when,\n\n335\n00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,080\nyou read the question and\nyou're like, this makes no sense,\n\n336\n00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,290\nit doesn't matter if I know\nthe technology or not.\n\n337\n00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,220\nI just can't decipher what\nthis person is saying.\n\n338\n00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,100\nAnd Microsoft is really good about that.\n\n339\n00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,180\nYou will see though,\nbecause this is a design exam.\n\n340\n00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,325\nThat there will often times be\nmore than one right answer.\n\n341\n00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n342\n00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,670\n>> If they're asking you to select the\nappropriate design model for a solution,\n\n343\n00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,990\nit's not uncommon that all of the design\nmodels they recommend would work.\n\n344\n00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,260\n>> Right.\n>> That everyone of them would work.\n\n345\n00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,890\nBut one of them will best\nmatch the scenario, right?\n\n346\n00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,140\nThat client's needs or future expansion or\nleast administrative effort,\n\n347\n00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,830\nwhatever it is that they're asking for.\n\n348\n00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,410\nSo, be ready for that.\n\n349\n00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,080\nThese are a little bit more, I don't want\nto call them subjective, you know, but\n\n350\n00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,870\nthey do require a little bit of\nindependent thought to make sure you pick\n\n351\n00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,290\nthe best answer cell.\n\n352\n00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,030\nI know for me, on this exam, the old mark\nfor review button, I'd probably use that\n\n353\n00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,810\nmore than any other exam, just because\nthere's different ways to do things.\n\n354\n00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,000\nAll right, but all that being said,\nit's a pretty exciting certification.\n\n355\n00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,350\nIt's a nice change from the 413 which\nwas very design heavy, you know.\n\n356\n00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,500\nThis one we get into a lot of design,\nbut we're seeing some new stuff,\n\n357\n00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,150\nwe're seeing the system centered tools and\nthat's a lot of fun.\n\n358\n00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:02,650\nAll right, so Mike can you think of\nanything we have left off here for\n\n359\n00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,280\nour review?\n\n360\n00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,134\n>> No I think we covered it all,\nwe talked about the objectives and\n\n361\n00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:08,747\nthe track that we're on.\n\n362\n00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,572\n>> That's basically it.\n\n363\n00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:14,530\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nif that stuff sounds exciting to you, and\n\n364\n00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,100\nthat's what you want to learn,\nthey you are in the right place.\n\n365\n00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,810\nThis was just our little overview to\nintroduce you to the certification, but\n\n366\n00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,121\nstay tuned because we have episodes\ncovering the actual exam content\n\n367\n00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:24,704\ncoming up.\n\n368\n00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:31,290\nI hope to see you then.\n\n369\n00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,259\n[SOUND]\n\n",
