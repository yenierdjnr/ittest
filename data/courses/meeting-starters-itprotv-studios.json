Sure, Vicki.\nThank you.\n\n15\n00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.814\nWell, actually what I did is rather than\ntry to give you a theory that I created by\n\n16\n00:00:56.814 --> 00:01:01.689\nmyself, I did a survey several years ago\nto 10,000 high potential employees at top\n\n17\n00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.320\ncompanies around the world.\n\n18\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.916\nThese were the best of the best, the folks\nthat anyone would love to have in\n\n19\n00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:10.222\ntheir company and I asked them a very\nfocused question which was what\n\n20\n00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:13.433\nare the characteristics of a leader\nyou would willingly follow?\n\n21\n00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.783\nNot famous leaders or iconic leaders, but\n\n22\n00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:18.784\nwho is the kind of a person\nthat you wanna come to work for\n\n23\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.712\neveryday that you want as your leader and\nthey told me seven key things.\n\n24\n00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:27.072\nThey all happen to begin with C and\nI'll got ahead and give you the first one,\n\n25\n00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:28.860\ncuz it's the most important.\n\n26\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.312\nThe other ones you can sort of mix up,\nbut the first one is character and\n\n27\n00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:36.500\nanother word here would be integrity or\nhonesty.\n\n28\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.866\nGreat research study by Kouzes and\nPosner, I know you've studied them, too.\n\n29\n00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.550\nThey did a 30 year research study,\n4 continents, 3 million respondents and\n\n30\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.642\nask the same question.\n\n31\n00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:49.161\nThat's where I got the question is what\nare the characteristics of a leader you\n\n32\n00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.342\nwould willingly follow?\n\n33\n00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.992\nFour major answers and\nthe first one was honesty.\n\n34\n00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:57.740\n89% of the people worldwide,\nthat's 3 decades, 4 continents,\n\n35\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.737\n3 million respondents all\nsaid that telling the truth,\n\n36\n00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:04.620\nbeing honest is the single most important\nthing they look for in a leader.\n\n37\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.676\nThe next one was forward-looking.\n\n38\n00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:10.412\nAnother word for that would be\nvisionary and a key idea here is,\n\n39\n00:02:10.412 --> 00:02:14.801\nit's not just the CEO or the senior\nmanagement team that sets the vision.\n\n40\n00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.546\nIf one person follows you, just one,\nyou set the vision for the two of you.\n\n41\n00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:22.889\nSo, every leader at every level has\nto be forward-looking or visionary.\n\n42\n00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.298\nThe next one was competent.\n\n43\n00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:28.340\nYou gotta be extremely good at what you\ndo and there's two areas of competence.\n\n44\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.909\nYou gotta be good at your job, highly\ncompetent that I like to use the word,\n\n45\n00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.322\ntowering confidence and you have to\nbe good at your leadership skills.\n\n46\n00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.761\nAnd then the last of the major four was\ninspiring and that doesn't mean that\n\n47\n00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.775\nyou've got to go rah, rah,\nsis boom, bah and be a cheerleader.\n\n48\n00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:43.831\nWhat it means is that\nif you're not inspired,\n\n49\n00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.845\ndon't expect anyone else\non your team to be.\n\n50\n00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.280\nYou've got to be passionate,\ncommitted, excited,\n\n51\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.529\ninspired in order to be inspiring.\n\n52\n00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:56.310\nSo, those four all fit up under\nthat first C of character.\n\n53\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and character is so important and\n\n54\n00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.787\nwhat you said about being willing to\nfollow a leader, I think that is key.\n\n55\n00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:06.734\nOther things to consider in leadership\nthat keep it simple for us?\n\n56\n00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nwe'll go through the other C's.\n\n57\n00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.460\nSo, the character's first and\nit's first among all of them.\n\n58\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.260\nThe next one that I like is courage and\nwhat they told me here is I\n\n59\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.800\nexpect my leader to be courageous, to take\nbig, bold risks, to take tough decisions,\n\n60\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.400\nbut what I really want is a leader who\nis courageous enough to be vulnerable.\n\n61\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.140\nTo admit, they don't have all\nthe answers to ask for help.\n\n62\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.447\nUnbelievably important thing in being an\neffective leader is having the courage and\n\n63\n00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.095\nvulnerability to ask for help.\n\n64\n00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:39.956\nNow this doesn't mean you should be\nsitting in the corner like, yeah,\n\n65\n00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:40.963\nI don't know what to do.\n\n66\n00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:45.934\n90% of the time you're courageous,\nyou're bold, you're a risk taker, but 10%\n\n67\n00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:50.508\nof the time when you feel overwhelmed you\nadmit it, when you don't have the answer\n\n68\n00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:55.045\nyou admit it and you show people that\nyou're courageous enough to be authentic.\n\n69\n00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:59.879\n&gt;&gt; Courage, I've seen courage in action\nand I've seen the opposite of courage in\n\n70\n00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.441\naction and I can clearly see how that is\na huge trait to being a great leader.\n\n71\n00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.142\nWhat's the next C that we can think about?\n\n72\n00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.966\n&gt;&gt; This C is one that we mentioned\nearlier from Kouzes and Posner, but\n\n73\n00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:15.628\nit's one that's essential in building\ntrust and respect which is confidence.\n\n74\n00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:19.837\nAnd the idea here is that you've got to be\nreally, really, really good at your job\n\n75\n00:04:19.837 --> 00:04:23.758\nand really good at your leadership\nskills and here's what I share with you.\n\n76\n00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:25.559\nThere's no excuses not to be.\n\n77\n00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.639\nIf you're going to be a leader, you've got\nto set the example of a being life long\n\n78\n00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.539\nlearner and never in the history of\nhumankind has there been more information\n\n79\n00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.352\navailable for free than right now.\n\n80\n00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:40.566\nSo there's no excuses, you should be\nwatching TED Talks and Big Think and\n\n81\n00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:45.108\nYouTube videos and listening to\niTunes Podcasts and reading and\n\n82\n00:04:45.108 --> 00:04:50.089\nreading different magazine and\nall those ways to invest in yourself.\n\n83\n00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.876\nBecause the more information you have\naccess to, the more you can help other\n\n84\n00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.500\npeople, the more respected you will\nbe as a leader for your competence.\n\n85\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.922\nAnd if you wanna have a great team and\na great company, having people that\n\n86\n00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.738\nare highly competent, focused and always\ngetting better every day, what I call\n\n87\n00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.014\npersonal [INAUDIBLE] is fundamental\nto building your great company.\n\n88\n00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:12.477\nAnd if the leader isn't highly competent\nin setting that example no one else will\n\n89\n00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:13.142\nfollow it.\n\n90\n00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:17.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and going back to being a leader\nthat you wanna follow, I can completely\n\n91\n00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:22.590\nunderstand how competence is one of\nthose things that if you don't have it.\n\n92\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.260\nI mean, people are definitely not\ngoing to respect you as a leader and\n\n93\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.030\nthat's probably a huge component as well.\n\n94\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.020\nWhat's another one,\nJohn that we can think of?\n\n95\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.324\n&gt;&gt; The next C is communication.\n\n96\n00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.671\nAnd again,\nwhen you hear all these, remember,\n\n97\n00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:36.628\nthis isn't a theory that I came up with.\n\n98\n00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:40.694\nAlthough I've been studying leadership,\nread hundreds of books on it,\n\n99\n00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:42.274\nlead a couple of companies.\n\n100\n00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:46.320\nThis is what those 10,000 high\npotential employees told me and\n\n101\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.390\nwhat they said around\ncommunication was of course,\n\n102\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.155\nI expect my leader to be able to\nstand up and explain the vision and\n\n103\n00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:56.321\ngive a motivating talk and\ngive clear expectations.\n\n104\n00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.346\nBut what I really,\n\n105\n00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:02.340\nreally want from my leader is someone who\nasks great questions and listens intently.\n\n106\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.080\nSomeone's who curious.\n\n107\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.179\nI've hired good people,\nthey're on my team, I'm leading this team.\n\n108\n00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.311\nWhy in the world wouldn't I be\nexcited about asking them questions,\n\n109\n00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.443\ntrying to get their opinion,\nthey're feedback, they're input.\n\n110\n00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:17.306\nSo you want a leader that's very curious,\nconstantly asking questions.\n\n111\n00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:20.537\nAnd then when someone gives them\nthe answer, they're an intense listener.\n\n112\n00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.965\nThey're using great body language.\n\n113\n00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.593\nThey're focused.\n\n114\n00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.768\nThey're taking notes.\n\n115\n00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:24.494\nThey're listening.\n\n116\n00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:25.613\nThey're trying to understand.\n\n117\n00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:29.188\nThey're asking more questions and\nthe other key thing is once they've asked\n\n118\n00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:32.928\nthe question, and listened, and written\nnotes that they actually apply some of\n\n119\n00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:35.640\nthe things that they've been\ntold by their team members.\n\n120\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.073\nSo lots of open, honest,\nrobust, high trust, high candor,\n\n121\n00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.175\ncommunication is critical.\n\n122\n00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:43.283\nAsking great questions and\n\n123\n00:06:43.283 --> 00:06:45.793\nlistening is what they told me\nthey wanted from their leader.\n\n124\n00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see how these are kind\nof building upon each other.\n\n125\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.600\nBecause if a leader doesn't have character\nand their communicating with you, maybe in\n\n126\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.320\na way that they think is effective,\nyou're gonna see right through that.\n\n127\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.860\nSo I can see how these are just\nbuilding one on top of the other, but\n\n128\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.560\nI think there's more, John.\n\n129\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.311\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the next one is collaboration.\n\n130\n00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:09.364\nAnd again, here's what the folks told\nme is I understand you're my leader.\n\n131\n00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:11.595\nI know you're my boss, I got that.\n\n132\n00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:15.413\nYou've got more seniority, rank and\ntitle, but don't lord that over me.\n\n133\n00:07:15.413 --> 00:07:19.650\nIf every now and then you gotta say, do\nthis, because I'm you're boss, I'm fine.\n\n134\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.158\nBut the rest of the time, I wanna see you\nas a team player as a partner and a peer.\n\n135\n00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:27.269\nI wanna see my leader\nroll up their sleeves.\n\n136\n00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.229\nGet in there shoulder to shoulder with us.\n\n137\n00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:30.399\nWork as part of the team.\n\n138\n00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.520\nDo the work and communicate, and\nwork with us as a peer as a partner.\n\n139\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.228\nAnd then if you say,\ndo it, because I told you.\n\n140\n00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:39.459\nDo it, because I'm your manager.\n\n141\n00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.996\nDo it, because I own the company.\n\n142\n00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:42.363\nI'll handle that.\n\n143\n00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:45.120\nThe reverse is if you constantly\nlead from that command and\n\n144\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.059\ncontrol thing that ain't gonna work and\nyour best people will leave immediately,\n\n145\n00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.343\nbecause they get frustrated and\nthey don't want to be lead that way.\n\n146\n00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:54.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talk about teamwork so often.\n\n147\n00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:59.669\nAnd oftentimes, we miss the whole\nleadership part of teamwork.\n\n148\n00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:04.641\nAnd from what you're saying, collaboration\nas a leader really can play into whether\n\n149\n00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.447\nor not the team is successful.\n\n150\n00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:10.638\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and then part of it too is\nthat we've got a different make up of\n\n151\n00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:12.921\nthe people in the workforce right now.\n\n152\n00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:14.361\nAs the millennials come in and\n\n153\n00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.931\nthey're gonna be the largest section\nof workers over the next ten years,\n\n154\n00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.170\nthe baby boomers and gen X are moving out,\nretiring, going to other places.\n\n155\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.790\nYou're gonna look for a leader that is\nif they're not a team member, if they\n\n156\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.880\ndon't work well with folks, if they don't\ntreat other people with respect and\n\n157\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.650\nrespect their information, their ideas,\n\n158\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.290\ntheir experience, their suggestions,\nyou can't actually build a cohesive team.\n\n159\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:42.376\nAnother big idea with the millennials\nis the next C, which is compassion.\n\n160\n00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:43.571\nI'm 52 years old.\n\n161\n00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.392\nWhen I grew up, when my boss said, jump.\n\n162\n00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.100\nI said, how high, sir?\n\n163\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.086\nIt was all command and control, all men.\n\n164\n00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:53.414\nNow it's changed and employees today,\nwant more flexibility.\n\n165\n00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:56.806\nThey want more of say in their outcome,\nthey want you to be compassionate and\n\n166\n00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:57.659\nunderstand that.\n\n167\n00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:00.422\nYes, this is my job, but I have other\nthings that are just as important to me.\n\n168\n00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:03.012\nMy family, my hobbies, my faith.\n\n169\n00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:05.386\nI play on a sports team,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n170\n00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:08.220\nI'll give you my 40,\nmaybe my 50 hours a week.\n\n171\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.843\nBut after that, I'm out of here and I'm\ngoing home to spend time with my friends,\n\n172\n00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.996\nmy family to go surfing,\nwhatever it might be and\n\n173\n00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:16.322\nit's not that they don't\nhave a strong work ethic.\n\n174\n00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:20.087\nIt's they have a different\nvalue system that says,\n\n175\n00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:22.833\nI need to be felt like I'm important.\n\n176\n00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:24.137\nI do important work.\n\n177\n00:09:24.137 --> 00:09:25.619\nI'm making a difference in the world.\n\n178\n00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.879\nI'm contributing to the company,\ntitle isn't that important.\n\n179\n00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.250\nThey want fair pay, but\nit isn't all about money.\n\n180\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.380\nSo, they need a leader who's\ncompassionate enough to understand\n\n181\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.260\nthat this job isn't their whole life.\n\n182\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.697\nThat their really focused on\nother parts of their life and\n\n183\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:42.981\nthey want to feel good while\nthey're in the company,\n\n184\n00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:45.907\nthat the leader truly cares about them and\nhas compassion for them.\n\n185\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:49.609\n&gt;&gt; And it makes a huge difference is you\nwork for somebody who cares about you.\n\n186\n00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:53.857\nIt definitely makes a big difference\nin the leadership style of that leader.\n\n187\n00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:56.503\nIs there a final C that you\nwanna share with us today, John?\n\n188\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:00.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Vicky, I'll touch on\nwhat you just said is, it's very,\n\n189\n00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.752\nvery hard to be inspired, passionate,\ncommitted and excited for\n\n190\n00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:06.571\na leader that isn't and\ndoesn't treat you fairly.\n\n191\n00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:12.087\nInteresting piece of research shows that\nthe number one factor in highly engaged,\n\n192\n00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:17.234\nsatisfied and loyal customers is engaged,\nsatisfied and loyal employees.\n\n193\n00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:20.860\nAnother phrase I love to use here is the\ncustomer's experience will never exceed\n\n194\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.257\nthe employee's experience.\n\n195\n00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:24.579\nSo if the employee doesn't\nhave a leader they admire,\n\n196\n00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.098\nthere isn't good communication.\n\n197\n00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:29.919\nThey're not treated with compassion,\nyou're not gonna see them do that for\n\n198\n00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:33.289\nyour customers which typically\nruns to a thing called bankruptcy.\n\n199\n00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:37.850\nNow if you've done the other six things\nas well and you've become a good leader,\n\n200\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.268\nyou've got a good team.\n\n201\n00:10:39.268 --> 00:10:41.830\nYou're building a successful\ncompany you're growing.\n\n202\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.221\nThe seventh C is contribution and\nthis is where the leader says,\n\n203\n00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:51.038\nI'm gonna leave a legacy that I'm\ngonna make long-term decisions.\n\n204\n00:10:51.038 --> 00:10:55.574\nIn America, at least,\nwe run on a very tight schedule of meeting\n\n205\n00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:59.109\nquarterly goals or\nmeeting Wall Street demands.\n\n206\n00:10:59.109 --> 00:11:03.821\nAnd oftentimes, our leaders, unfortunately\nmake very short-term decisions, but\n\n207\n00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.369\nthe best leaders and I see leaders\nin other countries like Japan,\n\n208\n00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:12.624\nwhere they make 10, 15, 20-year horizons\nto allow them to make 20-year decisions.\n\n209\n00:11:12.624 --> 00:11:13.972\nSo as contribution goes,\n\n210\n00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:18.720\nit's what I call planting the seeds of\ntrees under which you may never sit.\n\n211\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.836\nGiving back to your community.\n\n212\n00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:21.384\nBuilding a legacy of leadership.\n\n213\n00:11:21.384 --> 00:11:25.363\nCreating other leaders and taking\nthe resources, and the authority, and\n\n214\n00:11:25.363 --> 00:11:29.470\nthe respect that you've earned by doing\nthe first six exceedingly well, and\n\n215\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.250\nbecoming a great leader.\n\n216\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.996\nAnd then giving back as a servant leader\nand leaving the organization better than\n\n217\n00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.853\nyou found it and better not just for\na few years, but for decades.\n\n218\n00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:44.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so John these seven Cs that you\njust mentioned are very thorough, but\n\n219\n00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:47.644\nkeep things simple when we\nwanna talk about leadership.\n\n220\n00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:50.282\nAre there any final thoughts\nthat you had on leadership\n\n221\n00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:52.064\nbefore we wrap up today's session?\n\n222\n00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:55.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the most important\nthing to remember here is to be a great\n\n223\n00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:58.421\nleader of others, you must first\nbe a great leader of yourself.\n\n224\n00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.193\nSo my recommendation is to think about\nthe seven that I've shared with you and\n\n225\n00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:05.908\nthen look at other things that you've had,\nother influences you've had,\n\n226\n00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:07.434\nleaders you've worked with.\n\n227\n00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:08.780\nGood leaders, bad leaders.\n\n228\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.383\nWhat you've learned from them,\nyour own personal value system and\n\n229\n00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:16.301\nwork on creating what I call your own\npersonal philosophy of leadership or\n\n230\n00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:20.283\nyour own personal leadership competency\nmodel where you've got a written\n\n231\n00:12:20.283 --> 00:12:24.322\nlist of the key things that you wanna do\nto be the kind of leader you wanna be and\n\n232\n00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:28.019\nleave the kind of leadership legacy\nyou've always wanted to leave.\n\n233\n00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:31.811\nAnd when you've got that, you can use it\nas a touchstone for every day when you go\n\n234\n00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.321\nin the office, every day you go to work,\nto how you wanna act and behave and\n\n235\n00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.964\nimpact the other people in your\norganization as a highly effective leader.\n\n236\n00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.899\n&gt;&gt; So John, thank you for\nthat recap of the seven Cs of leadership.\n\n237\n00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:47.449\nAs always, you kept things simple on\na topic that can often be way too complex.\n\n238\n00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:50.336\nSo for BizPro.TV, I'm Vicky Hall.\n\n239\n00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:51.946\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n240\n00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:54.607\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nspending your time with us.\n\n241\n00:12:54.607 --> 00:13:03.483\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.038\nThis is a topic I've been studying for\nyears.\n\n13\n00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.292\nI'm actually in the middle of\nwriting a new book all around\n\n14\n00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.350\nhigh-performance teams.\n\n15\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.760\nAnd I've created a model, working with\nhundreds of teams around the world\n\n16\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.630\nat top companies, all the way up to\na group of the United States Navy Seals.\n\n17\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.130\nAnd what I've looked for is the pattern.\n\n18\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.228\nWhat is the pattern of what\ntruly great teams have?\n\n19\n00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:59.320\nAnd I'm gonna describe it using\na couple of letters, and it's dmc CMD.\n\n20\n00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.210\nThat's the model.\n\n21\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.776\nSo let's start with the first d.\n\n22\n00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:03.802\nThe first d is direction, but\n\n23\n00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:08.310\nthe key idea behind direction\nis it's a shared direction.\n\n24\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.080\nSomeone else might tell the team\nwhat they need to accomplish.\n\n25\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.320\nThey might give them an end goal and\nsay we're at a now and\n\n26\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.240\nI wanna be at z by the end of the year.\n\n27\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.920\nBut then, a high performance team has the\nability to put their thumb print on it,\n\n28\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.610\nto take some ownership.\n\n29\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550\nThe phrase I always use\nwhen describing this is,\n\n30\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.770\nif you don't have a say in the outcome,\nyou won't have a stake in the outcome.\n\n31\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.280\nSo step one, in a high performance\nteam is getting the team together,\n\n32\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.410\ndiscussing this, and\n\n33\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.708\nfinding a way to customize the way they're\ngonna approach achieving their outcome.\n\n34\n00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:39.318\nAnd give them a clear shared direction\nthat they're all committed to and\n\n35\n00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:40.212\naligned around.\n\n36\n00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:42.034\n&gt;&gt; I can understand how that would be so\n\n37\n00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:45.437\nimportant because if the team was\nnot going in the same direction,\n\n38\n00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:48.313\nthen obviously it wouldn't\nbe a high performing team.\n\n39\n00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:50.000\nSo that one's pretty clear.\n\n40\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.200\nWhat's another tip that we\ncan take away in creating and\n\n41\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.540\nworking in a high performance team.\n\n42\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.763\n&gt;&gt; The next level is,\nthis whole model's built on the two M's.\n\n43\n00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:04.938\nAnd the first M is measurement and\nin order to stay aligned and be moving in\n\n44\n00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:10.050\nthe same direction, you have to have\nclear metrics of what success looks like.\n\n45\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.570\nAnd the word I use here to describe it,\nwhich is very important is, binary.\n\n46\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.000\nThe measurements must be one, zero,\nblack, white, yes, no, no guessing.\n\n47\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.990\nOne of my very favorite business phrases\nis, ambiguity breeds mediocrity.\n\n48\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.470\nSo, a high performance team\ntakes the time to sit down and\n\n49\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.620\nclearly write out their goals,\nthe metrics, how things will be measured.\n\n50\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.530\nIn an unambiguous way, so\nthere's no guessing whatsoever.\n\n51\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.940\n&gt;&gt; I can see how often times in teams\nwe don't measure our results and\n\n52\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.280\nthe way you've defined it is\nthat binary process makes it so\n\n53\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640\nclear and so easy for us to understand.\n\n54\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.230\nWhat's another way to look\nat a high performance team?\n\n55\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.520\n&gt;&gt; And you're gonna see in a minute Vicky,\nwhy that idea of binary is so critical.\n\n56\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.790\nBut before we get there, the two C's and\nI'll put these two together.\n\n57\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.111\nThe first C is competence.\n\n58\n00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.540\nYou wanna get the best people you\ncan possibly get on your team.\n\n59\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.510\nIt just makes sense.\n\n60\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.665\nIf you wanna have a great\nhigh performance team,\n\n61\n00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:10.041\nyou have to have great high\nperforming individuals.\n\n62\n00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:14.390\nAnd another reason that is, is A players\nonly wanna play with other A players.\n\n63\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.110\nIf I'm going to be on a team,\na high performance team,\n\n64\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.240\nI expect that everyone else on\nthe team with me is highly competent.\n\n65\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.820\nThe next C is communications.\n\n66\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.410\nAnd the keywords around\ncommunications are open, honest,\n\n67\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.750\nrobust, and the keyword is transparent,\nand here's why.\n\n68\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.940\nPeople without access to information\ndo not have to take accountability\n\n69\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.070\nfor their actions.\n\n70\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.300\nIf you go to someone on the team and you\nsay, how you doing on the Spence project\n\n71\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.910\nand they go,\nI got no idea what you're talking about.\n\n72\n00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.050\nNo one told me about Spence.\n\n73\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.590\nI didn't know we work with them.\n\n74\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.560\nIf that's true you cannot\nhold them accountable.\n\n75\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.520\nHowever, if you say, no no no no no, I\nsent you an email, we talked about this in\n\n76\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.710\nthe weekly meeting, I left you\na voicemail, I carved it in your\n\n77\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.150\ndesk with a knife, I sent a pigeon to\nyour house with a note on its leg.\n\n78\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.722\nYou have all the information that I have,\nthen you can hold that person accountable.\n\n79\n00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:04.716\nIt used to be that people thought\ninformation was power, and\n\n80\n00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:08.825\nthat's not true, sharing information\nwith others, allows you to empower them,\n\n81\n00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:10.720\nwhich increases your power.\n\n82\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.980\nSo, in a high performance team,\n\n83\n00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.290\nyou want the very best players you\ncan get that are highly competent.\n\n84\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.860\nThen you want lots and\nlots of frank, courageous, open, and\n\n85\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.230\ntransparent communication.\n\n86\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.490\n&gt;&gt; So critical.\n\n87\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.916\nAnd you know some of the things that\nyou just touched on actually remind\n\n88\n00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.489\nof a recent conversation\nwe had around leadership.\n\n89\n00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:33.426\nSo it sounds like these characteristics\nof a high performing teams are oftentimes\n\n90\n00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:36.900\nbuilt upon the same kinds of\nprinciples as leadership.\n\n91\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.810\nSo certainly there may be\na little overlap there.\n\n92\n00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's a lot of similarities\n\n93\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.410\nin what it takes to be an effective\nleader of any team or any organization.\n\n94\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.980\nAnd communications is\ndefinitely one of those.\n\n95\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.650\nAnother big one, which is the next one in\nthe model, and this says we have d for\n\n96\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.320\ndirection shared.\n\n97\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.480\nM for measurements binary,\nhighly competent people with open, honest,\n\n98\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.070\ntransparent communication.\n\n99\n00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.030\nAnd now here's where\nthe whole model changes.\n\n100\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.820\nThis is really where\nthe power of the model.\n\n101\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.500\nThe next M is mutual accountability.\n\n102\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.470\nAnd this is where everybody on the team\ntakes both personal accountability for\n\n103\n00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.690\ndelivering what they say they'll deliver,\nfor getting their stuff in on time,\n\n104\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.680\nworld class work every time,\nyou can trust me.\n\n105\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.190\nI am reliable, I am dependable.\n\n106\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.357\nI have full accountability for\ndoing a great job at my job.\n\n107\n00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:26.462\nAnd they also have mutual\naccountability in the team,\n\n108\n00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.768\nwhich is where everybody holds\neach other accountable for\n\n109\n00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:33.340\ndelivering great work that\nexactly meets the measurements.\n\n110\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.050\nWhich is why the measurements are so\nimportant.\n\n111\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.313\nIf you don't have clear binary, specific\nmeasurements, here's what it sounds like.\n\n112\n00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:42.807\nHey, Dave I don't think\nyou're doing a good job.\n\n113\n00:05:42.807 --> 00:05:46.570\nOr Sue doesn't seem to me like\nyou achieved that on time.\n\n114\n00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.000\nWhen the measurements are binary, there's\nno think, feel, see, there's no opinion.\n\n115\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.500\nYou either did it or you didn't.\n\n116\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.290\nYou got it done on time or you didn't.\n\n117\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.530\nThe work was correct or not.\n\n118\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.980\nYou met your numbers or not.\n\n119\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.770\nNo guessing, no ambiguity.\n\n120\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.830\nWhat this does is it removed personality,\npolitics, emotion from the situation.\n\n121\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.871\nIf I'm gonna hold somebody else on my team\naccountable I don't want it to seem like\n\n122\n00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:09.350\nit's me versus you.\n\n123\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.290\nIt's me and you together versus\nthe measurement that we agreed on.\n\n124\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.030\nThat way I can be, what I call,\nrigorous without being ruthless.\n\n125\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.600\nI can push my team members to be really\ngood, but I'm never attacking them.\n\n126\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.678\nWhich leads to the third\nlevel of accountability.\n\n127\n00:06:22.678 --> 00:06:25.079\nAnd I haven't figure out a good name for\nthis but I call it,\n\n128\n00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.800\nreciprocal accountability.\n\n129\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.840\nWhich is where if you're a great team\nplayer you not only hold other people\n\n130\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.370\naccountable, but you expect and even\nencourage them to hold you accountable.\n\n131\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.730\nSo if you slip and you're not performing\nand someone else on the team calls you on\n\n132\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.490\nit, you don't get mad, you don't\nget defensive, you don't get angry.\n\n133\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.060\nYou say thank you.\n\n134\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.930\nI appreciate that.\n\n135\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.440\nYou're exactly right, the binary goal,\nI'm not meeting it, I apologize,\n\n136\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.800\nI'll get on it right away.\n\n137\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.382\nAnd that's really what differentiates\na high performance team from other teams,\n\n138\n00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:56.287\nis that level of accountability.\n\n139\n00:06:56.287 --> 00:07:01.180\n&gt;&gt; You know, as you were going through the\nmutual accountability part of this model.\n\n140\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.885\nOne of the things I can\nthink of that we hear so\n\n141\n00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:06.533\noften times is people say it's not my job.\n\n142\n00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:10.514\nAnd when we hear that it sounds\nlike maybe that would be\n\n143\n00:07:10.514 --> 00:07:15.590\na trigger to identify a less\nperforming team, is that correct?\n\n144\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n145\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.870\nWell this is again and\nyou hit it perfectly Vicki.\n\n146\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.405\nWhen you take the time to communicate,\nin our model, very clear\n\n147\n00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:26.673\nspecific measurable goals and the person\naccepts accountability for that.\n\n148\n00:07:26.673 --> 00:07:30.243\nAnd they do not deliver, then it's clear\nto the rest of the team that they've been\n\n149\n00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:34.041\ngiven the resources, the authority, the\ntime, the budget, everything they need.\n\n150\n00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.437\nTheir goals are clear,\nthere is no guessing, no ambiguity, and\n\n151\n00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:39.416\nthey've accepted responsibility,\n\n152\n00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:43.329\nthen it's easy to deal with that\ndecisively because there is no guessing.\n\n153\n00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.792\nWhich brings me to the last D,\nthe final D in the model which is perfect\n\n154\n00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.510\nid the discipline to\nactually do this every day.\n\n155\n00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.870\nTo build this level of accountability,\nhonesty, candor,\n\n156\n00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.590\nsheer direction into something\nthat drives the team every day.\n\n157\n00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.656\nIt's on every agenda,\nyou discuss it in every meeting, and\n\n158\n00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:03.219\nyou constantly make sure that you're\ngoing back to those first five.\n\n159\n00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:07.436\nAnd ensuring that the team has the clear\ndirection, specific binary measurement\n\n160\n00:08:07.436 --> 00:08:11.990\ngoals, top people, great communication,\nand high levels of accountability.\n\n161\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.000\nAnd you never let it slip.\n\n162\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.500\nWhat happens in a work group or\na regular team is every now and\n\n163\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.620\nthen when there's an emergency,\nthey pull together.\n\n164\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.791\nAnd they can be an amazing team.\n\n165\n00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.420\nThey're fire fighting, they're in\nthere together doing all that stuff.\n\n166\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.458\nAnd then, as soon as it's over,\nthey slip back into being a workgroup and\n\n167\n00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:26.660\nnot performing.\n\n168\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.150\nWith a high performance team, 90% of the\ntime they're performing exceedingly well.\n\n169\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.545\nAnd that 10%, when they slip, they pull\neach other back, they hold each other\n\n170\n00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:38.000\naccountable, and they rise back up\nto being a high performance team.\n\n171\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.877\n&gt;&gt; Well John, sign me up because that\nsounds like a team that I would wanna work\n\n172\n00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:42.878\non and in for sure.\n\n173\n00:08:42.878 --> 00:08:46.958\nIs there any other tips or tricks or\nany information that you wanna share about\n\n174\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.350\nhigh performing teams to\nkinda wrap us up for today?\n\n175\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.854\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n176\n00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:52.592\n[LAUGH] This is not easy.\n\n177\n00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:57.520\nOnly about 10% of teams ever achieve\nthe high performance teams level.\n\n178\n00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.289\nPart of it is you need to\nlook at it too and say,\n\n179\n00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.680\ndo we truly need to build that\nkind of a team for this project?\n\n180\n00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.710\nBecause sometimes you don't need a team,\nsometimes a work group is just fine.\n\n181\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.748\nSometimes a regular\ninter-departmental team or\n\n182\n00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:09.640\ncross-functional team would be great.\n\n183\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.384\nBut if it's something mission\ncritical that's gotta get done and\n\n184\n00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:13.757\nit's gotta get done perfectly.\n\n185\n00:09:13.757 --> 00:09:17.989\nYou need a high performance team and you\nneed to understand it takes a lot of work,\n\n186\n00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:20.180\na lot of discipline, great people.\n\n187\n00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.623\nIt is not easy and\nonly a few teams get to that level.\n\n188\n00:09:23.623 --> 00:09:27.848\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like it's deliberate to be\non a high performance team for sure.\n\n189\n00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:29.658\nSo that's all for today.\n\n190\n00:09:29.658 --> 00:09:32.610\nThis is BizPro.TV, thank you.\n\n191\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.585\nI'm Vicki Hall.\n\n192\n00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:35.427\n&gt;&gt;

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.750\nHi and welcome to BIZPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.140\nI'm your host Vickie Hall and\n\n3\n00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.250\nour segment today is going to\nbe about business excellence.\n\n4\n00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.030\nAnd we all know that there was a really\n\n5\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.540\nclear line between businesses that\nexcel and businesses that don't.\n\n6\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.720\nAnd to talk about that today I want\nto introduce John Spence, John.\n\n7\n00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.632\n&gt;&gt; Good to be here with you.\n\n8\n00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:27.371\n&gt;&gt; Welcome.\n&gt;&gt; Well Vicki,\n\n9\n00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:31.230\nwhat I like to do is share with you what I\ncall my formula for business excellence.\n\n10\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.720\nThis took me about 20\nyears to put together.\n\n11\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.770\nHundreds of books, lots of research.\n\n12\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.950\nWorking with companies all over the world.\n\n13\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.600\nLooking for the pattern of what\ntruly excellent companies do.\n\n14\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.450\nWhat they focus on to build and\nsustain a highly successful company.\n\n15\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.190\nAnd there's four elements to it.\n\n16\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.390\nAnd I will give you the first\nletters first for the formula and\n\n17\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.478\nthen I will go in each one in more depth.\n\n18\n00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:59.840\nIt's T plus C plus ECF multiplied by DE.\n\n19\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.290\nSo lets start with T.\n\n20\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.481\nT stands for talent and for most companies\ntoday the success of the company is\n\n21\n00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:09.343\ndirectly tied to the quality of\nthe people that you can get, grow, and\n\n22\n00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:13.870\nkeep on your team and the relationships\nthey create with your customers.\n\n23\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.115\nWhich means that talent attraction,\ntalent growth, and\n\n24\n00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:22.615\ntalent retention should be a major\nstrategic objective in your organization.\n\n25\n00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.875\nAnd years ago I did a, or\ncouple years ago I did a research study\n\n26\n00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:29.665\nof 10,000 high potential employees,\ntop companies around the world and\n\n27\n00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:33.740\nI asked them what do you look for\nin an organization you wanna work in.\n\n28\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.610\nAnd these are folks that I\ncall voluntary employees.\n\n29\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.350\nThey're so good at what they do\nthat they could work anywhere.\n\n30\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.370\nThey got lots of options.\n\n31\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.320\nSo I ask them,\nwhy do you work where you work.\n\n32\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.900\nAnd they give me six key factors.\n\n33\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.200\nSo these are six things it\ntakes to attract top talent.\n\n34\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.499\nNumber one is fair pay.\n\n35\n00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.656\nAnd fair pay was defined\nby them as 10% above or\n\n36\n00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:56.275\nbelow what i would make to do\nthe same job any place else.\n\n37\n00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.448\nAs long as you get parity on pay and\nI can look around the industry and\n\n38\n00:01:59.448 --> 00:02:04.040\nroughly make when everybody else pay the\npay comes off the table as a motivator.\n\n39\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.580\nThe next 5 the first one was\nmeaningful challenging work.\n\n40\n00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.300\nI wanna come to work every day and\ndo things that challenge me to grow,\n\n41\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.960\nto get better,\nto be innovative, creative, and\n\n42\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.720\nthat I'm really making a difference\nwith the stuff that I'm doing.\n\n43\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020\nSo meaningful, challenging work.\n\n44\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.070\nThe next one was cool colleagues.\n\n45\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.388\nPretty straight-forward.\n\n46\n00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:25.360\nA-players only wanna be on\na team with other A-players.\n\n47\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.470\nThe best wanna work with the best.\n\n48\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.940\nThe next one was winning culture.\n\n49\n00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.580\nWhich we're gonna go into in just a second\nin more detail and then the next one, and\n\n50\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.750\nthe last two are really interesting to me.\n\n51\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.390\nThe next one is personal and\nprofessional growth.\n\n52\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.110\nAnd personal growth says, I want to\nwork some place where my company is\n\n53\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.550\ninvesting in me, where I'm getting\ntraining and coaching, support, mentoring.\n\n54\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.480\nThat I can look back at\nthe end of the month and\n\n55\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.450\nI'm smarter than I was at the beginning.\n\n56\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.680\nAnd I'm constantly growing and improving.\n\n57\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.750\nThat's personal growth, the other side of\nthat same one was professional growth.\n\n58\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.070\nAnd what they say there was, I need to be\nable to look up five to seven years from\n\n59\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.680\nnow and see that there's a place for\nme in this company.\n\n60\n00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.660\nThat I've got a career path and\n\n61\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.600\nI can keep growing and\nthere's other places for me to go.\n\n62\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.660\nIf you hire top talent and\nthey don't feel like they are growing and\n\n63\n00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.130\ngetting better every day and\nthey can't see a place for\n\n64\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.190\nthemselves in the organization five years\nout you will lose them very quickly.\n\n65\n00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880\nThe only thing that will make you\nlose them faster is the last one.\n\n66\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.200\nWhich is actually the first one, but\nI leave it for last, which is I work for\n\n67\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.705\na leader I respect and admire.\n\n68\n00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:30.840\n88% of people that quit their job don't\nquit the job, don't quit the hours,\n\n69\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.690\ndon't quit the pay,\ndon't quit the work load.\n\n70\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.567\nThey quit their idiot boss.\n\n71\n00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:38.945\nSo when you look at what it takes to\nattract and retain the very best people,\n\n72\n00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:44.162\nit's fair pay, challenging, meaningful\nwork, cool colleagues, winning culture,\n\n73\n00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:48.845\npersonal and professional growth, and\nwork for a leader I respect and admire.\n\n74\n00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:52.749\n&gt;&gt; So John, I've never really thought\nabout talent acquisition in that way and\n\n75\n00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.669\nyou make it so easy to think about, but\n\n76\n00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.990\nit's probably really hard\nto do I would imagine.\n\n77\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.260\nAnd it also probably has a huge impact on\njust the environment that you work in.\n\n78\n00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.620\nI know one of the things that you\nmentioned is working with cool colleagues\n\n79\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.250\nand I, myself,\nwould definitely value that.\n\n80\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.440\nSo in thinking about recruitment and\ntalent and bringing people\n\n81\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.580\nin to the organization How do you\nthink it has an impact on excellence?\n\n82\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question Vicky and\n\n83\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.990\nmy belief is that you've got to be\nvery careful about who you hire and\n\n84\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.910\nmake sure that you're bringing\nin the very best people.\n\n85\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.790\nAnd there's a couple of ideas around that.\n\n86\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.530\nFamous one I hear from CEOs all over the\nworld is hire for attitude, aptitude and\n\n87\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.830\nvalues.\n\n88\n00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.830\nTrain for skills.\n\n89\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.630\nIf I've got someone that's got a positive,\nenthusiastic great passionate attitude.\n\n90\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.750\nThey've got the aptitude to learn and\nthey match the values of the organization,\n\n91\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.050\nI can train them to do\njust about anything.\n\n92\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.120\nThe other famous one is hire slow and\nfire fast.\n\n93\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.420\nA woman from Germany said higher mean,\nand fire nice.\n\n94\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.320\nMake it challenging.\n\n95\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.630\nPush them hard to make sure that that\ntalented person wants to work at\n\n96\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.370\nyour company.\n\n97\n00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.270\nAnd if, for some reason,\nthey have to leave.\n\n98\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.740\nHopefully they'll leave\nsaying good things about you.\n\n99\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.280\nAnd one of the things that's gonna drive\na tracking top talent is the next thing\n\n100\n00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.750\nthe C, which is culture.\n\n101\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.980\nOne of the major things\ntop talent looks for\n\n102\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.600\nis they wanna work in a place with\na great organizational culture.\n\n103\n00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.510\nAnd there's two sides\nto that culture coin.\n\n104\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.190\nThe first side is what employees want, and\n\n105\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.510\nwhat they want is what I\nphrase as a winning culture.\n\n106\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.850\nAnd there's a lot of different\nelements to that, and\n\n107\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.760\nsome of them are,\nis it a fun place to work?\n\n108\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.640\nDo I get treated fairly?\n\n109\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.380\nIs my voice heard?\n\n110\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.660\nDo I have the freedom to do my job well?\n\n111\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.310\nDo I work with people I really like,\nwho I would consider my friends?\n\n112\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.460\nDo I take pride in\nthe organization I work for?\n\n113\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.919\nAm I proud when I hand out the card or\nwhen I wear the logo on my shirt?\n\n114\n00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:43.633\nDo I get sun?\n\n115\n00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:48.207\nThis is a big one Vicky, do I get some\nsort of genuine, honest, sincere praise,\n\n116\n00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:50.480\nonce every seven to ten days.\n\n117\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.583\nAnd for all the folks watching this,\nthat doesn't mean you gotta freak out\n\n118\n00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:56.252\nlike [SOUND], I'd be out all day\nlong trying to praise my people.\n\n119\n00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:58.779\nAnd if you're high analytical,\nthat doesn't mean you put it on your\n\n120\n00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.840\ncalendar once every ten days you walk out\nand go I love you people, you're great!\n\n121\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.040\nThis is not what we're talking about here.\n\n122\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.480\nBut the caveat to that is it doesn't just\nhave to be the leader that's praising\n\n123\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.260\npeople and this really goes to\nthe heart of a strong culture.\n\n124\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.240\nIn most organizations when you mess up and\n\n125\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.630\ndo something wrong, there's someone\nthere to point it out really quick, but\n\n126\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.960\nif you do something right people\nrarely say anything at all.\n\n127\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.540\nSo I'm a big believer in creating\na culture of catching people doing\n\n128\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.320\nthings right.\n\n129\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.350\nThat everybody in the organization Is\ncoming to work everyday hoping to find\n\n130\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.220\nsomebody else doing something good and\ngiving them a pat on the back or\n\n131\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.370\nwriting them a hand written note or\nsending them an email, saying thank you,\n\n132\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.650\nthat was really good.\n\n133\n00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.256\nThat also means everyday when you get up\nto go to work, you know that everyone else\n\n134\n00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.756\nin your organization is trying to catch\nyou do something right and to praise you\n\n135\n00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:49.300\nfor that, which to me is a really neat\nidea about working in a culture like that.\n\n136\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.350\nNow let's jump to the other side, what\nthe business wants out of their culture,\n\n137\n00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.160\nI can sum that up in\ntwo words very easily.\n\n138\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.700\nThey want people with\nan ownership mentality.\n\n139\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.470\nThey want employees who are pro-active,\nwho are creative,\n\n140\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.250\ninnovative, that wanna get things going.\n\n141\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.700\nThey have a sense of urgency,\nthey take high levels of personal and\n\n142\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.960\nmutual accountability, and\nthey deliver business results.\n\n143\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.610\nSo those are the two things that we look\nat when we look at a winning culture.\n\n144\n00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.970\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a great place to work.\n\n145\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.530\nAnd one of the things that you\nmentioned about recognizing people for\n\n146\n00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.390\nwhat they do well,\nrecognizing achievements.\n\n147\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.730\nCould you imagine working in a place\nwhere that happened all the time?\n\n148\n00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.310\nIt's so easy for people to look\nwhat's going wrong often times.\n\n149\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.580\nSo I can imagine that that has a huge\nimpact on the culture of an organization.\n\n150\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.070\n&gt;&gt; It has a massive impact and the reverse\nof that is when people don't feel like\n\n151\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.320\nanybody at the organization\ncares about them.\n\n152\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.580\nAnd they're not getting praise,\nthey're not being rewarded.\n\n153\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.560\nThey pretty soon feel like they are not\ndoing anything that's important.\n\n154\n00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.590\nAnd they are not valued as\nan individual and they'll leave.\n\n155\n00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.700\nActually I'm gonna do\nsomething interesting.\n\n156\n00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.140\nThe ECF in the model is\nextreme customer focus.\n\n157\n00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.670\nBut let's back up a second and\nrealize as a leader in an organization\n\n158\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.110\nyour number one customers\nare your employees.\n\n159\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.380\nAnd the number one factor that\ndrives highly engaged satisfied and\n\n160\n00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.440\nloyal customers is engaged satisfied and\nloyal employees.\n\n161\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.920\nBut I've got a phrase that even\ntakes it further than that.\n\n162\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.860\nThe customers experience will never\nexceed the employees experience.\n\n163\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.930\nSo from extreme customer focus internally\nyou want to be focused on your employees,\n\n164\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.050\nlistening to them, understanding them,\ntaking good care of them.\n\n165\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.610\nBut then I'll make the jump to the other\nside of that is extreme customer focus to\n\n166\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.549\nyour external customers.\n\n167\n00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.480\nIt amazes me how many\norganizations I work with\n\n168\n00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.990\nthat don't deeply\nunderstand their customer.\n\n169\n00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.710\nThat aren't really getting close to them,\nlistening to them, and\n\n170\n00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.230\ntrying to create a relationship.\n\n171\n00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.650\nA long term relationship\nwith the customer.\n\n172\n00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.120\nSo you have to be\nextremely customer focused.\n\n173\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.740\nWe're gonna talk about this in\nanother one of the sessions about\n\n174\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.540\nowning the voice of the customer.\n\n175\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.010\nThat's the most important\nthing in that area.\n\n176\n00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine that.\n\n177\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.050\nAnd you know, so far we've talked\nabout the talent, the customer focus.\n\n178\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.960\nWe've talked about the culture\nof the organization.\n\n179\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.390\nAnd all that sounds great.\n\n180\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.320\nAnd I know we've started out\ntalking about business excellence.\n\n181\n00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.860\nAnd so I'm thinking that\n\n182\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.140\nthere could be a situation where\nthe company is great to work for.\n\n183\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.040\nYou feel really good.\n\n184\n00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.050\nBut at the end of the day, we know that\nbusiness excellence means results.\n\n185\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.820\nSo how does that translate\nto excellence in results.\n\n186\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAbsolutely perfect.\n\n187\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.600\nAnd you've hit the nail on the head.\n\n188\n00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.850\nThe last part of our formula,\n\n189\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.830\nwe had talent, plus culture,\nplus extreme customer focus.\n\n190\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:37.190\nAnd the last one is multiplied\nby disciplined execution.\n\n191\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.340\nDelivering business results.\n\n192\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.850\nWhen I look around the world, with all the\ncompanies I work for, the single biggest\n\n193\n00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.620\nissue is lack of disciplined execution,\nlack of accountability.\n\n194\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.880\nSo the key idea here is, is you've\ngot to create an organization where\n\n195\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.840\nyou take great ideas and\nturn them into action.\n\n196\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.030\nAnd I will quickly share with you\nwhat I think it takes to create that\n\n197\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.370\nculture of accountability.\n\n198\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.060\nThere's five steps.\n\n199\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.821\nStep number one is when you're gonna\nhold someone in your organization\n\n200\n00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.165\naccountable for a major project.\n\n201\n00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:05.931\nSomething that's got to get done.\n\n202\n00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:10.433\nStep one is 100% clarity plus\nappropriate authority and resources.\n\n203\n00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:12.488\nIn other words,\nI have to sit down with this person,\n\n204\n00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:15.830\nthat I'm gonna assign a major project to,\nyou don't want to do this on everything.\n\n205\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.790\nAnd get extreme clarity about\nwhat my expectations are.\n\n206\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.000\nHow success is measured.\n\n207\n00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.130\nWhat success looks like.\n\n208\n00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.260\nWhat the timeline is.\n\n209\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.750\nWhat the budget is.\n\n210\n00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.060\nThen you've gotta get enough authority and\n\n211\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.390\nall the resources they need to deliver\nwhat you're asking them to deliver.\n\n212\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.380\nSo step one, 100% clarity plus\nappropriate authority and resources.\n\n213\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.150\nStep two is 100% agreement.\n\n214\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.030\nThe person that you're gonna hold\naccountable actually has to sit there and\n\n215\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.940\nlook at you and say, I understand\nthe metrics, I understand the goal,\n\n216\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.850\nI understand what success looks like,\nI've got enough resources, I have enough\n\n217\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:53.830\nauthority, I believe this is a reasonable\ngoal, and I accept 100% accountability.\n\n218\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.090\nI've been asking companies for about the\nlast five years on a scale of one to ten\n\n219\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.500\nwith 10 being world class, if you look\nat all of your major projects and\n\n220\n00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.840\nscore them, how often would you\nsay that you get 100% clarity and\n\n221\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.790\nappropriate authority resources and\n100% agreement on a scale of 1 to 10?\n\n222\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.800\nIs anyone in here a 9 or a 10?\n\n223\n00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.970\nI've never had anyone raise\ntheir hand in the entire world.\n\n224\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.570\nSo you just look at those two things and\n\n225\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.440\nyou understand that that's a solid\nfoundation, which most companies don't do.\n\n226\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.610\nStep 3 then is a tough one for\na lot of organizations, is track and post.\n\n227\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.570\nAnd there's two ideas behind track and\npost.\n\n228\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.290\nNumber 1 is if you're gonna hold someone\naccountable to doing something important,\n\n229\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.680\nthat's mission-critical, you gotta tell\nthem where they stand against that.\n\n230\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.770\nSo, you've gotta be able to show them,\nthrough tracking\n\n231\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.790\nthat they can look at three seconds and\nfigure out how they're doing at that goal.\n\n232\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.850\nSo the one I like to use is green,\nyellow, red.\n\n233\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.480\nI'm either doing great against my goal.\n\n234\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.230\nI'm on target.\n\n235\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.160\nI'm on deadline.\n\n236\n00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.430\nEverything's going great.\n\n237\n00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.070\nI'm in a little bit of danger or\nI'm really not doing well and\n\n238\n00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.560\nI'm close to failing.\n\n239\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.990\nSo that step 1 is make it super easy\nto understand green, yellow, red.\n\n240\n00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.710\nStep two then is make it highly visible.\n\n241\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.780\nCut down all the trees, no place to hide,\nput it up on a white board,\n\n242\n00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.315\non a dashboard, on a computer, so\nthat everybody knows where everybody\n\n243\n00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:17.535\nfrom the top of the organization to\nthe bottom, stands on their goals.\n\n244\n00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:19.765\nSo, very easy to understand.\n\n245\n00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:22.785\nAnd highly, highly visible so\neverybody sees it.\n\n246\n00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.065\nNow, here's what happens\nin most organizations,\n\n247\n00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:29.655\nabout 10% of the people love that\nbecause they're your top performers.\n\n248\n00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:31.890\nThey know they're gonna be green,\ngreen, green.\n\n249\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.540\nLove it, it makes them proud, they can't\nwait till they put up the tracking.\n\n250\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.050\nAbout 70 to 80% of the people in the\nmiddle of the organization freaked out,\n\n251\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.310\nthey looked like a deer in the headlights.\n\n252\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.698\n[SOUND] And then about 10 or 15%,\nhopefully it's less at the bottom,\n\n253\n00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:48.251\nfall down on the ground like a two year\nold with a wet diaper and start crying and\n\n254\n00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:50.074\ngoing it's not fair, it's not fair.\n\n255\n00:12:50.074 --> 00:12:53.390\nAnd for those people what we like to\ncall is make them available to industry\n\n256\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.637\nbecause they've just told you,\nI'm mediocre,\n\n257\n00:12:55.637 --> 00:12:59.440\nI'm gonna be yellow red yellow red\nyellow red and not get out of there.\n\n258\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.970\nSo now what do you do about that big group\nin the middle that's all freaked out?\n\n259\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.020\nHere's what you do, it's the fourth step.\n\n260\n00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.110\nCoach, mentor, train, support.\n\n261\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.900\nMost people think that when I'm tracking\nyou, I'm tracking you to punish you.\n\n262\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.730\nTo you know show that you're missing your\ngoal, that I'm not gonna give you your\n\n263\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.210\npromotion, I'm not gonna give you\na bonus or give you a raise, and\n\n264\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.100\nthey see it as tracking as punitive.\n\n265\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.060\nWhat you do here is you flip it around and\nsay no, no, no.\n\n266\n00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.070\nWhen you slip from green to yellow\nwe're not gonna get mad at you or\n\n267\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.160\nyell at you we're gonna\nrush in to help you.\n\n268\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.100\nWe're gonna give you coaching, training,\nmentoring, support, and everybody on\n\n269\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.440\nthe team's gonna gather around you\nto get from yellow back into green.\n\n270\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.530\nAt first people don't really believe it.\n\n271\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.260\nThey struggle with it.\n\n272\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.210\nBut after a little while they realize,\nevery time I slip and every time I go into\n\n273\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.530\nyellow, everybody comes and\nhelps me and gets me back up in green.\n\n274\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.960\nAnd when that happens\nthey want more tracking.\n\n275\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.200\nThe other side of this is\nwhen someone doesn't do that.\n\n276\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.160\nAt least everyone around the organization\nknows that everyone was trying to get them\n\n277\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.660\nfrom yellow into green and\nthey slipped from yellow into red.\n\n278\n00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.910\nWhich brings me to the fifth and final\none which is celebrate success lavishly.\n\n279\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.340\nIf someone does a great job, and they\ndeliver their results, and everything's\n\n280\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.320\ndone well and they stay in green,\neverybody should cheer and celebrate that.\n\n281\n00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.080\nBut when someone doesn't do it and you\ncan't get them from yellow into green or\n\n282\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.890\nred into yellow then it's time to\ndeal decisively with mediocrity and\n\n283\n00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.710\nhelp them leave the organisation.\n\n284\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.550\nBut again if you've been coaching,\nmentoring, training and\n\n285\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.190\nsupporting, when they leave and I've got\na great Jack Welsh quote here that I like,\n\n286\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.190\nI never fired anybody with surprise.\n\n287\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.740\nAnd this also means that no\none else was surprised and\n\n288\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.570\nthey think that you treat them fairly and\nreasonably.\n\n289\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.210\nThat they were asked to held accountable,\nthey accepted the accountability and\n\n290\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.930\ndidn't deliver.\n\n291\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Wow, John that's a lot of information\nbut really good information.\n\n292\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.049\nAnd I love the equation and\n\n293\n00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:49.208\nhow the first parts of the equation\nkind of set you up for success.\n\n294\n00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:53.020\nAnd then there's that great multiplier\nat the end so that's really fantastic.\n\n295\n00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.558\nAny final thoughts on execution or\njust excellence in general for our group?\n\n296\n00:14:58.558 --> 00:15:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthese are four fundamental things.\n\n297\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.490\nThey're not the only things, you have\nto have great financial management,\n\n298\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.320\ngood quality product and service.\n\n299\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.530\nUnderstanding of your market,\nfinancing, all that sort of stuff.\n\n300\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:13.490\nBut to me if you do these four things,\nsurround yourself, hire, keep,\n\n301\n00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.070\ntrain the very best talent.\n\n302\n00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.910\nYou create a winning culture that\nalso delivers the business results.\n\n303\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.730\nYou have extreme customer focus.\n\n304\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.820\nInternal customers, your employees, and\nexternal customers who pay all the bills.\n\n305\n00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.680\nAnd then you take those first three\nthings and you make sure that you\n\n306\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.530\napply disciplined execution, that you\ntake all that great information and\n\n307\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.800\nactually deliver results\nin the marketplace.\n\n308\n00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.760\nI believe if you focus on these four\nthings, it'll create a good solid bedrock\n\n309\n00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.000\nfor the long term and\nsustainable success of the organization.\n\n310\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.090\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic stuff.\n\n311\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.520\nI know that I've learned quite a bit.\n\n312\n00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.830\nAnd I hope that you guys did too.\n\n313\n00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.570\nI think for today that's a wrap.\n\n314\n00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.320\nFor BizPro.TV, I'm Vicki Hall.\n\n315\n00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n316\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.951\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n317\n00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:09.759\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hall.\n\n4\n00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:13.446\nToday's session is going to be\nfocusing on the web of value.\n\n5\n00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.656\nAnd quite frankly,\nwhen John told me about the session today,\n\n6\n00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:19.680\nI did not know really where\nhe was gonna go with it.\n\n7\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.795\nSo I wanna introduce John Spence and\n\n8\n00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:25.613\nhe's gonna talk us through what\nthat means the web evaluation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:29.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's an interesting term,\nit's one I developed and\n\n10\n00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:33.981\nit's based on what I think are three\nessential things that any company.\n\n11\n00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:38.252\nBut especially a small to medium size\nbusiness really needs to focus on to build\n\n12\n00:00:38.252 --> 00:00:39.621\na high level of success.\n\n13\n00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.164\nAnd I'm great with the acronyms so\n\n14\n00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:47.449\nthis one is V-O-C M-O-T and W-O-M.\n\n15\n00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.450\nVOC, this is one of those things\nI jump up and down about.\n\n16\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.470\nIt's one of my strongest\nbusiness beliefs that whoever\n\n17\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.980\nowns the voice of the customer VOC,\nowns the marketplace.\n\n18\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.150\nThat whoever understands her customer the\nbest, who's the closest customer, creates\n\n19\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.110\nthe best relationship, listens to what's\nimportant to them, what they care about.\n\n20\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.160\nWhoever understands the customer\nthe best has a huge market advantage.\n\n21\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.979\nAnd I've made a recommendation to\nseveral of my clients in the past that\n\n22\n00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.561\nthey put a formal system in to do this.\n\n23\n00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:23.671\nAnd I'll give you four questions that\nwe help people ask that really get to\n\n24\n00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.040\nthe heart of listening to\nthe voice of the customer.\n\n25\n00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.740\nAnd I'll give you a quick example of\nhow I did this a couple of years ago.\n\n26\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.104\nI was working for a company out of Texas,\na due diligence firm that\n\n27\n00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:36.727\nthey would fly in to look and\nsee about whether the numbers were right.\n\n28\n00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:39.687\nOne company should buy another company,\nand I ask them,\n\n29\n00:01:39.687 --> 00:01:41.360\ndo you have a Pareto business?\n\n30\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.297\nAnd they say,\nwhat do you mean by a Pareto business?\n\n31\n00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:49.260\nAnd I said, does 80% of your revenue\ncome from 20% of your customers?\n\n32\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.145\nAnd they said, no, no, no, 90% of our\nrevenue comes from 10% of our customers.\n\n33\n00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:55.146\nI said, we'll deal with that later.\n\n34\n00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:58.236\nI said, let's get together a client panel,\nlet's get together five or\n\n35\n00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.800\nsix of your top customers.\n\n36\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.460\nBring them in and we'll ask them some\nquestions in front of your whole team,\n\n37\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.380\nwhich is about 170 people.\n\n38\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.951\nSo we got 6 of their top clients\nto represent at about 35,\n\n39\n00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.790\n40% of their total revenue\nout of a couple 100 clients.\n\n40\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.320\nThese six key ones and\nI asked them these four questions.\n\n41\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.200\nNumber one, why specifically do\nyou do business with this company?\n\n42\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.940\nAnd I'll change the phraseology a bit,\nit would be like this.\n\n43\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.246\nWhy specifically do you do\nbusiness with our company?\n\n44\n00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:29.480\nWhat are the top three or\nfour reasons you hired us?\n\n45\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.930\nAnd all six of them explained it and\nit was roughly the same thing.\n\n46\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.010\nAnd I turned to the company and said,\n\n47\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.150\nyou just got your brand,\nthat's your unique selling proposition.\n\n48\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.280\nIf all these people spend millions\nof dollars with you, for basically\n\n49\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.400\nthe same four or five reasons, this\nprobably why other people would hire you.\n\n50\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.050\nSo why specifically do\nyou do business with us?\n\n51\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.710\nThe top three or four reasons,\nthat's your brand.\n\n52\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.760\nNumber two,\nwhat do we do now that frustrates you?\n\n53\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.350\nWhat do we do that you wish we'd start,\nstop, change, do differently?\n\n54\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.920\nWhat would make it easier\nto do business with us?\n\n55\n00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.353\nAgain, all six answered\nroughly the same thing.\n\n56\n00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:06.148\nAnd I turned to the company and\nsaid, great, fix that stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:10.280\nIf that's stuff that your customers\ndon't like, let's change that right now.\n\n58\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.750\nQuestion number three, what would it take\nto earn more or all of your business?\n\n59\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.920\nWhat would we have to do to\nbecome your preferred supplier or\n\n60\n00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.400\nyour sole source supplier and\ndeliver everything to you?\n\n61\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.420\nAgain cuz you see a trend here,\n\n62\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.330\nthey all roughly said the same thing,\nand I turned them and said, great.\n\n63\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.900\nDo more of that and\nyou will get more of their business.\n\n64\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.450\nAnd the last thing I asked was, what\nwould it take for you to terminate them?\n\n65\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.901\nWhat would we do that\nwould cause you to be so\n\n66\n00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.500\nunhappy that you would\nfire us immediately?\n\n67\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.453\nAnd they just said a few things,\nbreach of confidentiality,\n\n68\n00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:52.150\nprofessional misconduct,\ngiving us false numbers.\n\n69\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.930\nPretty straightforward stuff and\nI looked at the company and\n\n70\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.400\nsaid, don't do those things.\n\n71\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.863\nSo at the end of that,\nof listening to the voice of the customer.\n\n72\n00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:03.698\nThey understood how to brand themselves,\nhow to go to market, what most people\n\n73\n00:04:03.698 --> 00:04:07.600\nwould buy from them, how to increase or\nhow to make their customers happy?\n\n74\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.130\nHow to increase their customer's business,\n\n75\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.710\nand how not to lose their\ncustomer's business?\n\n76\n00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.320\nI've recommended this sort\nof an idea to dozens and\n\n77\n00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.950\ndozens of companies and\nvery few ever do it.\n\n78\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.945\nProbably 90% of the organizations I\nwork with are unfortunately pathetic at\n\n79\n00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:25.864\ntruly listening to\nthe voice of the customer.\n\n80\n00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:28.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nI can only imagine how important that is.\n\n81\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.269\nAnd unfortunately you're right, I bet many\ncompanies don't really ask their customers\n\n82\n00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:35.656\nwhat they think and\nlisten to that feedback.\n\n83\n00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:39.665\nAnd I can actually think of some companies\nright now, off the top of my head,\n\n84\n00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:42.433\nthat they probably haven't\nasked their customer.\n\n85\n00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.314\nSo that's a good point.\n\n86\n00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:45.765\n&gt;&gt; I'll take the port from there.\n\n87\n00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:49.370\nBut I've talked to CEOs about this,\ncompanies that have hired me.\n\n88\n00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.460\nAnd they've said,\nI don't wanna ask the customer,\n\n89\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.610\nbecause I'd be afraid of what they said or\nif they complained, I'd have to fix it.\n\n90\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.150\nSo I'd rather not hear\nthe voice of the customer.\n\n91\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.517\n&gt;&gt; Path of least resistance, right John?\n\n92\n00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:01.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] absolutely.\n\n93\n00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:02.423\n&gt;&gt; So this web of value,\n\n94\n00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:05.850\nI'm starting to understand a little\nbit about creating this value.\n\n95\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.150\nSo the first thing is to listen to\nthe customer, understand what they want or\n\n96\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.800\nthey need from you.\n\n97\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.050\nWhat else is this web?\n\n98\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Well the next one we're gonna\ntalk about is MOT, moments of truth.\n\n99\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.951\nAnd many of the folks I work with say that\nthis is one of the most powerful ideas I\n\n100\n00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:23.467\nteach.\n\n101\n00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:27.891\nThis idea came from years ago, there was\na gentleman named Jan Carlzon that took\n\n102\n00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.950\nover as CEO of Scandinavian Airway.\n\n103\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.247\nAnd the airway was in\nvery serious trouble,\n\n104\n00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:34.710\nreally on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\n105\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.460\nAnd he looked at it and said,\n\n106\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.720\nwe're gonna have to rebuild\nthis thing from the bottom up.\n\n107\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.820\nI mean we just gotta change everything.\n\n108\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.570\nAnd he said as long as we're\ngonna rebuild this company,\n\n109\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.760\nwhy don't we rebuild it on the backs\nof the very best customers?\n\n110\n00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.330\nAnd in the airline industry,\n\n111\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.350\nthe very best customers are people like\nme, on the road 150, 200 days a year.\n\n112\n00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.544\nI don't get to pick where I go,\nI've got to buy plane ticket,\n\n113\n00:05:55.544 --> 00:05:59.117\nI've got to be there,\nI'm on the plane quickly, I'm off quickly.\n\n114\n00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:00.660\nI fly Delta most of the time.\n\n115\n00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.156\nWe have a joke that I probably have\nto go through Atlanta when I die.\n\n116\n00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:07.190\nBut what we're looking for here is\nwhat he said, we wanna get the very,\n\n117\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.120\nvery best customers.\n\n118\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.160\nThen he said, let's look at every place\nwe touch them, all of the touch points.\n\n119\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.150\nFrom when they pickup the phone to call\nus, to when they get home with their\n\n120\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.970\nluggage, what are all the different\nplaces we interact with the customer?\n\n121\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.840\nThen out of those, let's figure out\nthe three, four, five moments of truth.\n\n122\n00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.146\nThe make or break things that we must do\nflawlessly, to take that customer and\n\n123\n00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:32.143\nmake sure that they have\nan outstanding experience.\n\n124\n00:06:32.143 --> 00:06:36.610\nAnd I'm gonna switch gears here now, cuz\nI always use restaurants as an example.\n\n125\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.160\nI did a little research and\nfor the average restaurant,\n\n126\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.460\nif you were to leave your house,\ndrive over have dinner, and\n\n127\n00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.930\ndrive back to your house,\nthere's about 170 touch points.\n\n128\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.710\nIs it easy to find,\ndoes it have a big sign out front?\n\n129\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.410\nIs the ingress and\negress easy to get in and out?\n\n130\n00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.780\nAre the parking spaces wide enough?\n\n131\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.456\nIs the parking lot clean?\n\n132\n00:06:56.456 --> 00:06:58.057\nIs the shrubbery attractive?\n\n133\n00:06:58.057 --> 00:06:59.640\nIs it the right temperature\nwhen you go in?\n\n134\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.940\nIs the music too loud or not loud enough\non and on and those are all touch points.\n\n135\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.790\nBut basically for\n\n136\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.070\nevery restaurant on the face of the Earth\nthere's only four moments of truth.\n\n137\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.940\nFour things they've got to do and\nI use the word over and\n\n138\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.680\nover again flawlessly if you wanna take\nsomeone that came in for dinner and\n\n139\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.050\nturn them into a raving fan a patron.\n\n140\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.670\nWho comes back over and over again and\n\n141\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.470\ntells everybody about how great your\nrestaurant is, just four things.\n\n142\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.000\nAnd I've asked many, many crowds this,\nand they almost always get it.\n\n143\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.710\nHere it is, good quality food,\ngood service, reasonable prices\n\n144\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.290\naccording to the quality of the food and\nthe service and immaculately clean.\n\n145\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.180\nAs long as you do those four things,\n\n146\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.838\nyou're basically meeting the needs\nof pretty much every customer or\n\n147\n00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:42.563\nthe foundational needs,\nthose moments of truth.\n\n148\n00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.660\nSo here's an example of this.\n\n149\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.242\nLet's say, I decided we're all\ngonna go out for dinner or Vicki,\n\n150\n00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:48.730\nyou and I are gonna go out.\n\n151\n00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.810\nAnd we'll go out and have sushi,\nI know we both like sushi.\n\n152\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.974\nAnd we go there and it's easy to\nfind the place, big sign, well lit.\n\n153\n00:07:55.974 --> 00:07:59.658\nParking lots, super sparkling clean,\nit's well lit when we get in.\n\n154\n00:07:59.658 --> 00:08:04.598\nThe shrubbery looks like Koi, they're\nplaying that [SOUND] Japanese music,\n\n155\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:05.591\njust perfect.\n\n156\n00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:09.637\nThey greet us at the door, they're\nsuper nice, the service is incredible.\n\n157\n00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:11.528\nThey keep your sake hot and\nyour beer cold,\n\n158\n00:08:11.528 --> 00:08:13.589\nI mean they're just\ntaking great care of you.\n\n159\n00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:16.094\nYou look at the menu and\nthe prices are really reasonable.\n\n160\n00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:18.205\nI mean this is good prices.\n\n161\n00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.912\nThe sushi comes, it's the best\nsushi you've ever had in your life.\n\n162\n00:08:20.912 --> 00:08:23.993\nIt's unbelievable, it's man,\nthe service is great,\n\n163\n00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:27.827\nthe food is great, the price is great\nthen you get up to go to the restroom.\n\n164\n00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:30.760\nAnd you walk in there and it looks like\nnobody's cleaned it in five years.\n\n165\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.835\nIt's disgusting,\nthere's stuff all over the ground.\n\n166\n00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:35.368\nThere's cockroaches, I mean it's horrible.\n\n167\n00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:38.512\nHere's the question, are you ever\ngoing to go to that restaurant again?\n\n168\n00:08:38.512 --> 00:08:40.033\nAbsolutely not.\n\n169\n00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:41.753\nBut here's the key point.\n\n170\n00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:46.400\nThey got 169 out of 170\ntouch points perfectly.\n\n171\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.030\nThey nailed three of\nthe four moments of truth.\n\n172\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.250\nAnd because they missed\nthat one moment of truth,\n\n173\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.410\nthey have lost the customer forever.\n\n174\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:00.380\nSo the teaching point here is, you have\nmoments of truth in your business.\n\n175\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.933\nYou have things that your customers\nhave to have, that if you miss them,\n\n176\n00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:06.495\nit doesn't matter if you\ndo everything else right,\n\n177\n00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:09.601\nthey are not going to be happy,\nand you will lose them forever.\n\n178\n00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.996\nAnd it 's not necessarily four,\nit might be three it might be five,\n\n179\n00:09:12.996 --> 00:09:15.210\nit might be six probably\nnot more than that.\n\n180\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.230\nIf you start to get above six,\n\n181\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.640\nyou're getting too many things\neverything can't be a priority.\n\n182\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.134\nBut here's my challenges,\n\n183\n00:09:21.134 --> 00:09:24.932\nif you understand those moments of\ntruth then you can build processes and\n\n184\n00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:28.430\nsystems around them to make sure\nthat you deliver them perfectly.\n\n185\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.067\nI don't like checklists and standard\noperating procedures but I do know this,\n\n186\n00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:36.760\nif you want repeatable success,\nyou must have process.\n\n187\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.450\nAnd if there's any place in\nyour business you want process,\n\n188\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.270\nit's around the moments of truth.\n\n189\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.754\nOne other key point on this before\nI finish up on moments of truth is,\n\n190\n00:09:44.754 --> 00:09:46.416\nyou also have them internally.\n\n191\n00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.970\nYou've got things that you've got\nto deliver to other departments,\n\n192\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.020\nyour folks have to deliver.\n\n193\n00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.321\nAnd if they don't deliver\nthe moments of truth for each other,\n\n194\n00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:56.011\nit is impossible to deliver them for\nthe customer.\n\n195\n00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.402\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know you were making\nme pretty hungry for sushi-\n\n196\n00:09:58.402 --> 00:09:58.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n197\n00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:00.148\n&gt;&gt; Until you talked about that restroom.\n\n198\n00:10:00.148 --> 00:10:02.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And you know John,\n\n199\n00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:06.791\nI bet that after that experience, the only\nthing that I would actually think about\n\n200\n00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:10.400\nwhenever I thought about that restaurant,\nis that restroom.\n\n201\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.219\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n202\n00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:14.766\n&gt;&gt; I think you said,\nthere's 170 touchpoints?\n\n203\n00:10:14.766 --> 00:10:15.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:18.385\n&gt;&gt; That one would make\na huge impact on me, and\n\n205\n00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:23.686\nprobably would make me never go back to\nthat restaurant or that restroom again.\n\n206\n00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:26.207\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, and\nthat's why it's a moment of truth.\n\n207\n00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:30.168\nAnd then here's what would happen,\nis if you were really unhappy or\n\n208\n00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:31.287\nhappy either way.\n\n209\n00:10:31.287 --> 00:10:36.500\nWe get to the third part of the web\nof value which WOM, word of mouth.\n\n210\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.160\nNever in the history of human\nkind has it been easier to\n\n211\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.110\nmake a business successful with word\nof mouth or to put it out of business.\n\n212\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.972\nSo using that example,\nyou might go and had a great time and\n\n213\n00:10:47.972 --> 00:10:49.733\nthen the restroom's disgusting.\n\n214\n00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.593\nYou're gonna go right out and\nput it on Yelp.\n\n215\n00:10:51.593 --> 00:10:54.634\nAnd on Urbanspoon and put it on\nyour Facebook and your Twitter and\n\n216\n00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:56.760\ntell people never to go there.\n\n217\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.370\nSo the reverse of that is,\nif you wanna grow your business,\n\n218\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.540\nyou've gotta be able\nto do those first two.\n\n219\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.657\nListen to your customer, understand them.\n\n220\n00:11:04.657 --> 00:11:08.590\nUnderstand their needs, their wants,\ntheir fears, their wishes, their desires.\n\n221\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.790\nOut of all that identify\nthe moments of truth.\n\n222\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.369\nThe three, four,\nfive things you've gotta do flawlessly.\n\n223\n00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:16.943\nDeliver those things, meet their needs,\nanswer their questions.\n\n224\n00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.892\nAnd then if you do that,\nyou basically turn your customers and\n\n225\n00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:21.820\nyour marketing department.\n\n226\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.940\nThey become evangelists for your\nbusiness to go out and tell everybody.\n\n227\n00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.667\nAnd I'll give a real quick\nexample of the power of this,\n\n228\n00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.303\nwhen I wrote one of my last books.\n\n229\n00:11:30.303 --> 00:11:33.018\nAnd I won't mention it cuz\nI don't push books, but\n\n230\n00:11:33.018 --> 00:11:35.950\nit was an okay book on\nbusiness excellence.\n\n231\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.230\nAnd it was doing all right it won\na few awards, but it was number 11,031\n\n232\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.750\non the best sellers list on Amazon.com,\n[LAUGH] not exactly en fuego there.\n\n233\n00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.826\nThen guy Kawasaki,\n\n234\n00:11:45.826 --> 00:11:50.013\nthe former marketing director at Apple\nwas kind enough to tweet about my book.\n\n235\n00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:53.915\nHe read it, he liked it and said,\njust read John Spetza's book, really good,\n\n236\n00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:55.640\nI highly recommend it.\n\n237\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.554\nI went from number 1131 to\nnumber 11 in about 3 days and\n\n238\n00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:02.716\ngot back ordered for\ntwo months on Amazon.com.\n\n239\n00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:07.105\nThat one tweet, because he has\n1.8 million Twitter followers,\n\n240\n00:12:07.105 --> 00:12:12.507\ngenerated massive positive word of mouth\nand brought me a huge amount of business.\n\n241\n00:12:12.507 --> 00:12:16.554\nAnd it's exactly the same with your\nbusiness, so you gotta look at all\n\n242\n00:12:16.554 --> 00:12:21.097\nthe different channels, social media,\none on one meetings, VIP meetings.\n\n243\n00:12:21.097 --> 00:12:24.792\nEverything you can do, top customers,\nto listen to your customer,\n\n244\n00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:26.332\nserve them, satisfy them.\n\n245\n00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:29.362\nExceed their expectations,\nthen help them make it easier for\n\n246\n00:12:29.362 --> 00:12:32.639\nthem to go out and tell everybody\nabout how great your business is.\n\n247\n00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:35.069\nHow much they love doing\nbusiness with you, and\n\n248\n00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:37.574\nthat everyone else should\ndo business with you.\n\n249\n00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:39.048\nSo that's the three key
