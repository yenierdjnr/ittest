Sure, Vicki.\nThank you.\n\n15\n00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.814\nWell, actually what I did is rather than\ntry to give you a theory that I created by\n\n16\n00:00:56.814 --> 00:01:01.689\nmyself, I did a survey several years ago\nto 10,000 high potential employees at top\n\n17\n00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.320\ncompanies around the world.\n\n18\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.916\nThese were the best of the best, the folks\nthat anyone would love to have in\n\n19\n00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:10.222\ntheir company and I asked them a very\nfocused question which was what\n\n20\n00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:13.433\nare the characteristics of a leader\nyou would willingly follow?\n\n21\n00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.783\nNot famous leaders or iconic leaders, but\n\n22\n00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:18.784\nwho is the kind of a person\nthat you wanna come to work for\n\n23\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.712\neveryday that you want as your leader and\nthey told me seven key things.\n\n24\n00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:27.072\nThey all happen to begin with C and\nI'll got ahead and give you the first one,\n\n25\n00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:28.860\ncuz it's the most important.\n\n26\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.312\nThe other ones you can sort of mix up,\nbut the first one is character and\n\n27\n00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:36.500\nanother word here would be integrity or\nhonesty.\n\n28\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.866\nGreat research study by Kouzes and\nPosner, I know you've studied them, too.\n\n29\n00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.550\nThey did a 30 year research study,\n4 continents, 3 million respondents and\n\n30\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.642\nask the same question.\n\n31\n00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:49.161\nThat's where I got the question is what\nare the characteristics of a leader you\n\n32\n00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.342\nwould willingly follow?\n\n33\n00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.992\nFour major answers and\nthe first one was honesty.\n\n34\n00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:57.740\n89% of the people worldwide,\nthat's 3 decades, 4 continents,\n\n35\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.737\n3 million respondents all\nsaid that telling the truth,\n\n36\n00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:04.620\nbeing honest is the single most important\nthing they look for in a leader.\n\n37\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.676\nThe next one was forward-looking.\n\n38\n00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:10.412\nAnother word for that would be\nvisionary and a key idea here is,\n\n39\n00:02:10.412 --> 00:02:14.801\nit's not just the CEO or the senior\nmanagement team that sets the vision.\n\n40\n00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.546\nIf one person follows you, just one,\nyou set the vision for the two of you.\n\n41\n00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:22.889\nSo, every leader at every level has\nto be forward-looking or visionary.\n\n42\n00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.298\nThe next one was competent.\n\n43\n00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:28.340\nYou gotta be extremely good at what you\ndo and there's two areas of competence.\n\n44\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.909\nYou gotta be good at your job, highly\ncompetent that I like to use the word,\n\n45\n00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.322\ntowering confidence and you have to\nbe good at your leadership skills.\n\n46\n00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.761\nAnd then the last of the major four was\ninspiring and that doesn't mean that\n\n47\n00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.775\nyou've got to go rah, rah,\nsis boom, bah and be a cheerleader.\n\n48\n00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:43.831\nWhat it means is that\nif you're not inspired,\n\n49\n00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.845\ndon't expect anyone else\non your team to be.\n\n50\n00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.280\nYou've got to be passionate,\ncommitted, excited,\n\n51\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.529\ninspired in order to be inspiring.\n\n52\n00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:56.310\nSo, those four all fit up under\nthat first C of character.\n\n53\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and character is so important and\n\n54\n00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.787\nwhat you said about being willing to\nfollow a leader, I think that is key.\n\n55\n00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:06.734\nOther things to consider in leadership\nthat keep it simple for us?\n\n56\n00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.191\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nwe'll go through the other C's.\n\n57\n00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.460\nSo, the character's first and\nit's first among all of them.\n\n58\n00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.260\nThe next one that I like is courage and\nwhat they told me here is I\n\n59\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.800\nexpect my leader to be courageous, to take\nbig, bold risks, to take tough decisions,\n\n60\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.400\nbut what I really want is a leader who\nis courageous enough to be vulnerable.\n\n61\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.140\nTo admit, they don't have all\nthe answers to ask for help.\n\n62\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.447\nUnbelievably important thing in being an\neffective leader is having the courage and\n\n63\n00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.095\nvulnerability to ask for help.\n\n64\n00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:39.956\nNow this doesn't mean you should be\nsitting in the corner like, yeah,\n\n65\n00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:40.963\nI don't know what to do.\n\n66\n00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:45.934\n90% of the time you're courageous,\nyou're bold, you're a risk taker, but 10%\n\n67\n00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:50.508\nof the time when you feel overwhelmed you\nadmit it, when you don't have the answer\n\n68\n00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:55.045\nyou admit it and you show people that\nyou're courageous enough to be authentic.\n\n69\n00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:59.879\n&gt;&gt; Courage, I've seen courage in action\nand I've seen the opposite of courage in\n\n70\n00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.441\naction and I can clearly see how that is\na huge trait to being a great leader.\n\n71\n00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.142\nWhat's the next C that we can think about?\n\n72\n00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.966\n&gt;&gt; This C is one that we mentioned\nearlier from Kouzes and Posner, but\n\n73\n00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:15.628\nit's one that's essential in building\ntrust and respect which is confidence.\n\n74\n00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:19.837\nAnd the idea here is that you've got to be\nreally, really, really good at your job\n\n75\n00:04:19.837 --> 00:04:23.758\nand really good at your leadership\nskills and here's what I share with you.\n\n76\n00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:25.559\nThere's no excuses not to be.\n\n77\n00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.639\nIf you're going to be a leader, you've got\nto set the example of a being life long\n\n78\n00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.539\nlearner and never in the history of\nhumankind has there been more information\n\n79\n00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.352\navailable for free than right now.\n\n80\n00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:40.566\nSo there's no excuses, you should be\nwatching TED Talks and Big Think and\n\n81\n00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:45.108\nYouTube videos and listening to\niTunes Podcasts and reading and\n\n82\n00:04:45.108 --> 00:04:50.089\nreading different magazine and\nall those ways to invest in yourself.\n\n83\n00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.876\nBecause the more information you have\naccess to, the more you can help other\n\n84\n00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.500\npeople, the more respected you will\nbe as a leader for your competence.\n\n85\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.922\nAnd if you wanna have a great team and\na great company, having people that\n\n86\n00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.738\nare highly competent, focused and always\ngetting better every day, what I call\n\n87\n00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.014\npersonal [INAUDIBLE] is fundamental\nto building your great company.\n\n88\n00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:12.477\nAnd if the leader isn't highly competent\nin setting that example no one else will\n\n89\n00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:13.142\nfollow it.\n\n90\n00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:17.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and going back to being a leader\nthat you wanna follow, I can completely\n\n91\n00:05:17.498 --> 00:05:22.590\nunderstand how competence is one of\nthose things that if you don't have it.\n\n92\n00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.260\nI mean, people are definitely not\ngoing to respect you as a leader and\n\n93\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.030\nthat's probably a huge component as well.\n\n94\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.020\nWhat's another one,\nJohn that we can think of?\n\n95\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.324\n&gt;&gt; The next C is communication.\n\n96\n00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.671\nAnd again,\nwhen you hear all these, remember,\n\n97\n00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:36.628\nthis isn't a theory that I came up with.\n\n98\n00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:40.694\nAlthough I've been studying leadership,\nread hundreds of books on it,\n\n99\n00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:42.274\nlead a couple of companies.\n\n100\n00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:46.320\nThis is what those 10,000 high\npotential employees told me and\n\n101\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.390\nwhat they said around\ncommunication was of course,\n\n102\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.155\nI expect my leader to be able to\nstand up and explain the vision and\n\n103\n00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:56.321\ngive a motivating talk and\ngive clear expectations.\n\n104\n00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:57.346\nBut what I really,\n\n105\n00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:02.340\nreally want from my leader is someone who\nasks great questions and listens intently.\n\n106\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.080\nSomeone's who curious.\n\n107\n00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.179\nI've hired good people,\nthey're on my team, I'm leading this team.\n\n108\n00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.311\nWhy in the world wouldn't I be\nexcited about asking them questions,\n\n109\n00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.443\ntrying to get their opinion,\nthey're feedback, they're input.\n\n110\n00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:17.306\nSo you want a leader that's very curious,\nconstantly asking questions.\n\n111\n00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:20.537\nAnd then when someone gives them\nthe answer, they're an intense listener.\n\n112\n00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.965\nThey're using great body language.\n\n113\n00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.593\nThey're focused.\n\n114\n00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.768\nThey're taking notes.\n\n115\n00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:24.494\nThey're listening.\n\n116\n00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:25.613\nThey're trying to understand.\n\n117\n00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:29.188\nThey're asking more questions and\nthe other key thing is once they've asked\n\n118\n00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:32.928\nthe question, and listened, and written\nnotes that they actually apply some of\n\n119\n00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:35.640\nthe things that they've been\ntold by their team members.\n\n120\n00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.073\nSo lots of open, honest,\nrobust, high trust, high candor,\n\n121\n00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.175\ncommunication is critical.\n\n122\n00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:43.283\nAsking great questions and\n\n123\n00:06:43.283 --> 00:06:45.793\nlistening is what they told me\nthey wanted from their leader.\n\n124\n00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:49.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see how these are kind\nof building upon each other.\n\n125\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.600\nBecause if a leader doesn't have character\nand their communicating with you, maybe in\n\n126\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.320\na way that they think is effective,\nyou're gonna see right through that.\n\n127\n00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.860\nSo I can see how these are just\nbuilding one on top of the other, but\n\n128\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.560\nI think there's more, John.\n\n129\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.311\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the next one is collaboration.\n\n130\n00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:09.364\nAnd again, here's what the folks told\nme is I understand you're my leader.\n\n131\n00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:11.595\nI know you're my boss, I got that.\n\n132\n00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:15.413\nYou've got more seniority, rank and\ntitle, but don't lord that over me.\n\n133\n00:07:15.413 --> 00:07:19.650\nIf every now and then you gotta say, do\nthis, because I'm you're boss, I'm fine.\n\n134\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.158\nBut the rest of the time, I wanna see you\nas a team player as a partner and a peer.\n\n135\n00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:27.269\nI wanna see my leader\nroll up their sleeves.\n\n136\n00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.229\nGet in there shoulder to shoulder with us.\n\n137\n00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:30.399\nWork as part of the team.\n\n138\n00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.520\nDo the work and communicate, and\nwork with us as a peer as a partner.\n\n139\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.228\nAnd then if you say,\ndo it, because I told you.\n\n140\n00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:39.459\nDo it, because I'm your manager.\n\n141\n00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.996\nDo it, because I own the company.\n\n142\n00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:42.363\nI'll handle that.\n\n143\n00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:45.120\nThe reverse is if you constantly\nlead from that command and\n\n144\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.059\ncontrol thing that ain't gonna work and\nyour best people will leave immediately,\n\n145\n00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.343\nbecause they get frustrated and\nthey don't want to be lead that way.\n\n146\n00:07:52.343 --> 00:07:54.666\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talk about teamwork so often.\n\n147\n00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:59.669\nAnd oftentimes, we miss the whole\nleadership part of teamwork.\n\n148\n00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:04.641\nAnd from what you're saying, collaboration\nas a leader really can play into whether\n\n149\n00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.447\nor not the team is successful.\n\n150\n00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:10.638\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and then part of it too is\nthat we've got a different make up of\n\n151\n00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:12.921\nthe people in the workforce right now.\n\n152\n00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:14.361\nAs the millennials come in and\n\n153\n00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.931\nthey're gonna be the largest section\nof workers over the next ten years,\n\n154\n00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.170\nthe baby boomers and gen X are moving out,\nretiring, going to other places.\n\n155\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.790\nYou're gonna look for a leader that is\nif they're not a team member, if they\n\n156\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.880\ndon't work well with folks, if they don't\ntreat other people with respect and\n\n157\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.650\nrespect their information, their ideas,\n\n158\n00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.290\ntheir experience, their suggestions,\nyou can't actually build a cohesive team.\n\n159\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:42.376\nAnother big idea with the millennials\nis the next C, which is compassion.\n\n160\n00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:43.571\nI'm 52 years old.\n\n161\n00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.392\nWhen I grew up, when my boss said, jump.\n\n162\n00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.100\nI said, how high, sir?\n\n163\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.086\nIt was all command and control, all men.\n\n164\n00:08:49.086 --> 00:08:53.414\nNow it's changed and employees today,\nwant more flexibility.\n\n165\n00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:56.806\nThey want more of say in their outcome,\nthey want you to be compassionate and\n\n166\n00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:57.659\nunderstand that.\n\n167\n00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:00.422\nYes, this is my job, but I have other\nthings that are just as important to me.\n\n168\n00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:03.012\nMy family, my hobbies, my faith.\n\n169\n00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:05.386\nI play on a sports team,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n170\n00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:08.220\nI'll give you my 40,\nmaybe my 50 hours a week.\n\n171\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.843\nBut after that, I'm out of here and I'm\ngoing home to spend time with my friends,\n\n172\n00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.996\nmy family to go surfing,\nwhatever it might be and\n\n173\n00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:16.322\nit's not that they don't\nhave a strong work ethic.\n\n174\n00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:20.087\nIt's they have a different\nvalue system that says,\n\n175\n00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:22.833\nI need to be felt like I'm important.\n\n176\n00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:24.137\nI do important work.\n\n177\n00:09:24.137 --> 00:09:25.619\nI'm making a difference in the world.\n\n178\n00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.879\nI'm contributing to the company,\ntitle isn't that important.\n\n179\n00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:32.250\nThey want fair pay, but\nit isn't all about money.\n\n180\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.380\nSo, they need a leader who's\ncompassionate enough to understand\n\n181\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.260\nthat this job isn't their whole life.\n\n182\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.697\nThat their really focused on\nother parts of their life and\n\n183\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:42.981\nthey want to feel good while\nthey're in the company,\n\n184\n00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:45.907\nthat the leader truly cares about them and\nhas compassion for them.\n\n185\n00:09:45.907 --> 00:09:49.609\n&gt;&gt; And it makes a huge difference is you\nwork for somebody who cares about you.\n\n186\n00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:53.857\nIt definitely makes a big difference\nin the leadership style of that leader.\n\n187\n00:09:53.857 --> 00:09:56.503\nIs there a final C that you\nwanna share with us today, John?\n\n188\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:00.189\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Vicky, I'll touch on\nwhat you just said is, it's very,\n\n189\n00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:03.752\nvery hard to be inspired, passionate,\ncommitted and excited for\n\n190\n00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:06.571\na leader that isn't and\ndoesn't treat you fairly.\n\n191\n00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:12.087\nInteresting piece of research shows that\nthe number one factor in highly engaged,\n\n192\n00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:17.234\nsatisfied and loyal customers is engaged,\nsatisfied and loyal employees.\n\n193\n00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:20.860\nAnother phrase I love to use here is the\ncustomer's experience will never exceed\n\n194\n00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.257\nthe employee's experience.\n\n195\n00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:24.579\nSo if the employee doesn't\nhave a leader they admire,\n\n196\n00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.098\nthere isn't good communication.\n\n197\n00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:29.919\nThey're not treated with compassion,\nyou're not gonna see them do that for\n\n198\n00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:33.289\nyour customers which typically\nruns to a thing called bankruptcy.\n\n199\n00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:37.850\nNow if you've done the other six things\nas well and you've become a good leader,\n\n200\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.268\nyou've got a good team.\n\n201\n00:10:39.268 --> 00:10:41.830\nYou're building a successful\ncompany you're growing.\n\n202\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.221\nThe seventh C is contribution and\nthis is where the leader says,\n\n203\n00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:51.038\nI'm gonna leave a legacy that I'm\ngonna make long-term decisions.\n\n204\n00:10:51.038 --> 00:10:55.574\nIn America, at least,\nwe run on a very tight schedule of meeting\n\n205\n00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:59.109\nquarterly goals or\nmeeting Wall Street demands.\n\n206\n00:10:59.109 --> 00:11:03.821\nAnd oftentimes, our leaders, unfortunately\nmake very short-term decisions, but\n\n207\n00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:07.369\nthe best leaders and I see leaders\nin other countries like Japan,\n\n208\n00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:12.624\nwhere they make 10, 15, 20-year horizons\nto allow them to make 20-year decisions.\n\n209\n00:11:12.624 --> 00:11:13.972\nSo as contribution goes,\n\n210\n00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:18.720\nit's what I call planting the seeds of\ntrees under which you may never sit.\n\n211\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.836\nGiving back to your community.\n\n212\n00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:21.384\nBuilding a legacy of leadership.\n\n213\n00:11:21.384 --> 00:11:25.363\nCreating other leaders and taking\nthe resources, and the authority, and\n\n214\n00:11:25.363 --> 00:11:29.470\nthe respect that you've earned by doing\nthe first six exceedingly well, and\n\n215\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.250\nbecoming a great leader.\n\n216\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.996\nAnd then giving back as a servant leader\nand leaving the organization better than\n\n217\n00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.853\nyou found it and better not just for\na few years, but for decades.\n\n218\n00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:44.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so John these seven Cs that you\njust mentioned are very thorough, but\n\n219\n00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:47.644\nkeep things simple when we\nwanna talk about leadership.\n\n220\n00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:50.282\nAre there any final thoughts\nthat you had on leadership\n\n221\n00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:52.064\nbefore we wrap up today's session?\n\n222\n00:11:52.064 --> 00:11:55.378\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the most important\nthing to remember here is to be a great\n\n223\n00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:58.421\nleader of others, you must first\nbe a great leader of yourself.\n\n224\n00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.193\nSo my recommendation is to think about\nthe seven that I've shared with you and\n\n225\n00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:05.908\nthen look at other things that you've had,\nother influences you've had,\n\n226\n00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:07.434\nleaders you've worked with.\n\n227\n00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:08.780\nGood leaders, bad leaders.\n\n228\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.383\nWhat you've learned from them,\nyour own personal value system and\n\n229\n00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:16.301\nwork on creating what I call your own\npersonal philosophy of leadership or\n\n230\n00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:20.283\nyour own personal leadership competency\nmodel where you've got a written\n\n231\n00:12:20.283 --> 00:12:24.322\nlist of the key things that you wanna do\nto be the kind of leader you wanna be and\n\n232\n00:12:24.322 --> 00:12:28.019\nleave the kind of leadership legacy\nyou've always wanted to leave.\n\n233\n00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:31.811\nAnd when you've got that, you can use it\nas a touchstone for every day when you go\n\n234\n00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.321\nin the office, every day you go to work,\nto how you wanna act and behave and\n\n235\n00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.964\nimpact the other people in your\norganization as a highly effective leader.\n\n236\n00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.899\n&gt;&gt; So John, thank you for\nthat recap of the seven Cs of leadership.\n\n237\n00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:47.449\nAs always, you kept things simple on\na topic that can often be way too complex.\n\n238\n00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:50.336\nSo for BizPro.TV, I'm Vicky Hall.\n\n239\n00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:51.946\n&gt;&gt; I'm John Spence.\n\n240\n00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:54.607\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nspending your time with us.\n\n241\n00:12:54.607 --> 00:13:03.483\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
