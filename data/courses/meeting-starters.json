          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.207\nIn this session were gonna talk\nabout what it takes to build and\n\n3\n00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:07.880\nsustain a high performance team.\n\n4\n00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.060\nFirst thing we look at what is the role\nof the team in other words what\n\n5\n00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.760\nare they supposed to accomplish?\n\n6\n00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.810\nMight be a strategy team and it's down and\n\n7\n00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.586\nlook to the long term\nfuture of the organization,\n\n8\n00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.750\ncreates strategic objectives and\na basic framework of a plan.\n\n9\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.450\nMight be a decision-making team,\nit's their job to take that strategy,\n\n10\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.380\nthose ideas and\ndecide whether to implement them or not.\n\n11\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.870\nMight be an innovation team, their\njob is to blue-sky and brainstorm and\n\n12\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.610\ncome up with wild ideas.\n\n13\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.680\nOr it might be an implementation team.\n\n14\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.284\nIt's their job to take the ideas,\nthe strategy,\n\n15\n00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:43.202\nthe information that someone else has\nmade a decision on and implement it.\n\n16\n00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:48.049\nKey idea here, I've seen a lot of\ntrouble in teams when they don't\n\n17\n00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:50.640\nunderstand why they were formed.\n\n18\n00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.625\nGreatest example is an implementation\nteam that's spending a whole bunch time\n\n19\n00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:58.990\nblue-skying and talking about strategy\nwhen they're not the one that\n\n20\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.650\nsets a strategy and\nthey're the one that makes the decisions.\n\n21\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.890\nSo, the first thing you wanna do is back\nup and say, why did we form this team?\n\n22\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.130\nNumber two is,\nwhat is the structure of the team?\n\n23\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.440\nAnd there's really sort of a continuum\nhere that starts at independent,\n\n24\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.990\nthen interdependent, then dependent.\n\n25\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.180\nI like to use a sports analogy for this.\n\n26\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.920\nIf you look at different types of teams,\nan independent team would be a golf team.\n\n27\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.300\nYes I'm on the team, and\nI'm trying to play for a team score, but\n\n28\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.990\nI'm also playing for my own score.\n\n29\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.920\nIt's basically me versus the course,\nno one else can hit the ball for me,\n\n30\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.090\nnobody else can sink a putt for me.\n\n31\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.310\nI can get a little advice but at the end\nof the day it's my individual score\n\n32\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.500\nthat gets added to the team score\nwhich means the team could lose but\n\n33\n00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080\nI could still have the lowest score and\n\n34\n00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.180\nI would get an award I'm completely\nindependent from the rest of the team.\n\n35\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.010\nGreat example of an interdependent\nteam would be a baseball team.\n\n36\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.110\nWhen I'm up at the plate, I'm alone.\n\n37\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.540\nI'm basically independent.\n\n38\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.890\nIt's me against the pitcher,\nnobody can bat for me, nobody can run for\n\n39\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.280\nme, the coach can give me advice but\n\n40\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.940\nat the end of the day,\nI'm the only one at the plate.\n\n41\n00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.390\nHowever, when I'm in the field with the\nrest of the team, we are interdependent.\n\n42\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.150\nI've gotta be able to field the ball,\nthrow it to first base.\n\n43\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.830\nIf I'm out in the outfield, and a pop fly\ncomes out and I just watch it go by, and I\n\n44\n00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.740\ndon't do anything, my lack of effort, not\nplaying with the team, can cost the team.\n\n45\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.910\nSo an interdependent team, has elements of\nindependence, while I'm doing my own work,\n\n46\n00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.750\nbut I also have elements\nof interdependence where\n\n47\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.020\nmy performance impacts the rest of\nthe team and the performance of the other\n\n48\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.470\nplayers on the team, the other members\nof the team impacts my performance.\n\n49\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.780\nFinally you have a dependent team and\non a dependent team,\n\n50\n00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.805\neverybody's performance is\nimpacted by everybody else's.\n\n51\n00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:45.980\nTwo great examples for these would be\na football team or a basketball team.\n\n52\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.890\nYou can even say a soccer team because if\n\n53\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.500\none player decides not to play\nit impacts the entire team.\n\n54\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.340\nIf one basketball player decides they're\nnot gonna run to the other end of\n\n55\n00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.120\nthe court they won't pass the ball or\n\n56\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.400\nthey won't take any shots or one football\nplayer decides they're not gonna block.\n\n57\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.250\nOr another great wanna be a relay\nlike an Olympic relay running relay.\n\n58\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.650\nIf the first two runners out of the floor\ndo great, and the third runner decides\n\n59\n00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.580\nthey're not gonna run,\nI'm not thinking they're winning a metal.\n\n60\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.490\nSo you've gotta look at,\nwhat is the structure of our team?\n\n61\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.330\nAre we an independent team, an\ninterdependent team, or a dependent team.\n\n62\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.970\nOne last thing to look at before we look\nat the high performance team model is\n\n63\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.770\ncompensation.\n\n64\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.330\nThis is a big one.\n\n65\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.100\nThere's a thing called the law\nof unintended consequences.\n\n66\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.860\nIf you compensate a team individually,\nI don't care how\n\n67\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.510\nmuch you try to make them of the team, but\nif I work well and I get more money and\n\n68\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.730\nit doesn't matter what happens to\nthe rest of the team, it is not a team.\n\n69\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.070\nNow the reverse is I can pay someone\na special bonus for doing well but\n\n70\n00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.730\nif I don't tie a large part of their\ncompensation to the performance of\n\n71\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.460\nthe entire team, then you're\nbasically gonna create infighting and\n\n72\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.970\nit's everyone for themselves because\ntheir compensation rewards them for\n\n73\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.460\nbeing individually good,\nnot good on the team.\n\n74\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.090\nSo compensation is another big factor in\nhow a team interacts with each other.\n\n75\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.090\nNow I'd like to share with you the high\nperformance team model I've built after 20\n\n76\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.690\nyears of working with teams,\nfrom the Fortune 500 down to start ups,\n\n77\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.470\nevery type of company you can possibly\nimagine, basically all over the world.\n\n78\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.780\nAnd as I looked at all these different\nteams, the good ones, the bad ones,\n\n79\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.010\nthe high performance ones,\nthe dysfunctional ones, I looked for\n\n80\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.010\na pattern of what the best consistently\ndid that allowed them to be the best.\n\n81\n00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.499\nThere are six elements to this model, and\nif you spell it out it's D-M-C-C-M-D.\n\n82\n00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.770\nThe first D stands for direction.\n\n83\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.465\nIf you're gonna have an effective,\n\n84\n00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:49.865\nhigh-performance team,\nthey need to have a clear, specific,\n\n85\n00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:55.630\nwell-communicated Vision and strategy for\ngrowth and it has to be shared.\n\n86\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.580\nThat doesn't mean the team gets to set\nthe direction of the team, per se, it\n\n87\n00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.230\nmay be someone higher in the organization\nthat tells the team the outcome they want.\n\n88\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.640\nBut the team needs to have a say in\nthe outcome if they're gonna have a stake\n\n89\n00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.590\nin the outcome.\n\n90\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.370\nSo step one is to get a shared\ndirection for the team.\n\n91\n00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.260\nThe M and\n\n92\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.230\nthis whole model is basically built on\nthe two Ms, the first M is measurements.\n\n93\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.360\nThe only way to have a true high\nperformance team is to set very clear\n\n94\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.780\ngoals that are specific, measurable and\nthe keyword here is binary.\n\n95\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.650\nIt's one, zero, black,\nwhite, yes, no, no guessing.\n\n96\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.800\nHere's one my very favorite business\nphrases, ambiguity breeds mediocrity.\n\n97\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.550\nAnd on a high performance team,\nyou do not have any ambiguity.\n\n98\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.880\nEverybody knows exactly what the goals of\nthe team are, what the outcomes look like,\n\n99\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.680\nhow's it's gonna be measured, what the\nbudget is, what the time line as clear,\n\n100\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.750\nspecific, measurable.\n\n101\n00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.470\nAnd the keyword again here is binary\nbecause you can't have any guessing.\n\n102\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.050\nNo guessing.\n\n103\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.970\nYou either got the goal or you didn't.\n\n104\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.870\nAnd you're gonna see why this is so\nimportant in just a minute.\n\n105\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.550\nThe two Cs are pretty straightforward.\n\n106\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.000\nThe first one if competence.\n\n107\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.840\nI wanna get the best people I\ncan possibly get on my team.\n\n108\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.350\nNow, that doesn't mean that everybody\nhas to have four advanced degrees from\n\n109\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.970\nIvy league colleges.\n\n110\n00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.300\nWhat it means is for\nthe position they have on the team,\n\n111\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.640\nI want to get the very best\nperson I can for that position.\n\n112\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.720\nThe next C is communication.\n\n113\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.940\nAnd there's a couple of key words here,\nopen, honest,\n\n114\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.270\nrobust, candor,\nthe big one is transparency.\n\n115\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.910\nThe more information you share\nwith people on the team,\n\n116\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.360\nthe higher level of\naccountability you can have.\n\n117\n00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.190\nIf someone on the team didn't\nget enough information,\n\n118\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.920\nthey really don't know what's going on,\nsomeone didn't tell them about the goal,\n\n119\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.850\nthey didn't give them enough information\non the project, you're withholding\n\n120\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.400\ninformation, you cannot hold that\nperson accountable, they don't know.\n\n121\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.950\nBut if you give lots of information,\nyou share as much information as you\n\n122\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.850\npossibly can,\nyou share it with everybody on the team.\n\n123\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.790\nThen you can have very high\nlevels of accountability.\n\n124\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.230\nIt used to be that people said\nthat knowledge was power.\n\n125\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.180\nNo, sharing knowledge allows\nyou to empower other people,\n\n126\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.870\nwhich multiplies your power.\n\n127\n00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.060\nAnd on a team,\nwe want to have as much empowerment and\n\n128\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.650\nas much sharing of\ninformation as possible.\n\n129\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.100\nOkay, here's the big leverage\nin the model, the next M and\n\n130\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.650\nthat is mutual accountability.\n\n131\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.310\nThat's when you create a team and it's\nreally three levels of accountability.\n\n132\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.000\nLevel one is personal accountability.\n\n133\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.030\nI hold myself personally accountable for\ndelivering what I promised.\n\n134\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.970\nIf I accept a goal and I say I'm gonna\nget it done I work really hard to hold\n\n135\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.160\nmyself accountable to keep my word,\ndeliver on my promise, deliver that goal.\n\n136\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.350\nLevel two is mutual is accountability,\nand that's where everybody on the team,\n\n137\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.185\nregardless of ranks, seniority, doesn't\nmatter if we're on the team together,\n\n138\n00:07:47.185 --> 00:07:49.795\nwe all hold each other accountable for\n\n139\n00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:52.325\nachieving the goals we\nall agreed on together.\n\n140\n00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:55.845\nThat's why those specific measurable\nbinary goals are so important,\n\n141\n00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.555\nno ambiguity, no guessing.\n\n142\n00:07:57.555 --> 00:08:00.142\nBecause when I understand\neverybody else's goal and\n\n143\n00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:04.562\nthey understand my goal, then I can hold\nthem accountable and they can hold me\n\n144\n00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:07.862\naccountable because we all know what\nwe're supposed to be doing together.\n\n145\n00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:11.052\nThe third level of accountability on a\nhigh performance team, and this is really\n\n146\n00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:16.102\nwhat differentiates a work group from a\nteam to a high performance team, is where\n\n147\n00:08:16.102 --> 00:08:21.120\nyou expect even encourage other people\non the team to hold you accountable.\n\n148\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.600\nThat means that if somebody walks in your\noffice and says, hey, you were supposed to\n\n149\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.400\nget this done by noon on Tuesday and it's\n4 o'clock on Thursday, where's the report?\n\n150\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.246\nYou were supposed to have\nit to me two days ago.\n\n151\n00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:31.950\nYou don't get mad.\n\n152\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.600\nYou don't get angry.\n\n153\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.450\nYou don't get defensive.\n\n154\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.170\nYou say, thank you.\n\n155\n00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.250\nYou're exactly right.\n\n156\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.710\nI did promise that on Tuesday,\nit is Thursday.\n\n157\n00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.450\nMy fault, I apologize.\n\n158\n00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.830\nI will make that my number one\npriority and get it done right away.\n\n159\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.510\nNow I'm gonna tell you why the first M of\nmeasurable goals is so important because\n\n160\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.330\nif you don't have those clear, specific,\nmeasurable, binary goals, if you have\n\n161\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.310\nany ambiguity, what it sounds like is, hey\nI don't think you're trying hard enough.\n\n162\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.390\nDoesn't seem to me like that\nreport was turned in on time.\n\n163\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.090\nI don't feel like you're\nreally giving it 100%.\n\n164\n00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.630\nWhen the goals are unambiguous,\nthere is no guessing, there's no think,\n\n165\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.530\nfeel, or seem.\n\n166\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.890\nYou either got it or you didn't.\n\n167\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.650\nIt's data, it's facts.\n\n168\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.700\nThat means you can be rigorous,\nbut not ruthless.\n\n169\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.960\nYou can hold people fully\naccountable without attacking them.\n\n170\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.140\nYou can say, you're okay, but\nyour performance was not acceptable.\n\n171\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.350\nI like you, but I don't appreciate\nit when you turn things in two,\n\n172\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.670\nor three days late,\nit hurts the whole team.\n\n173\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.790\nA lot of people really struggle with\naccountability, holding other people\n\n174\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.980\naccountable, cuz they think they're being\nmean and when you have clear, specific,\n\n175\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.360\nmeasurable, agreed upon goals,\nwhere everybody knows what they are.\n\n176\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.040\nThey're black or white,\nyes or no, no guessing.\n\n177\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.830\nI've said this multiple times\nbecause it's so critical, but\n\n178\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.590\nif you can take all the ambiguity out,\nthen you can really\n\n179\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.720\nhave a high level of accountability\nwithout attacking each other.\n\n180\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.830\nAnd last but not least in the model\nis the final D, which is discipline,\n\n181\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.240\nthe discipline to actually build\nthis into the team, maintain it,\n\n182\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.560\nput it on the agenda, talk about it, make\nit part of the team culture all the time.\n\n183\n00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.880\nHere's what happens.\n\n184\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.900\nIn mediocre teams,\nwhen there's an emergency, there's a fire,\n\n185\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.690\nthey pull together and\nthey act like a high performance team.\n\n186\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.480\nThey are hitting on all cylinders,\nthey're helping each other,\n\n187\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.670\nhigh levels of accountability,\nlots of communication, but that's rare.\n\n188\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:24.905\nThe reverse is in high performance teams,\nthey act this way 85-90% of the time.\n\n189\n00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:27.015\nAnd every now and then,\nthey slip a little bit.\n\n190\n00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:30.225\nAnd then they hold each other accountable\nand get right back up to high performance.\n\n191\n00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:35.030\nSo those are some of the key ideas\naround the role of the team,\n\n192\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.530\nthe structure of the team,\ncompensation of the team and\n\n193\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.910\nmy high performance team model of DMCCMD.\n\n194\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.768\nI hope this helps you build better\nteams in your organization and\n\n195\n00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:49.074\nsustain them as high performance teams.\n\n196\n00:10:49.074 --> 00:10:59.074\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

of\n\n3\n00:00:06.637 --> 00:00:08.340\nhighly effective leaders.\n\n4\n00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.390\nThis is based on a proprietary research\nstudy I did with several thousand\n\n5\n00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.380\nhigh potential employees at top\ncompanies around the world.\n\n6\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.120\nThese are folks that you would love,\nlove to have in your company.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.620\nThey're so\n\n8\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.230\ngood at what they do, they basically\ncould get a job anyplace they wanted to.\n\n9\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.370\nThey're what I call voluntary employees,\nbecause if they didn't like their job,\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.940\nthey would just leave today and\nhave a job at the competition by tomorrow.\n\n11\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.050\nAnd by the way, 88% of people that\nquit their job don't quit the job,\n\n12\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.697\ndon't quit the hours, don't quit the pay,\ndon't quit [LAUGH] the workload.\n\n13\n00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:38.520\nYou know what they quit?\n\n14\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.005\nTheir idiot boss,\ntheir manager, their leader.\n\n15\n00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:45.020\n[LAUGH] So, this is especially\nimportant to cover these things.\n\n16\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.130\nI asked them, if you could work anywhere\nyou want to work, and with any leader\n\n17\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.910\nyou wanted to work with, basically, why\ndo you work for the folks you work for?\n\n18\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.800\nWhat are the characteristics you look for\nand\n\n19\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.710\nthe kind of leader that you\nwould willingly follow?\n\n20\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.690\nAfter I compiled all the answers,\nand looked for\n\n21\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.770\na pattern, it basically boiled\ndown to seven Cs of leadership.\n\n22\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.580\nThe first C is character, and\nit's the most important one.\n\n23\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.500\nYou might also use the word credibility\nhere, but here's what they told me.\n\n24\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.050\nThe single most important thing I look for\n\n25\n00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.810\nin a leader I would\nwillingly follow is honesty.\n\n26\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.160\nI want someone who will tell me the truth,\nwho has high integrity,\n\n27\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.100\nhas high character.\n\n28\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.650\nI can believe them\nbecause they're credible.\n\n29\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560\nWhy?\nBecause they're honest.\n\n30\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.790\nThe second C is competence, you gotta\nbe really, really good at what you do.\n\n31\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.050\nNow, this doesn't mean you gotta\nbe able to do everybody's job,\n\n32\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.040\nbut there are two skill sets you\nmust be exceedingly competent in.\n\n33\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.350\nYour job, whatever that might entail,\nwhatever your work duties are,\n\n34\n00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.900\nyou've gotta be, and the word I like\nto use is toweringly competent.\n\n35\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.970\nAnd then you've gotta be exceedingly\ncompetent at your leadership skills.\n\n36\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.240\nHere's the best advice I can\ngive you around competence.\n\n37\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.540\nNever in the history of the world has\nthere been more fantastic information\n\n38\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.570\navailable for free.\n\n39\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.330\nIf you're going to be an effective leader\nwho demonstrates competence, you've\n\n40\n00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.040\nalso got to be dedicated to lifelong\nlearning, to what I call, personal Kaizen.\n\n41\n00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.760\nContinuous incremental improvement, always\ntrying to get better, Reading, studying,\n\n42\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.320\nwatching videos, listening to audio books.\n\n43\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.370\nEverything you can do to get more\ncompetent at your job duties, and\n\n44\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.225\ndramatically more competent\nin your leadership skills.\n\n45\n00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:30.055\nThe third C is courage, and what the folks\non the survey told me was, of course,\n\n46\n00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.785\nI want someone who is courageous.\n\n47\n00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.875\nI want a leader who could\nmake bold decisions,\n\n48\n00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.875\ntake big risks, make tough calls.\n\n49\n00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.915\nBut really they said and\nthis is fascinating, is I expect that, but\n\n50\n00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:46.510\nwhat I really want is a leader who is\ncourageous enough to be vulnerable,\n\n51\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.580\nto be authentic,\nto admit they don't have all the answers.\n\n52\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.600\nThat they need some help, or\n\n53\n00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.130\nthey might be in over their head,\nor they're a little confused, too.\n\n54\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.890\nNow I wouldn't do this all the time, 90%\nof the time, I don't know what's going on!\n\n55\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.610\nBut what they're saying is most of\nthe time I want a bold, courageous\n\n56\n00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.320\nleader who's got a clear vision, that's\nstrong, and knows where they're going.\n\n57\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.820\nBut I also want them to be authentic and\nvulnerable enough,\n\n58\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.150\ncourageous enough, to ask for help,\nto say they need some assistance.\n\n59\n00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.090\nFor them to say, hey, you're smart people,\nthat's why I hired you,\n\n60\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.150\nthat's why you're on my team,\nI'd love your feedback, your input,\n\n61\n00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.780\nyour assistance on this, to help me\nwith this one area where I'm struggling.\n\n62\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390\nThe third C was courage.\n\n63\n00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.920\nThe fourth C was communication.\n\n64\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790\nAgain, what the folks in the survey\nsaid was I expect my leader to be\n\n65\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.180\na great communicator,\nto be inspirational, to be motivational,\n\n66\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.450\nto be able to share a clear vision\nof the future, where we're going.\n\n67\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.100\nBut the most important skills I look for\nin a leader that I would willingly follow\n\n68\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.860\nare asking great questions and\nbeing an intense listener,\n\n69\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.440\nbeing curious, wanting to know\nwhat other people are thinking.\n\n70\n00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.280\nI have just said it around courage is,\n\n71\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.650\nif you are a great leader,\nyou hire really smart talented people.\n\n72\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.360\nWhy in the world would you not ask them\nfor their input and their ideas, and\n\n73\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.840\nthen when they give it to you, listen\nvery, very closely to it and implement it.\n\n74\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.500\nThe fifth C is collaboration.\n\n75\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.420\nThis is a big one and again,\nremember in all these, I'm\n\n76\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.310\ngetting feedback from the top employees\nof the top companies around the world.\n\n77\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.620\nPeople that are very good at what they do,\n\n78\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.080\nthe kind of folks that anyone\nwould wanna have on their team, so\n\n79\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.710\nthey've got some pretty high expectations\nfor what they look for in their leader.\n\n80\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.530\nIn the area of collaboration, what they\nsaid is, I understand you're the boss,\n\n81\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.140\nI know you own the company, or\nyou're the senior vice president, or\n\n82\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.410\nyou're my manager, but\ndon't lord that over me.\n\n83\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.720\nWhat they said is most of the time,\nI want my leader to be a partner,\n\n84\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.930\na peer, to get in there shoulder to\nshoulder with me, roll up their sleeves,\n\n85\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.310\ndo the work, and really be part of\nthe team and collaborate with us.\n\n86\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.045\nThe sixth C is an interesting one,\ncompassion, thank you millennials.\n\n87\n00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:59.680\n[LAUGH] What they said in this survey was\n\n88\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.450\nI'm not going to give my\nlife to your company.\n\n89\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.500\nYou need to be a compassionate leader, and\n\n90\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.666\nunderstand that my job\nis just part of my life.\n\n91\n00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:11.200\nI have a family, I have a hobby,\ni donate my time,\n\n92\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.440\nI've got a sport I wanna play,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n93\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.760\nI'm gonna work hard while I'm there, but\n\n94\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.870\ndo not expect me to stay until 10 at\nnight, work through the weekends, and\n\n95\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.640\ndo those things,\nyou are not gonna drive me in the ground.\n\n96\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.560\nRemember, these are the best of the best,\nso they have options.\n\n97\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.600\nIf they don't enjoy where they're working,\nthey don't like their leader,\n\n98\n00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.520\nthey're not having fun, they feel like\nthey're being just crushed and overworked,\n\n99\n00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.850\nthat they don't have a compassionate\nleader, they will start looking for\n\n100\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.460\na job immediately and\nleave as fast as they can.\n\n101\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.780\nWhat compassion says is, understand me,\nrecognize my value, help me get better,\n\n102\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.940\ninvest in me, be a partner, be on my\nside and show me that you care about me.\n\n103\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.140\nYou care about me at the office, but\nyou care about me as a person and\n\n104\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.030\nyou want me to have some level of life\nbalance, and be compassionate to my needs,\n\n105\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.790\nmy desires, my fears, and\nto me having a life outside of this place.\n\n106\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.125\nThe final C, and when I look at these\nthings the first one, character\n\n107\n00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:14.005\nis definitely first and this one,\nthe seventh, is definitely the seventh.\n\n108\n00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:18.115\nThe other ones can kind of be mixed\naround but number seven is contribution.\n\n109\n00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:23.365\nWhat the people in my research survey said\nwas, once you get to be a true leader,\n\n110\n00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:28.235\nyou've got access to resources, you've got\na lot of people that work with you, you've\n\n111\n00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:34.570\ngot some influence, you've got access\nto money and other things like that.\n\n112\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.210\nThat you should take all of those things\nthat you've got at your disposal and\n\n113\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.900\nreinvest them in the future,\nto contribute back to your people,\n\n114\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.050\nyour company, your community,\nfrankly to the world.\n\n115\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.640\nIt was about the fact that\nleadership is an obligation, but\n\n116\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.530\nit's also a tremendous opportunity\nto use the resources and\n\n117\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.820\ninfluence you have at your disposal\nto make the world a better place.\n\n118\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.380\nThe big idea here was thinking long-term.\n\n119\n00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.650\nThe words I like to use is you\nmust plant the seeds of trees\n\n120\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.270\nunder which you may never sit,\n\n121\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.510\nthat a great leader isn't just thinking\nabout how can we maximize profit today?\n\n122\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.840\nHow can I increase revenue this month?\n\n123\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.270\nYes, you worry about those things but\nyou're also saying how can I build up my\n\n124\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.680\nleaders so that I have a great leadership\nteam five, ten years from now?\n\n125\n00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.800\nWhat do I need to do today to ensure\nthe company is strong a decade from now?\n\n126\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.430\nWhat sort of tough decisions can I make\nright now that will be a positive impact\n\n127\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.860\non my people, on my community,\non the sustainability of the Earth?\n\n128\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.030\nIt's really sitting back and asking, what\nis the legacy I want to leave as a leader?\n\n129\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.170\nWhat's the impact I want to have?\n\n130\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.350\nNot only today on the success\nof the business or\n\n131\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.910\nthe organization, but a decade from now,\ntwo decades, three decades from now.\n\n132\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.640\nHow will I impact people, touch them,\nassist them, contribute to them so\n\n133\n00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.280\nthat I can leave a strong,\npositive legacy?\n\n134\n00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.580\nBased on all of my research and\nworking with companies for\n\n135\n00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.820\n20 years teaching leadership, those\nare seven of the key characteristics that\n\n136\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.230\npeople look for\nin a leader they would willingly follow.\n\n137\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.610\nNow, to be a great leader, it's important\nto think about those characteristics but\n\n138\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.620\nalso think about the other things\nthat are important to you.\n\n139\n00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.030\nWhat the leadership values, the attitudes,\nthe attributes, the characteristics that\n\n140\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.630\nyou feel are critical for you to become\nthe kind of leader that you want to be?\n\n141\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.360\nIt's fascinating to me that in teaching\nmy classes all over the world,\n\n142\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.080\nI will usually ask at the beginning\nof a leadership class,\n\n143\n00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.350\nhow many of you in the room currently have\na written list of your core leadership\n\n144\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.010\nvalues that you use to guide your\nbehavior on a daily basis and\n\n145\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.032\nbe the kind of leader\nyou've always wanted to be?\n\n146\n00:08:46.032 --> 00:08:53.240\nPerhaps 5% or less of the people in\nthe room usually raise their hands.\n\n147\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.140\nThe major lesson from this is, you've\ngotta take the time to look at those\n\n148\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.100\ncharacteristics I just shared with you and\nyour own personal values, and\n\n149\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.710\nwhat you've seen the best\nleaders you've worked with, and\n\n150\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.418\ncreate your own personal\nleadership competency model.\n\n151\n00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:12.399\nA list of the things you want to live to\nbe the kind of leader that you hope to be.\n\n152\n00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.368\nNow it's time to do the workshop, I hope\nyou find it very valuable and helpful.\n\n153\n00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:26.368\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:07.090\nbusiness excellence.\n\n4\n00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.274\nThis is based on more than 20 years\nof research, reading, studying and\n\n5\n00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:14.718\nworking with literally hundreds\nof companies, looking for\n\n6\n00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:19.255\nthe pattern of what do only the best of\nthe best do to build a successful company?\n\n7\n00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:27.369\nThe formula is T+C (T+C+ECF)\nx DE = Business Excellence.\n\n8\n00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.794\nLet's start with the T.\n\n9\n00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.550\nThe T stands for Talent.\n\n10\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.129\nAll right,\nit's pretty straightforward to me.\n\n11\n00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.889\nThe success of your business\nis directly tied to\n\n12\n00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:40.700\nthe quality of the people that you\ncan get, grow, and keep on your team.\n\n13\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.280\nWhich means then, that talent acquisition,\ntalent development, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.190\ntalent retention should be\na major strategic objective.\n\n15\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.288\nYou wanna get the best people you\ncan possibly get on your team.\n\n16\n00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:53.710\nNow, this doesn't mean that everybody\nhas to have 11 advance degrees from IB\n\n17\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.489\nleague schools.\n\n18\n00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.810\nWhat it means is for\nthe position I'm hiring,\n\n19\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.168\nI wanna get someone who can do\nthat job really, really well.\n\n20\n00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:05.216\nWhether it is the CFO,\nwhether it's a sales person,\n\n21\n00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:08.876\nwhether it's someone who answers\nthe phones, whatever it is,\n\n22\n00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:13.319\nthese are all different skill sets and\ndifferent skill level requirements.\n\n23\n00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.367\nBut whatever job you're hiring for,\n\n24\n00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.762\nyou want to find somebody that's\nsuper talented in that area.\n\n25\n00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.649\nAnother thing to think about\nis that many businesses today,\n\n26\n00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.712\ntheir competition has a product that's\nclose, similar, maybe even better.\n\n27\n00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:32.410\nTheir competition has something that's\npriced similarly, maybe less expensive.\n\n28\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.940\nThey can copy you on your marketing.\n\n29\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.209\nIf you've got a great website,\n\n30\n00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.580\nthey'll have something up that looks\nlike it within a couple of hours.\n\n31\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.770\nDistribution, most, every business\ncan distribute anywhere in the world.\n\n32\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090\nIn other words, a lot of the things that\nused to differentiate businesses, and\n\n33\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.170\nallow them to compete successfully in\nthe marketplace have been wiped out.\n\n34\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.210\nThey're parity,\neverybody can do about the same thing,\n\n35\n00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.944\nwhich means that the quality of\nthe people that you can get on your team.\n\n36\n00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:04.171\nAnd the relationships they create with\nyour customers is one of the only\n\n37\n00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.853\nsustainable competitive advantages left.\n\n38\n00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:11.800\nThe C stands for culture, and\nthere are two parts to culture.\n\n39\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.760\nThe first part is what do employees want?\n\n40\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.900\nBased on the firms of endearment study,\nthe Great Places to Work study and\n\n41\n00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.937\na national Gallup poll of 23\nmillion American workers.\n\n42\n00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.752\nBasically, there's nine\nthings that people look for\n\n43\n00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:28.297\nin the kind of culture they would\nget excited about, engaged in, and\n\n44\n00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:30.880\nwould make them want to\nwork at a certain company.\n\n45\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.218\nFirst one is fun.\n\n46\n00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.299\nAnd that doesn't mean that we got\na rock-climbing wall, and masseuses,\n\n47\n00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.070\nand sushi.\n\n48\n00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.000\nAlthough, those things are nice.\n\n49\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.380\nWhat it means is that people\nenjoy where they work.\n\n50\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.780\nAnd the best test of this is do people\nsmile just as much when they come to work\n\n51\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.790\nas when they leave?\n\n52\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.540\nWhen your employees get\nthere in the morning,\n\n53\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.250\ndo they smile when they\nget out of the car?\n\n54\n00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.680\nAre they looking forward\nto coming to work?\n\n55\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.720\nDo they enjoy the people\nthey're working with?\n\n56\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.670\nAnd at the end of the day, are they\nsmiling when they leave to go home?\n\n57\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.560\nOf course, they wanna go home,\nthey want their weekend,\n\n58\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.850\nthey want their vacation, but\nthey also enjoy where they work.\n\n59\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.000\nNumber two is very close.\n\n60\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000\nIt's friends.\n\n61\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.440\nDo I like the people I work with?\n\n62\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.190\nDo I enjoy being around them?\n\n63\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.890\nAre they fun?\n\n64\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.870\nAre they nice?\n\n65\n00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.610\nDo they treat me with respect?\n\n66\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.350\nDo I consider the people\nI work with my friends,\n\n67\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.490\nsome of them even\npossibly my best friends?\n\n68\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.908\nNumber three sort of ties the first three\ntogether, and that's family atmosphere.\n\n69\n00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.671\nDo the people at work\ngenuinely care about me?\n\n70\n00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.759\nDo they ask how my kid's soccer game\nwas or if my mom's feeling better,\n\n71\n00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.420\nhow my vacation was?\n\n72\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.670\nDo they take a sincere\ninterest in me as a person,\n\n73\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.090\nnot just as some other\nperson at the office?\n\n74\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.130\nNumber our is fair, and\nthis isn't fairness around pay.\n\n75\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.645\nAnd the other research I've done clearly\nshows that as long as pay is fair,\n\n76\n00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:50.250\n10% above or below, what you would make\nto do the same job any place else,\n\n77\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.290\nyou can absolutely attract and\nkeep top talent.\n\n78\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.160\nBut really, what they were talking\nabout in fairness here is,\n\n79\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.310\nwill my opinion be respected?\n\n80\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.230\nIf something goes wrong,\nwill I be treated fairly?\n\n81\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.868\nAre the rules fair?\n\n82\n00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:06.562\nIs it a place where, if I have a concern,\nor an issue, or a complaint,\n\n83\n00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.686\nI will be heard, and\nI will be treated fairly?\n\n84\n00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:12.710\nThe next component is freedom.\n\n85\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.770\nAnd what that means is am I given the\ntraining, the resources, and the support\n\n86\n00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.400\nI need to do a great job, and that people\nget out of my way, and let me go do it?\n\n87\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.000\nNo micromanagement.\n\n88\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.020\nNumber seven is praise.\n\n89\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.790\nAnd this one's interesting,\nbecause it's some sort of genuine, honest,\n\n90\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.900\nsincere praise,\nonce every seven to ten days.\n\n91\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.120\nNow, before you freak out,\nthere's a big caveat to that.\n\n92\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.539\nWhich is the praise doesn't have to come\njust from the manager, or the leader.\n\n93\n00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:37.974\nIt can come from anyone.\n\n94\n00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:41.470\nThis is a really important point for me.\n\n95\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.570\nIn most businesses,\nif you mess up, 99.9% of the time,\n\n96\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.200\nthere is gonna be someone\nthere to point it out quickly.\n\n97\n00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.980\nThey are happy to show you\nthat you made a mistake.\n\n98\n00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.820\nIn most businesses, also, 99.9% of\nthe time, if you do something good,\n\n99\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.340\nnot great, just good,\nnobody says anything.\n\n100\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.840\nI think that's a really\nbad way to run a business.\n\n101\n00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.830\nHere's what I think,\n\n102\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.450\nyou need to create a culture of\ncatching people doing things, right?\n\n103\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.940\nThat's how you create a culture of\ngenuine, honest, sincere praise.\n\n104\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.950\nAnd everybody is looking to catch\neveryone else doing something right.\n\n105\n00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.490\nAnd I think this is especially neat,\n\n106\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.020\nbecause that means when I get up\nin the morning and go to work,\n\n107\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.240\nI know that I'm gonna be looking to catch\nmy coworkers doing something right, and\n\n108\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.600\ngive them some praise and a pat on\nthe back, or a handshake, or a nice job.\n\n109\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.548\nAnd that also means that everyone else is\ntrying to catch me doing something right.\n\n110\n00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.955\nSo, I've gotta be pretty excited\nwhen I go to work in the morning,\n\n111\n00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:36.340\ncuz I get to make someone else's day.\n\n112\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.240\nAnd everyone else is trying to do\nsomething to help make my day.\n\n113\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.790\nTo me, that's the kind of\nculture I want to work in.\n\n114\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.520\nA culture with lots of good,\nhonest, sincere praise.\n\n115\n00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.280\nThat doesn't mean you put it on your\ncalendar once every seven to ten days,\n\n116\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.200\nyou walk down, you go,\nyou people are doing a good job.\n\n117\n00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.165\nHo ho, man, am I a great leader.\n\n118\n00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:55.260\nNo, it's gotta be real, and\nit's gotta be specific.\n\n119\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.790\nYou don't just go, nice job.\n\n120\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.780\nYou go, great job on that report.\n\n121\n00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.970\nBoy, the way you gave me that executive\noverview with all those points,\n\n122\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.380\nthat was exactly what I needed.\n\n123\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.640\nWhen I talked to the CEO,\nit made me look great.\n\n124\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.540\nI really appreciate your work.\n\n125\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.160\nFor the first 15 or 20 years of this\nresearch, those were the only seven.\n\n126\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.500\nIt's a fun place to work,\nwhere I work with my friends.\n\n127\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.430\nIt's got a family atmosphere.\n\n128\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.400\nI'm treated fairly,\nI have freedom to go do my job well,\n\n129\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.780\nI take pride in\nthe organization I work for.\n\n130\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.380\nAnd I get genuine, honest, sincere\npraise once every seven to ten days.\n\n131\n00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.220\nYear after year after year,\nthe same seven.\n\n132\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.320\nIn the last few years,\n\n133\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.510\nhowever, thank you millennials [COUGH],\ntwo new ones have joined the list.\n\n134\n00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.010\nThose two are meaning and accomplishment.\n\n135\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.920\nIn other words, I wanna have\na job that makes a difference,\n\n136\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.800\nI wanna do something important.\n\n137\n00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.970\nI wanna have a job that's personally\nchallenging and meaningful to me, so\n\n138\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.040\nthat I know I'm not just doing mundane\nwork, I'm doing something important.\n\n139\n00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.910\nAnd then the last one is accomplishment,\nand that says, and\n\n140\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.870\nI want to be able to point at something\nand say, that's my work, I did that.\n\n141\n00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.960\nI'm not just a cog in the machine,\nI'm not just taking one thing and\n\n142\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.160\npass it on to the next, but I actually\nstart a project, work through it,\n\n143\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.220\nfinish it, and\nI have work that I can show that I did.\n\n144\n00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.610\nSo, those nine elements are the things\nthat an employee looks for, and\n\n145\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.700\nthe kind of culture in a company\nthey really wanna work for.\n\n146\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.140\nAnd it's that kind of a culture\nthat also attracts top talent.\n\n147\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.060\nThe other side of culture is\nwhat the employer looks for,\n\n148\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.920\nI'm gonna have a great winning culture for\nmy employees they attracts top talent, but\n\n149\n00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.570\nonce they get there, I need a culture\nof accountability, of proactivity,\n\n150\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.920\nof innovation, where people are always\ntrying to make the company better.\n\n151\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.210\nI can summarize this in two words.\n\n152\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.744\nI hear from Presidents and CEOs and\nowners of companies everywhere,\n\n153\n00:07:43.744 --> 00:07:46.879\nI want employees with\nan ownership mentality.\n\n154\n00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.365\nI want employees to treat\nthe business as if it were their own,\n\n155\n00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:54.800\nthat look at every $1 that comes in and\nsays how can we increase market share?\n\n156\n00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.130\nIncrease profitability, decrease waste,\nincrease customer satisfaction.\n\n157\n00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.970\nHow can we constantly make\nthis place better and better?\n\n158\n00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.400\nSo when you put those two pieces together,\na winning culture that attracts top talent\n\n159\n00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.930\nand also delivers the business results\nwhere people have an ownership mentality.\n\n160\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.260\nAnother way I like to say this is,\nthey're entrepreneurs.\n\n161\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.300\nThey're entrepreneurial\ninside of the company.\n\n162\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.430\nThey basically run their job like\nit's their own little business.\n\n163\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.290\nAnd they wanna make that business\nsuper successful and excellent and\n\n164\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.540\nmove the company forward.\n\n165\n00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.420\nWhen you have those two elements, and\nit's a tough balancing act sometimes.\n\n166\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.780\nWhen you put those two together,\nyou create the kind of culture\n\n167\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.470\nthat allows an organization\nto be extremely successful.\n\n168\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.230\nThe next element of the formula is ECF,\nwhich stands for extreme customer focus.\n\n169\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.850\nAnd I'm very careful about\nthe words I use, and\n\n170\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.450\nextreme is the word I wanna use here.\n\n171\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:52.410\nThis is one of the areas that I see a lot\nof companies not doing well enough in.\n\n172\n00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.970\nAnd it's an extremely important area,\n\n173\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.060\nwhich is getting really\nclose to your customer.\n\n174\n00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.270\nIf you understand your customer\nbetter than your competition,\n\n175\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.310\nyou understand their needs, their wants,\ntheir fears, their wishes, their desires.\n\n176\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.930\nIf you're really close to and\nyou're listening to them and\n\n177\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.790\nyou understand them deeply,\nthat's another huge competitive advantage.\n\n178\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:17.070\nSo it's essential to build this idea of\nextreme customer focus into your culture.\n\n179\n00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.090\nTo make sure that every employee clearly\nunderstands that the customer pays all\n\n180\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.350\nthe bills, and the closer you are to the\ncustomer, the better you understand them,\n\n181\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.190\nthe better chance you have of making\nthem loyal, satisfied, and engaged.\n\n182\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.011\nAnd there's an interesting thing\nhere to put back to culture is,\n\n183\n00:09:33.011 --> 00:09:36.414\nthe number one factor in highly engaged,\nsatisfied, and\n\n184\n00:09:36.414 --> 00:09:40.820\nloyal customers is engaged,\nsatisfied, and loyal employees.\n\n185\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.863\nAnd another phrase that I love is,\njust remember this,\n\n186\n00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:48.098\nthe customer's experience will never\nexceed the employee's experience.\n\n187\n00:09:48.098 --> 00:09:50.513\nSo there's the first three elements,\n\n188\n00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:54.140\ntalent plus culture plus\nextreme customer focus.\n\n189\n00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.330\nNow you're gonna take those and\nmultiply them by disciplined execution.\n\n190\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.520\nVery similar to extreme customer focus,\nor what I call owning the voice of\n\n191\n00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.620\nthe customer, as one of the big challenges\nthat a lot companies don't do well.\n\n192\n00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.700\nDisciplined execution or accountability\nis the single biggest challenge\n\n193\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.120\nI see right now in\norganizations around the world.\n\n194\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.080\nLots of companies have great products,\nthey understand their customer,\n\n195\n00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.750\nthey have a good strategy,\nthey know how to differentiate themselves.\n\n196\n00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.270\nBut they don't execute on that plan, and\n\n197\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.770\nbecause of that, all those great things\nthey have are completely useless.\n\n198\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.750\nSo disciplined execution is about being\nvery focused, having key result areas,\n\n199\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.700\nhaving metrics, having goals.\n\n200\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.980\nHaving timelines, having due dates, and\n\n201\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.770\nstaying on them all the time,\nbuilding them into the agenda.\n\n202\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.570\nTalk about them all the time.\n\n203\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.390\nAnd again, we keep coming back to culture.\n\n204\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.302\nHere's creating a culture of\naccountability, disciplined execution,\n\n205\n00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:54.800\nwhere we're constantly talking\nabout what do we need to achieve,\n\n206\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.840\nwhen do we need to achieve it by,\nwhat a success look like.\n\n207\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.762\nThat's constantly on the front\nof everybody's mind,\n\n208\n00:11:00.762 --> 00:11:04.090\ndriving a culture of execution and\naccountability.\n\n209\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.350\nNow to help you here, I wanna talk\nquickly about what does it take to create\n\n210\n00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.432\na culture of accountability.\n\n211\n00:11:08.432 --> 00:11:12.110\nAnd there's five things there,\nnumber one is, if\n\n212\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.790\nI'm gonna hold someone accountable for a\nmajor project, and this isn't small stuff.\n\n213\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:19.090\nI'm talking about mission critical things\nthat gotta get done that are gonna\n\n214\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.830\nimpact the future of the business.\n\n215\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.210\nIf I'm gonna hold somebody accountable for\nsomething like that,\n\n216\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.155\nI have to do three things for them.\n\n217\n00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:28.460\nNumber one is 100% clarity.\n\n218\n00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.390\nI need to sit down with that person\nthat I'm gonna hold accountable and\n\n219\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.662\nbe very clear and very specific about\nexactly what I want them to do.\n\n220\n00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:41.330\nI've gotta give them, again, key result\nareas, timelines, budgets, key metrics.\n\n221\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.100\nAnd the key idea around metrics here and\n\n222\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.460\nkey result areas is binary,\nit's yes or it's no.\n\n223\n00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.210\nIt's black or it's white,\nyou gotta do, you didn't, no guessing.\n\n224\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.610\nAnother big phrase that I use all\nthe time is ambiguity breeds mediocrity.\n\n225\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.470\nIf you're gonna have\na culture of accountability,\n\n226\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.630\nyou've gotta be really clear and get 100%\nclarity on what success looks like and\n\n227\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.610\nexactly what you're gonna hold\nthat person accountable for.\n\n228\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.440\nIn addition to that, you've also\ngotta give them all the authority and\n\n229\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.740\nresources they need to\ncarry out the project.\n\n230\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.210\nThere's nothing more frustrating\nthan giving a talented person\n\n231\n00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.300\nan important project that you're gonna\nhold them 100% accountable for, and\n\n232\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.160\nyou don't give them enough resources or\nauthority.\n\n233\n00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.410\nIt'll drive them crazy, and they'll quit.\n\n234\n00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:32.570\nSo step one, 100% clarity plus\nappropriate authority and resources.\n\n235\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.550\nStep number two, big one, 100% agreement.\n\n236\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.590\nWhich means the person that you just were\nvery clear about what you're gonna hold\n\n237\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:44.160\nthem accountable for, looks you back in\nthe eyes and says, I understand the goals.\n\n238\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.860\nI understand what success looks like,\nI understand the timeline, the due dates.\n\n239\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.120\nI understand the budget,\nyou've given me enough authority.\n\n240\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.360\nYou've given me all the resources I need.\n\n241\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.873\nI believe it is a reasonable goal.\n\n242\n00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:59.460\nI accept 100% accountability.\n\n243\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.090\nUntil you have those two things,\nyou do not have accountability.\n\n244\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.990\nHere's an interesting little factoid.\n\n245\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.490\nOver the past four years or\nso, I've asked probably 30 or\n\n246\n00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.990\n40,000 business owners,\nmanagers, presidents,\n\n247\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.500\nCEOs, on a scale of one to ten,\nwith ten being world class.\n\n248\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.034\nHow many of you would say you're a solid\nnine or ten on always getting 100%\n\n249\n00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:28.350\nclarity plus appropriate authority and\nresources and 100% agreement?\n\n250\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.380\nHow many hands have gone up?\n\n251\n00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:35.100\nNo one has ever raised their hand.\n\n252\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.810\nI had one guy in Australia raise his hand.\n\n253\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.490\nI went, you're lying.\n\n254\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.460\nHe went, you're right,\nhe put his hand back down.\n\n255\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.820\nAnd I had a young lady in\nFlorida raise her hand.\n\n256\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.980\nAnd I said, are you sure?\n\n257\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.500\nAnd she said, what was the question again?\n\n258\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.970\nMy manager told me to raise my hand.\n\n259\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.810\nNow that I've explained those first\ntwo steps, doesn't it just make sense\n\n260\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.070\nthat if you don't have 100% of clarity,\nappropriate authority and resources,\n\n261\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.990\nand 100% agreement, it's impossible\nto hold someone accountable?\n\n262\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.720\nThat should be obvious now,\nyet, nobody does it.\n\n263\n00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.710\nStep number three is track and post.\n\n264\n00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.550\nThe two critical elements around track and\npost are,\n\n265\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.460\nyou gotta make it super easy to understand\nwhere people are being tracked.\n\n266\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.814\nYou don't wanna track them on 100 things,\nyou just wanna track them on a couple of\n\n267\n00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:19.615\nkey deliverables, key goals,\nthat each person is accountable for.\n\n268\n00:14:19.615 --> 00:14:23.283\nAnd you've gotta track it in a way that's\nso easy to understand, that I could\n\n269\n00:14:23.283 --> 00:14:27.080\nlook at it, and in three seconds, I know\nexactly where I stand against my goal.\n\n270\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.540\nIt's green, yellow, or red.\n\n271\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.450\nI'm either doing great,\ncaution, or I'm not doing well.\n\n272\n00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.510\nThere's no guessing here,\nI can look at it immediately now.\n\n273\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.120\nHow do I stand against my goal?\n\n274\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.360\nThe other important element, and\n\n275\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.390\nthis is one where I often get pushed back\nis, you gotta make it highly visible,\n\n276\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.420\nwhere everybody in the company can\nsee everybody else's major goals.\n\n277\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.780\nCut down all the trees, no place to hide.\n\n278\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.340\nAnd I don't care whether you use\na dashboard, or a whiteboard, or\n\n279\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.950\na poster, or I've seen some of my\nclients put it on a TV screen, and\n\n280\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.238\nall that's up there and\nit rolls all day long.\n\n281\n00:14:58.238 --> 00:15:02.800\nBut you've gotta make it super easy\nto understand and highly visible so\n\n282\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.720\neverybody clearly knows where everybody\nelse stands against their goals.\n\n283\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.275\nNow here's what happens when you do that.\n\n284\n00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:11.760\nAbout 10% of your people love it,\n[LAUGH] why?\n\n285\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.480\nThey're your high performers, they're your\nstuds, they're always gonna be green,\n\n286\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.820\ngreen, green, green,\nyou walk by hey, look, I'm all green.\n\n287\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.275\nThat's the people that love tracking\nbecause it makes them look good.\n\n288\n00:15:23.275 --> 00:15:28.680\nA big portion in the middle,\n70%, 80% will freak out.\n\n289\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.588\nThey'll look like a deer\nin the headlights, like.\n\n290\n00:15:30.588 --> 00:15:34.680\nThey're gonna track everything I do and\npost it.\n\n291\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.500\nAll my major goals are gonna be tracked,\nand\n\n292\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.310\neverybody will know how\nI stand against them.\n\n293\n00:15:39.588 --> 00:15:40.710\nThat scares me.\n\n294\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:45.170\nAnd the reason is because for\nmost people, tracking equals punishment.\n\n295\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.970\nWe'll come back to that in a minute.\n\n296\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.135\nIn the third group, maybe 10,\n15%, hopefully 10 or 5.\n\n297\n00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:54.109\nWhen you tell them you're gonna do this,\nwe're gonna assign you goals, and\n\n298\n00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:56.091\nwe're gonna track them and\npost them everywhere.\n\n299\n00:15:56.091 --> 00:15:58.646\nThey go, no, you can't do that,\nit's not fair.\n\n300\n00:15:58.646 --> 00:16:01.099\nAnd they fall on the ground like\na two year old with a wet diaper and\n\n301\n00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:02.430\nstart crying and falling around.\n\n302\n00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.750\nAnd what you do is you look down at them,\n\n303\n00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.970\nyou go it's been a pleasure\nworking with you.\n\n304\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.770\nAnd then you make them\navailable to industry.\n\n305\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.310\nThe reason is they've just told you I'm\nmediocre and everybody's gonna know it.\n\n306\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.150\nWhen you put my goals up there, I'm gonna\nconsistently be yellow, red, yellow, red,\n\n307\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.380\nyellow, red.\n\n308\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.210\nAnd everyone will know it and\nI will have to leave or you will fire me.\n\n309\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.630\nSo, again let's come back to\nthat big group in the middle and\n\n310\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.430\nstep number four then is because\npeople are freaked out that they think\n\n311\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.960\ntracking equals punishment,\nI'm tracking you so I can yell at you.\n\n312\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.650\nI'm tracking at you so I can withhold\nbonus, you don't get a promotion or\n\n313\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.700\nwhatever it might be, but\ntracking equals punishment.\n\n314\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.140\nStep number four is coach,\nmentor, train and support.\n\n315\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.800\nIn other words, I'm not gonna yell at\nyou when you go from green to yellow,\n\n316\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.040\nI'm gonna help you.\n\n317\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.400\nPeople are gonna parachute in from the sky\nto do everything they can to assist you,\n\n318\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.730\nto help you, to get you back on green.\n\n319\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.600\nSo, tracking doesn't equal punishment,\ntracking equals help.\n\n320\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.450\nAnd it will take those people\na little while to realize it, but\n\n321\n00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.790\nonce they realize, every time I\nslip to yellow, I get support,\n\n322\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.970\nI get training, I get a mentor,\nI get a coach, I get more resources,\n\n323\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.920\npeople help me get back into green, it's\ncrazy they're gonna want more tracking.\n\n324\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.040\nAnd then the last element number five,\nis reward success lavishly and\n\n325\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.700\ndeal decisively with mediocrity.\n\n326\n00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.060\nAnd when I say lavishly,\nI'm not talking about running out and\n\n327\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.240\nthrowing hundred dollar bills everywhere,\nemployee of the month,\n\n328\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.640\ndinner out with her significant other,\nsome sort of a small gift or a prize.\n\n329\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.260\nAnd maybe money, maybe a bonus,\nmaybe a promotion.\n\n330\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.180\nBut you want to reinforce positive\nbehavior by letting people\n\n331\n00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.750\nknow that when they make a commitment\nthey take on accountability and\n\n332\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.410\nthey deliver on their promise, that\nthat's exactly what you want from them.\n\n333\n00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.450\nSo you wanna make them a model to the rest\nof the company of accountability.\n\n334\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.470\nOn the other hand, the folks that\nconsistently don't do it, and\n\n335\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.610\nyou're coaching them,\nyou're training them, you're supporting,\n\n336\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.040\nyou're doing everything you can to help\nthem and everybody else sees that.\n\n337\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.700\nThey see you make the effort\nto help them be successful and\n\n338\n00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.370\nthey just keep staying in yellow and\nred and red and red.\n\n339\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.890\nWhen you let them go,\neverybody understands why.\n\n340\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.480\nThey see that you helped them,\nthey see that you supported them,\n\n341\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.110\nthey see that you tried really hard,\nand that they didn't make it.\n\n342\n00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.320\nIt's a really important thing to\nremember this, when you let someone go,\n\n343\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.140\nterminate someone, everybody else in\nthe company looks to see how you did it.\n\n344\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.670\nDid you treat them fairly?\n\n345\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.230\nDid they know it was coming?\n\n346\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.420\nDid you give them help?\n\n347\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.560\nDid you give them corrective action?\n\n348\n00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.740\nIf you do all that through Coach Better\nTraining Support people will think it's\n\n349\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.470\nvery fair.\n\n350\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.990\nThey'll see that you\ntried hard to help them.\n\n351\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.700\nHowever though,\nif all of a sudden somebody looks up and\n\n352\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.600\nlike hey, where's Bob?\n\n353\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.790\nAnd you go, he got vaporized.\n\n354\n00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.960\nWhat do you mean he got vaporized?\n\n355\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.880\nHe was here a minute ago,\nhe's gone, they just terminated him.\n\n356\n00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.820\nAnd the other person say, but\n\n357\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.770\nI thought Bob got all exceeds last\nreport when they did his review.\n\n358\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.079\nWasn't he reviewed at the highest level?\n\n359\n00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:02.775\nWell if they fired Bob and\nhe was all exceeds and I'm all exceeds and\n\n360\n00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:07.131\nthere was no reason they fired Bob, or\nat least there's nothing I know about,\n\n361\n00:19:07.131 --> 00:19:09.049\nwhat happens is they get fearful.\n\n362\n00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:11.069\nThey think that I could be next,\neven though I'm doing a good job,\n\n363\n00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:11.876\nno one's said anything.\n\n364\n00:19:11.876 --> 00:19:14.470\nNo one said anything to Bob,\nnow Bob's gone.\n\n365\n00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.500\nAnd people when they're fearful,\ndon't do great work.\n\n366\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.060\nThey put their head down, they're scared.\n\n367\n00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.230\nThey do the least amount of work they\ncan cuz they don't wanna get in trouble.\n\n368\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.220\nAnd they're constantly talking and\n\n369\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.580\nworrying and\ngetting everybody else stressed out.\n\n370\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.550\nSo, the coach, mentor, train, and\nsupport allows you to show everyone else\n\n371\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.210\nwe're fair here, we treated them\nwith respect, we supported them, but\n\n372\n00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.750\nthey just couldn't make the grade.\n\n373\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.305\nThose are the five things it takes to\ncreate a culture of accountability,\n\n374\n00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:43.812\n100% clarity plus appropriate\nauthority and resources,\n\n375\n00:19:43.812 --> 00:19:49.410\n100% agreement, track and post,\ncoach, mentor, train, support,\n\n376\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:55.520\nreward success lavishly, deal immediately\nand directly with mediocrity.\n\n377\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.660\nSo, there you have it, my formula for\nbusiness excellence, talent, plus culture,\n\n378\n00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.380\nplus extreme customer focus,\nmultiplied by disciplined execution.\n\n379\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.832\nThese aren't the only four things you need\nto run a great business, but, what I will\n\n380\n00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:12.115\ntell you is, they're four foundational\nfundamental things you got to do well.\n\n381\n00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:14.876\nOn a scale of one to ten\nyou should be solid nine or\n\n382\n00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:17.100\nten on all four of these things.\n\n383\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.608\nAnd I can say that with extreme\nconfidence because I've looked hundreds,\n\n384\n00:20:20.608 --> 00:20:21.895\nof hundreds of companies.\n\n385\n00:20:21.895 --> 00:20:24.124\nI've read thousands of books and\n\n386\n00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:28.898\nwhen you look at those there's a very\nclear pattern that companies that\n\n387\n00:20:28.898 --> 00:20:33.688\nare successful over the long term do\nthese four things exceeding well.\n\n388\n00:20:33.688 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.949\nIn this session I wanna share with\nyou a really big business idea.\n\n2\n00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:09.192\nMany times when I'm teaching my courses,\n\n3\n00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:12.270\nfolks say this was the most\nimportant thing they learned.\n\n4\n00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.230\nIt's called the moments of truth.\n\n5\n00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.760\nAnd it was basically developed by\na gentleman years ago named Jan Collison.\n\n6\n00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.175\nHe was the CEO of Scandinavian Airway.\n\n7\n00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:23.010\nHe'd just come in to take it over.\n\n8\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930\nAnd the airway was in some pretty\nserious financial trouble as many are.\n\n9\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.533\nAnd he looked at it and said if we're\ngoing to rebuild this company why don't we\n\n10\n00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.180\ndo it with the very best customers.\n\n11\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.582\nI mean if we're going to chase a new\nmarket let's go to the market where\n\n12\n00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:40.980\nthe best customers are, the ones that\nevery airline would love to have.\n\n13\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.190\nIn the airline industry,\nthat's the frequent business traveler,\n\n14\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.135\n[LAUGH] somebody like me,\nwho's on the road 200 days a year.\n\n15\n00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.062\nThey get in and out quick, they usually\ndon't have much luggage, they pay whatever\n\n16\n00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:54.580\nfee they have to for the ticket,\ncuz they gotta be in the next place.\n\n17\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.844\nThey're the ones that, if you wanted them\nthat would be the client you go after\n\n18\n00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:59.485\ncuz they come back over and over again.\n\n19\n00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:01.750\nThey spend lots of money and\nthey're easy to deal with.\n\n20\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.350\nWe all want clients like that.\n\n21\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.450\nSo what he did is he look at and said\nlooks like all the touch points we have\n\n22\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.170\nwith someone that flies on our airline.\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.090\nFrom when they get on the website or\nmake a phone call and initiate.\n\n24\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.300\nTrying to get a ticket all\nthe way to when they get home,\n\n25\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.720\nhopefully with their luggage, and\nhopefully having a great experience.\n\n26\n00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.760\nThen he said,\nout of all those touch points,\n\n27\n00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.840\nlet's figure out the three,\nfour, five moments of truth.\n\n28\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.561\nThe stuff we have to do flawlessly\nif we're gonna take that person and\n\n29\n00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.050\nturn them into a customer evangelist.\n\n30\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.770\nSomebody who loves our airlines,\nwill only fly with us.\n\n31\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.720\nComes back over and over again.\n\n32\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.560\nTells all their friends to fly with us.\n\n33\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.310\nTells all their business\nassociates to fly with us.\n\n34\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.290\nWe wanna make sure that out\nof all the touch points,\n\n35\n00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.700\nwe figure out what those key moments of\ntruth are, and then we do them flawlessly.\n\n36\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.780\nNow let me give you an example\nthat'll bring this home,\n\n37\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.490\nand it's the same example I use every\ntime I teach this, restaurants.\n\n38\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.435\nI did the research,\nsat down one day and I counted it,\n\n39\n00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.429\nand if you go out to dinner with your\nfamily or by yourself or with friends.\n\n40\n00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.070\nThere is about a 170 touch points\nin a normal door restaurant.\n\n41\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.960\nIs it easy to find the place?\n\n42\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.580\nIs easy to get in and\nout of the drive way?\n\n43\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.840\nIs there good signage?\n\n44\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.070\nIs the parking lot clean?\n\n45\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.930\nIf it's at night, Is it well lite?\n\n46\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.530\nIs the shrubbery attractive?\n\n47\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.790\nThe landscaping?\n\n48\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.990\nIs the temperature right?\n\n49\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.060\nIs the music too loud or too soft?\n\n50\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.390\nDo they greet you when\nyou come in the door?\n\n51\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.710\nAre the seats comfortable?\n\n52\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.070\nAll of these things are touch points.\n\n53\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.240\nBut in pretty much every restaurant\non the face of the earth,\n\n54\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.330\nthere's only really four moments of truth.\n\n55\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.160\nFour things they have to nail,\njust absolutely do perfectly.\n\n56\n00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.720\nIf you are gonna become\na patron of that restaurant.\n\n57\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.100\nLove it, come back all the time,\nbring your friends,\n\n58\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.280\nbring your family,\ntell everybody about it.\n\n59\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.070\nJust four things they have\nto do exceedingly well,\n\n60\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.260\nthe four moments of truth for\na restaurant.\n\n61\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.510\nHere they are, and\nI've asked hundreds of audiences this and\n\n62\n00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.070\nthey almost always nail it immediately.\n\n63\n00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.100\nGood quality food, reasonable prices,\ngood service, cleanliness.\n\n64\n00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.390\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.890\nI have people say ambiance and everything.\n\n66\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.420\nThose are touch points.\n\n67\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.140\nBut if you're gonna go to\na restaurant over and over again,\n\n68\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.650\nyou gotta get really good food at\na reasonable price with great service, and\n\n69\n00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.320\nthe place has to be immaculately clean.\n\n70\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.260\nNow let me give you a scenario, let's say\nwe all go out to dinner together, you,\n\n71\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.504\nme, some friends.\n\n72\n00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:32.210\nAnd I happen to like sushi so\nI use sushi restaurants as an example.\n\n73\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.310\nAnd we get there and it's super easy\nto get at, it's right in the corner,\n\n74\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.670\neasy to find, big sign, big parking spots.\n\n75\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.190\nWe go in the evening, it's well lit.\n\n76\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.266\nWe come up and all the shrubbery and\nlandscaping is gorgeous,\n\n77\n00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.517\nthey've got a koi pond.\n\n78\n00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:45.570\nYou know, it's just stunning.\n\n79\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.831\nWe walk in,\nunbelievably polite when we get there.\n\n80\n00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:52.440\nBeautiful ambiance,\nnice artwork on the walls and everything.\n\n81\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.380\nThey seat us, the menu comes.\n\n82\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.195\nWe look at it and the prices,\nI mean, they're really reasonable.\n\n83\n00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.998\nAnd, you know, while we're sitting\nthere they bring us our drinks,\n\n84\n00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:02.623\nthey keep our sakai hot, our beer cold.\n\n85\n00:04:02.623 --> 00:04:04.717\nI mean the service is amazing.\n\n86\n00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:05.795\nThe food comes out.\n\n87\n00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:08.020\nIt's the best sushi you've ever had.\n\n88\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.280\nIt's incredibly fresh,\nit's beautifully prepared, it's stunning.\n\n89\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610\nI mean, you're having an amazing dinner.\n\n90\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.170\nAnd then you excuse yourself to get up and\ngo use the restroom, and\n\n91\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.610\nyou walk in there, and it looks like\nno one has cleaned it in four years.\n\n92\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.247\nIt's disgusting, it smells bad,\nthere's stuff all over the floor,\n\n93\n00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:25.377\nthere's cockroaches crawling around.\n\n94\n00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:28.522\nAnd as you walk out of the bathroom,\nyou're going God, it was horrible,\n\n95\n00:04:28.522 --> 00:04:29.762\nyou'd see a rat run across.\n\n96\n00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:32.688\nAre you ever,\never going to that restaurant again?\n\n97\n00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:35.205\nNo, but here's the key point.\n\n98\n00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:40.529\nThey got 169 out of 170 touch points,\nperfectly, they nailed three\n\n99\n00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.853\nof the four moments truth flawlessly but\nthey missed one moment of truth and\n\n100\n00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:49.930\nbecause of that they have now\nlost the customer forever.\n\n101\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.070\nHere's the really important point,\n\n102\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.740\nyou have moments of truth\nin your business too.\n\n103\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.580\nThree, four,\nfive maybe six things you've gotta do.\n\n104\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.090\nAnd I use the word over and\nover again, flawlessly.\n\n105\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.520\nAbsolutely perfect if you want to\nturn your customers into raving fans.\n\n106\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.030\nPeople who drive lots of new business\nto you, spend lots of money with you.\n\n107\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.520\nLove being with their,\nbeing there with you.\n\n108\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.033\nAnd again, there's only a few.\n\n109\n00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:15.925\nIt's not 100.\n\n110\n00:05:15.925 --> 00:05:20.010\nThere's a handful of things\nthat you have to do flawlessly.\n\n111\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.978\nSo, the first question you need to think\nabout is, what are your moments of truth?\n\n112\n00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.860\nWhat are the things you\nhave to do perfectly?\n\n113\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.370\nGive you another example real quick,\n\n114\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.370\nit's like making a cake,\nif the cake batter taste disgusting,\n\n115\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.420\nit doesn't matter how beautiful\nthe icing is, nobody wants a bite.\n\n116\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.330\nIf the cake batter is heavenly,\n\n117\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.720\njust delicious, you could glop icing\nall over it, people still want a piece.\n\n118\n00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.210\nBut, if you make a beautiful\ncake that tastes delicious and\n\n119\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.870\nput magnificent icing on it,\neverybody wants a piece.\n\n120\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.230\nThe moments of truth are the cake batter.\n\n121\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.430\nAll of the other stuff is touch points.\n\n122\n00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.820\nBut if you don't get the cake\nbatter right, nothing else matters.\n\n123\n00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.386\nCouple of other things to think\nabout with moments of truth.\n\n124\n00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:09.923\nNumber one, the only person you can truly\ntell you what the moments truth are,\n\n125\n00:06:09.923 --> 00:06:11.660\nare the customers.\n\n126\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.132\nSo ask them, what are the three or\n\n127\n00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:19.150\nfour most important things we need\nto do to keep you highly satisfied?\n\n128\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.470\nAnd I will challenge you that if you go\nout and ask a bunch of your customers, or\n\n129\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.330\nyour very best customers,\nthey're gonna come back and\n\n130\n00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.150\ntell you the same handful of things,\nall of them are, over and over again.\n\n131\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.300\nAnd you will get a very clear pattern,\n\n132\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.700\nwhich has just told you what your\nunique selling proposition is.\n\n133\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.150\nThat's basically your brand if several\nof your customers or a bunch of your\n\n134\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.150\ncustomers, your best customers,\nall tell you the same four things\n\n135\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.460\nthen those are the four things that other\npeople would come to your business for.\n\n136\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.150\nThat brings me to the second point which\nis and I'll stop here and tell you this,\n\n137\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.137\nI hate process.\n\n138\n00:06:54.137 --> 00:06:57.405\nI'm not a process guy,\nI don't like checklists and\n\n139\n00:06:57.405 --> 00:07:01.045\nstandard operating procedures and\nExcel spreadsheets,\n\n140\n00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:05.367\nbut I know that if you want repeatable\nsuccess you must have process.\n\n141\n00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:09.664\nAnd if there's any place in your\nbusiness you want process it's around\n\n142\n00:07:09.664 --> 00:07:11.035\nthe moments of truth.\n\n143\n00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:14.840\nThose are the things you want to create\nstandard operating procedures on.\n\n144\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.590\nYou want to track them, you want to have\nmetrics, you want to do lots of training.\n\n145\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.070\nYou need to make sure that everybody in\nyour company understands what the moments\n\n146\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.660\nof truth are and\nhow to deliver them superbly, flawlessly,\n\n147\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.440\nevery single time, for\nevery single customer.\n\n148\n00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.230\nLast but not least,\nhere's another really big idea.\n\n149\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.270\nYou have internal moments of truth.\n\n150\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.070\nThings inside of your business,\nthat if you don't deliver for\n\n151\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.830\neach other, it is impossible to deliver\nthe moment's truth for that customer.\n\n152\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.730\nSo there's two things you\nreally need to take a look at.\n\n153\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.391\nWhat are our three, four, five,\nsix moments of truth to our external\n\n154\n00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:53.113\ncustomers, that we have
