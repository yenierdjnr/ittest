videos\ncoming your way here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.310\nWe're gonna be covering\na product known as Metasploit.\n\n5\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.490\nAnd Sean, tell us about Metasploit and\nwhy I'd wanna watch this.\n\n6\n00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.870\nWhat can I do with Metasploit?\n\n7\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.210\n>> Metasploit, I guess the question is,\nas far as pen testing's concerned,\n\n8\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.650\nwhat can't you do?\n\n9\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.400\nBecause Metasploit is commonly\nreferred to as a tool, but\n\n10\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.670\nit's really a suite of tools,\nit's not just one thing.\n\n11\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.650\nIt's open source so people can add stuff\nto it, they can extend it out pretty far.\n\n12\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.260\nAnd it can do just\na tremendous amount of things.\n\n13\n00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.470\nIn fact,\nif you really look at the tool itself or\n\n14\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.820\nthe suite of tools itself,\nyou can pretty much go through\n\n15\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.960\nthe whole penetration testing\nprocess just with Metasploit.\n\n16\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.830\nSo there's just that much there.\n\n17\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.580\nSo it's really something\nthat you gotta get in and\n\n18\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.650\nreally get your hands dirty to\nunderstand what's going on there.\n\n19\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.800\nSo it's incredibly powerful and very\nuseful and even if you decide not to use\n\n20\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.300\nit on its own and you use it as part of\nyour other pen testing tools and the rest\n\n21\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.990\nof your pen testing process, you're still\ngonna get a lot of mileage out of it.\n\n22\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.120\nThis will add a whole extra level\nto your pen testing capability.\n\n23\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.530\n>> And you said it was open source so\n\n24\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.860\nit's freely accessible,\nruns on different platforms I'm assuming?\n\n25\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.800\n>> Yes, it runs on Linux and\n\n26\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.310\nWindows, and I believe, yeah,\nUnix, you can get it for that too.\n\n27\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.023\nIt's close enough, I guess, right?\n\n28\n00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:37.313\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can get it on there.\n\n29\n00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:42.383\nSo we're gonna be focusing on using\nit on Linux, but like I said,\n\n30\n00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:47.020\nyou can get it on Windows and\ndo your stuff over there.\n\n31\n00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.180\nIronically enough is if you go ahead and\ninstall it on Windows,\n\n32\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.340\nyou're pretty much gonna get\nthe same interface over there.\n\n33\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.310\nYou get the command line.\n\n34\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.970\nLine.\nSo yeah, you\n\n35\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.720\ncould move the command line here or\nyou can move it here.\n\n36\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.456\nBut you're getting a command line and\nyou'll like it.\n\n37\n00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:03.690\n>> [LAUGH] There's no fancy GUI for us to\nclick through or anything like that, huh?\n\n38\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.545\n>> Very, very little on that.\n\n39\n00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.585\nAnd you'll get pretty much everything\nright throughout the command line, so\n\n40\n00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:14.535\nthere are some GUI based things in there\nthat are either part of the product or\n\n41\n00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.585\nhas been added on by a third party.\n\n42\n00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:21.285\nWhat you're gonna be looking at command\nline for the most part and we're\n\n43\n00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:25.375\njust gonna go ahead and keep things simple\nand use it right inside of Kali Linux.\n\n44\n00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:29.620\nYou know we did a whole set\nof shows on Kali Linux so\n\n45\n00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.900\nif you're going through the whole process\nhere, you can watch the Kali Linux one and\n\n46\n00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.610\nget familiar with that and then jump right\nover into this and kind of see how this\n\n47\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.630\nfits in with that product and\nthe stuff we covered over there.\n\n48\n00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.870\n>> And this is something I could use\nif I was a penetration tester and\n\n49\n00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.680\nI was doing it for\nmoney or for a business.\n\n50\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.170\nThis is a product I could use.\n\n51\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.360\nAlso if I was just a network admin or\npart of the security team in a company.\n\n52\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.330\nSomething I could use\nto test my own stuff or\n\n53\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.200\nmake sure everything was on the up and up?\n\n54\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.420\n>> Yes, it's very well positioned as\nsomething that a security administrator or\n\n55\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.204\nsomebody along those lines would use.\n\n56\n00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:05.370\nIt could be used by developers, it could\nbe used by a number of different people.\n\n57\n00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.440\nNetwork admins, yeah,\n\n58\n00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.439\nI could see some tools in there that they\nmight get some mileage out of as well.\n\n59\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.120\nI'm not sure how far they'd be able\nto take it there, but who knows?\n\n60\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.620\nNetwork admins can always find, you give\nthem something like this, they're like,\n\n61\n00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.310\nI can use it.\n\n62\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.290\nSo who knows?\n\n63\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.740\nThey'll probably find some\nway to use it over there.\n\n64\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.270\n>> Good deal.\n\n65\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.890\nAll right, well we've got a bunch of\nexciting episodes coming your way.\n\n66\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.186\nDealing with Metasploit, so everybody\nstay tuned, sit back, relax, and enjoy.\n\n67\n00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:36.199\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.130\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.637\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:17.601\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:18.194\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:19.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.210\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.250\nExcited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.740\nWe were just getting started\nin our Metasploit videos.\n\n11\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.950\nWe're gonna be taking a look at\na program called Metasploit.\n\n12\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.210\nSomething we can use to do penetration\ntests amongst other things.\n\n13\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.070\nSo Sean, before we dive into all the cool\nstuff that we can do with it, let's talk\n\n14\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.510\na little bit about what it is and why\nwe would wanna use good old Metasploit.\n\n15\n00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.270\n>> Yeah,\nthat's the million dollar question-\n\n16\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.862\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.235\n>> I think when people really look at\n\n18\n00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.010\nMetasploit is why do I even care?\n\n19\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.690\nWhy this tool?\n\n20\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.389\nBecause you see it mentioned in so\n\n21\n00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:56.586\nmany different contexts especially\nthroughout the penetration testing world.\n\n22\n00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.834\nYou hear Metasploit this and\nMetasploit that, but it seems to be it's\n\n23\n00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:05.370\nmentioned a lot, some people have\na little bit of knowledge here or there,\n\n24\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.960\nand then there's very few people who\nhave really gone in and used it.\n\n25\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.200\nSo it's one of those things you kind\nof really got to discuss what it is.\n\n26\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.174\nSo Metasploit yes,\nit is indeed a penetration testing tool.\n\n27\n00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:21.273\nThat's one of the functions that it plays.\n\n28\n00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.434\nIt's got a tremendous sweep and\n\n29\n00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:28.877\npretty broad capability across the board\nas far as penetration testing tools and\n\n30\n00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:34.780\nit even integrates with a lot of the tools\nthat you have already seen in other areas.\n\n31\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.311\nSo that's actually kinda good\nnews because not only are you\n\n32\n00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.135\ngoing to be able to use\nthe stuff in Metasploit,\n\n33\n00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:45.726\nyou can also access those previously\nused tools to get their capabilities and\n\n34\n00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:50.129\neven integrate their capabilities in\nwith what Metasploit itself does.\n\n35\n00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:55.216\nOne that comes to mind for\nexample, is Nmap.\n\n36\n00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:59.810\nNmap does integrate directly\nwith Metasploit, and\n\n37\n00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.110\nit can do some pretty cool things.\n\n38\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.360\nIf you didnt think Nmap was in a nerdy\nway I guess cool enough as it is,\n\n39\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470\nit's got another level of stuff it can\ndo when you put it in with Metasploit.\n\n40\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.370\nSo that's kind of a neat thing there.\n\n41\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.796\nSo it does have a lot of capabilities\nin the penetration testing area,\n\n42\n00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:22.671\nand it can go from the beginning of the\npenetration testing process all the way\n\n43\n00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.258\non through pretty much.\n\n44\n00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:28.042\nI would say pretty much the only thing\nit can't do it is really develop\n\n45\n00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:30.100\nyour reports for you.\n\n46\n00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.170\nWe saw in Kali itself\nwhen we did that show,\n\n47\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.510\nwe saw that Kali itself had tools for\ndoing reporting.\n\n48\n00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.665\nAnd we saw when we did our CDH show\nthat we had tools that we could get from\n\n49\n00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.721\ndifferent areas to do reporting.\n\n50\n00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:47.251\nMetasploit doesn't have that, but\nwith the data that Metasploit gets, if\n\n51\n00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:52.230\nyou're using it in Kali like we have well,\nyou've got the reporting tools there.\n\n52\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.490\nSo it doesn't really need to do that, so\n\n53\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.050\nyou've got everything you've need\nas far as penetration testing goes.\n\n54\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.500\nBut like I said, that's just one item\noff the list that you could use it for.\n\n55\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.333\nWhat we're looking at it for,\nbut just when you can use it for.\n\n56\n00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.876\n>> What other kind of\nthings might we use it for?\n\n57\n00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:08.095\n>> You can also use it.\n\n58\n00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:15.880\nIt's got a somewhat notorious reputation\non the forensic side of the house.\n\n59\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.830\nBecause if we go back to what we\ndid when we discussed forensics.\n\n60\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.272\nI want to thank [INAUDIBLE] forensics for\nus.\n\n61\n00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:25.479\nWe wanna make sure that we\npreserve the time and date and\n\n62\n00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.022\nstuff like that on files.\n\n63\n00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:29.934\nSo we know when they were accessed,\nwhen they were modified,\n\n64\n00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:32.140\nwhen they were created,\nall that good stuff.\n\n65\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.410\nWell, Metasploit actually\nhas tools in there and\n\n66\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.370\nthis is just one of the tools\nthat it has that can do this.\n\n67\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.100\nIt can actually go through and\ndestroy some of that forensic evidence.\n\n68\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.978\nSo if someone were to have access to this\nand know how to use this the right way,\n\n69\n00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:48.900\nthey could very easily run across\na whole batch of files and\n\n70\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.562\noverwrite all the time and date stamps\non it and just ruin your whole day.\n\n71\n00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:56.361\n[LAUGH] If you're going to be trying\nto collect that evidence to take to\n\n72\n00:03:56.361 --> 00:04:00.226\ncourt because that's an important\npart to know when it was created and\n\n73\n00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.060\nwhat those attributes are.\n\n74\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.280\nThey can just go ahead and overwrite it.\n\n75\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.190\nIt has that ability.\n\n76\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.770\nIt might be a little bit of\nsomething that you don't wanna do,\n\n77\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.430\nbut you should talk about it.\n\n78\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.903\nAt least you should know it's there.\n\n79\n00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:14.910\nA lot of people don't\nknow that that's there.\n\n80\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.200\nAnd who knows, you inadvertently give\nsomeone the ability to access to this cuz\n\n81\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.330\nit can be remote accessed.\n\n82\n00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.270\nSomeone who uses this,\nthey can very easily go through and\n\n83\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.700\nstart destroying stuff before you\neven realized what's happened.\n\n84\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.725\n>> Is there a legitimate purpose for that\nfunctionality other than anti forensics\n\n85\n00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.779\ntype thing or is that really what it's?\n\n86\n00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.218\n>> I'll say yeah,\njust to be nice about it.\n\n87\n00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:41.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Someone probably had a reason to do it.\n\n88\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.003\nI can't think of why, but someone probably\nhad a reason for it, so I'll be nice and\n\n89\n00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:46.625\noptimistic and say yeah, you do.\n\n90\n00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:47.810\n>> Right.\n\n91\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.392\n>> But is is definitely there and it is\nsomething that's documented that if you\n\n92\n00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:55.971\nwant to see that or use that for\nwhatever reason it is there,\n\n93\n00:04:55.971 --> 00:05:00.785\nit's very well documented out there on\nthe Internet and in forensics circles.\n\n94\n00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:04.545\n>> So this is just one of those tools that\nrides the fences like a lot of them do.\n\n95\n00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:06.724\nIt can be used for good,\nit can be used for\n\n96\n00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:07.536\nevil-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:08.493\n>> Depending on what side of the fence\n\n98\n00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:09.057\nyou're on I guess.\n\n99\n00:05:09.057 --> 00:05:14.292\n>> Yeah, it depends on what the intent\nof the user of it actually is.\n\n100\n00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:19.090\nOnce you learn all the stuff\nthat Metasploit can do for you.\n\n101\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.030\nAnd like I said,\nhas a pretty deep bench as far as tools.\n\n102\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.969\nAnd that's not including the stuff\nthat you can get third party and\n\n103\n00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.238\nstart popping in there,\nall these extra modules.\n\n104\n00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:30.660\nYou can just have so\nmuch at your disposal.\n\n105\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.909\nIt's just a question of what\nyou are gonna do with it?\n\n106\n00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.954\nAnd you're gonna see that as we go\nthrough all these segments on Metasploit,\n\n107\n00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:42.697\nyou'll see that there's just so\nmany different things that\n\n108\n00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:46.789\nyou can do to access hosts\nremotely to sweep hosts and\n\n109\n00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.970\nfind out what they are running and\nwhat they are.\n\n110\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.530\nAnd so you'd get them to call you and\nopen up shells, call you up and\n\n111\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.950\ngive you a shell so you can do stuff\nhere and access something out there.\n\n112\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.810\nIt's got a lot of just nice and pretty\npowerful capabilities but how you use it?\n\n113\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.701\nIt's really up to you.\n\n114\n00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.066\nWe're hoping that you use it for\ngood and not for evil, but who knows?\n\n115\n00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:13.006\n>> [LAUGH] Keep on the good side.\n\n116\n00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.921\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the dark side has cookies.\n\n117\n00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.324\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n118\n00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:21.279\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Metasploit then a tool that I can\n\n119\n00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.648\nuse for penetration testing was one of\nthe biggest purposes of it I guess.\n\n120\n00:06:25.648 --> 00:06:26.425\n>> Yeah.\n\n121\n00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:30.862\n>> And then anti forensics is another\npurpose that we can use it for that.\n\n122\n00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:32.702\nAnd you got in here like\nsoftware development,\n\n123\n00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:35.320\nI could see where this could\nplay into that as well?\n\n124\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.290\n>> Yes most definitely, it is used quite\na bit by people over on that side of\n\n125\n00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.270\nthe house and there's very good reason for\nthat not only does it have all\n\n126\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.400\nthese tools that can check for\njust say, security holes in general.\n\n127\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.130\nBut it's one of the tools\nthat can help you locate and\n\n128\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.920\ntake advantage of things like buffer\noverflows and little defects in code.\n\n129\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.499\nIt can find ways to kind of\nget through those cracks.\n\n130\n00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:05.955\nSo you can use this tool to develop\nthese exploits to get in there and\n\n131\n00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:09.180\nreally cause people to have a bad day.\n\n132\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.220\nNot saying it's easy to do that,\ntaking advantage of buffer overflows and\n\n133\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.970\nstuff like that is definitely not easy but\n\n134\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.700\nthis makes it a lot easier\nthan it would be otherwise.\n\n135\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.610\nAnd that's why you'll see people like\nsoftware developers, they'll have this.\n\n136\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.490\nIt's not uncommon to see\nit sitting on their desk or\n\n137\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.360\nin their tool set someplace where\nthey will check things out, and\n\n138\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.570\nthey will check all sorts of\napplications out with it.\n\n139\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.270\nThey will check locally hosted apps,\ndistributed apps.\n\n140\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.920\nAnd I've seen a lot with web apps and\nSQL stuff.\n\n141\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.630\nYou actually have stuff built into\nMetasploit that can check SQL and\n\n142\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.030\nOracle databases.\n\n143\n00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.920\nIt's right there from the GetGo.\n\n144\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.778\nSo it's very, very useful for\n\n145\n00:07:50.778 --> 00:07:54.785\nthose people to employ in whatever\ntheir testing development is.\n\n146\n00:07:54.785 --> 00:07:59.480\n>> Yeah, we've talked about that in our\nother episodes, where we did Kali, Linux.\n\n147\n00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.965\nWe've talked about that in I think,\nCEH as well.\n\n148\n00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:03.659\nAnd some of our security shows.\n\n149\n00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:06.481\nAs an app tester or an application\ndeveloper or website tester,\n\n150\n00:08:06.481 --> 00:08:08.587\nwe've talked about all\nthe vulnerabilities.\n\n151\n00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:13.038\nAnd we've said, well, the problem is,\nlike with buffer overflows or with input\n\n152\n00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:17.180\nvalidation, is it was on the development\nsize where that hole was created.\n\n153\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.680\nSo if they've got a tool they can use,\nto look for\n\n154\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.060\nthose holes before they put out that\nfinished product, that's a good thing.\n\n155\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.640\n>> Yes and that's what they do.\n\n156\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.760\nI've seen quite a few software\ndevelopers have this as\n\n157\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.650\npart of their arsenal and they go ahead\nand learn it and they start using it.\n\n158\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.890\nAnd do some of their own testing before\nit even leaves their desk, I guess,\n\n159\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.845\nis the way we'll put it.\n\n160\n00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:43.610\n[LAUGH] They use this to do that initial\nassessment, or do some checks and\n\n161\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.420\nthings just to see if\nsomething's actually there.\n\n162\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.130\nAnd they've got a lot\nof mileage out of it.\n\n163\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:59.070\nI ran into a couple developers two,\nthree years ago that was using this tool\n\n164\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.430\nspecifically to test all different\nthings with their web application.\n\n165\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.070\nAnd they were very concerned about that,\nas you should be anyway.\n\n166\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.530\nBut they were extremely\nconcerned about this, because\n\n167\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.590\nthey were in a situation where they were\nmanaging health care data, HIPAA data.\n\n168\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.790\nSo there's a lot of stuff on the line.\n\n169\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.395\nIf you have a violation of any sort of\nHIPAA data, it is some pretty substantial\n\n170\n00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:26.710\nfines you can get per incident\nthat they can really nail you on.\n\n171\n00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.130\nSo they weren't taking any chances.\n\n172\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.610\nThis was just one of the many\ntoys that they had available\n\n173\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.020\nthat they were trying\ndifferent things out with.\n\n174\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.730\nAnd they were saying that they found\na good amount of problems with\n\n175\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.620\nMetasploit that they wouldn't\nhave found as easily other ways.\n\n176\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.080\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, so it was really cool for them.\n\n177\n00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.350\nAnd they were even starting to develop\ntheir own things to plug into it.\n\n178\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.380\nModels to plug in and\ntest stuff specific to their environment.\n\n179\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.320\nBut they credited it with making\ntheir environment a lot more secure\n\n180\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.700\nthan it would have been otherwise.\n\n181\n00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.478\nSo, you can't really beat that.\n\n182\n00:10:01.478 --> 00:10:06.220\nAnd to even add on top of that,\nthese penetration testing tools that\n\n183\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.220\nare in there to help the software\ndevelopers and help us as pen testers.\n\n184\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.240\nThey are updated on a regular basis.\n\n185\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.160\nSo when you get Metasploit,\nyou always wanna make sure that you\n\n186\n00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.450\nupdate it almost as soon as you get it and\ninstall it.\n\n187\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.410\nBecause they may have\nreleased a few more modules,\n\n188\n00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.800\nor updated a few more modules\nthat you can just dump in there.\n\n189\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.390\nAnd go ahead and do your testing and\nevaluations with.\n\n190\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.060\n>> Nice.\n>> You know?\n\n191\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.660\nSo, yeah.\n\n192\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.520\nIt's extremely robust.\n\n193\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:40.350\nAnd considering the fact, that this\ntool is free and there's other stuff\n\n194\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.560\nthat we're going to see in here that third\nparties make, which again are also free.\n\n195\n00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.025\nIt's, to me it's kind of mind numbing that\nthey release that amount of power and\n\n196\n00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:53.115\nthey're just deciding not\nreally to charge for it.\n\n197\n00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.015\nThey were saying, hey, here you go.\n\n198\n00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:59.795\nGo ahead and use this for your testing and\nevaluations and all that.\n\n199\n00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:02.340\nIt's a shame that more\npeople don't use it.\n\n200\n00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.400\nHope the purpose is when you get through\nthis course, it makes it a little less\n\n201\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.430\nintimidating to people,\nmakes it more accessible to people.\n\n202\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:15.100\nAnd if you're someone like a CEH,\nif you watch that course or\n\n203\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.320\nyou hold that credential, hopefully you\nwill look at this in a different light and\n\n204\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.860\nsay, okay, well, I understand what\nthe penetration testing process is,\n\n205\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.290\nand I'm gonna really kind of spend\nthe time to learn Metasploit.\n\n206\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.110\nNow, once I learn Metasploit, I'm gonna\nsee how it can enhance my overall\n\n207\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.240\npen testing process, and\nif you're a software developer, then heck,\n\n208\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.500\nyou'll see there that it's something again\nthat enhances your development process and\n\n209\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.500\njust makes it so\nyou can catch some of these problems\n\n210\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.780\nbefore they go out and\nsomeone else catches them.\n\n211\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.410\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH] >> Just a really neat thing.\n\n212\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.480\nAnd so\nI think everyone will be kind of excited.\n\n213\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.020\nAnd someone's gonna find, you were\nmentioning network admins using this.\n\n214\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.400\nYeah, I could see some places where\nthey could probably make use of\n\n215\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.860\nwhat we have here.\n\n216\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.210\nBecause there are some things that are\nrather interesting that would help them\n\n217\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.550\nlocate certain problems and defects and\nstuff like that on their network.\n\n218\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.430\nI could see them making use of it.\n\n219\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.530\nThere might be something else that might\ndo it, but they could use this too.\n\n220\n00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.820\nAnd who knows, those other things\nmay cost money and this doesn't.\n\n221\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.850\nSo they might say, hey,\nwe'll buy you the book but\n\n222\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.280\nwe ain't paying [LAUGH] all this money for\nthis other stuff.\n\n223\n00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.623\n>> Had that happen many times, right?\n\n224\n00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:29.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.290\n>> So is this a new program\nthat just came out recently, or\n\n226\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.060\nwhat's the history behind Metasploit?\n\n227\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.808\n>> It's evolved quite\na bit since it's came out.\n\n228\n00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:47.670\nIt's been out since I want to say since\nabout 2003, 2004 somewhere in there.\n\n229\n00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.590\nI might be wrong.\n\n230\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.610\nI'm sure someone will correct me in\nthe discussion group if I'm wrong.\n\n231\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.120\nBut it's been out for\nawhile and it was originally\n\n232\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.190\ndeveloped to just kind of a suite of like,\nbasically scripts and stuff like that.\n\n233\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.590\nAnd it just evolved from there and\nmore stuff got added into it.\n\n234\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.130\nAnd it kind of became the go to tool for\na lot of people\n\n235\n00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.320\nthat were really into doing penetration\ntesting and software development.\n\n236\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.330\nThey just started getting more and\nmore and more into it.\n\n237\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.240\nAnd it got a reputation and people\njust start adding more stuff to it and\n\n238\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.030\nthe developers of it started\nputting more stuff, saying oh,\n\n239\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.880\nwell that's a good idea,\nthat's a good idea.\n\n240\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.100\nAnd then they made it so it's very\nextensible so you could, if If they didn't\n\n241\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.020\nhave time to add something in or there was\nsomething that just wasn't worth their\n\n242\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.980\ntime to do because it was very specific,\nthey made it so you could add that in.\n\n243\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:44.475\nSo it rapidly became a tool over the years\nthat just grew and grew and grew and\n\n244\n00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:50.715\ngrew in power and when you look at it\nthere's not a ton of versions of this.\n\n245\n00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:53.955\nI think this technically right\nnow we're at version four,\n\n246\n00:13:53.955 --> 00:13:58.535\nit's kind of weird to keep track of\nthe version numbers of Metasploit.\n\n247\n00:13:58.535 --> 00:14:02.140\nBut they say you know I\nthink it's at version four.\n\n248\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.650\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n249\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.020\n>> But that doesn't sound like much, but\n\n250\n00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.730\nit's really gone through a tremendous\nevolution over that period of time.\n\n251\n00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.461\nAnd if you look in other areas\nof security and pen testing,\n\n252\n00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:20.509\nyou'll see along that last decade,\nyou see things just pop up here and there.\n\n253\n00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:23.879\nIt's like, oh look at Metasploit, and\nhere's Metasploit can do this or this, and\n\n254\n00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:25.640\nthey really didn't talk about it too much.\n\n255\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.210\nIt was really people that were really\ndeeply in the pen testing community that\n\n256\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.530\nwere really willing to do stuff\non their own and explore it,\n\n257\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.860\nthat were really kind\nof unlocking the power.\n\n258\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.700\nAnd even along that way, believe it or\nnot, even along that way that\n\n259\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.730\nperiod from when it was released up\nto now there's people still on both\n\n260\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:51.010\nsides of the fence of really is this a\ngood or bad thing that this is out there?\n\n261\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.830\nThat discussion really is taking place and\ntakes place all the time.\n\n262\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.880\nBecause the good guys, us, we will\nuse the thing to do our testing and\n\n263\n00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.190\nevaluations to close these holes,\nhopefully before someone else finds them.\n\n264\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.570\nBut again,\nanybody that can use a tool like this for\n\n265\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.140\ngood to find holes, it could be\nused by bad people to find holes.\n\n266\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.570\nSo it's been used on\nboth sides of the force,\n\n267\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.383\nI don't know whatever you want to call it.\n\n268\n00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:21.205\n[LAUGH] It's been used on both\nsides of this whole deal.\n\n269\n00:15:21.205 --> 00:15:25.745\nSo you'll see a lot of\nplaces where it pops up.\n\n270\n00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:29.395\nWe're not gonna use it with the intention\nthat we're going to be damaging anything,\n\n271\n00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.975\nor causing any problems.\n\n272\n00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:35.540\nAnd do be aware that Metasploit is one\nof those tools that you really wanna\n\n273\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.460\nknow your stuff before you get\ninto it because it's not really\n\n274\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.310\ndesigned to be the user friendliest\nof tools and that's not to scare\n\n275\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.280\nanyone away it's not designed to be, well\nit's going to be really really simple and\n\n276\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.610\nhas that nice GUI and everything,\nit's not gonna have that.\n\n277\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.808\nThere's been some attempts to put that on\nthere, but it's, that's not really there.\n\n278\n00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:00.455\nThey focused on just raw\npower it seems like.\n\n279\n00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:04.658\nAnd they very much delivered along\nthose lines in having that raw power.\n\n280\n00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:08.350\nThat you can get access to,\nyou've just got to spend time with it.\n\n281\n00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.724\nYou would think over that 10 year history\nthat they would have done something more,\n\n282\n00:16:12.724 --> 00:16:16.849\ndone something to make it easier to use,\nand has gotten easier to use, but yeah,\n\n283\n00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:21.219\nthere's not a GUI or anything like that in\nthere; you're going to have to become best\n\n284\n00:16:21.219 --> 00:16:25.080\nfriends, on a buddy to buddy basis\nwith the command line and that's it.\n\n285\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.000\nThat's just the beginning\nend of the story.\n\n286\n00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.140\n>> Sometimes I think they do that to\nkeep some of the script TD types to\n\n287\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.955\nkeep from using it where, if you're going\nto use this tool, this is a powerful tool.\n\n288\n00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:38.345\nYou better know what you're doing.\n\n289\n00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:41.085\nOne way to ensure that is to not\ngive them a clickable interface.\n\n290\n00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:41.765\nRight?\n\n291\n00:16:41.765 --> 00:16:42.345\n>> Yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:46.325\nI don't know if that would actually\nbe a conscious decision in this case,\n\n293\n00:16:46.325 --> 00:16:50.980\nbut I would not be the least bit\nsurprised if that decision was somehow\n\n294\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.000\npopped into someone's head.\n\n295\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.180\nI mean, because yeah, I don't know if you\nreally want to have something that has\n\n296\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.400\nthis amount of power in it you'd\nwant it just open to script kitties.\n\n297\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.830\nBecause there is the potential here for\na lot of damage if someone doesn't know\n\n298\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:10.160\nwhat they're doing, or\nis just poking around at something.\n\n299\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.860\nThey could cause a tremendous amount\nof damage and take out systems.\n\n300\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.520\nIn fact, they will tell you if you look on\na number of different sites, because there\n\n301\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.500\nare quite a few tutorials and stuff like\nthat out there at the Internet on this,\n\n302\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.740\na lot of those have been developed over\nthe years during this history and they've\n\n303\n00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.130\ngrown up, but one of the things that you\nsee as a common thread amongst it is yeah,\n\n304\n00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:37.160\nthat lab environment you have, make sure\nyou've got that backed up, because you can\n\n305\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.420\ndestroy things in your lab environment,\nwhich is what a lab environment's for.\n\n306\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.810\nI mean, if you don't break it, you're not\nimpressing me is the way I look at it, but\n\n307\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.560\nbe prepared that you should\nback these things up.\n\n308\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.690\nYou could very well go in and be probing\naround for a buffer overflow or some other\n\n309\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.970\ndefect in software or whatever, and just,\npoof, you've destroyed something and\n\n310\n00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:03.010\nyou have to go through and reset it or\ndo something to fix that machine.\n\n311\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.330\nBut you'll learn the power\nis very much there,\n\n312\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.400\nand you may very well be\nworking without a net.\n\n313\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.763\n>> And then I guess we should give credit.\n\n314\n00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:13.469\nHow makes metasploit?\n\n315\n00:18:13.469 --> 00:18:15.660\nWho makes it all possible?\n\n316\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.670\n>> Well metasploit,\nfrom its inception, was written by,\n\n317\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.890\nwas envisioned by a guy they called\nHD Moore, I think is the guy's name.\n\n318\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.780\nAnd there's a couple other ones\nthat were involved along the way.\n\n319\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.360\nAnd he developed it on his own as part of\nsomething called the Metasploit project.\n\n320\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.090\nSo if you go back,\nit's only a short number of years,\n\n321\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.310\nwe're not talking that long ago.\n\n322\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.220\nProbably if you go back about five years,\n\n323\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.860\nthe metasploit project was\ndefinitely still out there.\n\n324\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.220\nYou could go out there and see the website\nfor it, see all the documentation and\n\n325\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.460\neverything for it, it was right there.\n\n326\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.190\nBut that eventually got acquired\nby a company called Rapid 7, and\n\n327\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:02.010\nif you don't recall that name, Rapid 7 was\nsomething that was mentioned in the CEH\n\n328\n00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.230\nas the creators of a vulnerability scanner\ncalled expose, and they still have\n\n329\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.230\nthat out there too, so they acquired\nMetasploit, they have expose, and\n\n330\n00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.730\nthey have some other tools in their\narsenal as well that you can employ, and\n\n331\n00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:23.380\nthen the original creators actually\nare still with Rapid7, they\n\n332\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.840\njust pulled everyone over and said, okay,\nwe'll pry the project, the developers,\n\n333\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.900\nwe're going to bring them all over, and\nkind of absorb them into that entity.\n\n334\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:37.660\nThe cool thing about that is as far as\nthings like a vulnerability scanners,\n\n335\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:43.220\nif this is something that is designed\nto do pen testing and help you\n\n336\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:48.470\nexploit those weaknesses and defects and\nwhatever you have in software,\n\n337\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.300\nvulnerability scanner helps\nyou locate those things.\n\n338\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.880\nSo, the really neat thing about this\nis that Rapid 7 has an expose as\n\n339\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.850\ntheir vulnerability scanner, you can run\nthat and then if you have Metasploit\n\n340\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.680\ninstalled and understand it, you can\nactually have the two work together.\n\n341\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.490\nSo you can find vulnerabilities over there\nand bring them right into Metasploit, and\n\n342\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.360\nstart banging on them to\nsee just how serious it is.\n\n343\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.160\nSo that's, that's a neat thing.\n\n344\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.880\nJust makes your job that much easier.\n\n345\n00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.979\n>> Right.\n>> So you can get metasploit for\n\n346\n00:20:16.979 --> 00:20:21.841\nfree if you don't want, if you don't\nhave Queue or just don't want to use it,\n\n347\n00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:24.360\nand you want to use it on Windows.\n\n348\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.010\nYeah, you can use it on Windows just\nlike you can use an expose on Windows.\n\n349\n00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.290\nIt's pretty much going to be\nthe same experience though.\n\n350\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.700\nYou may feel a little bit better\nbecause it's in Windows I guess, but\n\n351\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.400\nit's pretty much going to\nbe the same experience.\n\n352\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.250\nCommand line is going to be the same.\n\n353\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.190\nYou know,\nthe tools are going to work the same.\n\n354\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.100\nIt's for the most part, I think there\nmight be some differences here and\n\n355\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.870\nthere because of the underlying\narchitecture of Windows, but\n\n356\n00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.240\nfor the most part everything\nis going to be the same, so.\n\n357\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.640\n>> And with Kali it's already installed.\n\n358\n00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.940\nSo if you've already downloaded that and\n\n359\n00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.650\nwatched your other episodes then you've\nalready got Medisplate and ready to go.\n\n360\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:03.255\n>> Yeah, pretty much all you'd want to do\nif you have Kali is just do that update.\n\n361\n00:21:03.255 --> 00:21:06.700\nBecause you don't know how\nold that Kali distra was, and\n\n362\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.030\nit's easy enough to do the update.\n\n363\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.580\nYou just go to command line,\nyou run a couple really quick commands and\n\n364\n00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.280\nit will update the whole thing\nwith the latest exploits,\n\n365\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.250\nwhatever else it has,\nand you're good to go.\n\n366\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.140\nSo, it's up to you which\nway you want to go.\n\n367\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.060\nIf you really just have, are stuck\non windows, and you love windows,\n\n368\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.930\nand you're like, I got to use this,\nit makes it easier for me.\n\n369\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.370\nNot going to argue with you.\n\n370\n00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:35.590\nYou can take metasploit over there and\nkeep on trucking, using it just fine.\n\n371\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.340\nBut if you are comfortable with Kali and\nthe Linux side of the house, and\n\n372\n00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.920\nit doesn't have to be just on Kali\nby the way, you can put it on\n\n373\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.690\njust about every major version of\nLinux you can have it installed on.\n\n374\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.080\nBut Kali seems to be the most\nlikely one you can put it on,\n\n375\n00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.880\nbecause of all the other\ntools that are there and\n\n376\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.220\nsince it does exist there anyway,\nit seems like a good fit for that.\n\n377\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.030\nSo it just seems that if you're\ngoing to be using this Linux and\n\n378\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.480\nKlinux seems to be the combination that\nyou'd have, because you have access to\n\n379\n00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.570\nMetasploit, you have access to\nthe other tools, they all integrate.\n\n380\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.265\nWhy not just just have all the tools\nready, instead of just having it as\n\n381\n00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:19.425\nan island unto itself or maybe not\nhaving the same integration on Windows.\n\n382\n00:22:19.425 --> 00:22:26.550\nSo, I would throw that out there, and\njust one little other little point on this\n\n383\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.770\nis when you look at Metasploit,\nthere's a lot of cases out there.\n\n384\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.800\nI don't know if it's kind of like\nthe nose in the air type thing.\n\n385\n00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.070\nBut a lot of cases when people\nhave developed modules or\n\n386\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.500\ndoing something revolving\naround Metasploit,\n\n387\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.640\nthey will almost always go\nright over to the Linux side.\n\n388\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.600\nAnd some of them will say, yeah,\nif you have problems with Windows,\n\n389\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.095\nor writing this on the Mac OS or\nwhat have you, don't call me.\n\n390\n00:22:51.095 --> 00:22:52.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's kind of their attitude.\n\n391\n00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.990\nI mean, yeah,\nthat's a little bit of a bad and\n\n392\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.640\nnegative attitude on it,\nbut be prepared for that.\n\n393\n00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.550\nThey just kind of consider\nthat this is a Linux tool,\n\n394\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.969\neven though it could run over there.\n\n395\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.750\nWe prefer you run it on\nLinux instead of Windows.\n\n396\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.840\nRapid 7 doesn't say that and\nI don't see them endorsing saying,\n\n397\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.520\noh yeah you've got to run it on Linux.\n\n398\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.390\nYou can't run it on Windows.\n\n399\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.980\nBut we'll make it available.\n\n400\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.580\nI don't see them actually\npushing that view, but\n\n401\n00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.780\nthe community outside of that seems to\nkind of skew that way, so another reason.\n\n402\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.440\n>> Yeah, that's a lot of work for\nthose developers.\n\n403\n00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.670\nThey're giving away free plugins for\n\n404\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.440\nthis tool they've always\ndeveloped to run on Linux.\n\n405\n00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.030\nI think some of them sometimes\nare just like, I'm not going to spend\n\n406\n00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.000\nthe time on something to get\nit to port over to Windows,\n\n407\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.850\nyou can use it on Linux or\nyou can not use it all type thing.\n\n408\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.630\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n409\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:48.180\nThere's, they may have been for\nyears been on Linux,\n\n410\n00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.360\nbecause it's so open and they can do all\nthe free development and everything for\n\n411\n00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.400\nit, that they just don't want to\nbother with doing anything on Windows,\n\n412\n00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.520\nbecause there's just so many complexities,\nand intricacies over there,\n\n413\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.490\nthat are just like, forget it,\nI'm not doing that.\n\n414\n00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.090\nSo, don't be surprised if\nyou run into that attitude.\n\n415\n00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:12.170\nNow, does that mean those plugins and\nstuff like that won't run on Windows?\n\n416\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.450\nNo, it doesn't mean that, it just means\nthey're probably not going to help you\n\n417\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.290\nget those plugins to run on\nWindows if you have a problem.\n\n418\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.130\nI just saw something like that last night,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n419\n00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.250\nwhere someone had their FAQ.\n\n420\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.190\nHe's like, hey, had a problem on Windows?\n\n421\n00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.512\nWell, that's unfortunate.\n\n422\n00:24:26.512 --> 00:24:29.235\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> That was kind of their attitude.\n\n423\n00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:29.810\n>> Run Linux.\n\n424\n00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.995\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that was\n\n425\n00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:32.855\nbasically the attitude in there.\n\n426\n00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:35.005\nIt was very nicely phrased,\nI'll tell you that.\n\n427\n00:24:35.005 --> 00:24:40.630\nBut it was basically saying yeah, go run\non Linux or I'm not bothering with you.\n\n428\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.659\nThat was kind of it.\n\n429\n00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:46.610\nBut, even though we're running on Linux,\n\n430\n00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.700\nhere, don't take it as, hey that's\nthe only place you could run it as, and\n\n431\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.970\nwe're not going to be all snobby about it.\n\n432\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.251\nBut, just be aware of those factors.\n\n433\n00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:55.040\n>> We're not going to help you.\n[LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.370\n>> Yeah, we're not going to help you.\n\n435\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.065\n>> We're just kidding folks.\n\n436\n00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:00.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well Sean,\n\n437\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.010\na lot of great information.\n\n438\n00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.460\nYou really got me excited about watching\nthese Metasploit episodes that we've got\n\n439\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.650\ncoming your way.\n\n440\n00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.570\nAnything else you want to throw\nin our little kind of a what\n\n441\n00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.930\nis Metasploit episode here?\n\n442\n00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.510\n>> Not really much, except you\nneed to start downloading this so\n\n443\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.560\nwe can get started on doing the rest\nof the stuff of Metasploit.\n\n444\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.660\nWe got a lot of things we're going to\ndo revolving around these areas, so\n\n445\n00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.330\nyeah I think we'll be really excited\nwhen they see what it can do,\n\n446\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.430\nespecially as a penetration tool.\n\n447\n00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.270\nWhat it adds to the whole mix.\n\n448\n00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:29.960\n>> Fantastic,\n\n449\n00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.034\nall right well I know I'm excited\n>> Excited.\n\n450\n00:25:31.034 --> 00:25:34.217\nI hope you guys are too, but for\nnow signing off for IT Pro TV,\n\n451\n00:25:34.217 --> 00:25:35.352\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n452\n00:25:35.352 --> 00:25:37.430\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n453\n00:25:37.430 -->

00:00:16.740\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.830\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.897\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:19.860\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.566\nExcited to get back into our Metasploit\nepisodes and in this one, Sean,\n\n8\n00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.240\nwe're gonna talk about some of\nthe different versions of Metasploit.\n\n9\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.851\nBecause if I go out there\nto Rapid7's website,\n\n10\n00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.622\nI know there's more than one option\nI have to download this software.\n\n11\n00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:34.250\nRight?\n\n12\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.570\n>> Yeah, there's different versions,\ndefinitely floating around out there, and\n\n13\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.260\nit could get rather confusing if you start\njust kinda looking around on your own.\n\n14\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.170\nAnd so,\n\n15\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.280\nto alleviate that we should talk about\nthe different versions that are out there.\n\n16\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.590\nReally, there's only two that you're\never gonna run into on a regular basis,\n\n17\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.810\nbut there are really four overall.\n\n18\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.400\nSo it is worth kind of just\nthrowing those all in there.\n\n19\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.150\nBut just to make sure\nthat no one gets lost and\n\n20\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.880\nis like, which one do I use again and\nthe kinda scratching their head.\n\n21\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.320\nWe're gonna make sure we cover these\ndifferent versions and talk about why one\n\n22\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.350\nover the other or\nmaybe better to say what one\n\n23\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640\nhas that the other one doesn't, or\ndoesn't have that the other ones do have.\n\n24\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.970\nSo, that's what were\ntrying to really explore\n\n25\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.604\nwhen we go through this whole thing.\n\n26\n00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:31.275\n>> Okay.\n\n27\n00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:36.254\n>> So for the metasploit versions that we\nhave, the two big ones that you're going\n\n28\n00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:39.780\nto run into are the community and\nthe pro version.\n\n29\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.894\nAlso if we're gonna be doing it here,\nit runs in the community version,\n\n30\n00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.340\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n31\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.270\nThat's what we're all sort of working on.\n\n32\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.640\nThe stuff you're gonna be doing in\nWindows, if you decide to use Windows as\n\n33\n00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.390\nyour weapon of choice this week, that's\ngonna be the community edition as well.\n\n34\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.055\nAnd you'll know it's community\nedition because if you paid for\n\n35\n00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:01.257\nit, it's not the community edition.\n\n36\n00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:02.802\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] That's\n\n37\n00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.540\nreally the easy way to figure that out.\n\n38\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.745\n>> Did I have to break out\nmy credit card or not?\n\n39\n00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:07.885\nOh, I must have got the community edition.\n\n40\n00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.748\n>> Yeah, if you swiped the credit card,\nthat's not the community edition.\n\n41\n00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:15.720\nSo the community edition is\nsomething that's freely available.\n\n42\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.010\nAnd you get it from Rapid7.\n\n43\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.310\nYou can get the repositories from Linux.\n\n44\n00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.290\nJust go ahead and do whatever in your\nversion of Linux to pull it down and\n\n45\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.350\ninstall it.\n\n46\n00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.350\nSo that's the most commonly encountered\nversion that you're gonna see.\n\n47\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.360\nAnd most people are actually\njust fine with it.\n\n48\n00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.840\nThere are some areas\nthat are lacking in it.\n\n49\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.420\nBut for the most part,\nunless you're one of the big boy develop.\n\n50\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.460\nYou're probably never,\never gonna miss that stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.010\nIt's just not something that's\ngonna be on your radar.\n\n52\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.710\nSo that would be the community edition.\n\n53\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.850\nAnd like I said,\nyou can get it from Rapid7 right now or\n\n54\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.230\nthrough your Linux version.\n\n55\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.992\nThen the pro version, the pro version\nis the paid version, it's the big boy.\n\n56\n00:03:04.992 --> 00:03:08.320\nIt's got all the bells and\nwhistles that you can think of.\n\n57\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.500\nIt can do a lot of neat stuff.\n\n58\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.108\nIt allows you to do additional things\nwith modules and stuff like that.\n\n59\n00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:20.320\nIt's really ment for\nenterprise level testing, so\n\n60\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.870\nyou're talking big, big, big projects.\n\n61\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.750\nAnd in that context, when you talk about\nbig projects, we're specifically talking\n\n62\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.358\nabout being able to test, evaluate, and\nremedy problems on a much quicker basis\n\n63\n00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:36.570\nthan we could with something\nlike a community edition.\n\n64\n00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.720\nCommunity edition can very well be\nused in an enterprise environment.\n\n65\n00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.820\nThere's actually absolutely\nnothing saying it can't be.\n\n66\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.170\nBut it's not optimized for that.\n\n67\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.710\nSo if you in an Enterprise environment and\n\n68\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.455\nyou're kind of doing spot checks here and\nthere.\n\n69\n00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:53.450\nCommunity edition might be just fine for\nyou, but\n\n70\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.270\nthe pro edition is something if\nyou have a lot of systems and\n\n71\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.830\nsoftware tests and\na lot of vulnerabilities to go over,\n\n72\n00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.340\nthen pro is gonna be worth the money,\ncuz it will speed up that whole process.\n\n73\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.250\nAnd there's another little\ndetail to it as well.\n\n74\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.395\nIs, community edition, they say it's,\ncommunity edition is for\n\n75\n00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:18.940\nnon-commercial uses.\n\n76\n00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.850\nThey allow you to use it in educational\nenvironments, so if you're doing it for\n\n77\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.760\ntraining purposes, or using it for\nstuff like we are, where we're not\n\n78\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.210\nusing it to develop software [LAUGH] or\nmake money off of, you're fine.\n\n79\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.730\nBut they expect that yes\nif you're gonna be doing\n\n80\n00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.820\na lot of development and testing,\nthey expect you to move over to pro.\n\n81\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.674\nAnd they're pretty easy going about that,\nbut you never know.\n\n82\n00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:47.035\nBut just for your own personal use,\nfor non-commercial use, for\n\n83\n00:04:47.035 --> 00:04:49.975\ntraining education,\nthey are saying, yeah, go ahead,\n\n84\n00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:52.929\nuse community eddition,\nit's perfectly fine for that.\n\n85\n00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:57.697\nAnd so heck, we've been using Community\nEdition in classrooms a lot for years, so\n\n86\n00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:00.421\nmost people if they've\never used Metasploit,\n\n87\n00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:03.930\nthat's the one they've run\nto is that specific version.\n\n88\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.090\nBut overall they both,\nthey really look the same.\n\n89\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.780\nNow, in addition to those two versions\nwe have an Express version and\n\n90\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.280\na Metasploit Framework Edition.\n\n91\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.510\nThose are kind of really kind\nof scaled down versions and\n\n92\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.380\nthey're really not seen all that much but\nthey do exist out there.\n\n93\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.630\nThe express version is a really\ntrimmed down version of Metasploit,\n\n94\n00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.890\nthat's basically been put on a diet,\n\n95\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.560\nit's very specific to certain things, has\nvery specific things on it and that's it.\n\n96\n00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.810\nAnd then the framework is just\na small number of things.\n\n97\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.910\nAnd it's commandline, that's really,\njust everything's commandline.\n\n98\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.180\nAnd that's all you're getting.\n\n99\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.640\n>> If I want to develop a module\nthat's gonna work with Metasploit or\n\n100\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.690\nsomething like that,\nI might need the framework?\n\n101\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.930\n>> Yeah, you could use the framework for\ndeveloping some basic modules with it.\n\n102\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.770\nBut I would say more than likely\nmost people are gonna just use\n\n103\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.590\nthe community or pro.\n\n104\n00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.723\nThey're probably never gonna\nencounter the other two.\n\n105\n00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:06.712\nFor all intensive purposes having\nsaid that there might be a number of\n\n106\n00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:10.033\npeople out here that have\nactually used those versions.\n\n107\n00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:14.555\nAnd at one point in time if you\ngo back before Rapid7 acquired\n\n108\n00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:18.540\nthe technology those were\na little more common.\n\n109\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.320\nBut for the most part now,\ndon't expect to see those.\n\n110\n00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.960\nExpect to see community or pro and\nthen the line's drawn there.\n\n111\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.180\nAnd just kind of hey whatever else\nis over there, is over there.\n\n112\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.850\nAnd we're just gonna ignore it.\n\n113\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.390\nSo and that makes it easier.\n\n114\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.230\nThat makes it a lot easier,\nto tell you the truth.\n\n115\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.720\nBecause four different versions,\n\n116\n00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.600\nand you've gotta learn the differences\nbetween all four different versions.\n\n117\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.580\nWhy bother?\n\n118\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.065\n>> You're starting to remind me of\nMicrosoft and their Windows flavors.\n\n119\n00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:48.625\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, see, Rapid 7 was first.\n\n120\n00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:49.600\n>> Right.\n\n121\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.240\n>> But yeah, it's, just keep that in mind.\n\n122\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.310\nMost of you are probably gonna just\nuse the Community Edition during your\n\n123\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.850\nwhole exploration using that sploit.\n\n124\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.389\nI mean, heck, you might even use it\nto do some of your basic pen testing.\n\n125\n00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.264\nBut remember if you're gonna be doing\nreally heavy duty commercial stuff and\n\n126\n00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:16.614\nmaking some serious money off this,\nthen, yeah, they do put that,\n\n127\n00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:19.016\nthey want you to go to the pro version.\n\n128\n00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:19.991\n>> Yeah, it's only right.\n\n129\n00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:21.809\nRight?\nIf you're gonna go out there and\n\n130\n00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.298\nbill people for your services and\n\n131\n00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:25.969\nyou're using Metasploit as\none of your major components.\n\n132\n00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:26.991\nGotta throw them a few bones.\n\n133\n00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:27.770\nRight?\n\n134\n00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.350\nAnd register your copy,\nget that pro version.\n\n135\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.270\nBut for us, for studying while before\nyou become that famous bin tester,\n\n136\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.870\nyou can use that community addition for\nfree.\n\n137\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.120\nAnd no problems, no harm, no foul.\n\n138\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.340\nAll right, so Sean, we've got our\nversion to pick, free for the most part.\n\n139\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.450\nUnless we're gonna be making money off of\nit or we need the extra performance in\n\n140\n00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.600\na large corporate environment,\nthen we move up into that pro version.\n\n141\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.030\nWhat about installation?\n\n142\n00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.490\nI know you said we could\nrun it on Windows,\n\n143\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.050\nwe could run it on Linux, even Unix.\n\n144\n00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.820\nBut any special considerations\nthey're gonna have?\n\n145\n00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.871\nLike tons of memory or\nfast hard drives, or-\n\n146\n00:08:03.871 --> 00:08:04.993\n>> You know,\n\n147\n00:08:04.993 --> 00:08:10.590\nit's pretty easygoing on\nhardware requirements.\n\n148\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.020\nAnd amazingly enough,\nthere's not a lot it really requires.\n\n149\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:22.720\nIn fact, if you still have Kali\ninstalled from the Kali course,\n\n150\n00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.720\nI think we recommended between a gig and\ntwo is about really where\n\n151\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.420\nyou need to have it, and they say Kali\nwill run on half a gig if you want, and\n\n152\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.050\nit'll actually run pretty good\non that if you ever tried it.\n\n153\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.860\nIt will run very well on that.\n\n154\n00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:45.350\nBut you don't really need that much\nextra for metasploit to run on that.\n\n155\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.350\nI'd say if you've got a virtual\nmachine and you have Kali Linux and\n\n156\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.520\nyou allocate two gigs to it,\nyou're probably gonna be just fine with\n\n157\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.010\nMetasploit, the community\nedition at least.\n\n158\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.420\nYou'll be just fine with it.\n\n159\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.940\nBecause you've got to think, there's\nnot all the extra overhead, you know.\n\n160\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.030\nWe already said that there's\nreally not a GUI there.\n\n161\n00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.780\nIt's command line so it doesn't have to\nhave any extra stuff to boost that up.\n\n162\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.390\nSo it's just opening up a console or\nterminal window as they call it.\n\n163\n00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.810\nAnd you're doing your stuff in there,\nso not a lot is going to happen there.\n\n164\n00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.820\nYou do have to for\n\n165\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.870\na lot of the tools especially if you're\ngoing to be doing the remote stuff,\n\n166\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.320\nyou have to have a network adapter\nactive in there that you can go and\n\n167\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.050\nconnect to, and so\nyou can start interacting with those.\n\n168\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.590\nAs far as other requirements on there,\nmake sure your Linux\n\n169\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.840\nversion is up to date, that you\nhave all the latest whatever on it.\n\n170\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.220\nIf you're gonna use an expose make sure\nan expose is on there and it's up to date.\n\n171\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.100\nAnd then just start plugging this in.\n\n172\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.960\nAnd, like I said, it's very,\nvery easy to install.\n\n173\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.930\nYou'd be amazed at just how easy it is.\n\n174\n00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.460\nYou don't have to jump through\na lot of hoops to get this to work.\n\n175\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.110\nEither on the virtual side or\n\n176\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:10.180\non the physical side, if you're\nphysically running Linux on a box.\n\n177\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.940\nSo that's the cool thing.\n\n178\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.370\nIt doesn't require a bunch of fancy stuff,\nreally.\n\n179\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.830\nNow with that being said, if you're gonna\nbe someone that is developing modules for\n\n180\n00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:28.150\nit, the modules will require\nother development tools for that.\n\n181\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.720\nMetasploit is done in Ruby, so\nif you're gonna be developing exploits and\n\n182\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.530\nstuff like that in, for the product,\nthen you're gonna need to have those\n\n183\n00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.390\npresent to be able to\naccomplish that task.\n\n184\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.810\nBut that's outside of Metasploit, but\nit will be working with Metasploit.\n\n185\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.700\nYou're creating the actual module,\nwhatever it is, typing away on it,\n\n186\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.450\ncreating it, and then bring it on over and\ntry it, and go back and forth.\n\n187\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.130\nSo remember that.\n\n188\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.740\nIf you're gonna be doing those\nextra modules, then yes,\n\n189\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:03.240\nyou will have to get those\ntools present on that box.\n\n190\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.890\nNow, that's the Linux side.\n\n191\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.380\nThe same stuff, for the most part,\napplies over on the Windows side.\n\n192\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.290\nThe Windows side, if you're gonna\nbe doing it on a physical machine,\n\n193\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.980\nit's just a matter of installing it,\nupdating it, and be ready to go.\n\n194\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.220\nYou're gonna put an exposÃ© on there,\n\n195\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.910\nput an exposÃ© on there, and you get\neverything up to date, you're ready to go.\n\n196\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.110\nIt's really, really, really easy going.\n\n197\n00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.950\nYeah, the installation doesn't have a log,\nlittle glitches or\n\n198\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.800\nanything happening to it.\n\n199\n00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.240\nMetasploit I found, as probably\na lot of you have already found,\n\n200\n00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.400\nif you were downloading it,\nprepping it for the course.\n\n201\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.470\nMaybe you weren't using Kali.\n\n202\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.610\nThere's not much to it.\n\n203\n00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.300\nYou just double-click, and\nit will tell you a few things.\n\n204\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.740\nAnd let's go.\n\n205\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.310\nOf course, we probably should talk about\nthe one thing that is gonna throw a huge\n\n206\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.590\nmonkey wrench into this whole process\nif you don't pay very close attention.\n\n207\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.860\nWhat you were mentioning Mike.\n\n208\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.480\n>> I was installing it before the show.\n\n209\n00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.130\nGet it on my machine here.\n\n210\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.290\nAnd I did get a couple warnings that are\nnot the kind of warnings that you normally\n\n211\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.720\nsee when you install software.\n\n212\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.683\nAnd of course they're gonna\nfrighten some people or\n\n213\n00:12:11.683 --> 00:12:13.209\nworry some people a little bit, right.\n\n214\n00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:15.261\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I get the warning basically\n\n215\n00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:18.230\nsaid hey you're getting\nready to install Metasploit.\n\n216\n00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:22.180\nBefore you do this it would be a good idea\nif you disabled all antivirus software and\n\n217\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.605\nkilled your firewall.\n\n218\n00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:27.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I thought to myself, hm, you know,\n\n219\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.170\nwhat better way to attack somebody's\nmachine than to run an installation\n\n220\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.230\nprogram and, hey, turn off all you're\nsecurity while you're running this,\n\n221\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.890\ncuz we're just gonna call home real\nquick and set up a back door, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.860\nBut that's not what Metasploit is doing-\n>> Hey turn that stuff off,\n\n223\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.956\nwe're testing security here.\n\n224\n00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:44.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so for somebody the first\n\n225\n00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.460\ntime they're looking at that, that could\nbe worrisome right, but nothing to fear?\n\n226\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.600\n>> Yeah there's nothing really\nto be concerned about that.\n\n227\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.120\nI mean you should raise an eyebrow.\n\n228\n00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.118\nYou should always raise an eyebrow.\n\n229\n00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:59.330\nI don't care what it is if it tells you to\ndisable your security stuff and if you,\n\n230\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.840\nif the first time you're encountering\nthis if you're unaware of what it is\n\n231\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.320\nyou should probably stop the installation\nand check to see why it's doing that.\n\n232\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.464\nThat would be just quite frankly be\nstupid, if you just went ahead and\n\n233\n00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:14.756\njust drove on and said,\nI'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n234\n00:13:14.756 --> 00:13:18.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it will happen is,\n\n235\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.680\nif you do continue that installation,\nand you don't.\n\n236\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.890\nLet's just talk about the malware part for\na moment.\n\n237\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.940\nIf you don't disable the anti-malware\nstuff on your system, your anti-virus,\n\n238\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.510\nwhat will happen is several of the modules\nand stuff that's included from Metasploit,\n\n239\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.170\nyour anti-virus will pick up and\nstart deleting it off your drive.\n\n240\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.660\nAnd which case, it's basically breaking\nMetasploit as it's being installed or\n\n241\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.740\nshortly after it's installed.\n\n242\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.070\nIt will start screaming at you and\nquarantining stuff, left and right, and\n\n243\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.750\nMetasploit will just not work.\n\n244\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.430\nSo that's why it's asking you to do that.\n\n245\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:55.400\nHowever, it's worth adding\nthat to this whole thing that\n\n246\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.290\nif you are going to install\nMetasploit which we are of course.\n\n247\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.355\nIf we are installing it,\nthe easy way to deal with that is, and\n\n248\n00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:07.820\nthis is the way I do it, but\nyou don't have to do it this exact way.\n\n249\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.270\nBut you can go in your antivirus and\n\n250\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:14.440\njust exclude the Metasploit folder and\nthen you won't have any problems.\n\n251\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.520\nOn my Windows box, because I've got\nMetasploit installed both on Windows and\n\n252\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.020\non Lennox on this system I have here.\n\n253\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.976\nWhat I did is, I just created\na Metasploit folder before I ran\n\n254\n00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:28.250\nthe Metasploit installation, and\nthen just went into my antivirus and\n\n255\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.775\nexcluded it, and\nthen started my installation.\n\n256\n00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:32.460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just installed it in that folder.\n\n257\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.410\nZero problems.\n\n258\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.660\n>> So that way you still\ngot your antivirus running,\n\n259\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.030\nit's just not gonna try to\ntouch that Metasploit folder.\n\n260\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.890\nCuz it includes a lot of code and stuff\nthat most antivirus is gonna pick up and\n\n261\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.250\ntry to remove to keep you safe.\n\n262\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.980\nSo you're telling your computer hey look,\nI'm putting something in this folder and\n\n263\n00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.440\nI know that it could be potentially\nharmful, but I don't want you to touch it,\n\n264\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.970\nleave it alone.\n\n265\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.400\nSo make an exception on your antivirus,\nthat way you can still run your antivirus,\n\n266\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.152\nkeep the rest of your computer safe,\nbut at least that Metasploit folder,\n\n267\n00:14:58.152 --> 00:15:01.790\nit won't start removing things and\ncorrupting your installation.\n\n268\n00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.610\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a nasty surprise, or it will be,\n\n269\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.990\nif you leave your anti virus and\nstuff like that on.\n\n270\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.350\nBecause you're gonna run into a situation,\nthat product,\n\n271\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.790\nwhen you try to run it later on,\nis just not gonna work.\n\n272\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.340\nAnd you're gonna flip out\nwhen you go through it,\n\n273\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.740\nstart trying to use the different modules,\nand go, why isn't that working?\n\n274\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.520\nWhy isn't that working?\n\n275\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.490\nWhy is not that working?\n\n276\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.360\nWhen I started using Metasploit sometime\nback I got that nasty surprise, and\n\n277\n00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.600\nit doesn't have to by the way, just do\nit during the installation process.\n\n278\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.420\nIt could be after that.\n\n279\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.980\nYou may install it and\nnot a single thing goes wrong, and\n\n280\n00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.140\nyou're like yeah I didn't have\nto to do that, no problem.\n\n281\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.450\nIt's gonna get it at some point.\n\n282\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.035\nIt's just a question of when, not if.\n\n283\n00:15:48.035 --> 00:15:51.341\n>> Exactly, depending on what your\nscan settings are, maybe your Realtime\n\n284\n00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:54.857\nprotection is not going, but the next\ntime it runs a scan across that drive, or\n\n285\n00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:57.897\nyou open up that folder in\nWindows Explorer for example and Defender\n\n286\n00:15:57.897 --> 00:16:01.785\nwants to kick in and try to keep you safe\nand you'll see files start disappearing.\n\n287\n00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:04.538\n[NOISE] Yeah, so not a good thing.\n\n288\n00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:06.450\nAnd then the firewall's another thing.\n\n289\n00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.259\nIt's gonna require us to turn it off at\nleast while we're running it Sean, or\n\n290\n00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:12.850\nwe don't have to leave it off forever,\nobviously.\n\n291\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.830\n>> You don't have to leave it off forever\n>> Really the reason why they want you\n\n292\n00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:23.090\nto have the firewall dropped for\nthis is because Metasploit does\n\n293\n00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:28.180\ninclude a bunch of built-in\nscanners of all different types.\n\n294\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:35.150\nAnd it also integrates with Endmap,\nbut it also has its own stuff built in\n\n295\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.860\nthat can do even more customized\nscans than, than NMap can do.\n\n296\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.830\nWhich is actually kinda cool if you\nthink about it like Metaploit or\n\n297\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.530\nNMap where it can do a lot,\nand here's Metasploit\n\n298\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.900\ncome along going let me just add to that\nwhole mess that you've got going on.\n\n299\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.820\nAnd so it has it's own and the thing\nis if you're doing port scans and\n\n300\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.999\ndifferent kinds of scans.\n\n301\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.620\nIt will cause some of those to fail if\nthose ports are blocked going out, so\n\n302\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.660\nthey're telling you to disable that.\n\n303\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.310\nAnd you could, if you want to,\n\n304\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.040\njust disable it while\nyou're running Metasploit.\n\n305\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.660\nIf you wanna get really creative you\ncould find some way to create a bunch of\n\n306\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.590\nexceptions in your firewall.\n\n307\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.620\nI tend to think that would probably be\na lot more trouble than it's worth.\n\n308\n00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.910\nBecause you'd spend quite a bit of\ntime doing something like that, but\n\n309\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.260\nthere's nothing saying it can't be done.\n\n310\n00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.250\nThere's probably,\nthere's always somebody out there.\n\n311\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.880\nOh it's not that big of a problem I\ncan create a script about this long.\n\n312\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.000\nWhatever I don't care, you can do\nit that way that's all I'm saying.\n\n313\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.170\nBut that's the primary reason,\nis that we have these scanners.\n\n314\n00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.790\nWe have these things\nthat have the ability,\n\n315\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.680\nlike I said,\nto implant something on another machine.\n\n316\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.350\nIf that machine phones home,\nif it can't connect to it\n\n317\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.180\nyour exploit may have been\nsuccessful getting onto a system.\n\n318\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.380\nBut getting back off, and\ncalling you back, it may be blocked.\n\n319\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.530\nIn which case you think it failed.\n\n320\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.970\nIt didn't really fail, per se, it just\ncouldn't establish a full connection.\n\n321\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.540\nYou got half of it done.\n\n322\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.850\nSo you might say,\nokay why didn't this launch?\n\n323\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.860\nOh, it launched,\nit just couldn't get back to you.\n\n324\n00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.650\nSo there's those little things, but\n\n325\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.760\nthose are just some basic\nthings you should be aware of.\n\n326\n00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.710\nThose are the really two big exceptions\nto this whole thing that you gotta make\n\n327\n00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.600\nsure that you are prepared for.\n\n328\n00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.380\nI would say probably if you're gonna have\nany problems with either one of them,\n\n329\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.630\nit's gonna be the former one, the\nantivirus stuff other than anything else.\n\n330\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.720\nBecause the firewall, easy to fix.\n\n331\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.720\nYou just drop the firewall\nif your stuff isn't working.\n\n332\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.710\nWith the antivirus stuff, if that runs and\nstarts destroying part of Metasploit.\n\n333\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.100\nYou can say well I'm gonna go and\npull those things out of quarantine and\n\n334\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.200\nrestore them.\n\n335\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.630\nYou've still effectively damaged\nMetasploit in some way shape or form.\n\n336\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.900\nSo rather than be relying on a tool\nthat might be kind of shaky,\n\n337\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.510\nyou're probably going to\nend up reinstalling it.\n\n338\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.010\nAnd then that requires if you've\ndone any customizations or\n\n339\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.400\ntweaks then you've gotta\ngo hunt those down.\n\n340\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.790\nDo all that stuff,\njust make a note of that, be aware of it.\n\n341\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.780\nAnd don't mess around,\njust make the exception for it and\n\n342\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.930\nbe safe and\nyou'll be good from there on out.\n\n343\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.190\n>> One of the great things about\nvirtualization technology is I can\n\n344\n00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.030\nset up my Metasploit box, I can have\nit installed on this virtual machine.\n\n345\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.860\n>> Like if I'm using my Kali install or\nif I've got a Windows virtual machine.\n\n346\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.200\nAnd maybe I don't even run antivirus\nsoftware on that little VM,\n\n347\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.690\nit doesn't ever connect to the outside, or\nit becomes my penetration testing machine.\n\n348\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.840\nSo I leave the firewall off maybe or\nsomething.\n\n349\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.070\nBut if you're gonna run\nit on your host machine.\n\n350\n00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.050\nIf you're on the machine that you use all\nthe time, just simply add an exception for\n\n351\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.880\nKali, disable your firewall\ntemporarily while you use it.\n\n352\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.400\nOr if you wanna make the big crazy script,\nlike Sean says,\n\n353\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.740\nyou can figure out what ports\nare needed and do it that way, so.\n\n354\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.610\nYeah.\n>> There's more than one way to do it if\n\n355\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.760\nyou want, but\njust remember those requirements.\n\n356\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.900\nThose are probably the big\nones out of anything with the,\n\n357\n00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.090\nthe updates and all that other stuff\njust means you won't get the latest and\n\n358\n00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.380\ngreatest of everything,\nbut it will still work.\n\n359\n00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.830\nbut if one of those things happen,\nfirewall or anti-virus,\n\n360\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:14.100\nit ain't working then that's where\na big problem starts right there.\n\n361\n00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.700\n>> That's no fun if it doesn't work.\n\n362\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.135\n>> Yeah, you don't want that and that will\nbe very frustrating, if you run into that.\n\n363\n00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.745\n>> All right, well we got\na bunch of different additions,\n\n364\n00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:23.345\nI guess we could call it.\n\n365\n00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:24.505\nWell, they're not really that many, right?\n\n366\n00:20:24.505 --> 00:20:26.185\nFour, but two primarily.\n\n367\n00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:29.575\nYou got the Pro version if you're gonna\nbe using this in a large corporate\n\n368\n00:20:29.575 --> 00:20:34.210\nenvironment, or if you're gonna be Making\nmoney with your services using Metasploit.\n\n369\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.830\nGet that community version for\neverybody else.\n\n370\n00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.510\nFor us, for practicing for students,\nfor small businesses things like that.\n\n371\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.300\nCompletely free,\nno licensing involved there.\n\n372\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.480\nAnd then installing it and you've got\nthe other two that we talked about,\n\n373\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.750\nthe Metasploit framework and\nthe developer's version.\n\n374\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.100\nAnd then as far installation goes,\npretty straight forward installation,\n\n375\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.610\nthe only thing you really gotta worry\nabout is making sure anti-virus\n\n376\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.380\ndoesn't break your installation.\n\n377\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.580\nBecause as it unpacks it's files,\n\n378\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.970\nthey are gonna trigger that\nanti-virus software most likely.\n\n379\n00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.370\nand it's gonna start Removing things, and\nthen your installation's not gonna work,\n\n380\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.030\nso disable that or make an exception for\n\n381\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.420\nthe folder that you're installing\nMetasploit into if you have to.\n\n382\n00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.220\nAnd then your firewall for all these tools\nto work, they're using dynamic ports and\n\n383\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.450\ndifferent port numbers to do different\njobs and put listeners on and\n\n384\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.840\nthings like that.\n\n385\n00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.450\nSo hard to keep track of all that, they'll\nrecommend you just turn off your firewall.\n\n386\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.310\nAgain, if it's your produc, if it's\na machine that you use all the time, maybe\n\n387\n00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.550\nyou turn it off temporarily, but that'll\nhelp all those other features function.\n\n388\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.370\nSo, a lot of good information.\n\n389\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.640\nNow we're gonna get it installed,\nand Sean, I'm excited,\n\n390\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.070\nwe're gonna start using Metasploit and\ndiving into it.\n\n391\n00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.910\nBut For now, anything else we wanna talk\nabout, as far as the different versions,\n\n392\n00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.150\nand what we need to run it?\n\n393\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.760\n>> Well,\nI don't think there's anything else,\n\n394\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.760\nreally, to talk about the versions and\nrunning it.\n\n395\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.650\nBut something I think would be worthwhile\nadding in the last few moments here is,\n\n396\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.780\nIs what should you have if you're\ngoing to follow along with this and\n\n397\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.280\ndo your testing with this.\n\n398\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.050\nWell for virtual machines, if you're gonna\ndo it that way or just machines period.\n\n399\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.900\nWe'll just leave it at that.\n\n400\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.370\nIf you're wanna virtualize them or\ndo physical stuff.\n\n401\n00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.460\nThat's your call but you will, if\n\n402\n00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.940\nyou're gonna do this you should consider\nhaving the Metasploitable virtual machine,\n\n403\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.740\nbecause it's a purposely vulnerable\nmachine that you can test against.\n\n404\n00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:28.010\nThen you also have the, you should also\nconsider getting a Windows machine.\n\n405\n00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:32.770\nIn fact, if you can get a copy of\nWindows XP with Service Pack 2,\n\n406\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.420\nyou're in good shape.\n\n407\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.630\ncuz a lot of the exploits that they have\nright out of the box are in there, and\n\n408\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.750\nthey're against XP with Service Pack 2.\n\n409\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.990\nDoesn't mean you have to use that, but\n\n410\n00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.920\nthat's one of the ones that there's quite\na few in there that you can test against.\n\n411\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.160\nAs far as other virtual\nmachines outside of that.\n\n412\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.640\nOr machines, period, outside of that.\n\n413\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.080\nThat's your call.\n\n414\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.530\nAnd you can have machines and\napplications.\n\n415\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.180\nBecause Metasploit doesn't just\ntest at the operating system level,\n\n416\n00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.680\nit can do the application level as well.\n\n417\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.930\nSo, you should have those core things.\n\n418\n00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:11.090\nYou should have your system\nthat has Metasploit on it.\n\n419\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.230\nYour Metasploitable system and\na Windows system.\n\n420\n00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.440\nXP Service pack 2 is a good one.\n\n421\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.190\nIt doesn't have to be that,\nbut that is a good one.\n\n422\n00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.250\nAnd then, up and\nabove beyond that, you know?\n\n423\n00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.310\nIf you're gonna be working on web apps,\n\n424\n00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.320\nhave one that possibly has\nthat web app installed.\n\n425\n00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.810\nIf you're gonna be working with databases,\nhave that database installed.\n\n426\n00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.960\nSo you can just bang away on it.\n\n427\n00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.080\nFor what we're doing here,\nfor my environment,\n\n428\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.210\nI have Kali running in a virtual machine,\n\n429\n00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.420\nI have XP Service Pack 3,\nactually running in a virtual machine and\n\n430\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.030\nI have Metasploitable out there\nrunning its virtual machine.\n\n431\n00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.800\nAnd, for kicks, I have Android\nrunning a virtual machine too.\n\n432\n00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.540\nI couldn't just leave well enough alone.\n\n433\n00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.770\nSo that's what I've got.\n\n434\n00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.779\n>> I like it, I like it.\n\n435\n00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:59.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well all right there you go ladies and\n\n436\n00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.720\ngentlemen get you sandbox set up so\nyou can play along with us as we explore\n\n437\n00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.612\nall the things that we can\nwith with good old Metasploit.\n\n438\n00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:10.430\nAll right well I tell you what,\nthat's going to do it for this episode so\n\n439\n00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.020\nmake sure you tune in next time for\nmore episodes on Metasploit.\n\n440\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.900\nBut for now signing for ITProTV I'm\nMike Roderick and I'm Sean Oriyano and\n\n441\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.264\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n442\n00:24:19.264 --> 00:24:25.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.120\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.930\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.980\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.770\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.370\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.820\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\n\n9\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510\nexcited to be here doing another\nepisode in our Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.400\nAnd this one, Sean, we're just gonna kind\nof get our feet wet, I think, right?\n\n11\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.290\nWe're gonna dive in and\n\n12\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.530\ntake a look at Metasploit a little bit and\nreally talk about some terminology and\n\n13\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.480\nthings, and get us set up for\nwhat's to come in the rest of the week.\n\n14\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.640\n>> Yeah, this is where we're gonna start,\nyeah really kinda setting the stage for\n\n15\n00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.550\ndifferent things that\nare gonna be popping up,\n\n16\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.430\nand terms are gonna be, they're gonna\nbe just floating around like crazy.\n\n17\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.490\nSo it's best just to get them out of\nthe way right up front, so everyone's on\n\n18\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.030\nthe same page and we're not getting\na lot of questions going, what was that?\n\n19\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.410\nWhat does that mean?\n\n20\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.850\nBecause there is definitely a lot of\nlittle terminologies and things like that\n\n21\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.811\nthat we need to be aware of, so expect\nwhat you hear now to be used quite a bit.\n\n22\n00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.293\n[LAUGH] A whole heck of a lot.\n\n23\n00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:08.850\n>> All right, so\nwhere do we even start, Sean?\n\n24\n00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510\nI guess first we do is\nfire up Metasploit maybe?\n\n25\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.360\n>> Yeah, the way we can fire up Metasploit\nis it's actually quite simple to do.\n\n26\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.030\nI have it here on my screen.\n\n27\n00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.760\nSo what I've done in Kali is I have\njust gone ahead and opened up a console.\n\n28\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.390\nAll you need to do.\n\n29\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.403\nOpen up a console, and\nthen you can just type MSF console.\n\n30\n00:01:35.403 --> 00:01:39.730\nAnd just go ahead and open that up.\n\n31\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.840\nAnd this is gonna be the main interface\nthat you are going to be using.\n\n32\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.080\nAnd it will take, don't expect it just\nto all of a sudden, just, you know,\n\n33\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.890\ncome right up immediately.\n\n34\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.790\nIt is gonna take a moment or\ntwo to get everything all loaded.\n\n35\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320\nAnd you can see that mine is starting up.\n\n36\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.350\nYou can see the little stuff,\nwhirring and all of that.\n\n37\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.750\nIt's going to take a moment.\n\n38\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.030\nOnce it does that,\nit will go ahead and go poof and\n\n39\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.710\nwe've got this stuff loaded into here and\nyou get some basic information about it,\n\n40\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.420\nyou'll get some little\nASCI graphic type stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.110\n>> You gotta have that.\n\n42\n00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.520\nWhat's a tool without a little\nASCII logo graphics there.\n\n43\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.331\n>> Yeah, Missile Command, look at that.\n\n44\n00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.608\n[LAUGH] What's a day without\nMissile Command, right?\n\n45\n00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:31.221\nBut anyway.\n\n46\n00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:36.830\nSo we have our Metasploit\nenvironment loaded and\n\n47\n00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.360\nyou can see we have a little\nMSF as the command prompt.\n\n48\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.180\nSo that is going to\nindicate right to you that\n\n49\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660\nyou have the Metasploit framework loaded.\n\n50\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.560\nSo, everything should be good, and once\nwe've got to this point we are ready to\n\n51\n00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.710\nkinda start poking around the environment.\n\n52\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.630\nAnd so you can see by the way like we\nwere saying, command line, no frills.\n\n53\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.340\nIt's like, that's what you get and\nyou're gonna like it.\n\n54\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.000\nThat's what you're gonna get right there.\n\n55\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.760\nSo, that being said,\nwe should start talking about\n\n56\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.120\nsome terminology and then go through the\ninterface and talk about what that means.\n\n57\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.310\nSo you should be going ahead,\nif you're following along,\n\n58\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.710\nand starting to get this up and running.\n\n59\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.380\nI will tell you by the way\nthat some of this stuff,\n\n60\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.510\nI just really get out of the way up front.\n\n61\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.020\nSometimes when you load Metasploit just\nfrom scratch you've done nothing wrong\n\n62\n00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.880\nat all, it will still glitch and\nget little errors now and then.\n\n63\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.070\nOn the first time it runs be prepared for\nthat.\n\n64\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.520\nAnd all you gotta do is\njust Google the error.\n\n65\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.380\nUsually it's something simple,\nas they'll tell you.\n\n66\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.150\nJust run this command and start and stop\nthis and it will go ahead and clear it up.\n\n67\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.390\nThere's little things that they're kind of\nannoyances that have been there instead of\n\n68\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.500\nactually patching it or fixing it alike,\njust reboot it [LAUGH] or\n\n69\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.980\ndo something like that.\n\n70\n00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.650\nBut just so you know.\n\n71\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.040\nAnyway, so that's our environment, you\ncan see some basic information about it.\n\n72\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.520\nBut yeah, let's talk about some\nof these terms that are gonna be\n\n73\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.720\ncoming up during the week.\n\n74\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.880\nSo first term I think I got\nin the list here is exploits.\n\n75\n00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.470\nAn exploit is something that could\nbe used to take advantage of\n\n76\n00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.240\nsome sort of a defect or problem,\nor hole, whatever, in the system.\n\n77\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.400\nAnd there's a lot of exploits\nthat actually come with Kali,\n\n78\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.020\nor sorry,\nwith Metasploit right out of the box.\n\n79\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.330\nIn fact, you can look right here\non this opening screen here,\n\n80\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.520\nyou can see it has 14,\n112 exploits, and 802 auxiliaries.\n\n81\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.530\nThe auxiliaries, so they have some extra\nones are kinda like third party and\n\n82\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.830\nother stuff in there.\n\n83\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.310\nSo you can go with that, but\nif you want more information on it,\n\n84\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.360\nthis is just to kind of get you\nfamiliar with the commands.\n\n85\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.200\nIt's just as simple as doing\nshow exploits like that.\n\n86\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.760\nAnd you hit enter, and\nit will take a moment.\n\n87\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.270\nIt's gonna enumerate\nwhat's in the library.\n\n88\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.480\nAnd then it should go ahead and\nspit stuff back.\n\n89\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.270\nBy the way, I'll tell you, if some of\nthese commands take a little too long, in\n\n90\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.000\nyour opinion, it's subjective, to execute,\nsometimes that's completely normal.\n\n91\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.970\nOther times you may just need to\nshut down the virtual machine and\n\n92\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.500\nallocate more memory to it,\nthat is, if you're virtualizing it.\n\n93\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.480\nOf course, if you're not in a virtual\nenvironment, different story.\n\n94\n00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.620\nOkay, so what bind did here\nis it enumerated all those\n\n95\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.830\nexploits that are present in the system.\n\n96\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.600\nAnd you can see it's got a lot of them.\n\n97\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.360\nIt said 1,400 of them, so\nI'm scrolling through this big long list.\n\n98\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.530\nYou can see they've got it for everything.\n\n99\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.540\nI think I saw Novelle One in there,\nif you have Novelle.\n\n100\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.806\nIf you run that one,\nit tells you to get rid of Novelle.\n\n101\n00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's really simple.\n\n102\n00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.100\nIn any case, you see that it's got it for\n\n103\n00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.580\nso many different things when\nyou really get down to it.\n\n104\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.260\nIt's got exploits for everything,\nI mean, NetGear, some stuff for\n\n105\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.510\nPandora, PineApp, LinkSys.\n\n106\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.010\nYou just keep going and\ngoing and going and going.\n\n107\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.430\nThere's a lot of stuff,\nyou see where I ran the command.\n\n108\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.900\nIt just keeps going.\n\n109\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.470\nAnd even look, by the way, down here\ntowards the bottom, just in case you're\n\n110\n00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.550\nnot noticing it, right there,\nSamsung Galaxy and then it has Android.\n\n111\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.120\nSo tells you type of stuff this\nthing is able to test for.\n\n112\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.700\nIt actually has a pretty broad\namount of capabilities here.\n\n113\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.450\nJust like I was saying in our intro and\nI've been saying all along,\n\n114\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.450\nit's got a lot of\ncapabilities in this product.\n\n115\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.970\nSo I'm looking at the exploit and right\nhere, just with a cursory look of it,\n\n116\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.640\nI'm seeing Android sitting right out\nthere, so I know I can test for that.\n\n117\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.300\nAnd so that could, so\nif you're an android developer,\n\n118\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.140\nsomeone that needs to assess\nthose products well there you go.\n\n119\n00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.330\nYou have an exploit, you have exploits\nbuilt in and you can make your own.\n\n120\n00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.010\nYou can make any one of these exploits,\nany exploit you want.\n\n121\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.240\nI mean, you gotta have knowledge of how\nall the mechanics and everything of it,\n\n122\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.740\nbut that goes without saying.\n\n123\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.750\nIt's just, you can develop it,\nstick it in here, and boom, use it.\n\n124\n00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.280\nI mean, just really, really,\nreally awesome amount of stuff.\n\n125\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.960\n>> [LAUGH] We've got people in chat room\nsaying they've got some Novelle servers.\n\n126\n00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.095\nI'm sure David would share if we need\nto test any Novell for vulnerabilities.\n\n127\n00:07:54.095 --> 00:07:57.611\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just wanna go ha-ha!\n\n128\n00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because they're stored away, so\n\n129\n00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.845\nwe can't test against those.\n\n130\n00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:02.691\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just a ton of\n\n131\n00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:07.083\nexploits built in there and the ability to\ntest just about anything, and As you said,\n\n132\n00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:11.171\nit's all expandable as well, so they're\ngonna add new exploits all the time,\n\n133\n00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:13.080\nanother reason to keep it up to date.\n\n134\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.562\n>> Yeah, it really, really is.\n\n135\n00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.814\nI'm just kind of, and I don't know if\nyou guys are taking the time to do this,\n\n136\n00:08:19.814 --> 00:08:22.135\nif you're running this or\nfollowing along with this.\n\n137\n00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:27.099\nIt's kind of an interesting thing to look\nat, when you talk about exploits, and\n\n138\n00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.070\nyou talk about what they can do.\n\n139\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.820\nIt's one thing to say oh,\n\n140\n00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.890\nwell it takes advantage of\nsomething on the system, but if\n\n141\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.610\nyou start flipping though it that is what\nI've got going up on my screen right now.\n\n142\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.370\nI'm kind of flipping through\nsome of these things and\n\n143\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.250\nI see a lot of different\ninteresting ones stuff with sort.\n\n144\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.540\nThere's Novel, there's HP Open View,\nthere's stuff with Apache,\n\n145\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.520\nTom Cat, IS was in there,\nyou've got Adobe stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.634\nAdobe stuff has defects?\n\n147\n00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:57.198\nI didn't, whoa.\n\n148\n00:08:57.198 --> 00:08:58.324\nI gotta sit down.\n\n149\n00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:01.958\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna get a call.\n\n150\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.945\n>> Yeah, D-link and\nI'm seeing Netgear and Linxus and\n\n151\n00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.143\nthere's about anything you can think of.\n\n152\n00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:10.245\n>> Yep.\n\n153\n00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:13.055\nYep, I mean heck I'm on I've got\nWireshark popping up in there,\n\n154\n00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:16.997\nit's got some stuff specifically\nto check Wireshark.\n\n155\n00:09:16.997 --> 00:09:19.137\nThere's just a lot of them.\n\n156\n00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:21.257\nThere's a Firefox one.\n\n157\n00:09:21.257 --> 00:09:22.977\nMac OS stuff.\n\n158\n00:09:22.977 --> 00:09:27.257\nYou can test stuff against\nMac OS if you happen to have it.\n\n159\n00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:28.787\nThere's a Safari browser in there.\n\n160\n00:09:28.787 --> 00:09:31.617\nI mean so we're just going Solaris.\n\n161\n00:09:31.617 --> 00:09:36.260\nI mean you just keep going on and\non and on and on with this.\n\n162\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.882\nWe're not gonna we're\ndefinitely not gonna do that.\n\n163\n00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:39.637\nGo through every last one of them.\n\n164\n00:09:39.637 --> 00:09:41.709\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean it's impossible to go through\n\n165\n00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:42.430\nall of them in here.\n\n166\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.680\nBut there's so many of them.\n\n167\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.780\nJust right out of the box that\nyou could do that is just,\n\n168\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.370\nit's just fascinating when\nyou really get down to it.\n\n169\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:59.170\nThere's WordPress, so if you need to test,\nyou've got the stuff.\n\n170\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.690\nNow here's where it kinda gets really mind\n\n171\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.220\nnumbing is when you go through\nthis list of exploits in here.\n\n172\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.286\nKeep in mind, everyone of these exploits\nhas a set of options underneath\n\n173\n00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:17.112\nit as well so they have different\nthings you can configure within it.\n\n174\n00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:23.613\nDon't worry, you don't have to memorize\nthose, or have any documentation for it.\n\n175\n00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:27.467\nEach one has it's own little\nmenu that you can bring up,\n\n176\n00:10:27.467 --> 00:10:30.509\nit's basically a help\nsystem is what it is.\n\n177\n00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:33.200\nAnd it tells you what\nyou can drop in there.\n\n178\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.790\nAnd it will tell you what the current\nconfiguration of that is, and\n\n179\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.900\nwhat you can change and how to change it.\n\n180\n00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.301\nSo, in some senses it kinda tries\nto hold your hand and say, these\n\n181\n00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:47.442\nare the things that you can do or need\nto do to make this thing work correctly.\n\n182\n00:10:47.442 --> 00:10:50.440\nBut something also really cool about it is\n\n183\n00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.303\na lot of the options\nare actually pretty consistent.\n\n184\n00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:55.881\nI mean there is stuff that you see,\n\n185\n00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:59.662\nthere's ones you're gonna see in\nhere called RHOSTS and LHOSTS.\n\n186\n00:10:59.662 --> 00:11:02.722\nThose are common in a lot of the exploits.\n\n187\n00:11:02.722 --> 00:11:06.462\nIt's the exact same option so they kind of\nstandardize across which is a nice thing\n\n188\n00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:09.962\nthat somebody decided I'm gonna call\nit something else just because I can.\n\n189\n00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:12.470\nNope, they standardized it.\n\n190\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.640\nSo we really like that.\n\n191\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.840\nSo like I said, just browse through it.\n\n192\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.550\nYou will see that there are even stuff\nin here that take advantage of certain\n\n193\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.880\nMicrosoft knowledge base articles, to test\nfor it, to see if you have that problem.\n\n194\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.992\nIt can test against those.\n\n195\n00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:34.360\nI mean there are some up here on my\nscreen right now that have knowledge base\n\n196\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.810\narticles, MS0655 and MS57, and\nyou just keep going right on through.\n\n197\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:46.841\nSo they've got you covered on\na lot of different fronts.\n\n198\n00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:50.533\nSo I just saw RealNetworks in there.\n\n199\n00:11:50.533 --> 00:11:51.276\n>> Oh yeah?\n\n200\n00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:54.853\n[LAUGH]\n>> Again, if you run that one,\n\n201\n00:11:54.853 --> 00:11:56.883\nit says uninstall it.\n\n202\n00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.579\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm getting ITPro in so\n\n203\n00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:02.073\nmuch trouble right now.\n\n204\n00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:04.499\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah maybe a few calls to deal with.\n\n205\n00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:08.786\n[LAUGH]\n>> But anyway, I mean yeah,\n\n206\n00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:13.855\nthe other thing interesting about this is,\nyeah I'm joking about the Adobe and\n\n207\n00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:18.850\nthe RealNetwork stuff, It's also kind\nof interesting to look in here because\n\n208\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.164\nyou see stuff that you may not have\neven thought about testing for and\n\n209\n00:12:23.164 --> 00:12:27.478\nI went through this and the first\ntime I was browsing through this and\n\n210\n00:12:27.478 --> 00:12:30.160\nit was like wow that's a lot of software.\n\n211\n00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.822\nThen I saw stuff popping up in here and\n\n212\n00:12:31.822 --> 00:12:36.220\nit's like I wouldn't expect that to\nmake an appearance as a plug-in or\n\n213\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.760\nthat to make an appearance so\nyou're seeing just a lot of things.\n\n214\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.670\nIf anything, this teaches you that\nevery piece of software has defects and\n\n215\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:51.830\nif you don't get used to that you're gonna\nhave to become used to it very quickly.\n\n216\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.526\nSo pretty good stuff.\n\n217\n00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:59.290\nSo, that's what that is, so\nthat's the show exploits command,\n\n218\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.580\nit will show everything that you've got\n\n219\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.880\nloaded in that product,\nas an exploit at that point in time.\n\n220\n00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.677\nAnd FYI, you do not have to just\ngo ahead and view it that way.\n\n221\n00:13:13.677 --> 00:13:17.491\nI just typed show exploits, and\nit just puked all this stuff up on screen,\n\n222\n00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:19.041\nand said, hey, here you go.\n\n223\n00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:23.973\nThere are ways, that we'll get into later\non, that you can actually filter that so\n\n224\n00:13:23.973 --> 00:13:28.340\nit looks for specific ones,\nit doesn't just show you everything.\n\n225\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.460\nYou can already kind of\nsee the key to doing that.\n\n226\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.744\nIf you look, you'll see on most of these\nthings, like towards the bottom there,\n\n227\n00:13:36.744 --> 00:13:40.090\nyou'll see windows/wins/,\nit's got stuff after it.\n\n228\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.550\nYou'll notice that there's basically\nwhat looks like a folder structure.\n\n229\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.950\nYou can tell it to show\nexploits at a certain location.\n\n230\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.080\nAnd that way it will just build,\nnarrow it down.\n\n231\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.500\nIf you're ever testing it against Novell,\nThe Reel or Adobe or\n\n232\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.580\nwhatever, I don't wanna see that.\n\n233\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.970\nMaybe I'm not testing it right now.\n\n234\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.760\nI don't wanna see that.\n\n235\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.400\nJust drop it off, I'll look at it\nlater if I have to test against those.\n\n236\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.370\nIt's irrelevant.\n\n237\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.600\nSo they've already got\nyou covered on that.\n\n238\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.060\n>> Nice.\n>> But we're not gonna worry about that\n\n239\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.610\nright now at this point in time.\n\n240\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.998\nBut that's just so you're going, oh,\n\n241\n00:14:09.998 --> 00:14:12.820\nI'm not gonna have to do that every time,\nam I?\n\n242\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.494\nNo you're not.\n\n243\n00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:17.415\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, okay, just relax.\n\n244\n00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:18.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> That was a close one.\n\n245\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.080\nI was like, it was a long list to\ntry to parse through looking for\n\n246\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.215\na particular exploit.\n\n247\n00:14:22.215 --> 00:14:23.661\n>> Yeah.\n\n248\n00:14:23.661 --> 00:14:26.881\nIt definitely would be and\nnot something that I would wanna do,\n\n249\n00:14:26.881 --> 00:14:30.951\nI would definitely not ask anybody to do\nthat or expect them to do that because you\n\n250\n00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:34.201\ntell someone to look through\nthe list that way if you hate them.\n\n251\n00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:35.096\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n252\n00:14:35.096 --> 00:14:37.022\n>> That's what you do.\n\n253\n00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:40.567\n[LAUGH] So that's the show,\nwhat an exploit is, and\n\n254\n00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:44.453\nthat show exploits is to give\nyou an idea in the console.\n\n255\n00:14:44.453 --> 00:14:47.320\nBut we've got more terminology, of course.\n\n256\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.236\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> That's not the end of it.\n\n257\n00:14:49.236 --> 00:14:49.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n258\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.529\nlet's talk about some other terminology,\nand\n\n259\n00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:58.675\nthen we'll go back over here to\nMetasploit and take a look at that.\n\n260\n00:14:58.675 --> 00:14:59.301\n>> Okay.\n\n261\n00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:04.294\n>> So the next one I've got\non this list is a payload.\n\n262\n00:15:04.294 --> 00:15:09.854\nA payload is, think of a payload\nas what you're delivering.\n\n263\n00:15:09.854 --> 00:15:10.656\nHence the term payload.\n\n264\n00:15:10.656 --> 00:15:11.421\nRight?\n\n265\n00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:16.450\nIt's what you're delivering\nto an actual system.\n\n266\n00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.920\nWhat you can deliver?\n\n267\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.510\nIt's kind of unlimited really\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n268\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:26.130\nIt could be stuff that opens it up\nto system up to remote execution.\n\n269\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:34.250\nIt could be something that causes the\nsystem to carry out a specific function.\n\n270\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.070\nAnd then there's even capabilities and\nwe won't be getting to these\n\n271\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.690\nfor a little bit, but we will get to it.\n\n272\n00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.670\nYou can actually deliver payloads that\nwill tell that system to call you back.\n\n273\n00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.583\nAnd when it calls you back and\ncontacts you, it makes that confirmation,\n\n274\n00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:58.273\nit will actually open up a shell which\nyou can pipe commands back to it.\n\n275\n00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:03.025\nSo yeah, that's kind of a powerful\nas well as a scary level of\n\n276\n00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:07.143\ncapability [LAUGH] that\nyou're talking there, so.\n\n277\n00:16:07.143 --> 00:16:09.848\nThat's what a payload is,\nit's something you deliver.\n\n278\n00:16:09.848 --> 00:16:13.020\nWhat you deliver,\nlike said, a lot of stuff.\n\n279\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.510\nIt's just like saying,\nwhat can UPS deliver?\n\n280\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.385\nThey can deliver a lot.\n\n281\n00:16:16.385 --> 00:16:19.300\n>> [LAUGH] The choice is yours, huh?\n\n282\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.630\n>> Yeah, tell me what you're delivering,\nand I'll say yes or no.\n\n283\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.210\nLet's just make this easy.\n\n284\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.270\nSo that's kind of what\nwe have going on here.\n\n285\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.780\nNow, when we wanna see what\npayloads we have available, so\n\n286\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.560\nI can go back into Kali and\ninto Metasploit itself.\n\n287\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.640\nAnd I can say, I wanna see what payloads\nare actually available for use.\n\n288\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.140\nWell you probably can figure this one out.\n\n289\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.890\nIs it just doing show payloads.\n\n290\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.340\nAnd it takes some time,\nand what does it do?\n\n291\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.880\nIt shows you, here's the type of\nstuff that you can actually deliver.\n\n292\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.447\nI mean, in yeah.\n\n293\n00:16:57.447 --> 00:16:58.350\nThere.\n\n294\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.860\n>> Wow.\n>> I mean, look at that.\n\n295\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.400\nWell, that's our beginning of it.\n\n296\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.200\nBut you go through this, and\nyou can see, there's a lot of stuff.\n\n297\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.270\nThere's Windows stuff.\n\n298\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.320\nWindows 64 VNC server.\n\n299\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.190\nThere's stuff with,\nsome more stuff with Windows.\n\n300\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.960\nStuff that can allow you to execute stuff.\n\n301\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.490\nCommand shell ones.\n\n302\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.170\nSo different areas of Windows.\n\n303\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.360\nLike most major piece of\nsoftware are gonna have a lot,\n\n304\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.160\nWindows just has had a lot of time focused\non it, so that's why it has quite a bit.\n\n305\n00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.550\nBut you can see this here DLL injection.\n\n306\n00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.010\nIt's got those, so\nwhere we've got some pretty serious\n\n307\n00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.960\npower loaded into this environment\nright from the get go.\n\n308\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.390\nI mean just really, really, really neat.\n\n309\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:54.390\nAnd we'll be using a few of\nthese throughout this course.\n\n310\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.480\nWe haven't got to that yet\nbut we will be doing it.\n\n311\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.620\nFirst we've got to learn.\n\n312\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.540\nYou know, see what's there and\nlearn what it is.\n\n313\n00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.230\nThen we'll take a basic one and\nkind of just go through it and\n\n314\n00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.440\nsee what it looks like\nto to actually use one.\n\n315\n00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.110\nAnd then we can go on from there.\n\n316\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.720\nOnce you've learned how to use\nan exploit in the payload.\n\n317\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.950\nOnce you've learned the format for it and\n\n318\n00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.340\nhow to run the thing,\nyou can pretty much run any of them.\n\n319\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.276\nIt's just a matter of looking at\nthe options figuring the options and\n\n320\n00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:24.854\ngo right on.\n\n321\n00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.870\nSo that's a pretty cool thing.\n\n322\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.440\nBut yeah, so I just was scrolling through\n\n323\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.090\nsome of this stuff just to\ngive you an idea of the stuff.\n\n324\n00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.500\nI just went past the Mac OS,\n\n325\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.090\nthere's some Linux stuff, and\nthen just some other things we have.\n\n326\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.540\nUnix, there's Unix making\nan appearance for, really,\n\n327\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.270\nthe first time in here,\nthere's another Android one.\n\n328\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.570\nSo we really got it covered.\n\n329\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.760\nAIX, if you need it.\n\n330\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.952\nSo, some really good stuff.\n\n331\n00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:58.662\nSo those are all things that,\nright out of the box,\n\n332\n00:18:58.662 --> 00:19:01.264\nyou can deliver to a remote system.\n\n333\n00:19:01.264 --> 00:19:05.547\nYou can just target the system and\nsay boom I'm gonna go right out there and\n\n334\n00:19:05.547 --> 00:19:09.831\ndrop it off on there and go ahead and\nwhatever it's configured to do it will\n\n335\n00:19:09.831 --> 00:19:12.550\npresumably carry that\nout once it gets there.\n\n336\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.430\nOnce it's delivered.\n\n337\n00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.940\nBy its delivery mechanism to that box.\n\n338\n00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.380\nIt should just go ahead and\n\n339\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.647\ncarry out whatever you wanted it to if\nyou've configured it right of course.\n\n340\n00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:27.605\nAnd if the deficiency that it takes\nadvantage of is present there,\n\n341\n00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:33.722\nit should go ahead and take advantage of\nit and just do whatever it's supposed to.\n\n342\n00:19:33.722 --> 00:19:39.878\nSo that's kind of a really cool thing but\nyou can see we've seen a lot of stuff so\n\n343\n00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:45.400\nfar both with exploits and\nwith payloads and those guys fit together.\n\n344\n00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.360\nYou can imagine how many different\ncombinations you can make within reason.\n\n345\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.120\nThere's gonna be some limitations\non combinations of those two but\n\n346\n00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.140\nthat's still a lot of stuff I can do.\n\n347\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.100\nAnd we're not even talking\nthird party stuff.\n\n348\n00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.480\nYou wanna go third party stuff?\n\n349\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:06.500\nThis gets really nasty as far\nas how many are in there,\n\n350\n00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.620\nthat's where knowing those filtering\ncommands really come in handy.\n\n351\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.470\nSo but anyway, those are those two.\n\n352\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.540\nThat's our exploits and\nthat's our payloads,\n\n353\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.690\ntwo really important items to making\nthis thing to making this thing work.\n\n354\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.340\nSo make sure you know\nwhat those terms are,\n\n355\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:29.590\nbecause those are gonna be used,\njust plastered all over the place.\n\n356\n00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.070\nThen some other terms,\njust to quickly talk about.\n\n357\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.300\nWe've got shell code.\n\n358\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:44.030\nShell code will be code that you can\nrun or execute on a remote system.\n\n359\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.640\nAnd that's about as far\nas we'll get right now,\n\n360\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.100\nbecause there are some little nuances\nin it that just have to be discussed\n\n361\n00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.390\ninstead of me just going through and\nthrowing it at you right now.\n\n362\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.566\nI'll just leave it at that.\n\n363\n00:20:56.566 --> 00:20:59.200\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Cuz you'll hear that term.\n\n364\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.590\nThen we have modules.\n\n365\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.280\nModules are just little components that\nyou can add into the product that do\n\n366\n00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.540\ndifferent things There's a whole slew\nof those that we have waiting for\n\n367\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.800\nus in the wings,\n\n368\n00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.500\nboth with Metasploit out of the box\nplus ones that you can get third party.\n\n369\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.341\nAnd keep in mind, by the way,\nthis is one of the areas modules, and\n\n370\n00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:24.935\nsome of the exploits and payloads, as\na matter of fact, there are some ones that\n\n371\n00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:29.800\ncome only with the pro version, and\ndon't come with the community edition.\n\n372\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:36.990\nBut those are usually pretty specific,\nand you may not need those, so, just FYI.\n\n373\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.270\nI never said there wasn't differences.\n\n374\n00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.470\nI just said, I'm not,\nI just told you they were, and\n\n375\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.850\nnow I'm just gonna say if there's a\ndifferent set between the versions that's\n\n376\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.850\nrelevant to talk about at that\npoint in time, I'll bring it up.\n\n377\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.100\nThis is one of those times, and\nthat is different between those versions.\n\n378\n00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.755\n>> And if theres a module that you really\nwanted to play with that didn't come in\n\n379\n00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:58.905\nthe community version, you could get\nthe trial version of the pro, right?\n\n380\n00:21:58.905 --> 00:22:01.135\nCuz they do offer like a-\n>> It's a 14 day trial.\n\n381\n00:22:01.135 --> 00:22:04.429\n>> A 14 day trial there, so yeah,\nyou could always go get that and\n\n382\n00:22:04.429 --> 00:22:08.212\nsee if the module is something that you\nwanted or did what you needed to do.\n\n383\n00:22:08.212 --> 00:22:11.880\nBefore you forked out the dough for\nupgrading to that pro version.\n\n384\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.460\n>> Yeah, that's definitely not a bad idea.\n\n385\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.970\nI don't even know, I haven't looked\nrecently what the pro version costs, so\n\n386\n00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.660\nI don't even know.\n\n387\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.988\nI know it's probably in four digits\nsomeplace, just don't know where.\n\n388\n00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:25.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay so you've got those,\n\n389\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:31.210\nyou got the shell code, the module and\nthen you have a listener.\n\n390\n00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.200\nAnd a listener, well, come on.\n\n391\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.680\nThe name really sums up\nthe whole concept right there.\n\n392\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.000\nA listener is something that\nis gonna be started up and\n\n393\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.140\nrunning on the metasploit system and it's\ngonna be waiting for incoming connections.\n\n394\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.950\nSo, if you had fired off\nsomething to another system and\n\n395\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.130\ndropped that payload off and it ran and\n\n396\n00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.360\nit was gonna do a reverse shell to you,\nThen what would happen is that,\n\n397\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.070\nwhen it called you up, this listener\nwould pick up that signal, and\n\n398\n00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:04.010\nit would complete the connection and allow\nthat shell to be displayed on your box.\n\n399\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.900\nSo that would be the significance of that.\n\n400\n00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.400\nThat's also why, by the way, at those\nlisteners, if you're not careful and\n\n401\n00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.640\nyou leave the firewall running, that's\none of the things it could be blocking.\n\n402\n00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.340\nIf a listener can't see that incoming\nconnection, nothing's happening.\n\n403\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.860\nIt's just effectively blinded.\n\n404\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.750\nTherefore, your exploit, if it's waiting\nfor that reverse shell in our example to\n\n405\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:29.400\ncome your way, it will never see it,\nand that's the end of the story.\n\n406\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.370\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n407\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.960\nwe really want to make sure\nthat we are aware of that.\n\n408\n00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.860\nSo that's just some basic terminology.\n\n409\n00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.690\nReally count on seeing exploits and\npayloads, exploits and\n\n410\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.610\npayloads just used all over the place.\n\n411\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.280\nIt's a very very common term when\nyou're talking about the stuff.\n\n412\n00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.110\nThose are the things that people develop.\n\n413\n00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.460\nThose are things that get updated and\n\n414\n00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.940\nget put out there in\nthe wild from time to time.\n\n415\n00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.756\nSo you can even get payloads and exploits.\n\n416\n00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:08.095\nYou can get them off different people's\nwebsites that have done different white\n\n417\n00:24:08.095 --> 00:24:10.594\nhats that have done testing and\nfound things.\n\n418\n00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:12.161\nAnd use this product.\n\n419\n00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:15.570\nThey make those available so\nyou could maybe even drop them in yours.\n\n420\n00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.230\nIt's not unheard of.\n\n421\n00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.380\n>> So exploits then are gonna be\nthings that can be taken advantage of\n\n422\n00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.620\nvulnerabilities or test vulnerabilities\nand then payloads something I can deliver.\n\n423\n00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.910\nSomething I could submit and\nthen we've got out shell code,\n\n424\n00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.890\nwe've got our listeners, and\nwe've got our models to build.\n\n425\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.100\n>> Yeah those are our big terms for\nright now.\n\n426\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:40.630\nYes, there are other terms that are kind\nof just hiding around the bend for us.\n\n427\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.290\nNo product in the history of ever has\never just said well oh, we've got what?\n\n428\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.736\nYeah, we've got five terms, you're good,\nokay good let's go ahead and\n\n429\n00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:50.950\nget some stuff done.\n\n430\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.530\nWe have more terms but\nI'm not gonna sit here and\n\n431\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.680\njust run over a bunch of definitions and\nterminology, that's not the time for it.\n\n432\n00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.690\nWhen we get to the point where we need to\nadd a new term, we'll define it then but\n\n433\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.345\nthese are the terms you gotta\nhave really cut outta the gate,\n\n434\n00:25:07.345 --> 00:25:08.839\nbecause those ones\nreally start popping up.\n\n435\n00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:12.650\nRight when we start digging into stuff.\n\n436\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.310\nSo, anyway, you saw, yeah,\nthe five different terms.\n\n437\n00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:22.310\nYou also saw your first peek\nIn here at the Metasploit\n\n438\n00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.610\nenvironment, and notice the way\nthe syntax of the commands work.\n\n439\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:31.680\nWe had show and then space and\nthen the next command.\n\n440\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.690\nThe format of commands, it's really,\nit's not a crazy thing.\n\n441\n00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.030\nIt's something that you can\nlook at in other products and\n\n442\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.020\nsee the exact same type of format.\n\n443\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.980\nI point that out just because I kinda\nwanna, as we're going through this,\n\n444\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.044\nI wanna demystify as much as\nI can what Metasploit is.\n\n445\n00:25:53.725 --> 00:25:55.425\nPeople do have kind of a fear and\n\n446\n00:25:55.425 --> 00:25:58.215\nget kind of intimidated because\nit is all command line.\n\n447\n00:25:58.215 --> 00:26:00.695\nWhen they have used\ncommand line other places,\n\n448\n00:26:00.695 --> 00:26:04.005\nlet's kind of demystify it a bit and say,\nyeah, these things you can recognize.\n\n449\n00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:08.945\nThese things are consistent across certain\nmodules and certain areas, so it's not,\n\n450\n00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:12.769\ndon't get that level of anxiety\nthat you may have had in the past.\n\n451\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.050\nJust, look, it's relatively easy.\n\n452\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.280\nWe ramp it up but it's still pretty easy.\n\n453\n00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.620\n>> I feel cool, calm,\nand collected right now,\n\n454\n00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.140\njust from listening to what you said so\nfar.\n\n455\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.420\nSo I'm ready to dive in there.\n\n456\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.540\nAll right, so Sean,\nI think that's going to do it for\n\n457\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.080\ntime on this particular episode,\nanything else we want to toss in?\n\n458\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.392\nWe covered a bunch of good terms,\nsaw our first look at Metasploit,\n\n459\n00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:37.670\nran a couple commands just to get a list\nof all those exploits and payloads.\n\n460\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.866\nNow they're available\nthrough our interface there.\n\n461\n00:26:39.866 --> 00:26:46.360\n>> Yeah, you heard some of the basics,\nyou saw how they worked.\n\n462\n00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.760\nAnd you should've noticed, we don't know\nwho was using Using Windows out here,\n\n463\n00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.320\nand who isn't.\n\n464\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.270\nYou should've noticed, in Windows, that\nyou can open up the console in there and\n\n465\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.780\ndo the same thing now.\n\n466\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.090\nI will tell you on Windows, by the way,\n\n467\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.665\nthat while KLEE we can open up just\na console on the menu and type it in.\n\n468\n00:27:05.665 --> 00:27:08.956\nWindows, you are probably gonna have\nto go through the menu no matter what\n\n469\n00:27:08.956 --> 00:27:10.295\nversion you have of Windows.\n\n470\n00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:14.525\nGo through the menu, and\nactually grab the Metasploit console.\n\n471\n00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:16.515\nIf you don't it won't load in the stuff.\n\n472\n00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:19.515\nIt's kinda like,\nif you've used PowerShell,\n\n473\n00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:23.570\nif you don't load the PowerShell console\nit just won't run the regular one.\n\n474\n00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.650\nPowerShell Is just not\ngonna recognize you.\n\n475\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.500\nIt's the same deal.\n\n476\n00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.620\nYou're gonna have to go through the\nMetasploit console, to make sure it works.\n\n477\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.150\nSo, be aware of that gotcha.\n\n478\n00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.560\nSo, with that being said.\n\n479\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.190\nYou know, everything else should be fine.\n\n480\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.150\n>> Fantastic.\n\n481\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.870\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n482\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.190\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n483\n00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.210\n>> And I'm Sean Oreano.\n\n484\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.095\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:54.250\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.460\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.390\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.048\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\nHow you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:19.862\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:25.535\nAnother exciting episode here at ITProTV,\ncovering our Metasploit and in this one,\n\n8\n00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:30.730\nSean, we've taken a look at, we kinda\ngot our feet wet in a previous episode,\n\n9\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.130\ntook our first look at Metasploit.\n\n10\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.950\nNow we wanna get in there and\nkind of take a closer look at it, and\n\n11\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.170\nlearn our way around?\n\n12\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.210\n>> Yeah, that's what we wanna do.\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.600\nWe really wanna get in and\nstart seeing just how the product's used.\n\n14\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.320\nAnd you know, you did see some\nof that in the previous segment.\n\n15\n00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.956\nWell now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna kinda talk about the interface\n\n16\n00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:52.790\na little bit more.\n\n17\n00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.510\nJust so you can kinda of see\nwhat's happening there and\n\n18\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.815\nsee where to, you know,\nwhere to find help and\n\n19\n00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:03.575\nyou know some of the basic commands\nthat make it easier to navigate and use.\n\n20\n00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:08.110\nWithout some of these basics trust me it\ngets kind of annoying after a while so\n\n21\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.600\nwe'll learn how to use the stuff and make\nsure you're a little more comfortable with\n\n22\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.280\nit before we start getting into\nsome of the more advanced stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.870\nSo what we have is we are going to\ntake a look at a couple things.\n\n24\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.760\nThe first thing really, to take a look\nat is talking about what environment\n\n25\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.930\nare you really gonna use most of the time\nand that's gonna be the console, but\n\n26\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.330\nnot just any old console,\nit's gonna be the MSF console.\n\n27\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.680\nNow we went ahead and we started\nthat in the previous segment and\n\n28\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.090\nI'm just gonna go ahead and do it for\n\n29\n00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.920\nyou again here just to make sure we're\nagain all on the same page here.\n\n30\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.680\nSo what's going to happen is is you\nopen up your terminal window and\n\n31\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.200\nyou can just do MSF console and\nyou're gonna\n\n32\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.970\njust hit enter on the thing and\nit's gonna go ahead and take it's time.\n\n33\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.350\nLike we, so we saw previously\nit's going to take some time.\n\n34\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.850\nIt's got to load in all of it's stuff and\nits modules, also the other collateral\n\n35\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.060\nstuff to make it work but it will go\nahead and, if everything goes right\n\n36\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.370\nit will load and give you a command\nprompt that has the little MSF in it.\n\n37\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.800\nThis is, like I said, where you're going\nto do the majority of your things.\n\n38\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.680\nIt's not the only place but\n\n39\n00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.580\nit's the majority, you're going\nto do the majority of stuff here.\n\n40\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.800\nFor the record,\nthere are other little interfaces and\n\n41\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.440\nstuff like that that\nexist in this product.\n\n42\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.890\nIf you've used Metasploit in the past\nyou may be familiar with some of those.\n\n43\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.460\nSome of those have\nactually just been axed.\n\n44\n00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.570\nThey got rid of them.\n\n45\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.760\nThey're trying to push\ninto a fewer number of\n\n46\n00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.100\ninterfaces that are more consistent and\nmore in line with one another.\n\n47\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.025\nYou kinda gotta love that.\n\n48\n00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:06.360\nSo just having a lot of little crazy\nthings sitting out there you've got\n\n49\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.470\njust this consistency.\n\n50\n00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.970\nOkay, so what we have here is again,\nthere's the environment we saw before,\n\n51\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.830\na little different opening graphic on\nthere, no missile command this time.\n\n52\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.840\n>> Yeah, I forget who it was.\n\n53\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.210\nI think Ben was asking for the cow.\n\n54\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.220\nThere he is,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.510\n>> so we're happy now.\n\n56\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.825\n>> Yeah, so\ncan get a little you know, there.\n\n57\n00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:31.842\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we have the opening banner in there.\n\n58\n00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:34.420\nYou can see the version\nthere right up top.\n\n59\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.720\nAnd then you can see the exploits and\npayloads and\n\n60\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.305\nsome other stuff in there, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:45.595\nSo it's waiting for a command.\n\n62\n00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.125\nNow to go through the console,\n\n63\n00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:52.605\nit's just really like using\na regular turmoil window, really,\n\n64\n00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:57.270\nwhen you get down to it it's just using a\ndifferent prompt inside of the framework.\n\n65\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.440\nSo what we can do is we've\ngot options at this point.\n\n66\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.630\nI mean, there's some commands here\nthat I look at as kind of like yeah,\n\n67\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.040\nthey're kind of interesting or\nfun, but are they really useful.\n\n68\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.990\nI mean, one here,\nif you don't like the cow,\n\n69\n00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.005\nyou can just type in a banner and\nit will reload it and do something else.\n\n70\n00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:23.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see this one,\n\n71\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.190\nit's saying hey, you putting a password.\n\n72\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.850\nIt keeps saying permission denied,\nsays oh, you didn't say the magic word.\n\n73\n00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.020\nOkay so [LAUGH]\n>> Apparently I've got a sense of humor.\n\n74\n00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.310\nI mean if you keep typing that\nit'll keep swapping the banner.\n\n75\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.620\nI mean, is it really useful.\n\n76\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.660\nI don't know, maybe for\nentertainment value.\n\n77\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.600\nSometimes you need something\nto break up the monotony.\n\n78\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.940\nThere you go.\n\n79\n00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.646\nOf course if that's the way you're\ndoing it, I question your sanity.\n\n80\n00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, that's that.\n\n81\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.020\n>> Always nice to know we can flip\nthrough all their different banners,\n\n82\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.250\nthough maybe a certain one just\ngets me motivated for that day.\n\n83\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.940\n>> Yeah, you never know.\n\n84\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.520\nThat's a good way to look at it.\n\n85\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.790\nSo you've got that way\nof rotating the banners.\n\n86\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.040\nOkay, whatever.\n\n87\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.920\nSo you've seen that but\nthere definitely are other ones in there.\n\n88\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.720\nWays to access what you can do\nin here just in case you need\n\n89\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.570\nit is you just type in\nthe good old help menu.\n\n90\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.628\nThey have one in here, you can do help,\nor you can do show -h.\n\n91\n00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:31.550\nI happen to like just type in help,\nit doesn't get any easier than that.\n\n92\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.090\nSo we're gonna use some of these commands,\n\n93\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.190\nnot all of them during out\nexploration of Metasploit.\n\n94\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.020\nBut, in those, you can scroll up through\nthis, like I'm doing right here.\n\n95\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.620\nSo, things I want to point out to you is,\n\n96\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.180\nyou can see that we have\nthe second one down,\n\n97\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.850\nbacK, that is actually a good one to know,\nokay.\n\n98\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.600\nBecause one of the things you're going\nto be tempted to do, I guarantee it,\n\n99\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.520\nyou're going to be tempted to do when\nyou get inside a command Metasploit and\n\n100\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.670\nyou're like oh, it's not where I wanted\nto be, or I didn't want to run this.\n\n101\n00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.840\nYou're going to want to hit Control-C.\n\n102\n00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.160\nIf you hit Control-C, you can actually\nexit out of not just that command but\n\n103\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.200\nthe whole framework.\n\n104\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.550\nNow you're gonna have to\nreload the whole framework and\n\n105\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.680\neverything to get back\nto where you're going.\n\n106\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.670\nIt's nonsense, you don't wanna do that,\nyou wanna keep this nice and easy and\n\n107\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.180\nsimple.\n\n108\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.280\nSo, if you're someplace you don't\nwanna be, just back, enter, and\n\n109\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.940\nit should just take you back to the next\nlevel up, however you want to look at it.\n\n110\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.000\nSo that's a very useful one that if you're\ntaking notes, you want to have that one.\n\n111\n00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.152\nOther things that are worthwhile,\nthe color command.\n\n112\n00:06:44.152 --> 00:06:45.290\nIt's down there.\n\n113\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.420\nThe color command can alter\nthe colors that appear on screen.\n\n114\n00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.930\nIt's very basic,\ndon't get too excited over it.\n\n115\n00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.480\nIt doesn't let you customize a ton but\nit does do it.\n\n116\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.510\nAnd then we've got other ones, exit,\n\n117\n00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.830\nexit's is the graceful way\nof exiting the framework.\n\n118\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.090\nYou could do control C,\nit's not recommended because you could\n\n119\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.630\nbe in the middle of a process or\nsomething could be happening.\n\n120\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.400\nExit is a much better way to do that.\n\n121\n00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.930\nGoing through and looking at some\nof these other options in here.\n\n122\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.210\nYou can see that we've got plenty\nof other things out there.\n\n123\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.140\nTake a look at at some stuff on\nthis next screen I've got here.\n\n124\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.380\nSome of the ones that are of use or\nof interest.\n\n125\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.940\nI mean, yeah, we've got quit.\n\n126\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.940\nOkay, fine.\n\n127\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.320\nBut then you go through and\nyou look at search.\n\n128\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.327\nSearch is a keyword that\nyou should remember,\n\n129\n00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:47.501\nbecause search is something that you're\ngoing to want to have in your arsenal.\n\n130\n00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.800\nBecause I guarantee you unless you're\nreally like going through that show\n\n131\n00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.156\nexploits and going through and\nfinding an exact one,\n\n132\n00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:56.398\nyou can do search and type in a couple\nof things and find the exact exploit or\n\n133\n00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.043\nwhatever it is you're looking for.\n\n134\n00:07:58.043 --> 00:07:59.110\nIt will narrow it down.\n\n135\n00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.175\nSo that's a very handy one to have.\n\n136\n00:08:02.175 --> 00:08:06.220\nAnd then just drop and there are some\nother ones in here that are worthwhile.\n\n137\n00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.490\nThreads are in there.\n\n138\n00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.550\nYou can actually tell it how many threads\nit's gonna dedicate to a specific process.\n\n139\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.860\nThe more threads you\nallocate to something,\n\n140\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.230\nthe faster it's going,\nthe process is going to be.\n\n141\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:25.040\nSo that's, gives you a level, gives you\nthe ability to fine tune certain things,\n\n142\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.644\nand ways that you just can't do as\n\n143\n00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:32.870\neasily with other tools and\nso that's kind of neat.\n\n144\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.630\nThat's what is one of the cool\nthings about Metasploid is it\n\n145\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.630\ndoes have a lot of stuff going on, but\nwhile it has a lot of stuff going on,\n\n146\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.360\nyou don't necessarily have to use it all.\n\n147\n00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.710\nBut you may wanna explore the different\noptions in here because you can fine-tune\n\n148\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.240\nstuff to an insanely,\ninsanely high degree and\n\n149\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.340\nget results that you may not be able\nto get the same way in other places.\n\n150\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.140\nSo we will be talking at I'm pointing\nthese out because these are the ones that\n\n151\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.630\nwe will be using and I just kind of want\nto get them stored in your gray matter.\n\n152\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.650\nOCUs for selecting modules.\n\n153\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.740\nAll those things that we saw.\n\n154\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.596\nIf you want to use a specific one, you'll\ndo use and type out which one you want and\n\n155\n00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.980\nit will load that in.\n\n156\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.680\nAnd start prompting you for\nstuff specific to that module.\n\n157\n00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:27.800\nSo that's just a few of those and\nthen just the last one, the database.\n\n158\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.050\nLet me bring this up here\nwhile you've got these.\n\n159\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.870\nThe database stuff we are going to,\nas we get further into stuff,\n\n160\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.360\nwe are going to start talking about how\nyou can integrate with the database that\n\n161\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.360\nis present in Metasploit.\n\n162\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.180\nMetasploit has the option of using MySQL,\n\n163\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.950\nand then there's another\ndatabase it can use.\n\n164\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.920\nIf you use the database in there,\nwhich you've just gotta, you go ahead and\n\n165\n00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.600\nyou start the database up,\nif you look at these commands, it kind of\n\n166\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.910\ngives you a clue of some of\nthe integration options we have.\n\n167\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.130\nIf you're really kind of playing detective\nand looking through this, you can kind of\n\n168\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.285\nsee what can happen here where it extends\nsome of the existing tools we have as we\n\n169\n00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:18.475\ngo right on down that list,\nyou find db_nmap, okay?\n\n170\n00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.175\nWell look at what it does.\n\n171\n00:10:20.175 --> 00:10:24.385\nRuns nmap and then takes the out,\nrecords the output automatically.\n\n172\n00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:25.555\nIt puts it into the database.\n\n173\n00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:30.085\nSo now what happens is is that takes\nthe stuff, shoots it in the database.\n\n174\n00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:32.575\nWhat can you do with it\nwhen it's in a database?\n\n175\n00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:38.610\nYou can do all sorts of manipulations and\nexaminations of it that you can't\n\n176\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:44.190\nnecessarily do the same way or with the\nsame amount of ease without Metasploit.\n\n177\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.780\nSo that opens up an interesting area so\nto speak.\n\n178\n00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.160\n>> So in previous episodes in our galley\nwe saw where you could use N map and\n\n179\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.120\nyou could output it to the screen.\n\n180\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.570\nYou could output it to the file.\n\n181\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.020\nNow you can dump in the database, and\nI can use other commands or hosts and\n\n182\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.220\nnotes to pull stuff back out of that.\n\n183\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.080\n>> Yeah,\nit's really awesome that you can do that.\n\n184\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.200\nThat to me is one of the things that\nlocks a tremendous amount of power.\n\n185\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.560\nYou know now you dump it\nright into that database.\n\n186\n00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.830\nYeah, you can do all just\n\n187\n00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.850\nall sorts of new stuff that you can't\ndo without going through a lot of work.\n\n188\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.440\nThey have it right there ready to go.\n\n189\n00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.440\nThe database, to get the database working,\n\n190\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.160\nit doesn't take a whole lot\nof effort to get it working.\n\n191\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.280\nAnd we will get to that, but for right now\nwe're gonna kind of learn the basics and\n\n192\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.760\nhow to access some of these things\nwithout involving the database.\n\n193\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.050\nThen we'll link up with the database.\n\n194\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.460\nAnd start seeing how the two can work\ntogether, and I think you really dig that\n\n195\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.270\nwhen you see those two working together\nhand in hand, it adds another level to it.\n\n196\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.630\nAnd yeah, Postgre, David,\nyeah, that's the other one.\n\n197\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.220\nThat's the other name I'm looking for\nfor databases.\n\n198\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.472\nSo that's the console, and\n\n199\n00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:07.141\nyou can see the console pretty\nstraightforward to use.\n\n200\n00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:08.660\nYou can see the commands in there.\n\n201\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.490\nI'm showing you the help\ncommand just because, I mean,\n\n202\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.350\nit's something that you're gonna need.\n\n203\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.309\nTrust me.\n[LAUGH] You're gonna need it.\n\n204\n00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:18.420\nI still use it from time\nto time just because hey,\n\n205\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.780\nI don't focus a lot on trying\nto memorize you know, command.\n\n206\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.440\nIt's not thing I focus on what\nI'm expecting to happen, and\n\n207\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.430\nthen I can find the commands\nto carry that out.\n\n208\n00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.290\nSo help is something that you can,\nthat you're\n\n209\n00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:38.580\ngoing to be using more and more or you're\ngoing to need more as you go through.\n\n210\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.970\nSo just keep that in mind and\nexplore some of the different commands.\n\n211\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.840\nI mentioned a few,\nwe'll be using a few more.\n\n212\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.490\nTry some of the different ones.\n\n213\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.481\nYou should really,\nonce you get comfortable with the basics,\n\n214\n00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.370\ntry some of these other ones.\n\n215\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.550\nOther than that, so\nthat's the console itself.\n\n216\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.750\nThat's kind of just how you\nkind of use it and load it.\n\n217\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:07.380\nAll you gotta do now is really just start\nusing commands, and you'll find out,\n\n218\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.560\nyou can do stuff in here that,\nyou can do just a regular command prompt.\n\n219\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.780\nI can go in here and I can do a ping to\n\n220\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.375\nMicrosoft.com and hit Enter and\nit's gonna execute it right there.\n\n221\n00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:26.055\nI mean, so, no big surprise.\n\n222\n00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.683\nReally, what [CROSSTALK]\n>> Not your normal commands,\n\n223\n00:13:27.683 --> 00:13:31.263\nyou're just adding these other modules\nthat add all the Metasploit specific\n\n224\n00:13:31.263 --> 00:13:32.170\ncommands.\n\n225\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.700\nYeah.\n\n226\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.650\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, so it's loading it right on top,\n\n227\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.020\nso yeah, you can access this other\nstuff that's [COUGH] outside\n\n228\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.840\nthe Metasploit environment.\n\n229\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:47.090\nYou can go ahead and just start\nworking with it and do whatever.\n\n230\n00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.180\nSo that brings up a whole you know,\n\n231\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.230\nanother interesting level of\ncapability because you may have thought\n\n232\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.520\nin Metasploit, especially if this is\nyour first time, you may have thought.\n\n233\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.290\nWell Metasploit,\n\n234\n00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.200\nif I'm switching to its own console I just\nhave access to the stuff in that console.\n\n235\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.350\nWell, no you don't.\n\n236\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.390\nI just showed you, you don't.\n\n237\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.470\nYou have access to,\nyou know, there's Ping.\n\n238\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.130\nYou can use plenty of\nother tools that are,\n\n239\n00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.230\nanything that's available in the operating\nsystem you can pretty much access\n\n240\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.200\nthrough here.\n\n241\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.590\nAnd start feeding it information or\nback and forth.\n\n242\n00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.240\nYou can even store this stuff,\nthis ping stuff if you wanted,\n\n243\n00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.670\nif I was gonna use the database for\nit at this point.\n\n244\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.450\nI could start dropping\nthat to the database.\n\n245\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.240\n>> Mm, nice.\n\n246\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.850\nIt's really just a neat thing so\n\n247\n00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.380\nyeah, there's the power of\ndoing something like this.\n\n248\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.090\nAnd notice by the way, it's already\ntelling you, I hit Ctrl+C on that ping,\n\n249\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.470\nit was just pinging over and over again.\n\n250\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.310\nHere it was safe to do so,\nthat's why I did it.\n\n251\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.400\nIn other cases if you hit Ctrl+C, yeah,\n\n252\n00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.710\nit will go right back out to\nthe root prompt and say root@kali.\n\n253\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:48.938\nSo, I was fine here but\n\n254\n00:14:48.938 --> 00:14:52.711\nmake sure you know which commands you\ncan [LAUGH] get away with that in.\n\n255\n00:14:52.711 --> 00:14:55.796\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] But anyway, yeah, so\n\n256\n00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:56.934\nthat's the console.\n\n257\n00:14:56.934 --> 00:15:04.410\nLet's talk about the other\noptions here as well just in case\n\n258\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:09.840\nthey come up or something that you decide\nyou kinda wanna take a closer look at.\n\n259\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.640\nThere's one called msfcli,\n\n260\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.230\nit's the Metasploit framework,\nit's another command line interface.\n\n261\n00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.430\nThat one,\nif you type in at the root prompt,\n\n262\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.520\nif you type in msfcli it will and\nsome of you, it might load it.\n\n263\n00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.797\nAnd the reason I say some of you it\nmight load it is because they've\n\n264\n00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.180\ndeprecated that.\n\n265\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.485\nThey told you immediately,\nif you load it, it tells you.\n\n266\n00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:37.527\nActually it gives you a drop dead date,\nwhich is actually kinda fascinating.\n\n267\n00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:41.304\n[LAUGH] They tell you around\n6/18/2015 this is gonna be,\n\n268\n00:15:41.304 --> 00:15:43.784\n[SOUND] we're gonna\nsend it out to pasture.\n\n269\n00:15:43.784 --> 00:15:45.687\nSo it gives you basically\na retirement date.\n\n270\n00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:49.103\nAnd so, if you used that in the past,\n\n271\n00:15:49.103 --> 00:15:54.627\nthen they tell you what options\nto go to and then that's it.\n\n272\n00:15:54.627 --> 00:15:56.670\nThere's no msfcli.\n\n273\n00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.970\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n274\n00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.940\nIf you haven't used MSFCLI\nit's obviously no big deal.\n\n275\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.661\nBut just to put it in it's proper context\nit was something that was used for\n\n276\n00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:11.591\ndoing scripting and stuff like that.\n\n277\n00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:13.970\nIt was more focused on that side of it.\n\n278\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.380\nWhereas the console is basically\nmore task-based and task-oriented.\n\n279\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.380\nSo you have the two options.\n\n280\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.290\nThey just said why even bother with\nthe CLI, we'll just go ahead and\n\n281\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.390\nkeep stuff in the MSF console and\nkeep it easy.\n\n282\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.400\n>> Nice.\n\n283\n00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.906\n>> Now, the other guy I want to\ntalk about here and bring up, so\n\n284\n00:16:35.906 --> 00:16:39.524\nI've got the console here,\ntalked about CLI.\n\n285\n00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:44.282\nThe other one we've got deals with that\nlittle thing I said way back in our first\n\n286\n00:16:44.282 --> 00:16:45.310\nsegment.\n\n287\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.920\nI said that Metasploit doesn't have a GUI,\n\n288\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.970\nso you better get used\nto not having a GUI.\n\n289\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.690\nWell, that's been traditionally one\nof the barriers to getting in here.\n\n290\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:01.880\nSo that's caused people a lot of\nthings like just panic, or anxiety.\n\n291\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.040\nIt's like I just don't\nfeel comfortable with it.\n\n292\n00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.000\nYou know how it is.\n\n293\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.392\nWe all know people who have\na command line they just kinda like,\n\n294\n00:17:09.392 --> 00:17:10.997\nthey don't want to touch it.\n\n295\n00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:14.401\nSo some people have tried to address that,\n\n296\n00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:17.950\nbecause Metasploit has\na lot of power in it.\n\n297\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.970\nBut if people aren't really\ncomfortable with the command line or\n\n298\n00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.410\njust used to reading something out of\na book and typing that in, they're\n\n299\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.850\nnot gonna explore a lot and they're\nnot gonna be willing to explore a lot.\n\n300\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.670\nBecause they may be kind of\nconcerned about what might happen.\n\n301\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.430\nThey get pigeonholed or stuck on a certain\nline of thinking, and that's where it is.\n\n302\n00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.744\nWhere a GUI, they might not.\n\n303\n00:17:36.744 --> 00:17:37.540\nThey see everything presented.\n\n304\n00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.420\nThey're like, well what if I do this,\nthis, and this?\n\n305\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.850\nPeople think differently.\n\n306\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.880\nSo somebody tried to address that,\nand this is through something called,\n\n307\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.010\nif you type in a tool called Armitage.\n\n308\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.721\nI don't know if the words French, but I've\nseen what the look, French thing on it.\n\n309\n00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:54.964\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I sound like international.\n\n310\n00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:56.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n311\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.230\nwhat it does is it will take a moment and\nits gonna ask to connect to a database.\n\n312\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.794\nNow, if this is your\nfirst time running this,\n\n313\n00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:08.930\nit actually might spit out some other\nerrors in addition to what I have here.\n\n314\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.380\nThe stuff I have here to connect to\nthe database, and saying, hey, well,\n\n315\n00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.740\nit's not running,\nwould you like me to start it?\n\n316\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.198\nYeah, of course, I want you to start it.\n\n317\n00:18:17.198 --> 00:18:21.179\nIf you get a problem where\nit's not starting it,\n\n318\n00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:25.838\nthere's actually some commands,\nyou can look them up,\n\n319\n00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:32.266\nthat actually you can stop the database\nand you can start it and it will be fine.\n\n320\n00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:35.736\nBut [COUGH] try and\nthink of it off the top of my head,\n\n321\n00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:39.220\nbut they're really easy to look up.\n\n322\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.480\nSo what it's doing right now,\nis it's connecting to the actual database.\n\n323\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.072\nIt takes a moment or two.\n\n324\n00:18:46.072 --> 00:18:48.750\nSo it's just going ahead and\ndoing its thing.\n\n325\n00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.638\nAnd it brings up Armitage.\n\n326\n00:18:51.638 --> 00:18:54.740\nAnd what we're seeing over\nthere on the left-hand side.\n\n327\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.920\nAnd this is a tool that,\nby the way, we will,\n\n328\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.970\neven though it's not part of the core\nMetasploit functionality, it\n\n329\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.250\nisn't really actually part of Metasploit\nproper, it's something that someone else\n\n330\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.260\nwrote, because that individual was\none of those people I talked about,\n\n331\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.170\nthat had some anxiety and some issues\nwith wanting to just get around and\n\n332\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.220\nswim around the product and use it.\n\n333\n00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.870\nYou decided, well, let me go ahead and\n\n334\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.570\nwrite something that can\nalleviate some of that.\n\n335\n00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.230\nSo he came up with this.\n\n336\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.030\nAnd what you're seeing here is\nyou're seeing Armitage's interface,\n\n337\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.750\nand what it has is on\nthe left-hand side you can see we\n\n338\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.560\nhave a whole bunch of\nthings that we can open up.\n\n339\n00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.820\nOver here, that tells us what we can do.\n\n340\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.540\nWhat this is, is this is\n\n341\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.750\na representation of the stuff we saw when\nwe did show exploits and show payloads.\n\n342\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.790\nThis is just showing what\nthat would really look like.\n\n343\n00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.910\nRemember, I said they had slash this,\nslash that?\n\n344\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.610\nThis is just representing\nthe exact same type of thing.\n\n345\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.250\nIt's easier to relate to.\n\n346\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.300\nWhen we look at it this way.\n\n347\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.360\nWhen you look at stuff\nlike scanners in here.\n\n348\n00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.810\nI mean, it's got all sorts of\ndifferent scanners loaded.\n\n349\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.988\nIt just says,\nwe'll drill down one more level on that.\n\n350\n00:20:08.988 --> 00:20:12.590\nSo it does make it a lot easier for you.\n\n351\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:18.430\nThere's our exploits,\norganized by context.\n\n352\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.535\nSo pretty neat, but\nthat's not the only stuff that's here.\n\n353\n00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:26.280\nI just always wanna say, but that's not\nall, there's more stuff here, wait,\n\n354\n00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.350\n[LAUGH] there's more.\n\n355\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.740\nThere's more stuff, go over here.\n\n356\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:34.610\nI mean, you see over right next to it, off\nto the right, you see the computer here,\n\n357\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.790\nso I've got my IP address sitting there.\n\n358\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.720\nWell, you can, as you start connecting to\nremote hosts and start running different\n\n359\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.060\nattacks, it can actually lay them out for\nyou so the context of how things\n\n360\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.120\nare laid out to one another, and\nhow the connections are going.\n\n361\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:55.884\nSo another way of helping visualize what's\ngoing on, so that's very valuable to have.\n\n362\n00:20:55.884 --> 00:20:57.626\nAnd then, we've got,\n\n363\n00:20:57.626 --> 00:21:03.160\ndown at the bottom you have the regular\nMetasploit console ready to go.\n\n364\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:10.360\nSo you've got everything right here,\nready to go and start interacting with.\n\n365\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.767\nSo someone's effectively created\nwhy it is a very basic GUI.\n\n366\n00:21:15.767 --> 00:21:20.820\nIt is a GUI, nonetheless,\nwhere we didn't have one before.\n\n367\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.420\nSo that's what you have, and\nthis guy actually had it,\n\n368\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.660\ndid this actually has,\nthis is Armitage, it's completely free.\n\n369\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:34.570\nHe does have a, something I\nthink it's called Cobalt Strike.\n\n370\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.731\nSo that's an awesome name.\n\n371\n00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:39.054\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna create something it would be\n\n372\n00:21:39.054 --> 00:21:40.676\ncalled Cobalt Strike, I don't care.\n\n373\n00:21:40.676 --> 00:21:45.802\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But he's got something called\n\n374\n00:21:45.802 --> 00:21:50.924\nColbat Strike which is like\nthe big boy super duper advanced\n\n375\n00:21:50.924 --> 00:21:56.765\nversion of this that can do extremely\nwicked stuff that Armitage and\n\n376\n00:21:56.765 --> 00:21:59.855\nMetasploit can't do on it's own.\n\n377\n00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:04.636\nBut that's like requires enterprise\nlicensing and all sorts of special\n\n378\n00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:09.803\ntraining to use, most of us won't need\nunless we're working at that level and\n\n379\n00:22:09.803 --> 00:22:13.408\ntesting across the board all\nsorts of applications and\n\n380\n00:22:13.408 --> 00:22:16.491\nall sorts of exotic and\nunique environments.\n\n381\n00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:22.005\nYou'll probably never need that,\nbut this is what Armitage is.\n\n382\n00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:26.817\nIf you need to exit out of Armitage\nall you gonna do is just go\n\n383\n00:22:26.817 --> 00:22:30.950\nunder the Armitage menu and\njust click Close.\n\n384\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.900\nIt should take you right back\nto your Metasploit console.\n\n385\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.957\nDo not go up to the X at the upper\nright corner and click like that.\n\n386\n00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:40.920\nThat could very well close all of\nyour console and everything out.\n\n387\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.770\nYou'd have to open up the console and\nreload the MSF and all that.\n\n388\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.118\n>> Yeah, wait for\nit all to reload, so yeah.\n\n389\n00:22:46.118 --> 00:22:50.140\n>> Yeah, I mean minor thing,\nminor inconvenience I guess.\n\n390\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.040\nBut it's something that you can\navoid just by being kinda conscious\n\n391\n00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.780\nof that whole process happening there.\n\n392\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.790\n>> Nice.\n\n393\n00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.530\nThere's a few different ways.\n\n394\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.480\nThen we can interface with Metasploit.\n\n395\n00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.470\nWe've got our standard shell our console.\n\n396\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.103\nWe've got the CLI which is being\ndepreciated, so that one is kind of\n\n397\n00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:12.144\ngoing away on us, and we've go Armitage,\nArmitage I guess we should say.\n\n398\n00:23:12.144 --> 00:23:12.877\n>> Everyone wants, yeah.\n\n399\n00:23:12.877 --> 00:23:16.526\n>> [LAUGH] Nice that somebody has\ntaken the time to develop that and\n\n400\n00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:19.622\ngive those people had that\nfear of the command line.\n\n401\n00:23:19.622 --> 00:23:23.420\nMaybe a good starting point, get them\na little more comfortable with it.\n\n402\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.052\nGonna get that GUI command line\ncombination going on in there and\n\n403\n00:23:28.052 --> 00:23:32.616\ngive them a chance to ease on\ninto that command line interface.\n\n404\n00:23:32.616 --> 00:23:37.520\n>> Yeah, it really is and there's nothing\nsaying that if you're an advanced user\n\n405\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.489\nthat you can't use Armitage just\nto make it easier on yourself.\n\n406\n00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:45.140\nI have no problem with people\nmaking it easier on them self.\n\n407\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.321\nI have had people over the years ask me,\nit's like well,\n\n408\n00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:48.600\nhow did you learn all that stuff.\n\n409\n00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.296\nYou must be really smart.\n\n410\n00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:50.613\nIt's like No, I'm freaking lazy,\n\n411\n00:23:50.613 --> 00:23:52.570\ncuz I don't want to do a bunch\nof extra work, you know.\n\n412\n00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.824\nI'm going to find\nthe easiest way to do it.\n\n413\n00:23:53.824 --> 00:23:55.350\nPath of least resistance.\n\n414\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.660\nYou know that's why I do this stuff.\n\n415\n00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.500\nIt has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\n416\n00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.785\nSo, that's,\nI have no problem with someone using that.\n\n417\n00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:08.815\nJust make sure you understand what's\ngoing on underneath the hood, so when you\n\n418\n00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:14.405\nstring those exploits and payloads all\ntogether, you really get what's happening.\n\n419\n00:24:14.405 --> 00:24:21.095\nIf you don't have that Armitage, you won't\nbe able to release the full power of it.\n\n420\n00:24:21.095 --> 00:24:27.210\nSo, you know, just be prepared for\nthat angle, but\n\n421\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:32.890\nthe guy that creates Armitage, he's pretty\nhelpful from what I've seen on his site.\n\n422\n00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:38.690\nHe's puts it out there pretty straight\nforward with what you ask as a whole FAQ.\n\n423\n00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.950\nYou can email him and he usually gets back\nto you in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n424\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.960\nAnd he's pretty knowledgeable.\n\n425\n00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.650\nHe also is one of the ones\n\n426\n00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.190\nthat doesn't really want to\nhelp you on Windows and Mac OS.\n\n427\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's like, and he's nice about it.\n\n428\n00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.560\nHe's like, yeah, you can do stuff\nover there but I'm not doing it.\n\n429\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.260\nYou know, so just FYI.\n\n430\n00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.140\nIf you're going to be doing that.\n\n431\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.240\nSo the thing I want to make sure\nthat also in here that we take away.\n\n432\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.325\nIs just remember that,\ncuz this is going to come up big later on,\n\n433\n00:25:16.325 --> 00:25:20.395\nis you're not just limited\nto the tools in Metasploit.\n\n434\n00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:23.265\nYou have the tools in Metasploit,\nall those modules, and\n\n435\n00:25:23.265 --> 00:25:27.765\nall that, but you can also access that\nstuff out in the operating system too.\n\n436\n00:25:27.765 --> 00:25:31.245\nSo if you're using Kali,\nwe went through and\n\n437\n00:25:31.245 --> 00:25:37.215\ndid that whole series of shows on Kali,\npretty much everything you used in Kali,\n\n438\n00:25:37.215 --> 00:25:42.030\nthings like FPing, and HPing,\nand, and map all those things.\n\n439\n00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.970\nPretty much every last one of those can\nbe accessed right through Metasploit,\n\n440\n00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:51.080\nwithout exiting Metasploit,\nwhich is saying a lot.\n\n441\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:58.830\nJust imagine if you go through the stuff\nin Kali and you get comfortable with that.\n\n442\n00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.450\nAnd then you get comfortable\nwith Metasploit and\n\n443\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.010\nyou stream the two together.\n\n444\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.930\nYou've just bumped up your skills and\nyour power tremendously, so\n\n445\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.750\ndon't forget that,\ncuz we will be doing that here.\n\n446\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.880\nWe will be stringing both of those\ntogether to get that association in your\n\n447\n00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.920\nhead ready to go.\n\n448\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.230\n>> Fantastic, all right.\n\n449\n00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.600\nA lot of great information there.\n\n450\n00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.980\nWe're getting closer and\ncloser to seeing Metasploit in action.\n\n451\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.210\nBut again,\nwe gotta learn our way around there.\n\n452\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.980\nWe saw a few different interfaces\nthis time and you know,\n\n453\n00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.700\nhow we can interact with Metasploit and\nwork with it.\n\n454\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.780\nSo good information, Sean,\nlooking at our clock, it's about time for\n\n455\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.010\nus to call this one a wrap.\n\n456\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.120\nSo I think that's what we'll do,\nbut make sure you come back.\n\n457\n00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.410\nWe've got more episodes on\nMetasploit coming your way.\n\n458\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.720\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n459\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.440\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n460\n00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.532\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n461\n00:26:46.532 --> 00:26:50.582\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:15.990\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.060\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.790\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.550\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.610\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.620\nAnother exciting episode coming\nyour way here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.953\nContinuing on with our Metasploit\nepisodes, and in this one Sean,\n\n10\n00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:28.648\nwe're gonna take another look and\n\n11\n00:00:28.648 --> 00:00:31.522\nwe're still going over some\nof the basics of Metasploit.\n\n12\n00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.061\nNow we wanna look at something\ncalled utilities, so\n\n13\n00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:36.840\nsome utilities that\nare incorporated with Metasploit?\n\n14\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.320\n>> Yeah and\nthese are really utilities that are,\n\n15\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.880\nI kinda wanna give you an idea that these\nutilities are ones that were there but\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.970\nthey transitioned over to something else,\nso.\n\n17\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.597\nThis is really for those of you that\nare coming from the previous versions\n\n18\n00:00:53.597 --> 00:00:57.462\nof Metasploit that may have stuff,\nthat may have stuff that worked with those\n\n19\n00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:01.028\nprevious versions and you bring it over or\nare looking for something and\n\n20\n00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:05.240\nit's giving you all these messages saying,\nhey we don't do that anymore.\n\n21\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.800\nThat's what this is meant for,\n\n22\n00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.290\nthese are utilities that you may have\nhad a reason to use in the past but\n\n23\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.760\nthey've been replaced and so we're making\nsure you're aware of the replacement.\n\n24\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.970\nWhich are things that we're gonna\ntalk about later on in here, but\n\n25\n00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.060\njust also to throw in\nsomething else into that.\n\n26\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.560\nAnother reason even if you haven't\nused it before, the documentation for\n\n27\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.440\nproducts like this, Open Source and\n\n28\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.110\nall that kinda gets just smeared\nout over several versions.\n\n29\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.520\nIn fact, if you go look at several of\nthe books on Metasploit that are available\n\n30\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.520\nright now, a lot of them will mention\nutilities that they say oh yeah, this\n\n31\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.020\nutility does this, this, and this and talk\nabout all this neat stuff they can do.\n\n32\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.760\nThat utility doesn't exist anymore.\n\n33\n00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.020\n>> Now the more frustrating, right?\n\n34\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.720\nYou're looking at the documentation,\nit's telling you to type this.\n\n35\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.940\nYou type it in, and\nall you get are errors.\n\n36\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.930\nThat's frustrating.\n\n37\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.610\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so,\n\n38\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.830\nwe're trying to avoid you\npulling your hair out and\n\n39\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.260\ngetting frustrated and\ngoing, what the heck?\n\n40\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.270\nWhy isn't this working?\n\n41\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.360\nWhy was it working on screen,\n\n42\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.070\nwhy is it working one way on screen\nwhen I try to follow this book?\n\n43\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.780\nThis book is brand new,\nwhy is it not doing that?\n\n44\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.350\nWell, book isn't using new\ninformation is what it is.\n\n45\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.530\nAnd so we want to make sure that, just in\ncase you're using an older version, or\n\n46\n00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.750\nif you're looking at documentation that\nmight be just a little bit out of date,\n\n47\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.170\nthat you're not caught in a trap there and\nget frustrated, and\n\n48\n00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.360\njust saying, the hell with Metasploit,\nI'm never using it again.\n\n49\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.610\nWe definetly do not want that.\n\n50\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.200\nIt's a great product, powerful product.\n\n51\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.560\nAnd something you should be using\nas a security and pen tester.\n\n52\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.950\nSo let's avoid those little pitfalls and\ntalk about these utilities.\n\n53\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.800\nAnd talk about what replaced them.\n\n54\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.180\nAnd what they do.\n\n55\n00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.210\n>> Cool.\n\n56\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.200\nAll right well let's take a look.\n\n57\n00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.150\nWhere do we start?\n\n58\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.050\nWhat's the first one that\nthey've gotten rid of us on us?\n\n59\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.480\n>> The first one we have that they've\nactually replaced with something else is\n\n60\n00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.610\none called MSF Payload.\n\n61\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.280\nWhat this one does is this one is\nsomething that's designed to allow you to\n\n62\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.530\ncreate payloads to drop off on a system.\n\n63\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.330\nAnd you're gonna use\ndifferent development tools.\n\n64\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.065\nYou can use things like Visual Basic,\nC++, stuff like that to develop it.\n\n65\n00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.755\nAnd this would allow you\nto take those things and\n\n66\n00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:24.555\nmove them right into\nthe Metasploit environment.\n\n67\n00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:29.165\nAnd so, it's a cool thing to have that\nbecause if you're gonna be developing\n\n68\n00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:33.475\nthis, or working with this and developing,\nyou kinda need something like that.\n\n69\n00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:35.695\nAnd so they went through and\nthey kinda just axed that.\n\n70\n00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:38.705\nIt wasn't because they're trying to\nclose the product off or anything.\n\n71\n00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:43.660\nWhat they did is they actually\nreplaced it with another utility and\n\n72\n00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.970\nactually they have it replaced\nseveral things with this utility.\n\n73\n00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.348\nThere's one called MSF,\nthe much more cool sounding, by the way,\n\n74\n00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:51.419\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n75\n00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.380\n>> MSF venom.\n\n76\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.210\nThat's the name of the new tool.\n\n77\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.266\n>> Venom.\n>> Yeah, I love that.\n\n78\n00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:01.429\nSo it's scary but\nthat's what they went through,\n\n79\n00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:06.005\nis they replaced MSF payload,\nwith MSF Venom, so you can do everything.\n\n80\n00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:12.870\nYou could do in MSF Payload with the Venom\nutility and not have any problem, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.560\n>> Nice.\n>> Now obviously there's some new\n\n82\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.380\nstuff added in there, and\nsome other things like that,\n\n83\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.450\nif you do wanna develop your own exploits.\n\n84\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.450\nAnd if you wanna develop your own exploits\nthat's gonna require, like I said,\n\n85\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.350\nall sorts of programming and\nknowledge like that.\n\n86\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.640\nThat's not going to be stuff that we're\n[LAUGH] really going to worry about\n\n87\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.480\ntalking about in here because can't\ntalk about a, it's no good for\n\n88\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.350\nus to talk about exploits\nanywhere in this whole coverage\n\n89\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.610\nof Metasploit unless you know all those\nprogramming skills coming in, so.\n\n90\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.530\nOnce you've got those skills though\nyou can figure out an exploit\n\n91\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.410\npretty quickly, you know, so.\n\n92\n00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.140\nLike in an afternoon, I've heard people\ncreate exploits in an afternoon.\n\n93\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.860\nAfter they know how Metasploit works,\nthey're a software developer,\n\n94\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.520\njust type something in,\nand they're firing it off.\n\n95\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.100\nSo that's the cool thing about that.\n\n96\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.550\n>> So they didn't take our capability away\nto use other products to develop these,\n\n97\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.510\nit just changed the tool we're gonna\nuse then to bring those into our\n\n98\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.810\nMetasploit environment.\n\n99\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.560\nYeah, it's as Metasploit has evolved and\n\n100\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.340\nmetamorphasized over the years its,\nthey've\n\n101\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.130\nalways allowed you to develop your own\nexploits but it's a question of just now.\n\n102\n00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.370\nSome of the tools may have changed or\nbecome more powerful.\n\n103\n00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.450\nI mean even Metasploit itself at one point\nwas developed with a totally different\n\n104\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.890\nprogramming language, and\n\n105\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.420\nnow it was basically rearchitected from\nthe ground up so it's all done in Ruby.\n\n106\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.130\nSo that required [LAUGH] some changes.\n\n107\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.380\nYou have tools like this also reflecting\nthose changes and giving you more power.\n\n108\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.420\nAnd they very clearly have\ndocumented how to create exploits so\n\n109\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.480\nthis would be one of\nthe utilities that you'd use.\n\n110\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.760\nYou'd have to have that programming\nenvironment as well to create it there\n\n111\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.080\nthen run it through this and\n\n112\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.180\na couple other things to get it ready\nto be dropped into Metasploit proper.\n\n113\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.200\nBut just in case you run into that and I\nfelt that the stuff that we talked about,\n\n114\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.260\nor are talking about this utility section.\n\n115\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.060\nI saw them mentioned\nfar too many times for\n\n116\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.870\nthem to be just something that,\noh, well, don't worry about it.\n\n117\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.580\nIt's not in here.\n\n118\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.477\nIt's been replaced with something else.\n\n119\n00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.461\nI could've just said MSF Venom and said,\n\n120\n00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.710\nthis is what it does without\nmentioning the previous stuff.\n\n121\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.272\nBut since those have been mentioned so\nmuch, I don't want someone\n\n122\n00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:28.250\njust beating their head against the wall,\nhaving problems with it.\n\n123\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.460\nSo this is a case where.\n\n124\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.020\nCan't use the old one but\nyou got MSF Venom.\n\n125\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.930\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n126\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.340\nSo MSF Payload, depreciative\nbeing replaced with MSF Venom.\n\n127\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.810\nWhat else do we have?\n\n128\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.710\n>> You also got another one that\nis actually, it has got some very,\n\n129\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.550\nvery useful capabilities for\nus that we are gonna see.\n\n130\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.530\nThis MSFN code,\nwhat it does is it would allow you\n\n131\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.620\nto if you're doing specifically,\nwe talked about this in CEH.\n\n132\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.890\nIf you want to evade an IDS or\na firewall or something like that,\n\n133\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.640\nyou can send your attack out but\nencode your attack in a different way.\n\n134\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.640\nSo the signature doesn't match something\nthat the IDS already is aware of.\n\n135\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.520\nAnd if you do that,\nit just slips right on by.\n\n136\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.190\nOkay.\nYou could see where that could be useful\n\n137\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.380\nfor what we're doing here.\n\n138\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.320\nThis is a pen testing tool, and\n\n139\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.030\nwe do wanna slip stuff into an environment\nto get it to execute on a remote system.\n\n140\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.750\nSo with that being the case,\nMSFN code becomes very, very, very,\n\n141\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.950\nvery important,\nan instrumental piece of that.\n\n142\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.180\nHowever, again deprecated, gone.\n\n143\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.380\nThey replaced it with MSF Venom again.\n\n144\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.960\nSo MSF Venom takes on the MSF Payload and\nMSFN code capabilities.\n\n145\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.685\nAnd merges them into the one utility, so\nif you're gonna be doing any one of those.\n\n146\n00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:53.480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.300\n>> You've got that utility for it.\n\n148\n00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.770\nAnd we will be seeing MSF Venom in here\nat some point when we start getting\n\n149\n00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.310\ninto doing the R evasions and trying to\nget around these defensive structures.\n\n150\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.220\nIt's gonna play a big role for us.\n\n151\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.080\n>> Nice.\n>> So if you see that.\n\n152\n00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.345\nDoesn't exist anymore.\n\n153\n00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:19.440\nHeck, if you see pay load or\nencode anyplace in any of the documents or\n\n154\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.010\nbooks or anything you're looking at you\nprobably can flip through there and\n\n155\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.250\nfind that it mentions back track in\nthere too, and back track is dead.\n\n156\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:32.230\nSo, and that's what I found\na lot of times is when a text or\n\n157\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.940\ndocumentation refers to it and\nit mentions one of these things in there,\n\n158\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.580\ninevitably at some point it's gonna say\nBacktrack R3 or something like that.\n\n159\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.220\nIn which case,\nI know it's really not for me.\n\n160\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.750\nMost of the stuff will work, but\n\n161\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.480\nthere's these little things that could\nbe frustrating and just a real pain.\n\n162\n00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.440\nThe framework will tell you if you try\nto run these things that are deprecate,\n\n163\n00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.710\nit will put a message on screen.\n\n164\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.260\nBut who knows how long\nthey're going to leave that.\n\n165\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.560\n>> Right.\nAnd at some point they're gonna say,\n\n166\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.390\nall right, everybody should know at\nthis point we're not gonna bother with\n\n167\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.540\nthe warnings or the prompts or\nanything like that.\n\n168\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.021\nYeah, they'll be like yeah,\nyou know better, or\n\n169\n00:09:09.021 --> 00:09:12.905\nthat shouldn't be using that and we're\njust going to go ahead and just kill it.\n\n170\n00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.541\nYou know, typically if they do go\nthrough and they deprecate something,\n\n171\n00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:21.655\nthat's not an unknown strategy\nwhere they'll leave it there and\n\n172\n00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:26.088\nhave it running for some brief period\nof time, and then [NOISE], gone.\n\n173\n00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:30.190\nMost of these ones that I've mentioned so\nfar that have been deprecated.\n\n174\n00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.230\nThey will still put a warning\nup on screen saying deprecated.\n\n175\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.230\nAnd it's very clear about it.\n\n176\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.820\nIt won't make any bones about it.\n\n177\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.920\nIt's deprecated and\nit will tell you the date that it had,\n\n178\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.640\nthe drop dead date on it.\n\n179\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.176\nAnd in the case of these\nones it said 6/18/2015.\n\n180\n00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:51.170\nSo, they're gone.\n\n181\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.616\n[LAUGH] That warning is still there,\nbut they're gone,\n\n182\n00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:57.000\nyou will not be using those anymore.\n\n183\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.520\nThe latest updates took them out, so\n\n184\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.230\njust be aware that those are not\nsomething you can even use anymore.\n\n185\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.980\nYou may have a couple months ago\nyou could have, but not now.\n\n186\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.230\n>> Well, we got venom to replace it,\nso as long as we know that,\n\n187\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.820\nwe should be good to go.\n\n188\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.520\n>> Yeah, they've replaced it with similar\nas well as enhanced functionalities so\n\n189\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.860\nit's not something that\nyou're up the creek and\n\n190\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.410\njust stuck with,\nwith dealing with the absence of it.\n\n191\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:29.110\nThey do have other things that can replace\nthat functionality, so we're good.\n\n192\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.930\nWe're in very good shape there,\n\n193\n00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.450\nso don't freak out if you're looking at\ndoing development or anything like that.\n\n194\n00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.662\nYou're covered.\n\n195\n00:10:36.662 --> 00:10:38.110\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n196\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.430\nAll right, any others that they've\ngotten on us that we should be aware of?\n\n197\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.750\n>> Well, those are the big ones for\nright now.\n\n198\n00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.740\nThere is one more that I\nmade a note here to mention,\n\n199\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.750\nis this NASM shell.\n\n200\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.816\nWhat this one does,\n\n201\n00:10:55.816 --> 00:10:59.510\nis this one is designed if you're going\nto get down, really, really get down.\n\n202\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.275\nI mean, you're kind of a,\nyou're kind of one of those hard-code,\n\n203\n00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:08.060\nreally want to get in\nthe trenches type of people,\n\n204\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.370\nthe NASM shell is designed to help\nyou sort through assembly code.\n\n205\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.310\nSo if you really, really, really, want\nto get into assembly code, this is it.\n\n206\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.870\n>> There's an exciting evening for you?\n\n207\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.818\n>> Oh yeah.\nYou can see the excitement in my eyes.\n\n208\n00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:22.364\nRight?\n\n209\n00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:25.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's, so it's,\n\n210\n00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.160\nthey have that if you wanna\nget into it at that level.\n\n211\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.850\nIt'll help you sort through that.\n\n212\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.680\nSo if you're not doing that sort of thing,\nthen you could care less.\n\n213\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.855\nYou may forget that it even exists.\n\n214\n00:11:36.855 --> 00:11:37.520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n215\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.250\n>> But it is there,\nif you really need to get in.\n\n216\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.430\nAnd drill in at that level and\nit's not to say that you shouldn't.\n\n217\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.180\nIt just means that a lot of us,\nprobably, will not need to.\n\n218\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.970\nBut you may wanna be aware of it and\n\n219\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.040\nstart exploring the capabilities\nof that at some point.\n\n220\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.330\nBecause it gives you\nadditional power even up and\n\n221\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.120\nbeyond what's normally in\nMetasploit on its own.\n\n222\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.000\nIt lets you dig into even\ndeeper stuff in products, and\n\n223\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.590\nreally poke and prod things to break it.\n\n224\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.130\nSo yeah, that's a cool thing, really.\n\n225\n00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.150\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n226\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.270\nSo a few different utilities\nthat have changed forms,\n\n227\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.600\nchanged names over the last\nfew developments of Cali.\n\n228\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.540\nSome of them being brought\nover from back track.\n\n229\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.680\nStill there, still have the functionality,\nyou just need to be aware of it.\n\n230\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.470\nYou might be one that's\nused this in the past, and\n\n231\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.410\nyou remember using that\nMSF payload command.\n\n232\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.910\nYou go to type it in and it doesn't work.\n\n233\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.250\nNow we know it's just been\nreplaced with that MSF Venom.\n\n234\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.380\nAs well as the MSFencode, that's also\nbeing replaced by that MSF venom, so\n\n235\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.900\nit's gonna do both jobs.\n\n236\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.805\nAnd then we got that NASM shell if we want\nto dive into the assembly language and\n\n237\n00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:47.590\ndo some work in there.\n\n238\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.420\nSo a lot of good stuff.\n\n239\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.950\nAny other things we need to be aware of?\n\n240\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.610\nChanges or\nutilities that they've modified?\n\n241\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.550\n>> Those would be for right now,\nthe ones I have said were deprecated.\n\n242\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.050\nAs well before, I mentioned the MSFCLI.\n\n243\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.980\nThat would be the other one\nthat would be deprecated.\n\n244\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.689\nThat would add to this list of payload and\nencode.\n\n245\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.930\nJust like I said, just be aware of some\nof these things, that they're not there,\n\n246\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:18.180\nso if you look in the documentation,\nand for some of the older stuff, and\n\n247\n00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.220\nthey had, or that someone doesn't tell\nyou the documentation was written for\n\n248\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.120\nan older version, which, don't expect\nthem to always online and tell you,\n\n249\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.510\nhey we wrote this for an older version.\n\n250\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.000\nSomeone's just trying to be nice and\n\n251\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.530\nwrote the stuff to help everybody and\nthey didn't think about that.\n\n252\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.490\nSo now you've got a situation where\nyou might try to copy an example and\n\n253\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.390\nit breaks.\n\n254\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.920\nIf something breaks you\nstart examining it,\n\n255\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.490\nyou may very quickly find\nthat stuffs been deprecated.\n\n256\n00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.780\nBut this is just a few for right now.\n\n257\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.640\nFortunately, I should say, fortunately\nI guess I should add as well is that\n\n258\n00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.030\nif you run some of these things and\nthey are deprecated,\n\n259\n00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.710\nusually they're pretty good\nabout just telling you.\n\n260\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.430\nThey'll just tell you by the way,\n\n261\n00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.910\nthat command's dead,\nthis is what it's replaced with.\n\n262\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.070\nAnd then it will leave you right there,\nit will dump you out of whatever you're\n\n263\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.300\nin and say, go look for your answers\nthere because this isn't here.\n\n264\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.070\nIf you were to run payload or\n\n265\n00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.670\nencode you'll see right away that they\nwill tell you right there on screen,\n\n266\n00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.648\nMS Venom, that's where you should be,\nis not here because this is gone.\n\n267\n00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:23.530\nThis is just giving you a banner that hey,\nstop using this and go over there.\n\n268\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.950\nSo that is a cool thing but I know there\nis other stuff in there that's deprecated\n\n269\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:34.290\nthat I haven't bumped into so I can't\ntell you that everything is that way.\n\n270\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:40.435\nSo just be a little cautious and make\nsure that you are looking at stuff for\n\n271\n00:14:40.435 --> 00:14:44.885\nKali and that will set you\nat least on the right path.\n\n272\n00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:48.455\nOnce you have got comfortable with Kali\nand know what's in there, then you could\n\n273\n00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:51.814\nprobably go look at some of the older\nstuff and say oh, well I could use that,\n\n274\n00:14:51.814 --> 00:14:55.030\nbut oh, I gotta tweak a code here or\nhere to make that work.\n\n275\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.850\nBut learn the basics before you do that.\n\n276\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.620\n>> Very good.\n\n277\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.240\nAll right,\na lot of good information in this episode.\n\n278\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.150\nBut look at our clock, it's about time for\nus to wrap this one up, so\n\n279\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.690\nwe hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n280\n00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.447\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n281\n00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:11.219\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n282\n00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:12.216\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n283\n00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:15.432\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.692\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick and\nwith me today Mr. Shaun Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:16.388\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:17.109\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.654\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:19.175\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:23.029\nAnother exciting episode coming\nyour way of our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.393\nAnd in this one, we're gonna be looking at\nour passive intelligence gathering tools.\n\n10\n00:00:28.393 --> 00:00:31.997\nSo Sean, I guess we should start with\nwhat do you mean by passive intelligence\n\n11\n00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.390\ngathering?\n\n12\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.590\n>> Well,\nthis passive intelligence gathering,\n\n13\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.230\nit just means we are gathering\ninformation out of the environment and\n\n14\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.802\ndoing as little interaction with\nthe intended target is possible.\n\n15\n00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:50.761\nAnd so, a lot of these techniques\nwill be gathering it from just places\n\n16\n00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.956\nwhere information has\nhappened to leak out or\n\n17\n00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:57.252\nhas just been posted in some way shape or\nform.\n\n18\n00:00:57.252 --> 00:01:01.496\nWe're just gonna scrape it off those\nsources and then put it together into\n\n19\n00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:05.809\na picture that hopefully gives us enough\nto continue on with our process and\n\n20\n00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.497\nso Metasploit's gonna\nhelp us out with that.\n\n21\n00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:11.894\n>> So hitting place, we're not really\ntouching the target or attacking them at\n\n22\n00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:15.409\nthis point, we're just finding all those\nplaces that companies love to hide.\n\n23\n00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.821\nNot hide, but put information out there\nmaybe not thinking that it's gonna amount\n\n24\n00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:20.586\nto anything.\n\n25\n00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:23.930\nBut if we do it right, we gather a bunch\nof information from a bunch of different\n\n26\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.479\nsources, we can paint a pretty\ngood picture of our target.\n\n27\n00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.419\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n28\n00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:32.632\nAnd that's the name of the game is to\nget as complete a picture as you can,\n\n29\n00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:37.692\nso you can target things much,\nmuch better than you would otherwise.\n\n30\n00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:41.831\nIf you don't get a good complete picture,\nyou're gonna be targeting stuff and\n\n31\n00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:46.278\nit's going to be very, very uncoordinated\nand very, very sloppy attack and you know\n\n32\n00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:50.399\nthink bull in China shop as that old\nsaying goes and you've kinda got the idea.\n\n33\n00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.529\nIt's not gonna work in your favor,\nso we really wanna make sure that\n\n34\n00:01:55.529 --> 00:02:00.393\nwe're gathering good, workable,\nactionable information.\n\n35\n00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:03.141\n>> Nice.\nSo gathering this information from\n\n36\n00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:07.291\npublicly available sources like who is and\nplaces like that.\n\n37\n00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:11.483\nWhat are some of the tools that\nMetasploit brings to bear on this?\n\n38\n00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:16.485\n>> Well, what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna use some of the tools that\n\n39\n00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:21.733\nwe see in other places, but we're just\ngonna use them through Metasploit,\n\n40\n00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:26.735\nso we gain some comfort level of using\nthese tools through Metasploit and\n\n41\n00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.120\nso that's kind of the cool thing.\n\n42\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.020\nIt's something that we said, again, in an\nearlier segment that you can access a lot\n\n43\n00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.644\nof these tools that are built into the\noperating system, you can access them and\n\n44\n00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:41.079\npull them right on over into Metasploit.\n\n45\n00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.412\nAnd you don't have to do anything funky\nwhere you're opening up another console\n\n46\n00:02:45.412 --> 00:02:48.280\nwindow and running it over there and\nflipping back and\n\n47\n00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.209\nforth, you don't have to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.190\nIt's right there ready for you to go.\n\n49\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.845\nSo that's what we're gonna focus on is\nactually using some of the tools that\n\n50\n00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:04.023\nwe've seen before, but we're gonna use\nthem within the Metasploit environment.\n\n51\n00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:09.039\nAnd I also think it's something that\nneeds to be added to this is that\n\n52\n00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:14.671\nwe're not doing this in the context of\nlooking at a pen testing engagement,\n\n53\n00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.280\nso we're not selecting\na specific victim here.\n\n54\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.994\nWe're gonna assume at this point,\n\n55\n00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:25.155\nthat if you've been through\nthe other things with us,\n\n56\n00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:30.410\nlike the CEH and Kali that you've\nkinda got a handle on what entails.\n\n57\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.839\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\njust gonna focus on Metasploit and\n\n58\n00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.270\nthen you can string them together and\neverything else, cuz yeah,\n\n59\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.304\nthat ground's been covered already.\n\n60\n00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:41.161\nVery good.\n\n61\n00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.414\nSo where do we start?\n\n62\n00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:45.399\nAny particular place you like to start?\n\n63\n00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.002\nYou got a favorite or?\n\n64\n00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:52.003\n>> You've got a bunch of places that\nyou can start when you are doing\n\n65\n00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:56.819\nyour passive investigation and\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna get\n\n66\n00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.393\ninformation that is gonna help us with\nour next stage as we were saying.\n\n67\n00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:07.300\nSo what we might wanna do is to get\nthings that have things relating to\n\n68\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.186\nIP addresses and\nIP ranges would be very, very good.\n\n69\n00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:15.001\nWe wanna get DNS information,\nif at all possible and\n\n70\n00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.613\nthere's plenty of ways to do that.\n\n71\n00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:20.759\nSo we wanna get those things.\n\n72\n00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.601\nIf we can get operating\nsystem information, hey,\n\n73\n00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:27.843\nthat's great to pull that and anything\nelse technical that you can gather.\n\n74\n00:04:27.843 --> 00:04:32.884\nI mean, I would tell you for\nthe operating system stuff in particular,\n\n75\n00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:37.085\nif you can during your process\nof intelligence gathering,\n\n76\n00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:41.791\ngain information as to what\noperating system someone's using and\n\n77\n00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.422\nmaybe different patch levels and\nstuff like that.\n\n78\n00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:50.075\nThat may actually be available someplace\nout in the ether, as I sometimes say.\n\n79\n00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:54.030\nIf it's out there someplace and\nyou can find it, that actually really\n\n80\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.931\nhelps you significantly,\nespecially with a tool like Metasploit.\n\n81\n00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:03.760\nCuz Metasploit has it exploits and\npayloads built specifically into it,\n\n82\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.787\nas we saw that take advantage of\nthe things on different operating systems.\n\n83\n00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:14.106\nSo if you can really pick that up,\nthen yeah, you can do stuff like drop a,\n\n84\n00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.699\nwe were talking about\ndoing a remote shell.\n\n85\n00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.101\nBang, you can do that.\n\n86\n00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:24.464\nSo just be aware of what version you\nactually have or if you can find out\n\n87\n00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:29.735\nthe version information, which we kind of,\nif you go back to CEH and\n\n88\n00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:35.396\ngo back to other stuff we've done,\nwe kind of no ways to do that already.\n\n89\n00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:39.041\nWe're just kinda bringing\nthose tools over here.\n\n90\n00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:41.685\n>> But that's gonna make a big\ndifference in your test or\n\n91\n00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:45.092\nyour attack or whatever it is we're\ntrying to do because as you said,\n\n92\n00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:48.855\nsome of these exploits are very specific\nto a particular operating system,\n\n93\n00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:52.484\nmight be a particular operating system\naddition or a piece of hardware.\n\n94\n00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:56.090\nIn particular,\nvendor like Netgear versus Linksys.\n\n95\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.821\nSame exploits don't work on both,\n\n96\n00:05:57.821 --> 00:06:00.772\nit really helps then to know\nwhat it is you're dealing with.\n\n97\n00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:04.975\nAnd that's all possible really\nwith what we've seen in,\n\n98\n00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:08.592\nas you said,\nin other episodes with CEH and Kali.\n\n99\n00:06:08.592 --> 00:06:13.749\nWe can usually figure that out\nwith a pretty good certainty.\n\n100\n00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.727\n>> Yeah, we have the power\nalready to do a lot of this, so\n\n101\n00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:21.270\nwe can start putting those things together\nto bring it over to bear on Kali.\n\n102\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.873\nSo we can get that information and\nstart getting exploits for our arsenal,\n\n103\n00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:28.000\nthat's just a really neat thing.\n\n104\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.304\nNow you may not have paid a lot of\nattention to that stuff when or\n\n105\n00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:37.039\nnot as much as you should have-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.223\n>> You're over on the Kali side,\n\n107\n00:06:39.223 --> 00:06:43.509\ncuz you were maybe looking at Kali and\nCEH and saying, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.948\nWell, that's good to know that and that\nand that and you may have noted it, but\n\n109\n00:06:47.948 --> 00:06:52.119\nyou may have not seen, you may have seen\nokay we did some stuff later on that\n\n110\n00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:55.846\nreally didn't give it All the weight\nthat you maybe should have.\n\n111\n00:06:55.846 --> 00:07:01.071\nNow when we bring this into the picture,\nit adds a whole another level to it,\n\n112\n00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:06.216\ncuz once you can pick up with something\nlike EnMAP, for example, if we pick\n\n113\n00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:11.546\nthat up and we can see Service Pack\ninformation and see those types of things.\n\n114\n00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:15.772\nThat's letting us basically go from\nthrowing hand grenades to all of a sudden,\n\n115\n00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:18.241\nwe're painting a dot\nfrom a laser on the back.\n\n116\n00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:20.798\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On the back of the thing, saying hey,\n\n117\n00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:21.341\nI got you.\n\n118\n00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:26.687\nIt's just a matter of what are we\ngonna launch at that point?\n\n119\n00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:30.158\nSo some really neat stuff and\nthis is also, by the way,\n\n120\n00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:35.140\nsomething that has been said along this\nwhole path with penetration testing no\n\n121\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.794\nmatter where we've been in the process.\n\n122\n00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:42.113\nIt's been you gotta have platform\nknowledge, because when you start picking\n\n123\n00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:46.170\nup details, you'll start understanding\nthe platform that's there and\n\n124\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.394\nthat's also gonna help drive\nwhat you do at later stages.\n\n125\n00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:52.382\nSo with that being said,\nyeah, we can go ahead and\n\n126\n00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:54.954\nget started gathering some information.\n\n127\n00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:58.879\nSo, and it seems like some of the first\nthings we always look for, IP addresses,\n\n128\n00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.710\nDNS information,\nI mean that really does help us.\n\n129\n00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.940\nIf we don't know what their IP address\nrange is, it makes it hard to scan or\n\n130\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.955\nattack, or pretty much do anything, right?\n\n131\n00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:07.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n132\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.120\nit's really gonna hamper your ability, so\n\n133\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.360\nyou're gonna wanna have\nthat information in hand.\n\n134\n00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.910\nSo, we need to start gathering\ninformation like that, and\n\n135\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.480\nI don't necessarily always gather\nit in any particular order.\n\n136\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.230\nI mean yeah, you'll find when you go\nthrough it that there are some things\n\n137\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.730\nthat have a more of a logical order and\nsequence to them.\n\n138\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.950\nAnd that's fine, but you don't always\nhave to stick with the same sequence.\n\n139\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.680\nYou might find that it's easier to\nget things at different times from\n\n140\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.210\ndifferent places, and\njust go ahead and go with the flow.\n\n141\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.460\nOf course, like I said, if there are cases\nwhere something does have to flow in\n\n142\n00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.880\na logical sequence, then you'll recognize\nthat when you get some practice.\n\n143\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.120\nSo we can go ahead, we can start-\n>> Well, let's take a look at it.\n\n144\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.400\n>> Get in and gather information.\n\n145\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.670\n>> Let's do some passive\nintelligence gathering.\n\n146\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.800\n>> All right.\n\n147\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.770\nSo let's just kinda get in.\n\n148\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.440\nAnd like I said,\n\n149\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.800\nthese tools, you've seen some of\nthe ones I'm gonna use here before.\n\n150\n00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.190\nBut what we're gonna do is we are going to\njust access them through Metasploit and\n\n151\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.640\nsee if there's any difference at all.\n\n152\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.890\nSo, we've got up here, here's\nthe Metasploit console, the MSF console.\n\n153\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:29.570\nSo, one of the ones we can access,\nit's available on here, is whois.\n\n154\n00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:36.030\nAnd so I can just do a whois right here\nat the command line in Metasploit.\n\n155\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.620\nSame syntax, and you can see it\nspits up the exact same information.\n\n156\n00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.290\nSo when I go through all this and I think\noh, yeah, went up a little too far.\n\n157\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.960\nYou can see, this one doesn't look like.\n\n158\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.176\nThis is actually kind of interesting.\nIt didn't give me a lot of information\n\n159\n00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:50.720\nwith that.\n\n160\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.170\nDidn't give me any information with that.\n\n161\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.790\nSo that's, I mean,\nsometimes that stuff does happen.\n\n162\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.190\nYou gotta be prepared for it.\n\n163\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.110\nI mean, I know there's other\nplaces I can get that from,\n\n164\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.490\nlike NetCraft would be able\nto pull stuff like that.\n\n165\n00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.680\nThe IANA website would be\nable to pull stuff like that.\n\n166\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.590\nI mean, so there are other tools for this.\n\n167\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.020\nAnd remember this is Kali, we do have\nother tools to pull this stuff as well.\n\n168\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.600\nSo that would be something\nthat you'd kinda wanna say oh,\n\n169\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.200\nwell, it didn't work, what do we do?\n\n170\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.540\nAm I stuck,\nam I gonna beat my head against a wall?\n\n171\n00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.430\nNo, just use something else.\n\n172\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:32.346\nSo we could look for, let's see if\nI put in a website like USA Today,\n\n173\n00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:34.170\nif it gives me anything.\n\n174\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.070\nWell, that gave me some more.\n\n175\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:43.090\nSo I go through here, and\nlooks like a standard record there.\n\n176\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.967\nThere's nothing that's\nany big surprise there.\n\n177\n00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:51.560\nI'm seeing just the stuff\nI would expect to see.\n\n178\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.600\nI see my different pieces of information,\n\n179\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.170\nwho registered it, and\nsome other stuff just going through here.\n\n180\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:07.210\nTypical stuff we, like I said, we expect\nto see with this type of utility.\n\n181\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:13.690\nSo we're getting information,\nwe gather it as appropriate.\n\n182\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:19.660\nSo that's not necessarily a bad start,\nI would say.\n\n183\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:25.345\nProbably consider going\nthrough another tool.\n\n184\n00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:27.385\nYou could even access the web browser.\n\n185\n00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:32.395\nNot through Metasploit, but you might\naccess the web browser, open it up and\n\n186\n00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:37.010\nstart punching stuff in to see if you\ncan get an IP address out of there.\n\n187\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.990\nSee if you can get more information\nto build on top of that.\n\n188\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:46.570\nSo, now this is also a good example of\nsomething else that may be a roadblock\n\n189\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.570\nto some of you out there\nis if remember when we\n\n190\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.040\ngo back to the beginning of this section,\nI said anything that you can access,\n\n191\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.437\nanything in the operating system,\npretty much, through Metasploit, okay?\n\n192\n00:12:00.437 --> 00:12:04.105\nWell, you gotta really read into that,\n\n193\n00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:08.985\nbecause there's a possibility that some of\nyou out there may have typed in whois and\n\n194\n00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:12.576\nit just came back and\nit's like yeah, okay, whatever.\n\n195\n00:12:12.576 --> 00:12:15.005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's unknown command and\n\n196\n00:12:15.005 --> 00:12:17.022\nyou got frustrated.\n\n197\n00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:18.622\nNow, why would it do that?\n\n198\n00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:21.042\nWell, you don't have whois on your system.\n\n199\n00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:23.292\nWindows does not have whois on there.\n\n200\n00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:26.442\nSo it could very well just\npuke all over that and\n\n201\n00:12:26.442 --> 00:12:30.072\nsay I'm not doing that,\nbecause it's not there.\n\n202\n00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:31.102\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n203\n00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:36.542\nYou can get a whois client for Windows,\nyou can get it right from Microsoft.\n\n204\n00:12:36.542 --> 00:12:40.000\nMicrosoft makes it available for\nfree, so if you really want that and\n\n205\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.642\nto do something like that,\nyou can grab it.\n\n206\n00:12:41.642 --> 00:12:43.140\nBut remember,\n\n207\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.470\nthe commands we're accessing here are\ncommands that are in the operating system.\n\n208\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.190\nWe're just accessing\nthem through Metasploit.\n\n209\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.410\nSo if it's not in the operating system,\nit's a no go.\n\n210\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.530\nIt's not something that Metasploit's\ngonna say okay, I got you covered, and\n\n211\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.390\nbrings it with it.\n\n212\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.169\nNo, it has to be in the operating system\nof what we're doing with these commands.\n\n213\n00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:03.850\nSo if you saw that, there you go.\n\n214\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:10.110\nSo what we would do here is\nwe'll make it quick and easy\n\n215\n00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.470\nsince we've been through the whole process\nof gathering IP addresses, and the like.\n\n216\n00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.515\nWe will say okay, well,\nwe got an IP address.\n\n217\n00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:21.604\nWell l, anything else we can do?\n\n218\n00:13:21.604 --> 00:13:24.155\nAny other information\nthat we might wanna get?\n\n219\n00:13:24.155 --> 00:13:26.270\nWell, other information\nyou can get through here,\n\n220\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.240\nit's useful to get DNS information.\n\n221\n00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.533\nWe've got some of it here, but\nwe can get other information through,\n\n222\n00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:41.347\njust by going to the framework and\ndoing an nslookup.\n\n223\n00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:44.479\nAnd again, you'll notice nslookup\nbrings it back and it actually,\n\n224\n00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.100\nyou can see in here, what did it do?\n\n225\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.700\nIt was in Metasploit.\n\n226\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.750\nAnd since I'm running nslookup in\nthe interactive mode and I didn't type in\n\n227\n00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.440\nnslookup and then space the name,\nit's right in our interactive mode.\n\n228\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.630\nSo it's gonna have its own command prompt.\n\n229\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.978\nSo what do I do here?\n\n230\n00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:04.440\nI do nslookup,\nit drops out of Metasploit and\n\n231\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.195\nsays okay, you want to run nslookup,\nso here you go.\n\n232\n00:14:07.195 --> 00:14:11.940\nSo I type in, I would say I want\nto look at all the records.\n\n233\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.690\nSo I'd do set type to any,\nand hit Enter on that.\n\n234\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.830\nAnd then say okay, well, let's look at\n\n235\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.650\nthe public record for ITProTV.\n\n236\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.510\nWe'll say we'll look out there for\nthat once we hit Enter on it.\n\n237\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.610\nAnd what does it do?\n\n238\n00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.620\nIt spits back a bunch of stuff that you\n\n239\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.810\ncould pull out of a normal name server\nlookup without really any effort.\n\n240\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.955\nSo, this stuff would be, again,\n\n241\n00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:48.675\ngood information that could be used for\nplanning a further attack.\n\n242\n00:14:48.675 --> 00:14:50.795\nI can see IP addresses in there.\n\n243\n00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.415\nI can see nameserver stuff.\n\n244\n00:14:53.415 --> 00:14:56.040\nI can see an SOA record,\nstart of authority record.\n\n245\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.360\nThere's a mail record in there.\n\n246\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.620\nSo I'm getting some good information.\n\n247\n00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.920\nI would be noting these\nthings as I went through.\n\n248\n00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.410\nI mean, there's the server information,\nthere's just going right on down the list.\n\n249\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.840\nSo, we're not doing too bad at this point.\n\n250\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.227\nAnd of course, again,\nyou guys have seen before.\n\n251\n00:15:17.227 --> 00:15:21.820\nWe're just now doing it\nwithin inside of metasploit.\n\n252\n00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.930\nAnd you could, if you really wanted to\ntake it to the next level, there are ways\n\n253\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.475\nto actually get this stuff and just dump\nit into that database if you wanted to.\n\n254\n00:15:31.475 --> 00:15:35.365\nAgain, we're not gonna worry\nabout that at this point, but\n\n255\n00:15:35.365 --> 00:15:40.185\nwe could do that if were building a case\nor wanted track stuff or whatever.\n\n256\n00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:42.798\nWe could do that.\n\n257\n00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:46.250\nSo there's our information,\nyou can see it's trying to look for\n\n258\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.776\nan authoritative answer,\nit didn't get one.\n\n259\n00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:52.640\nSo no big deal, I'll quit out of that and\n\n260\n00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.306\nthat should Is it quit for\n>> Exit?\n\n261\n00:15:57.306 --> 00:16:00.150\n>> I knew I'd jack it up.\n\n262\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.100\nSo, do exit.\n\n263\n00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.570\nOkay, it doesn't like me at that point.\n\n264\n00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.100\nSo, all right.\n\n265\n00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.730\n>> At least it didn't dump\nyou all the way back to.\n\n266\n00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.090\n>> Yeah, I didn't dump me all the way out,\n[LAUGH] so.\n\n267\n00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.835\nAll right.\n\n268\n00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:15.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you're getting information here,\n\n269\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.700\nso we're doing pretty good.\n\n270\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.060\nThat the stuff that we have that we've\npulled out of NSlookup is stuff that we\n\n271\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.980\ncan target, you know, through Metasploit.\n\n272\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.350\nMetasploit does have plugins specifically\ndesigned to go after that information.\n\n273\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.860\nSo you should be wherever it is,\ndocumenting that.\n\n274\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:40.190\nOf course we know that, but\nwe're just kinda reiterating that we have,\n\n275\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.090\nthat we wanna do these types of things.\n\n276\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.490\nYou might consider, and\nI'm not gonna worry about it here.\n\n277\n00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.050\nBut you might actually consider\nusing techniques at this point,\n\n278\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:56.790\nto kind of hit some of those, do banner\ngrabs and hit some of those IP addresses.\n\n279\n00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.880\nLike the name servers.\n\n280\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.090\nYou get the IP address and\n\n281\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.460\nhit it, because you might be able to tell\nwhat operating system that's running on.\n\n282\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:10.980\nAnd there's tools directly in\nMetasploit that will hit DNS servers.\n\n283\n00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.090\nYou might look at getting the IP address.\n\n284\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.580\nWe see an IP address there for\na mail server.\n\n285\n00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.800\nThat looks like it's hosted\nby Microsoft with that.\n\n286\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.530\nWell, we could hit that and\nfigure out, see if we could figure out\n\n287\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.439\nwhat operating system and\nmaybe what mail server they're using.\n\n288\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.540\nProbably notes, right?\n\n289\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.740\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH] I'm sure.\n\n290\n00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.400\n>> Yeah, that's what they're doing.\n\n291\n00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.060\nIt's their trick.\n\n292\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.610\nSo we could hit that IP address and\n\n293\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.110\nfigure out presumably what\nversion exchange they're running.\n\n294\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:48.960\nAnd there are exploits for that too, so\n\n295\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.320\nthat's where you gotta look a little\ndeeper now and take some time.\n\n296\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:00.100\nYou know how to do that, so we're not\ngonna take a ton of time doing that.\n\n297\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.080\nYou should already know how to do that.\n\n298\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.620\nIf you're not, CEH has that covered.\n\n299\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.660\nSo we'll let you go back there to\nthe intelligence gathering and\n\n300\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.670\nreconnaissance stuff to crystallize\nthat and get that clear for you.\n\n301\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.970\nSo we're doing not too bad so far.\n\n302\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.000\nWe're getting good stuff and we can go\neven further with this if you wanted.\n\n303\n00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.040\nAnd I haven't even opened up\nother stuff like Netcraft.\n\n304\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.060\nI haven't opened up that.\n\n305\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.050\nI haven't opened up these other utilities.\n\n306\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.570\nTo, take it to that level.\n\n307\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.170\nThere's nothing saying you couldn't,\nI just haven't done that.\n\n308\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:44.660\nYou know so, there's those things\nactually available to you.\n\n309\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.560\n>> A lot of good information so far.\n\n310\n00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.570\nWe've just used a couple of those.\n\n311\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:55.790\n>> And there, just an FYI we also have\nsome other, just to put it out there.\n\n312\n00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.280\nI'm not I got kind of fat\nfingers a couple times,\n\n313\n00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.400\nthat's why I'm getting\na lot of stuff in here.\n\n314\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.440\nWe could do one for\nwhat was mentioned in the Kali class,\n\n315\n00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.950\ndo the load balancing discovery.\n\n316\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.790\nWe're doing our probing around hit Enter,\nand see what it pops up and says oh yeah,\n\n317\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:19.740\nthere's load balancing in place, or\nnot in place as the case may be.\n\n318\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.870\nSo that's something that we're looking\nin there and we're seeing that,\n\n319\n00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.690\nit's telling us\nthe information that it found.\n\n320\n00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.400\nI found that kind of interesting.\n\n321\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.250\nI did put Microsoft, right?\n\n322\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.070\nIt says Apache.\n\n323\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.100\nYeah.\nInteresting.\n\n324\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.000\n>> Microsoft has seen the light.\n\n325\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.680\n>> They're changing [LAUGH]\n>> So that could be.\n\n326\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:52.780\nThis is actually a good learning thing\nhere because we might have a situation.\n\n327\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.380\nI mean the guy who writes this tool you\ncan kind of see a little bit of him in\n\n328\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.670\nthe upper right.\n\n329\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.610\nHe says it might give false positives and\nstuff.\n\n330\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.700\nSo he's telling you yeah,\nhe's well aware that this thing is,\n\n331\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.740\nhe wrote it and\nhe's still kinda playing with it.\n\n332\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.670\nAnd possibly it's gonna give\nyou bogus information, so\n\n333\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.810\nyou might not wanna entirely\nrely on what's on here.\n\n334\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.850\nAnd anybody that was watching our Kali\nstuff last week knows we ran the exact\n\n335\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.380\nsame tool, and it did say that\nthere was load balancing there.\n\n336\n00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.710\nAnd we know there's load balancing there.\n\n337\n00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.810\nWe've checked that already.\n\n338\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.530\nSo, why is this doing it?\n\n339\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.840\nWell, this could be,\nwhen we look at Apache,\n\n340\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.540\nApache's typically associated with\nthe Unix / Linux side of the house.\n\n341\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.640\nWell, if you remember from way back,\n\n342\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.850\nwhen we did our Netcraft stuff, we saw\nthat it said that there was Linux and\n\n343\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:45.050\nthen there was IAS running on top of it\nand we said that can't exist that way.\n\n344\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.850\nSo we determined that there was a load\nbalancer sitting in front of it, and\n\n345\n00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.840\nthen there was the Windows system behind\nthat with all these things on top of it,\n\n346\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.350\nthat's probably what's picking up.\n\n347\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.580\nIt's probably going out directly,\nand hitting that instead.\n\n348\n00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:04.960\nAnd it's IDed that aspect of it,\nhasn't IDed the stuff behind it.\n\n349\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.420\n>> And we've mentioned a couple times\nin a few of our different classes,\n\n350\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.070\nwe talk about trust to verify\n>> Use more than one tool if you got it,\n\n351\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.231\ndon't assume everything's\nalways gonna be 100% correct.\n\n352\n00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:17.970\n>> Yeah, it's always,\nalways, always that way.\n\n353\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.140\nDon't just run your favorite tool and\n\n354\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.120\ngo oh, well that's dead on,\nthat' exactly what I wanna see.\n\n355\n00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.440\n>> That can hurt you.\n\n356\n00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.220\nEspecially with that mindset,\nthat's exactly what I wanna see,\n\n357\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.220\nalso you had a preconceived\nidea what you should see?\n\n358\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:38.770\nSo you're gonna mold your evidence\naround that, so the other way around,\n\n359\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.020\nso yeah,\njust be careful with this type of stuff.\n\n360\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:47.099\nSo, but, yeah, we've already seen\na couple of things here that we can just\n\n361\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.650\ndrop right out of the Metasploit\nenvironment temporarily,\n\n362\n00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.850\nrun those commands, and\nwe can go right back in when we exit it.\n\n363\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.660\nSo we're not fully\nexiting that environment.\n\n364\n00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:05.620\nWe could be just porting this stuff\nover and doing our whole deal.\n\n365\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.180\nAnd we're not limited to just those tools.\n\n366\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.560\nLike I said,\nit's really anything and in our Kali\n\n367\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.390\nexploration, we saw tools for\ndoing all sorts of stuff.\n\n368\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.220\nPulling meta data and\nuser information and doing all of that.\n\n369\n00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:29.040\nSo you could potentially be bringing a lot\nof open source stuff right over here\n\n370\n00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.670\ninto Metasploit and\nbe doing further things with it.\n\n371\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.230\nWe just haven't got there.\n\n372\n00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.930\nit's like we were just talking\nabout the fact that you can\n\n373\n00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.900\ndo this open source intelligence\ngathering quite easily with it.\n\n374\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.750\nSo that's what we want to take out of\nit is that you can run these tools.\n\n375\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.020\nAgain, if it says when you run a tool\ninside of here saying unknown command or\n\n376\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.950\nsomething.\n\n377\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.710\nIf you typed it right and\nall that's correct,\n\n378\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.150\nthen it's probably not on your system,\nand it knows it.\n\n379\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.480\nIt's not gonna say oh yeah,\nI'll go download it.\n\n380\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.780\nIt's gonna say I don't know what's\nwrong here, but I can't find it.\n\n381\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.100\nYou go solve it and ask me again.\n\n382\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.060\n>> So\nMetasploit gives us a nice interface.\n\n383\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.760\nA way to kind of run it all\nfrom that one location and\n\n384\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.240\neven at some point start putting\nit in this common database\n\n385\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.450\nto keep track of our project, but\nyou still have to have the tool.\n\n386\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.590\nMetasploit doesn't give\nyou all these tools.\n\n387\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.670\nIt has to be there on your system in\norder for Metasploit to access it.\n\n388\n00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.830\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n389\n00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.820\nIf it's not there,\nyou won't be able to access it, period.\n\n390\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:31.170\nSo be very, very cautious with that.\n\n391\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:31.770\n>> Very good, Sean.\n\n392\n00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.160\nAgain, a lot of great information here.\n\n393\n00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.620\nPassive intelligence gathering,\ngoing out and\n\n394\n00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.050\nfinding information that's readily\navailable through public means.\n\n395\n00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.370\nWe didn't break into anything,\n\n396\n00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.770\nwe're not stealing anything,\nwe're not cracking passwords yet.\n\n397\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.170\nWe're checking who is databases,\n\n398\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.760\nwe're looking at DNS information\nhere at the registrars, we could\n\n399\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.940\npossibly be looking at I'm assuming\ncompany websites and places like that.\n\n400\n00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.890\nWe've talked about other ways to do this\npassive intelligence gathering in other\n\n401\n00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.050\nshows.\n\n402\n00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.015\nSocial media, all that great stuff,\nlot of Information out there.\n\n403\n00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:05.995\nAnd it lets us start painting a picture\nof our target, of what it is that we're\n\n404\n00:24:05.995 --> 00:24:09.885\ntrying to either test or attack, or\nwhatever it is we're trying to do.\n\n405\n00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:12.705\nSo anything else you want to\nthrow in here Sean on the passive\n\n406\n00:24:12.705 --> 00:24:14.275\nintelligence gathering?\n\n407\n00:24:14.275 --> 00:24:18.035\n>> You know,\nI like what you just said about it.\n\n408\n00:24:18.035 --> 00:24:22.636\nWhen you're saying it about that we have\nall these different information sources\n\n409\n00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:24.510\nand places we can get stuff from.\n\n410\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:30.852\nJust kinda look at and think about what\nyou've got sitting on your desktop,\n\n411\n00:24:30.852 --> 00:24:35.328\nif you're virtualizing Kali\nwith Metasploit in it.\n\n412\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.930\nAll the tools you need to\ngather information are-\n\n413\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.460\nthere's just a tremendous amount.\n\n414\n00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.070\nWe said there was like 300, I actually\nread, there are they said over 400.\n\n415\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.040\nSo we were off by a little bit.\n\n416\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.380\nAnd whatever.\n\n417\n00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:55.170\nBut you've got over 400 tools in KALI.\n\n418\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.520\nAnd that's not Including the full\ncapabilities of Metasploit.\n\n419\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.880\nMetasploit's just, oh,\nMetasploit's in there.\n\n420\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.200\nWell Metasploit's not one tool,\nit's a whole other\n\n421\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.020\ncan of worms you're opening that has\nthat additional levels of power.\n\n422\n00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:14.290\nSo when you get down to\nit there could be 1,000\n\n423\n00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:18.880\ntools plus that you have in Kali, when\nyou combine Metasploit and Kali together.\n\n424\n00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.440\nI mean so that translates to just so\n\n425\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.690\nmuch raw power sitting at your\ndesktop getting ready for\n\n426\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.320\nyou to use, that it's kinda frightening\nin a way what you could do with it.\n\n427\n00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.450\nAnd we haven't even gotten to the nasty\nstuff yet we can do with this.\n\n428\n00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.140\n>> Frightening,\n\n429\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.390\nexhilarating I guess it just depends on\nwhich way you wanna look at it so [LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.020\nAll right, so Sean I'll tell you what,\n\n431\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.600\nit's about time to wrap\nthis episode up so.\n\n432\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.130\nWanna thank everybody for tuning in and\nwatching, hope you enjoyed it.\n\n433\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.610\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike

00:00:17.030\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.200\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.020\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.940\n>> How are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.030\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.850\nWe've got another exciting episode\ncoming your way here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.920\nWe're continuing on with\nour Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.500\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\nfocus on active intelligence gathering.\n\n11\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.570\nI know in a a previous episode we talked\nabout passive intelligence gathering.\n\n12\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.870\nSo if you haven't seen that one,\nmake sure you go and watch that one.\n\n13\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.440\nAnd now we're gonna switch gears and\ndo a little active intelligence gathering.\n\n14\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.310\nWhat's the big difference,\n\n15\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.770\nSean, between passive and active before\nwe dive into all these cool tools?\n\n16\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.340\n>> Well, the real difference between\nthe two is the fact that when you're doing\n\n17\n00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.360\npassive you are doing as little possible\nengagement with the system as you can.\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.923\nAnd in fact,\n\n19\n00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:01.167\nwhen I say as little as possible,\ntheoretically shouldn't be doing any.\n\n20\n00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:04.535\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we do find if you look back at some\n\n21\n00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:10.638\nof the techniques we've used over our\nprevious journeys through PIN testing,\n\n22\n00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:16.645\nwe found out that, yeah, there are some\ncases where you do very very minimal,\n\n23\n00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:22.777\nbut not enough to really increase your\nchances of getting caught all that much.\n\n24\n00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:27.987\nNow when you go over to active you\nare firing probes at the system or\n\n25\n00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.510\nsystems as the case may be.\n\n26\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.740\nReally looking for\nthat information to see what you can get.\n\n27\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.050\nIt could be you're looking to pull ranges\nof the systems that are up or down.\n\n28\n00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.500\nIt could be that you're trying to\nget lists of ports that are open.\n\n29\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520\nYou could possibly start moving into that,\nbut\n\n30\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.270\nthere's a number of things but\nactively means yes,\n\n31\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.480\nyou are engaging in the system you are\ndoing much more to make yourself visible\n\n32\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.290\nbut information may be more accurate but\nyou do pay for that at a price.\n\n33\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460\nSo that's the big\ndifference between the two.\n\n34\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.470\n>> So in our passive phase we were\ngathering things like IP address ranges,\n\n35\n00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.930\nDNS names that were registered.\n\n36\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.830\nGoing into these public sources of\ninformation that anybody can go get,\n\n37\n00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.100\nso we weren't raising any flags or setting\noff any alarms or anything like that.\n\n38\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.000\nNow we're going to take that information,\n\n39\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.870\nlike those IP address ranges,\ntry to find their live host.\n\n40\n00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.640\nBut to do that,\nwe've got to talk to their network.\n\n41\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.680\nSo now, with the active phase,\nwe are as you say,\n\n42\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.610\nengaging the enemy here which is\nobviously gonna increase our chances for\n\n43\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.160\ndetection or setting off alarms and\nthings like that.\n\n44\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.340\nBut it is our next step as\nwe progress into this test.\n\n45\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n46\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.510\nSo that's what we gotta do is we gotta\nstart gaining information from that\n\n47\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.590\ntarget and so\nyou've got plenty of tools to do that and\n\n48\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.840\nwe've seen lots of tools in the past that\nwe can use to do that active engagement.\n\n49\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.936\nWe can look at some of those tools again\nbefore we start moving into the way\n\n50\n00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:04.702\nwhat NMAPS brings to\nthe table in this category.\n\n51\n00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:08.985\nBecause NMAP does have\nsome stuff outside of what\n\n52\n00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.168\nthe regular tools in Kali or\nwhatever would do.\n\n53\n00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:17.798\nIt has its own stuff that it can\ndo additional levels of tests,\n\n54\n00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.940\nwhich is quite neat.\n\n55\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.855\nSo, what we need to kinda do a compare and\ncontrast here I guess between the two.\n\n56\n00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.870\n>> There's a lot of this similar\nto our passive where we're\n\n57\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.460\ntaking tools that we've already seen or\nmaybe learned to use and\n\n58\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.370\njust using them through\nthe Metasploit interface?\n\n59\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.920\n>> Yes.\n\n60\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.390\nThat's really what it is, is that you're\nusing a lot of this stuff at this point\n\n61\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.080\nthrough the Metasploit interface.\n\n62\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.780\nBut we're gonna start discussing\n\n63\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340\nhow some of this stuff can be\nintegrated directly into the database.\n\n64\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.620\nWe're still not at the point where\nwe're gonna put it into the database,\n\n65\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.030\nbecause we're going to do some set\nup there before we get to that.\n\n66\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.598\nBut get the tools.\n\n67\n00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:01.730\nMake sure that we're\ngetting the same nice,\n\n68\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.430\ngood information that we\nwould expect out of them.\n\n69\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.280\nOnce we get that and we're cool with the\nway they work then we can just go over and\n\n70\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.350\njump over to getting the information and\ndumping it into that database.\n\n71\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.878\nSo, that's what we have coming up,\nbut we gotta,\n\n72\n00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:19.720\n[LAUGH] we've got a few steps we\ngotta take first before we do that.\n\n73\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.126\nBaby steps, baby steps.\n\n74\n00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:22.469\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n75\n00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.780\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nwell let's dive in and see,\n\n76\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.430\nwhere do we want to start with our\nactive intelligence gathering?\n\n77\n00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.680\n>> Well, the places we can start at,\none of the tools we've seen\n\n78\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.160\nin the past that we'll\nlook at again here and\n\n79\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.215\nwe know it's available in\nKali is going through NMAP.\n\n80\n00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:48.710\nNMAP is, it's really no big secret,\nwe know what this tool does.\n\n81\n00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.500\nSo if we go to my system here and\n\n82\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.120\nI get this Metasploit command prompt up,\nit's easy enough just for me to run,\n\n83\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.260\nto go over to this console and\ndo NMAP and do my switches.\n\n84\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.690\nAnd you can really do whatever switches\nyou want, so it's kinda your call.\n\n85\n00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.630\nJust go ahead and\ntell it the scan type I wanna run.\n\n86\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.250\nAnd just put in the IP address,\n\n87\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.800\nwhatever you choose to put in\nas an IP address, of course.\n\n88\n00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.210\nAnd just dump that in and\nit will do a quick scan.\n\n89\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.430\nIn this case, I stuck one in and\nit says well the system's down,\n\n90\n00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.890\nbut packet may be actually\nblocking your probes.\n\n91\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.380\nOkay, well that's something that it's\ntelling you you have gotta adjust for.\n\n92\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.210\nSo I might follow its guidance in here and\n\n93\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.220\ndo a pn which we actually\ndidn't cover that,\n\n94\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.840\nthat the pn option in our CEH or\nother classes.\n\n95\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.340\nBut what a PN does,\nit means just, don't ping.\n\n96\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.370\nAnd so if we do that,\nmaybe it'll give us something.\n\n97\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.500\nIt still said nothing was up,\nokay fine, but\n\n98\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.370\nwe could see that end map is actually\ndoing what it's supposed to.\n\n99\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.920\nI do have another system on here.\n\n100\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.720\nI should be able to just\nreplace that with a 230 and\n\n101\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.980\nwell it's giving me a little\nbit of grief today.\n\n102\n00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.615\nLet's go over here and\ncheck my other system such as it is.\n\n103\n00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:30.610\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n104\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.060\n>> Okay, so this one's 116, 128, so\nthat's why I had the little issue there.\n\n105\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:44.057\nSo I will go back over here and kill this.\n\n106\n00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:48.584\nThey say it was 116, 128.\n\n107\n00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:53.835\nSo I will do that and get rid of this and\nlet's see what we get.\n\n108\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.480\nHopefully we'll get a better result.\n\n109\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.805\nWell, taking a little longer,\nthat's a positive sign.\n\n110\n00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So-\n\n111\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.050\n>> Signs of life on the other end.\n\n112\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.630\nI like it.\n\n113\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.660\n>> Yeah, I'm getting something.\n\n114\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.535\nIt's got a pulse.\n\n115\n00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:07.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what do we have here?\n\n116\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.420\nWell no big secret, I mean we've\nseen this what, how many times?\n\n117\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.190\nWe've seen the output of NMAP just\ntons and tons of times before.\n\n118\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.420\nSo, you would presumably\nlook through this list, and\n\n119\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.249\nsee if it's got anything that is\n\n120\n00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:32.140\nof interest to you or of use to you.\n\n121\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.903\nSo, I'm kind of glancing through this,\nand I can see that looks like,\n\n122\n00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.740\nwell I can see that we have FTP and\nTelnet.\n\n123\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.070\nAnd SSH,\nwell I actually have in Metasploit,\n\n124\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.400\nI have exploits designed for\neach one of those, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.050\nSo that's making me,\nthat's catching my attention.\n\n126\n00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.289\nBut then I look,\nI see some stuff relating to Microsoft.\n\n127\n00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:59.210\nWell, that could be something\nthat I might be of use to me.\n\n128\n00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.219\nAnd I would just go down the list,\nmaking a note of port numbers and\n\n129\n00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.510\nservices that are running on them.\n\n130\n00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.070\nSo, that's giving me some good stuff.\n\n131\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.890\nSo that's a good start.\n\n132\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.840\nSo, we've got that.\n\n133\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.230\nYou can also just add in\na couple other things in here.\n\n134\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.507\nYou can do a -A,\nwhich will do a banner grab,\n\n135\n00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:27.910\nwhich will try to query\ninto a banner grab.\n\n136\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.040\nMaybe get you a little more information,\nand\n\n137\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.580\nthen if you want to save yourself some.\n\n138\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.952\nEveryone's gonna be\nreally pissed at me now.\n\n139\n00:08:35.952 --> 00:08:37.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz I'm gonna show this next switch,\n\n140\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.010\nthey're gonna be going, should've\nshown that to us in another episode.\n\n141\n00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.990\nBut, I didn't wanna.\n\n142\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.490\n>> Good things come to those who wait,\nright?\n\n143\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.080\n>> If you don't want to note all\nthat stuff, you could very easily\n\n144\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.040\ndo -OX and then put the name of the file.\n\n145\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.050\nI could say, output,\nyou know right there and\n\n146\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.210\nit will just shoot\nthe stuff out to a file.\n\n147\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.310\nIf I want to do that.\n\n148\n00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.965\nSo I just hit Enter, and\nit's gonna do the scan for me.\n\n149\n00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.260\nMm-hm.\n\n150\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.400\n>> And I would expect it to take\na little bit of time to do that.\n\n151\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.490\nHow much time it takes, well it kinda\ndepends on just a whole number of factors,\n\n152\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.810\nhow many hosts you're scanning, how many\nports are actually open on that system.\n\n153\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.290\nAnd you could just keep adding onto it.\n\n154\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.930\nBut what you wanna have at the end of it\nis have that good information that you\n\n155\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.870\ncould start just kind of poking through\nand say, yeah, that's stuff I can use.\n\n156\n00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:42.525\nI can already see by looking at it,\nit's writing the same stuff to a file.\n\n157\n00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:45.305\nBut if I'm looking at this right now,\n\n158\n00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:47.845\nI'm even looking at some of\nthe listed ports that are up there.\n\n159\n00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:51.575\nI've showed you some of the stuff\nat the top of the list that\n\n160\n00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:56.915\nwe have actual exploits for.\n\n161\n00:09:56.915 --> 00:10:01.440\nBut if I look at this list I can honestly\nsee down towards the bottom, port 5900.\n\n162\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.580\n5900, well, VNC,\nI know we have an exploit for that.\n\n163\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:14.080\nI look at the MySQL and the PostgreSQL,\ngot exploits for both of those too.\n\n164\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.550\nSo, this thing is music to my ears.\n\n165\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.320\nIf this was a live system\nthat had all that,\n\n166\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.620\nThat's exactly the type of\nstuff that's like yeah,\n\n167\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.600\nI'll do my hand-wringing, getting ready\nfor my next step to go in there and\n\n168\n00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.550\nstart busting down some doors and\nstuff like that.\n\n169\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.630\nSo, that's really, really,\nreally good stuff.\n\n170\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.150\nSo, you see it's still\ntaking some time to do this.\n\n171\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.570\nWhat I can do is, I should have a,\nwell, I won't use that\n\n172\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.820\none yet, cuz I have another example\nof something else on there.\n\n173\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.620\nBut, yeah, you can see it's still\ngoing ahead, doing its job,\n\n174\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.430\nand everything in there.\n\n175\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.816\nIt's writing it out to a file.\n\n176\n00:10:57.816 --> 00:11:03.269\nSo, fine, so.\n\n177\n00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:05.750\n>> That's basically,\nshould give you the same results.\n\n178\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.910\nShould just store it in a file instead\nof scrolling across the screen so\n\n179\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.210\nyou have it for later reference.\n\n180\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.470\nAnd at least you can output it in like\nan XML and you can do a script file or\n\n181\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.600\njust a straight up text\nfile if I remember right.\n\n182\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.750\n>> Yes, you could definitely do that.\n\n183\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:26.720\nAnd FYI on this,\nif you wanted to dump this to a database,\n\n184\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.810\nthat capability, like we said, is there.\n\n185\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.710\nI'm gonna start up while that\none's doing its business.\n\n186\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:39.095\nIf I wanted to dump that\nto a database it's not\n\n187\n00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:44.708\na difficult task to run\nNMap with that in mind.\n\n188\n00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:48.760\nSo, my Metasplit console's\ngonna start up over here, so\n\n189\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.750\nI'm gonna run another session while\nthat one's doing its business.\n\n190\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.980\nAnd we'll take a look at the command\nthat actually does that, allows you\n\n191\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.396\nto dump into that database, such as it is,\nif we were gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n192\n00:12:03.396 --> 00:12:09.450\nSo, if I type in my help command,\n\n193\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.500\nyou can see right there on my screen\nthe database back end commands.\n\n194\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.260\nIf you go right middle on that list that's\nthe ones I was showing you earlier on\n\n195\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:26.020\nIf you do db NMap, it's not putting\nthat to a text file anymore.\n\n196\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.710\nIf you tell it,\nit's not putting it to a text file,\n\n197\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.600\nit's shooting that right into\nwhatever the database is.\n\n198\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.840\n>> Nice.\n>> So it takes the output and boom.\n\n199\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.050\nSo, the stuff that we're doing,\nyou know, over here and\n\n200\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.600\nyou can see that it went ahead and\nfinished my scan over here, and\n\n201\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.160\nthat already I can tell is a lot\nmore than I had previously.\n\n202\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.860\nAnd this is good stuff.\n\n203\n00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:54.220\nThis is going above and\nbeyond what I get with a normal scan.\n\n204\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.390\nYou can see it did take some time,\nbut there's good stuff here.\n\n205\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.750\nI could have dumped this right into\na database, and searched it, and\n\n206\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.560\ndone done all that good stuff with it.\n\n207\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.290\n>> That's powerful stuff\ncuz you might have,\n\n208\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.350\nagain with NMap you could input\na list of IP address right?\n\n209\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.120\nSo you might have multiple hosts that\nyou're trying to scan and you don't want\n\n210\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.270\nto sit there and watch it go by anything\nlike that or put it into text file.\n\n211\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.780\nYou still gotta do your sorting, or\n\n212\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.330\nsomehow compile that data\ninto something meaningful.\n\n213\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.110\nShoot, if I can dump it out, if I have 100\nIP addresses and have it scan them all and\n\n214\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.460\ndump it right into a database,\nnow I can use any of my database tools\n\n215\n00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.480\nto query that and look for\ncertain things, that's powerful there.\n\n216\n00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.450\n>> Yeah, it offers you amazing\namount of utility there.\n\n217\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.150\nAnd if you really, really start thinking\nabout this, you got a range of IPs,\n\n218\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.170\nwe've already been down this road where\nwe know if you have a range of IPs,\n\n219\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.490\nprobably not every one of those IPs\nhas something living behind it.\n\n220\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.000\nWhat's to say that you can't use\na Kali tool or use one of the tool,\n\n221\n00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.996\nor use a variation of one\nof the tools in NMap.\n\n222\n00:13:55.996 --> 00:14:00.280\nWe know we can do a quick\nping sweep in NMap.\n\n223\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.350\nWhat's to keep us from doing a ping\nsweep across that range of IPs,\n\n224\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.180\nfind the ones that are alive,\nwrite that out to a file and\n\n225\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.800\nthen re-feed that file into another Nmap\nscan that does a more detailed scan of it,\n\n226\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.980\njust pulling additional\ninformation out of it?\n\n227\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.310\nSo now we're not hitting all\nof those things and waiting.\n\n228\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.460\nWe found the ones that are live and\n\n229\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.488\nnow we're gonna re-focus our efforts on\nthose and shoot that into a database.\n\n230\n00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:27.335\n>> Nice.\n\n231\n00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:31.380\n>> So, daisy chaining stuff together,\nsomething we've talked about in CEH.\n\n232\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.830\nWe're mentioning it now is that these\ncommands are not something you just,\n\n233\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:35.990\na one off thing.\n\n234\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.040\nIf you don't get the concept of\ndaisy chaining stuff down, and\n\n235\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.415\nputting these stuff together for\nfor maximum effect,\n\n236\n00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:47.285\nyou're probably gonna get less than\nstellar results with Metasploit,\n\n237\n00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:51.155\nor it's just gonna become\nsomething that is rather tedious.\n\n238\n00:14:51.155 --> 00:14:52.515\nSo, you'll learn.\n\n239\n00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:53.800\nYou will learn.\n\n240\n00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.030\nAt the beginning, I don't expect you\nto be just stringing stuff together.\n\n241\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.320\nYou're going to be touchy feely and\nexploring stuff.\n\n242\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.200\nBut after you've done that,\nyou'll be like, oh, well wait a minute.\n\n243\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.770\nI can do this and this and this and\nmake my life just so much easier.\n\n244\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.270\nAnd that's what we're here for.\n\n245\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.420\nWe want to make it easier for doing this.\n\n246\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:11.975\nAbsolutely.\n\n247\n00:15:11.975 --> 00:15:13.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n248\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.880\nso, just to kind of\nexplore things a bit here.\n\n249\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo, I've run NMap right\nhere at the command line,\n\n250\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.260\nso I can see NMap and bla, bla.\n\n251\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.080\nThat shoots it out to an output file.\n\n252\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.467\nSo, we'll say, okay, fine,\nit out an XML file, we're good.\n\n253\n00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:35.930\nI would've, if I ran these same switches,\n\n254\n00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.323\nI would've got the same thing with\nDB NMap, you know, so DB NMap, remember,\n\n255\n00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:43.875\nstill runs Nmap, but\nthe end result is it goes into a database.\n\n256\n00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:49.749\nSo, if I wanted to do that, I just could\nhave ran that command instead of this,\n\n257\n00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:54.378\nbut got the same results with\na different destination for it.\n\n258\n00:15:54.378 --> 00:15:59.603\nSo, what you would do, and\nthis is where Nmap Starts to come in for\n\n259\n00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:04.830\nyou is, of course, the system\nI'm scanning in case you weren't\n\n260\n00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:10.077\nkind of really closely focused on it,\nthat was Metasploitable.\n\n261\n00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.751\nSo that Metasploitable\nsystem's designed for\n\n262\n00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:17.358\nstuff like this to give us results that\ngives us something interesting to look at,\n\n263\n00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:21.162\nits not a system that's been patched up,\nand it's all pretty, and\n\n264\n00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:23.879\nyou're gonna get nothing or very little\n>> [CROSSTALK] That\n\n265\n00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:24.547\nwouldn't be fun at all.\n\n266\n00:16:24.547 --> 00:16:29.674\n>> Yeah, you want to actually see\nthe on the ground stuff that's working,\n\n267\n00:16:29.674 --> 00:16:31.026\nso we look at this.\n\n268\n00:16:31.026 --> 00:16:35.519\nAnd you're getting some stuff that\nshould be drawing your attention.\n\n269\n00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:38.350\nOnce you get through the exploits and\n\n270\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.642\nstart really delving through this,\nyou'll see things and go, oh,\n\n271\n00:16:43.642 --> 00:16:48.685\nI've got like I can do something\nwith that, and that, and that.\n\n272\n00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:53.060\nSo those are things that I\nwill try when I get there.\n\n273\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.605\nSo yeah, I've got FTP in there.\n\n274\n00:16:55.605 --> 00:16:57.270\nSSH, got that in there.\n\n275\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.274\nI mean, you're even seeing because I\ndid that -a, and I did that compare and\n\n276\n00:17:01.274 --> 00:17:01.900\ncontrast.\n\n277\n00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.080\nRemember, without the -a,\nit just said port and open or close,\n\n278\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.340\nit said the service and that was it.\n\n279\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.930\nIt was very, very abruptly ended.\n\n280\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.230\nHere, you can see it's got,\nit's telling me for open SSH,\n\n281\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.790\nit's got the db and\nstuff behind it telling me protocols.\n\n282\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.658\nI got the key stuff for SSH.\n\n283\n00:17:23.658 --> 00:17:31.710\nYou can, you're seeing a certification or\ncert information.\n\n284\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.210\nThere's some DNS stuff with bind.\n\n285\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.170\nI mean, this is really good stuff.\n\n286\n00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.830\nA lot of this, probably because they\ndesigned Metasploitable that way,\n\n287\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:48.400\nis designed specifically for\nwe have a specific design for that.\n\n288\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.119\nSo they specifically design it for\nus to scan and find it anyway, but\n\n289\n00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:54.614\nyou should be paying\nattention to the stuff.\n\n290\n00:17:54.614 --> 00:17:57.574\nThere's Our PC, there's stuff for that.\n\n291\n00:17:57.574 --> 00:18:00.250\nYou see the NetBIOS stuff.\n\n292\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.640\nSo this has the Samba.\n\n293\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.440\nClient right tells us about NeBIOS stuff.\n\n294\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.070\nThat's actually another really good one.\n\n295\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.460\nIf you have a range of IPs and\nyou're not sure what's behind it,\n\n296\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.990\nyou can run a scan of one of\nthe scans that's actually\n\n297\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:23.193\nin Metasploit itself, you can scan a whole\nrange of IPs and look specifically for\n\n298\n00:18:23.193 --> 00:18:27.160\nthe Samba stuff while in the NetBIOS,\nand it'll pick that up and\n\n299\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.230\nidentify and tell you these are all\nthe Windows systems on there.\n\n300\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.230\nI know every last one of\nthose is a Windows system.\n\n301\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:37.350\nAnd it will do it way quicker than\nNmap will, in the end it's quicker and\n\n302\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.440\nit's quieter, too,\nwhich it's kind of scary that it's\n\n303\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:40.986\ngot to that point-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.269\n>> That it can go zip right across there.\n\n305\n00:18:43.269 --> 00:18:45.190\nAnd just tell you, hey,\nthere's all the Windows systems.\n\n306\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.320\nAnd it can tell you with a certain\ndegree of accuracy what version\n\n307\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.480\nof Windows that is just off of that.\n\n308\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.860\nSo yeah,\nthat should give you a lot of concern.\n\n309\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.440\nAnd that's probably where you were saying\nearlier, Mike, about network admins.\n\n310\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.537\nThat'd be something that they'd-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.549\n>> Probably wanna wanna pay attention to,\n\n312\n00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:04.052\nor at least that's something we could\ndo and go, I guess what I found.\n\n313\n00:19:04.052 --> 00:19:09.226\nBut anyway, we just go through this list,\n\n314\n00:19:09.226 --> 00:19:16.579\nand see if there's anything\nelse that's catching our eye.\n\n315\n00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.487\nAnd like I said,\nwe have the VNC in there, and\n\n316\n00:19:18.487 --> 00:19:20.455\nwe've got some other\nstuff sitting in there.\n\n317\n00:19:20.455 --> 00:19:23.822\nYou got uptime information and\n\n318\n00:19:23.822 --> 00:19:28.234\nstuff like that, so this is good stuff.\n\n319\n00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:31.702\nThis is really, really good stuff for us.\n\n320\n00:19:31.702 --> 00:19:35.420\n>> Thats' a really adds a lot of info,\nbecause it's doing that banner grabbing or\n\n321\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.550\nwhatever it can do to pull back additional\ninformation about each one of those\n\n322\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.640\nports that's open.\n\n323\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.160\n>> Yeah.\n\n324\n00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.310\nYeah.\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n325\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.856\n>> Exactly, so don't underestimate this.\n\n326\n00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:50.765\nAnd this is also why I would tell you,\ngo through your Nmap again,\n\n327\n00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:54.440\nand practice with some\nof those other switches.\n\n328\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.300\nWe only covered a limited\nnumber of switches.\n\n329\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.830\nWhen we were doing the CEH for\nexample, the CEH,\n\n330\n00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.065\nwe were trying to that keep\nthat certification oriented.\n\n331\n00:20:05.065 --> 00:20:08.300\nTo a certain point,\nwe added some extra stuff in there.\n\n332\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.790\nBut Nmap, we could have gone crazy with,\nthere's so many.\n\n333\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:17.214\nNow, we're breaking out of, we don't care\nabout the certification part of it at this\n\n334\n00:20:17.214 --> 00:20:21.577\npoint, this is we're building the skills\nwith Metasploit, so you're gonna have to\n\n335\n00:20:21.577 --> 00:20:25.273\nexplore some of these other switches and\nsee what they can do for you, and\n\n336\n00:20:25.273 --> 00:20:29.126\nI don't think I'm gonna disagree that\nit's doing a lot for me right here.\n\n337\n00:20:29.126 --> 00:20:34.880\nWhich is [LAUGH] in good for\nlater later use.\n\n338\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.830\n>> I know Nmap's got some great\ndocumentation out there on the web.\n\n339\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.520\nIf you just type Nmap without any\nparameters at your prompt, it'll spit up\n\n340\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.460\nall of its instructions with all\nthe different switches that you can use.\n\n341\n00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.910\nAnd there's quite a few.\n\n342\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.570\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n343\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.550\nYou gotta love it.\n\n344\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.414\nSo that's a new spin on Nmap.\n\n345\n00:20:55.414 --> 00:21:00.183\nThat's the big one I kinda really\nwanted to show as far the active\n\n346\n00:21:00.183 --> 00:21:04.510\nreconnaissance stuff, and\nthis kind of stages the game,\n\n347\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:10.100\nbecause I already did ping for you\nearlier on, you saw that ping will work.\n\n348\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.860\nAny of the other stuff for\nmapping on a network will work.\n\n349\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.440\nThe tools from Kali,\nwe did the load balance discovery, so\n\n350\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.660\nyou know the other tools we ran in\nour Kali class, those will work for\n\n351\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.781\ndoing active recon, so\nyou got a huge suite of tools,\n\n352\n00:21:26.781 --> 00:21:31.391\npretty deep bench of tools you\ncan use to gather this stuff.\n\n353\n00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.817\nIt's just a matter of which\nones are you gonna use.\n\n354\n00:21:33.817 --> 00:21:40.127\nBut we're also turning our attention\nthis point to what is that revealing.\n\n355\n00:21:40.127 --> 00:21:44.548\nAnd so, we look at something like this and\nwe can see very quickly that we're seeing\n\n356\n00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:49.495\nNetBIOS information, and operating system\ninformation, a lot of service information.\n\n357\n00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:50.915\nStuff like that.\n\n358\n00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:54.901\nWe're making it, we're really making\nmental notes of that or making sure that\n\n359\n00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:58.648\ngets into the database, so we can start\nsearching on that and lining them up\n\n360\n00:21:58.648 --> 00:22:02.534\nwith potential exploits and payloads that\nwe can drop on to a system to get it.\n\n361\n00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:07.892\nI mean, if you found for example,\na Windows XP system with Service Pack 2,\n\n362\n00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:13.587\nyou found that, that's just by doing that\none NetBIOS deal I was talking about,\n\n363\n00:22:13.587 --> 00:22:17.355\nyou find that,\nthat's basically a huge open door for\n\n364\n00:22:17.355 --> 00:22:21.910\nyou to punch a hole in it and\nopen up a reverse shell out of it.\n\n365\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.430\n>> There's one or\n\n366\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.210\ntwo exploits I think that work against\nWindows XP that serves actually, right?\n\n367\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.029\n>> Yeah.\n>> At least one.\n\n368\n00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.561\n>> Yeah, yep.\n\n369\n00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:29.472\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or a hundred out of [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:22:29.472 --> 00:22:30.436\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n371\n00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:31.468\nIt varies a bit.\n\n372\n00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:32.177\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:33.652\n[LAUGH]\n>> But I mean,\n\n374\n00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.280\nthat tells you right away that\nwe sweep our range of IPs and\n\n375\n00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.010\nwe use the right switches and\nwe discover that that's what it is.\n\n376\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.750\nYou've just drawn a big\ntarget on its back,\n\n377\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.490\nbecause you know with that\ncombination of service pack and\n\n378\n00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.530\nthat service being open that you more than\nlikely are gonna be able to punch in and\n\n379\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.595\ndrop a payload off that will run and\nopen up a shell for you.\n\n380\n00:22:55.595 --> 00:22:59.306\n>> [CROSSTALK] It's invaluable information\nI mean I don't know how you would continue\n\n381\n00:22:59.306 --> 00:23:02.486\non with your attack if you didn't\nknow what that operating system was,\n\n382\n00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:05.189\nbecause you basically are now\ndoing a shot in the dark with all\n\n383\n00:23:05.189 --> 00:23:06.692\nthe different exploits we have.\n\n384\n00:23:06.692 --> 00:23:10.548\nBut they're very specific to a particular\nedition of an operating system or\n\n385\n00:23:10.548 --> 00:23:14.175\na version of an application, so\nyou've gotta have this information.\n\n386\n00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:17.838\nAnd Nmap and\nMetasploit makes it real easy to get.\n\n387\n00:23:17.838 --> 00:23:21.707\n>> Yeah, there's just a tremendous\namount of stuff you can do here, so\n\n388\n00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:26.312\nyou get the information, get whatever\ninformation you can, pay close attention\n\n389\n00:23:26.312 --> 00:23:30.782\nto it, and then once you've gotten used\nto the exploits that are out there and,\n\n390\n00:23:30.782 --> 00:23:31.480\nwho knows?\n\n391\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.196\nMaybe you're gonna be one of\nthe people that develops your own.\n\n392\n00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:36.576\nThe sky's almost the limit on this.\n\n393\n00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:39.147\nI mean, it really, really is.\n\n394\n00:23:39.147 --> 00:23:44.687\nSo that's kind of what I wanted to get out\nof the way here is that we can run in and\n\n395\n00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:49.631\nout through here and get quite a bit\nof stuff, we can turn attention to\n\n396\n00:23:49.631 --> 00:23:54.490\nwhat we're getting, and then you\neven saw the db in map Once again,\n\n397\n00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.690\nI was talking about how you\ncould run that instead of N Map.\n\n398\n00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.150\nI would just take the N Map\ncommand I did here, and\n\n399\n00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.440\nreplace that with DBN Map, with all\nthe same switches, everything, after it.\n\n400\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.160\nAnd it would work the exact same way.\n\n401\n00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.720\nExcept the results\nare going to the database.\n\n402\n00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.450\nSo that's just showing you,\nyou know, stuff we could do.\n\n403\n00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.870\n>> And probably a good time to slip in our\nlittle disclaimer that we always do in all\n\n404\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.660\nof our security shows, Sean.\n\n405\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.960\nRemember, make sure you've got permission.\n\n406\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.150\nOnce you start getting into that\nactive intelligence gathering phase,\n\n407\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.130\nyou're touching the system or\nthe network of your target,\n\n408\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.560\nwhether you're doing a pen test,\nwhether you're doing what have you.\n\n409\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.150\nNow you've started across those lines\nwhere, of legality, depending on the area\n\n410\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.730\nyou are, depending on the, you know,\nif you're doing this on a work network,\n\n411\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.960\nthat could cause huge problems,\nprobably against your EULA.\n\n412\n00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.680\nYour ISP might have an issue with you\nrunning all kinds of scans all the time,\n\n413\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.610\nso just keep in mind.\n\n414\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.770\nMake sure you've got permission to scan\nwhoever it is you're trying to scan.\n\n415\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.550\nSo, yeah, a lot of good information there.\n\n416\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.460\nWe looked at passive intelligence\ngathering in the previous episode,\n\n417\n00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.000\nwhere we didn't have any contact,\nreally, with the intended target.\n\n418\n00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.490\nWe were going to open source places or\ndoing our open source intelligence\n\n419\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.170\ngathering off of social media and\nregistrars and.\n\n420\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.760\nAnd things like that.\n\n421\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.950\nAnd then in this episode we really focused\non the active scanning it was mostly\n\n422\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.310\nabout, or active intelligence gathering\nand mostly about scanning, right.\n\n423\n00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.720\nEither doing network scans,\nlooking for live hosts, or\n\n424\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.580\nonce I've found my live host,\nmaybe doing port scans.\n\n425\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.020\nAnd that's when we really start\nto see the information flow.\n\n426\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.310\nBecause now all of a sudden we're doing\nthat banner grabbing, and tools like Nmap,\n\n427\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.110\nand combining that,\nNmap through Metasploit,\n\n428\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.200\nbeing able to store that information\ndirectly into a database, cuz there was\n\n429\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.420\na lot of information that came back, a lot\nof banners on each one of those ports.\n\n430\n00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.980\nI can put it right in a database, and\n\n431\n00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.870\nnow I can use my normal database\nqueries to summarize information,\n\n432\n00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.540\nor retrieve information any way I want,\nso a lot of great stuff.\n\n433\n00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.550\nAnything else we want to throw in Shaun\non our active intelligence gathering?\n\n434\n00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.380\n>> I don't know, what can you say, except\nthat was pretty cool, wasn't it [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.800\nIt really is.\n\n436\n00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.610\nI hope youre guys gears\nare churning on this.\n\n437\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.060\nI really, really truly do.\n\n438\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.950\nBecause we've given you a lot\nof these tools already, so.\n\n439\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.610\nI just showed Endmap,\nbut you've got a whole\n\n440\n00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:22.010\ntoolbox full of things you could do, so\nhopefully you got your gears turning.\n\n441\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.060\nLike, I wonder if, try it.\n\n442\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.590\nThat's all I can say is try it.\n\n443\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.910\nDon't go and just ask,\nit's like well what about this?\n\n444\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.870\nTry it.\n\n445\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.760\nYou probably can.\n\n446\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.030\nSo-\n>> Best way to learn, right?\n\n447\n00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.700\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n448\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.930\n>> All right, well ladies and gentleman,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode\n\n449\n00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.750\nbut for now,\nsigning off right to you from ITProTV.\n\n450\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.260\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n451\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.330\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n452\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.643\n>> And we'll

00:00:16.145\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:17.245\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:17.895\nI'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:18.515\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:19.865\nI'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:22.035\nWe have another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n9\n00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.755\ncontinuing on with our Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:25.285\nAnd in this one,\n\n11\n00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:29.792\nwe're gonna take a another look at\nactive intelligence gatherings.\n\n12\n00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.342\nWe've already seen some, if you missed it,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n13\n00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:35.942\ncheck out our previous episode where we\nstarted our active intelligence gathering.\n\n14\n00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:40.142\nWe're just gonna continue on Sean, so\nwhat do you got on the table for us next?\n\n15\n00:00:40.142 --> 00:00:41.942\nWell, next thing I'm gonna look at is,\n\n16\n00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:45.512\ninteresting enough we're gonna take\nanother look at port scanning.\n\n17\n00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:50.212\nBut the port scanning we're looking at is\nusing stuff that's inside of Metasploit,\n\n18\n00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:52.710\nit's not the endmap stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.700\nSo what you're gonna see is not\nonly are we doing port scanning,\n\n20\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.260\nbut this is also, we are using\nthe stuff in Metasploit itself.\n\n21\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.810\nSo we're now starting to kind of move over\nand and see what tools we have there.\n\n22\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.000\nThis is like a standalone tool\nthat Metasploit is just accessing.\n\n23\n00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.210\nThis is something that's\npart of Metasploit?\n\n24\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.640\nYes, this is actually a module right\ninside of Metasploit that's doing this.\n\n25\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.405\nSo you're actually seeing really for\nall intents and purposes the first real\n\n26\n00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:25.850\nfull-on command inside of Metasploit,\nthat we're gonna use in here, and\n\n27\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.000\nwith that is not just\nlooking at a port scanner,\n\n28\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.290\nit's also kinda seeing how the format and\nkinda stuff works in there too,\n\n29\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.410\nand I'm gonna show you some\nof the details with it.\n\n30\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.930\nSo we're gonna look at active\nintelligence gathering,\n\n31\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.370\nwe're gonna kinda see how the command\nworks, and dissect things along the way.\n\n32\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.840\nSo you can get used to some stuff because\nthis stuff will be a recurring topic.\n\n33\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.470\nThe whole format and\nthe way the commands work.\n\n34\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.870\nSo really cool stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.610\nI think you'll dig this,\nwhat we're gonna be doing.\n\n36\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.670\nI'm siked.\n\n37\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.950\n>> Alright.\n\n38\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.570\n>> So we can start by talking\nabout what we're gonna do.\n\n39\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.870\nWe're gonna do a port scan, and\n\n40\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.410\nthe port scan we're gonna do is\ngonna do a simple send scan.\n\n41\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.990\nIf you remember that one,\n\n42\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.240\nyou're just firing send requests out\nat a system to illicit a response.\n\n43\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.650\nSo nothing fancy,\nwe'll keep it simple for right now.\n\n44\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.370\nWell, to start that there's\na few things we can do.\n\n45\n00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.700\nSo, let me start with\nsomething here first is,\n\n46\n00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.230\nI'm telling you well, we're gonna do a\nPort scan and we're gonna use a SIN scan.\n\n47\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.850\nWell, how do I even know that?\n\n48\n00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.310\nWell, one of the things I talked about\n\n49\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.500\nearlier on when we looked at\nin our first couple segments.\n\n50\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.910\nThey said hey, here's all the exploits and\n\n51\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.740\npayloads that MetaSploit has available and\nthat stuff just shot by and\n\n52\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.870\nyou're like woah, that's a lot of stuff,\nwhat just happened there?\n\n53\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.510\nSo, I told you,\nthere's there's ways to look through that.\n\n54\n00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.260\nWell, and make it simpler to\nlocate what you're looking for.\n\n55\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.010\nWell, with that in mind, we're gonna\nstart learning some of that right now.\n\n56\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.840\nSo, what I'm gonna do on my screen is, I'm\ngonna say that I'm gonna do a port scan.\n\n57\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.740\nBut I don't know what type of port scan.\n\n58\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.240\nSo this would be like you guys coming\nin if you haven't used this before and\n\n59\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.330\nyou don't know what type of\nport scan you're gonna use, but\n\n60\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.820\nyou know you're gonna do a port scan.\n\n61\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.180\nWell the way we're gonna do\nthis is you can do a search.\n\n62\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.100\nSo that's just a standard\nkey word in Metasploit.\n\n63\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.960\nYou can do search and\nthen you can do port scan.\n\n64\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.370\nNothing fancy there.\n\n65\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.960\nAnd then when you're done, just hit Enter,\nand it take a minute, and boom.\n\n66\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.660\nWhat do we have showing up there?\n\n67\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.760\nWell, you got a list of Port scans.\n\n68\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.350\n>> Nice.\n\n69\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.080\n>> Interesting, huh?\n\n70\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.800\nThat's a nice short list there compared\nto what we got when we just ran\n\n71\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.735\nIt'll show all my exploits.\n\n72\n00:03:42.735 --> 00:03:43.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n73\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.950\nA whole bunch of stuff\njust went shooting by.\n\n74\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.960\nSo now we've just gone through and\nit's a nice, compact list.\n\n75\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.990\nIt's just the stuff that our\nport scanners So, you could try\n\n76\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.520\nthe search command on other stuff,\nif you want, I'll leave that to you to do.\n\n77\n00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.840\nIf you look at the stuff here, you can see\nthat they in some way, shape, or form,\n\n78\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.710\nhave the term for scan.\n\n79\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.510\n>> In the name so\nit brought those things up.\n\n80\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.510\nAnd you can see that we\ndo have a reasonable\n\n81\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.510\nnumber of port scans available to us.\n\n82\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.230\nSo the one we're really\ninterested in is the one there,\n\n83\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.780\nit's kinda sorta right\njust below the middle.\n\n84\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.850\nIt says auxiliary scanner, port scan,\nSYN, that tells you underneath,\n\n85\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.310\nthat's a SIM port scanner.\n\n86\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.760\nOkay, so cool, we've got that.\n\n87\n00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.450\nSo, the way we use that\nis we use the command.\n\n88\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.010\nYou gotta be kinda careful with this in\nhere, is that when you execute commands\n\n89\n00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.740\nin Metasploit,\nespecially something like this,\n\n90\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.900\nwhat we're gonna do is to use the SIM port\nscanner, we are going to use a key word.\n\n91\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.000\nCalled use.\n\n92\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.050\nThat's simple, right?\n\n93\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.990\n>> I like that.\n\n94\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.360\nSo, and but the way you gotta use it is as\nwe see, for right now we're gonna use and\n\n95\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.700\nthen space and then take a look at\nthe synport scanner we have above it.\n\n96\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.970\nSee that actual\nauxiliary/scanner/port scan/sin.\n\n97\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.530\nThat's what we're gonna use.\n\n98\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.910\nWe're gonna go ahead and use that.\n\n99\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.420\nSo ultimately we should end up.\n\n100\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.600\nAnd because I didn't wanna take\na lot of time typing it out,\n\n101\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.130\nyou can do the auxiliary,\nor you can just type.\n\n102\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.979\nIn some cases you can do use.\n\n103\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.130\nScanner, port scanner, SYN if you don't\nwant to do the other stuff in there.\n\n104\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.120\nI went through and used scanner.portscan.\n\n105\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.604\nYou might be able to use\naxillary/scanner/portscanner/SYN.\n\n106\n00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.730\nKeep in mind, if you get a screw up in\nthere, or it says I can't find this and\n\n107\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.590\ncan't load it, make sure you\ndidn't do u space into a slash and\n\n108\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.250\nthen put the rest of it.\n\n109\n00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.370\nIf you put a slash preceding that\nright at the beginning eventhough\n\n110\n00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.330\nit's one contiguous thing, it will read it\nwrong, and it will puke an error out, and\n\n111\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.400\nyou won't get anywhere.\n\n112\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.810\nSo we wanna avoid that.\n\n113\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.015\nWe don't wanna have that happen.\n\n114\n00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:03.870\n>> [LAUGH] So once you've got that\ntyped out, as simple as hitting Enter.\n\n115\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.280\nAnd what it's gonna do\nis it loads that in.\n\n116\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.319\nAnd you can see that it's got the SYN\nin red there, so it's actually flagged\n\n117\n00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.850\nas saying Yes I'm confirming that I've\nloaded that in and I'm ready to go, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.540\nSo the question is what\ndo you do at this point?\n\n119\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.460\nI meant It's like, oh well that looks\npretty, it changed color, right?\n\n120\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.315\n>> That was nice.\n\n121\n00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:25.240\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so\nthat makes me feel a little bit better,\n\n122\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.890\nthat I'm actually accomplishing something.\n\n123\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.050\nI don't know what but there's progress.\n\n124\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.880\nl looked at somebody shoulder\nsurfing on me I mean, you know.\n\n125\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.724\nIt's like see it's red,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n126\n00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:36.528\n>> [LAUGH] Come on, I'm working.\n\n127\n00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:42.310\nSo what we're gonna do here\nis we are going to type in\n\n128\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.430\nthe command to get more information.\n\n129\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.470\nAppropriately enough it's called Info.\n\n130\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.240\nI hit Enter on that.\n\n131\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.160\nAnd you get kinda the bio, if you will,\non what's being done with this.\n\n132\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.060\nOkay?\nWhat we're gonna do is we're just\n\n133\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.940\ngonna set a few, or\nreally two of the options in here.\n\n134\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.830\nI'm not gonna worry about setting any\nof these other things just because\n\n135\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.680\nit's not gonna add any\nvalue to the demo and\n\n136\n00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.510\nit doesn't really get me any\ncloser to where I need to be.\n\n137\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.710\nSo, the two I wanna say is the one called\nRHost and the one called Threads, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.050\nYou've seen Threads already and we'll talk\nabout there here again in just a moment\n\n139\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.500\nBut if you look at RHOSTS,\nwhat does RHOSTS tell us?\n\n140\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.360\nIt's the target address range\nof who you're gonna hit.\n\n141\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.040\nNow, you can choose to put in\nthe whole IP address and slash,\n\n142\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.240\nyour class or your bits and whatever\nin there, you can do that if you want.\n\n143\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.670\nNot stopping you.\n\n144\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.630\nYou can also just put\nin a single IP address.\n\n145\n00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.587\nYour call, I'll leave it up to you to do.\n\n146\n00:07:52.587 --> 00:07:55.895\nBut the way you do that is\nwhat's important to us.\n\n147\n00:07:55.895 --> 00:08:01.427\nSo the way we do it is, we type in\nat the command line, we do set And\n\n148\n00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:06.660\nthen we do space, and\nwe are going to do rhosts exactly as so.\n\n149\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.120\nAnd then we put a space in there.\n\n150\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.060\nAnd then you go ahead and type whatever IP\naddress you have on your specific system.\n\n151\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.290\nSaying, so on my system,\nsitting over here I've\n\n152\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.905\ngot my 192.168.116.128.\n\n153\n00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:29.600\nWhatever your target system is for\nthis, do the same thing.\n\n154\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.430\nDo the exact same deal.\n\n155\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.360\nTake its IP address and drop it in there.\n\n156\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.347\nI would say just for what we're doing\nhere, just drop in a single IP address.\n\n157\n00:08:40.347 --> 00:08:44.982\nTo keep it simple so you don't have a lot\nof, you're not gonna be spinning your\n\n158\n00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:49.900\nwheels there for a long time waiting for\nit to spit something back at you.\n\n159\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.870\nSo you put that in there.\n\n160\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.161\nSo you got your IP address set our host,\n\n161\n00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:58.782\nmake sure everything's all\nsquared away and by the numbers.\n\n162\n00:08:58.782 --> 00:09:01.360\nYou hit Enter and it acknowledges it.\n\n163\n00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.258\nYou can see it says our host and does\na little arrow, and then says it set it to\n\n164\n00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:11.640\n192.168, in my case the IP address\nthat I told it to set it to.\n\n165\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.030\nOkay, so that's good right there, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.090\nNow the other one we set is\nwe're gonna do Set and THREADS.\n\n167\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.109\nAnd you can set threads on,\nyou can set a whole range for it.\n\n168\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.770\nThe more threads you dedicate to\nsomething, the faster that's gonna go.\n\n169\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.560\nIt's adding more resources to it.\n\n170\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.160\nSo obviously, conversely,\nyou set it lower, it's at 1 right now,\n\n171\n00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.190\nwe can clearly see that onscreen.\n\n172\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.179\nYou leave it as 1, It's not getting much\nresources so it's gonna go slower but\n\n173\n00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.500\nthat could be an advantage, right?\n\n174\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:57.051\nI mean, if you're trying to evade and\ntrying to keep yourself\n\n175\n00:09:57.051 --> 00:10:03.530\noff the radar as much as possible,\nyou may wanna use a lower number.\n\n176\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.910\nSo, I could, for example, I could use 25,\n\n177\n00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:12.120\nyou can use 50 or something like that and\nexperiment with it, if you choose to.\n\n178\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.560\nSo, once we do that, hit Enter, and\nit tells me, hey, threads are set at 25.\n\n179\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.180\nSo, we're making progress on this,\nso what do we got?\n\n180\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.400\nWe got the command being run.\n\n181\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.190\nWe were using the module, rather.\n\n182\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.650\nWe are setting it to our host,\nremote hosts.\n\n183\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.380\nThey're actually also, by the way,\nit's not part of this command.\n\n184\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.171\nAnd you'll be able to figure\nit out when you see it.\n\n185\n00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:36.959\nYou'll see our host here for remote host.\n\n186\n00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.177\nYou'll see another one called Lhost.\n\n187\n00:10:39.177 --> 00:10:40.232\n>> I'm gonna guest local host.\n\n188\n00:10:40.232 --> 00:10:40.975\n>> Yeah, you'd be right.\n\n189\n00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:44.880\n>> [LAUGH] Woo-hoo.\n\n190\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.150\n>> So you can see that it kinda gets,\n\n191\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.920\nit's kind of easy to figure\nsome of this stuff out.\n\n192\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.750\nSo, again, trying to demystify this.\n\n193\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.590\nYou can see a lot of this stuff.\n\n194\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.800\nI mean, just this info command alone has\ntaken a lot of that stuff out of it.\n\n195\n00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.610\nIf you're not sure what something does,\nwell, it's just cleared it up for you.\n\n196\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.600\nI mean, right now if I wanted\nto I could say for ports,\n\n197\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.770\nit says ports I could go over there,\nI could say set ports.\n\n198\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.755\nAnd you can do this if you want.\n\n199\n00:11:19.755 --> 00:11:26.445\nI could say set ports and do 1, 2, 10,\n24, so we're only doing that first range.\n\n200\n00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:27.975\nI don't want it to scan that other stuff.\n\n201\n00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:30.025\nI'm only concerned with that first part.\n\n202\n00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:31.895\nOnce you go through and\ndo that, what did it do?\n\n203\n00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:34.525\nIt says, oh, I'm only gonna\nscan the first 10, 24 ports.\n\n204\n00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:38.365\nAnything else, it's off the menu,\nI'm not doing it, okay.\n\n205\n00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:42.610\nIf you're happy with the things\nare set at this point,\n\n206\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.660\nthe next step is, well,\nit hasn't done anything yet.\n\n207\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.610\nYou just told it this is\nthe parameters I wanna use.\n\n208\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.730\nOkay, so what you do is you just\nsimply you wanna run it, you type run.\n\n209\n00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.470\nI mean,\nit doesn't get any easier than that.\n\n210\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.460\nType run, and it is gonna take\nsome time to do that, okay.\n\n211\n00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.940\nSo while yours is running,\nI'm just gonna go over here to one\n\n212\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.720\nI ran earlier, and\nit's sitting back there.\n\n213\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.160\nAnd you could see, it's gone through.\n\n214\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.980\nIt's run its whole thing.\n\n215\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.920\nIt's returning something back like this.\n\n216\n00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.562\nAnd take a look at what's gone on here.\n\n217\n00:12:16.562 --> 00:12:20.290\nIt's saying, it's got,\nthese are all the ports that are open.\n\n218\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.130\nIt's telling you.\n\n219\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.070\nI mean, you can see it in black and white.\n\n220\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.620\nIt's open.\n\n221\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.070\nYou can see the IP address, and\nyou can see the port that is open.\n\n222\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.384\nSo it's only reporting back those once.\n\n223\n00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:36.010\nSo that's really cool for us.\n\n224\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:41.970\nNow, you might look at this and\nsay, well, what's the benefit?\n\n225\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.599\nWhy use this over Nmap?\n\n226\n00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.800\nI know compared to Nmap\nit's like what the hell?\n\n227\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.180\nHow many steps did I just jump through?\n\n228\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.690\nI could have done that in Nmap like that.\n\n229\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.374\nYeah, I would give you that.\n\n230\n00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:58.580\nYou probably could have done this exact\nsame scan in Nmap probably quicker.\n\n231\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:04.390\nBut you can actually chain this together\nwith other stuff inside of Metasploit and\n\n232\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.900\nreally modify the results and manipulate\nthem in ways that Nmap couldn't.\n\n233\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.440\nSo, you've got that little extra\nthing to kind of factor into it.\n\n234\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.270\nSo don't just write it off,\nand go, oh well.\n\n235\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.130\nIt's just more difficult,\nso I'm only gonna use Nmap.\n\n236\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.810\nI'm not telling you never use Nmap.\n\n237\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.228\nNmap's an amazing tool.\n\n238\n00:13:23.228 --> 00:13:25.980\nIt does everything and then some.\n\n239\n00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:32.300\nBut remember, you can do a lot of other\nstuff here too inside of Metasploit.\n\n240\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:38.720\nThey didn't just put this in there,\nsaid, what, Nmap is too easy to use?\n\n241\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.251\nWell, we can't have that.\n\n242\n00:13:40.251 --> 00:13:42.742\nWe gotta add about ten more steps on it,\ncall it something else and\n\n243\n00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:44.043\nthen we'll do it.\n\n244\n00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:46.002\nObviously they didn't do that.\n\n245\n00:13:46.002 --> 00:13:50.918\nSo what you have here is\nyou should when yours is\n\n246\n00:13:50.918 --> 00:13:55.835\ndone it should spit out\nresults similar to what\n\n247\n00:13:55.835 --> 00:14:00.020\nI've got here on my results on screen.\n\n248\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.720\n>> Yeah.\nMaybe you're on a Windows box and\n\n249\n00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.340\nyou don't have Nmap installed, right?\n\n250\n00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.830\nIt's not like Nmap is a part of that so\nmaybe we're going that route.\n\n251\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.526\nHeck, I don't need to get Nmap.\n\n252\n00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:10.046\nI've got a port scanner built in.\n\n253\n00:14:10.046 --> 00:14:15.388\n>> Yep, so you can see, and I've been\n\n254\n00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:21.410\nusing this product for a while,\n>> So\n\n255\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.680\nI'm talking from a different\nperspective in here, but\n\n256\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.960\nI don't know if anyone disagrees with it,\nbut that to me is pretty straightforward.\n\n257\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.306\nI mean, when you first get into it,\nit's kind of like yeah, but\n\n258\n00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.030\nthat's the way it is with anything.\n\n259\n00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.196\nBut now you're getting into it and\n\n260\n00:14:36.196 --> 00:14:40.237\nonce you do that a couple times\nit'll make a lot of sense, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:43.603\n>> Yeah, relatively intuitive once you get\nthe first few commands done you can almost\n\n262\n00:14:43.603 --> 00:14:45.100\nfigure out the rest of them.\n\n263\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.480\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n264\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.830\nI mean, if you remember\nstuff like search and info.\n\n265\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.670\nI mean, that's gonna eliminate\na lot of your problems right there.\n\n266\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.970\nI mean it's like, what do I do now?\n\n267\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.570\nWell, pop in info and\n\n268\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.310\nsee what the info says and you're like\nyou'll get back on track, no problem.\n\n269\n00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.330\nAnd just to point out something here,\nif you were gonna add this in.\n\n270\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.507\nSo I'm just gonna for kicks, I am going\nto, I've got another console up here and\n\n271\n00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:12.150\nI think to keep myself so\nI don't have to type anything in.\n\n272\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.250\nOkay, so I've got my use scanners,\nthe stuff we just did, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.145\nSo it's gonna go through and load it in.\n\n274\n00:15:19.145 --> 00:15:21.346\nOkay, so we were just here, so\n\n275\n00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:26.767\nwhat I wanna show is let's say you\nmistype something, and went to a module,\n\n276\n00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:32.510\nand you're like, I didn't want to\nbe there, you're getting upset.\n\n277\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.710\nI told you, do not hit Ctrl+C.\n\n278\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.000\nIn most cases, if you hit that,\nor, there are a lot of cases,\n\n279\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.880\nrather, hit that, you're going right\nback out to the Linux command prompt.\n\n280\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.690\nYou are not going back to\nMetasploit's command prompt.\n\n281\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.680\nSo, what happens if you're here?\n\n282\n00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.822\nIf you try to get out of it,\nif you type exit or quit,\n\n283\n00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:54.323\nit's gonna kick you out of Metasploit.\n\n284\n00:15:54.323 --> 00:15:54.823\n>> Oh, now you tell me.\n\n285\n00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:56.329\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:58.012\n>> You're like, hold on.\n\n287\n00:15:58.012 --> 00:16:03.581\nOkay, so the way you do it is If\nyou go way back to the beginning,\n\n288\n00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:10.335\nI was talking about the interface,\nwhat you're gonna do is just type back.\n\n289\n00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:13.230\n>> You did tell us that, that was\na very important command to remember.\n\n290\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.541\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n291\n00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.216\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz you know what, no offense,\n\n292\n00:16:16.216 --> 00:16:18.787\nyou all are gonna screw it up at some\npoint, and you're gonna need that.\n\n293\n00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:20.104\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've done it, and\n\n294\n00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:20.831\nyou're gonna do it too.\n\n295\n00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:23.291\nSo just remember that.\n\n296\n00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:25.823\nIt's gonna save you a lot of pain and\n\n297\n00:16:25.823 --> 00:16:31.407\nsuffering that you would have had if you\nhad to keep going, [SOUND] MSF console.\n\n298\n00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:35.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No more of that.\n\n299\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.440\n>> Coming from a Windows\nbackground it kinda reminds me\n\n300\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.670\nof something like ntdsutil where you're\nreally layers down into the tool.\n\n301\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.810\nMetasploit being that outer shell, or\nthat MSF console being that outer part\n\n302\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.680\nof the tool, then you're getting deeper,\nand deeper with the auxiliary SYN scan.\n\n303\n00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.540\nAnd it's like,\nyou wanna take one step back,\n\n304\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.280\nyou don't wanna leave the tool entirely.\n\n305\n00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.590\nSo maybe if we can think of that, that\nwill help us remember that back command.\n\n306\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.350\n>> Yeah,\nthat's not a bad analogy at all is that,\n\n307\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.810\nyou only wanna go back a certain step or\nonly wanna do certain things.\n\n308\n00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.381\nThis is a great command\nto have in your toolkit,\n\n309\n00:17:13.381 --> 00:17:17.965\ncuz you're gonna use it and\njust get used to it.\n\n310\n00:17:17.965 --> 00:17:19.298\n>> I'm reloading the console right now.\n\n311\n00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:22.234\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:23.709\n>> That's the other way you learn.\n\n313\n00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:29.461\n[CROSSTALK] So, but I can tell you that\nother port scan's still doing its job,\n\n314\n00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:33.177\nif you wanna do another one,\nyou can very easily,\n\n315\n00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:37.159\nI'm sure all of you at this point,\nafter seeing one,\n\n316\n00:17:37.159 --> 00:17:42.670\ncan figure out any of the other ones on\nhere if you just really looked at it.\n\n317\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.420\nIf I do a port scan and do XMAS.\n\n318\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.765\nRemember, use, so use this Module,\nand then give it the name.\n\n319\n00:17:52.765 --> 00:17:55.551\nI didn't put auxiliary in front of it,\nI could of and it would of been just fine.\n\n320\n00:17:55.551 --> 00:18:00.795\nI hit Enter, and it's gonna load that in,\nand boom, there we go.\n\n321\n00:18:00.795 --> 00:18:02.860\nYou want to see how to configure it?\n\n322\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.740\nInfo.\n\n323\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.930\nBoom, info comes up.\n\n324\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.600\nThis is what you can set.\n\n325\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.950\nAnd this isn't any different.\n\n326\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.460\nThe info for this isn't any different\nthan it was for the SYN scan.\n\n327\n00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.960\nI wouldn't really expect it to be.\n\n328\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.310\nSo it isn't any different.\n\n329\n00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:23.108\nIf I wanted to, I could,\nat this point configure the thing,\n\n330\n00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:25.623\nand then go ahead and run.\n\n331\n00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:28.600\nAnd remember, to configure something,\nwhat do you do?\n\n332\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.120\nSet space, whatever the variable is,\nbecause those names we have on here,\n\n333\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.140\nfor like we have for the XMAS scan,\nthose are all basically variable names.\n\n334\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.390\nSo we do set, space, variable name.\n\n335\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.270\nAnd then, put space and\nwhat you're gonna set it to.\n\n336\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.600\nAnd then, Enter and it will tell you,\nit gives you immediate feedback and\n\n337\n00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.930\nthere's not just an Enter and\nit moves the next line.\n\n338\n00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.773\nAnd you're like, did it get that?\n\n339\n00:18:49.773 --> 00:18:51.777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It didn't say anything wrong, but\n\n340\n00:18:51.777 --> 00:18:52.967\nit didn't say anything good either.\n\n341\n00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:53.930\nIt tells you.\n\n342\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.398\nIt tells you, hey, I set it to that or\nyou better go fix that,\n\n343\n00:18:57.398 --> 00:19:00.230\ncuz I don't know what\nyou're talking about.\n\n344\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.090\n>> Can we get these guys\nto talk to PowerShell?\n\n345\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.999\nBecause that's one of my most\nhated features about PowerShell.\n\n346\n00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:05.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you do something right,\n\n347\n00:19:05.608 --> 00:19:08.990\nyou get nothing bad, if you do something\nwrong, you get a bunch of red text.\n\n348\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.580\nCome on, PowerShell,\nlet me know that it worked.\n\n349\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.351\nI mean, I know that you can\nchange the output on that.\n\n350\n00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.810\nBut anyway, great tool.\n\n351\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.495\nAgain, these are just scanners that\nare built right into Metasploit,\n\n352\n00:19:18.495 --> 00:19:20.829\nyou don't have to have any\nthird-party software to do that.\n\n353\n00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:22.790\nI installed this on Windows.\n\n354\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.510\nI don't have to worry if I have Nmap\ninstalled on that particular box.\n\n355\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.580\nIt's got the scanners in.\n\n356\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.813\nAnd not just a port scanner, but\nthey've got the ability to do some pretty\n\n357\n00:19:31.813 --> 00:19:36.407\nspecialized scans, the SYN scans,\nthe XMAS scans, whatever the case may be.\n\n358\n00:19:36.407 --> 00:19:37.503\n>> Like I said,\n\n359\n00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:43.590\nit's got a pretty broad amount of\ntools in different classifications.\n\n360\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.500\nIt's got it.\n\n361\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.050\nSo we just did a SYN scan.\n\n362\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.480\nI brought up this XMAS scan, you can\nsee it's pretty much more the same.\n\n363\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.252\nI mean, you can go through and\nconfigure this, and\n\n364\n00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:59.266\ndo everything the exact same way using\nthe use command, the set command.\n\n365\n00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:04.160\nAnd then, you're done,\nyou wanna make that happen, hit Run.\n\n366\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.580\nHow easy can that be.\n\n367\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:12.160\nSo you're ready to go with those scans,\nso if you're playing\n\n368\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.060\nalong with this you should be able to run\nevery one of those scans at this point.\n\n369\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.107\nNo doubt if you grasped all the stuff\nwe had with SYN and info and\n\n370\n00:20:20.107 --> 00:20:23.737\nall that stuff I just told you, I have\nno doubt that you could do a search for\n\n371\n00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:26.511\nall the port scan stuff,\nrun every one of them in there.\n\n372\n00:20:26.511 --> 00:20:27.371\n>> Fantastic.\n>> Yeah.\n\n373\n00:20:27.371 --> 00:20:33.558\nNow, some of them quite frankly you won't\nhave, I think there's one there for SAP.\n\n374\n00:20:33.558 --> 00:20:36.063\nIf you don't have that,\nyou ain't gonna be testing that, but\n\n375\n00:20:36.063 --> 00:20:38.000\nyou could figure it out\nif you did have it.\n\n376\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.785\nSo fantastic.\n\n377\n00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:44.300\n>> That's lot of great information,\nlove being able to scan and\n\n378\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.370\nretrieve that information out.\n\n379\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.942\nThat's part of that active intelligence\ngathering that we need to do,\n\n380\n00:20:49.942 --> 00:20:52.836\nas we progress on in our penetration test,\nor\n\n381\n00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:56.054\nwhatever it is that we're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n382\n00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:58.810\n>> Well, Sean, again,\na lot of great information.\n\n383\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.640\nAnything else we need to throw\ninto before we wrap this one up?\n\n384\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.586\n>> Yep.\nWell, practice is the other ones,\n\n385\n00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:06.435\nyou guys.\n\n386\n00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:07.460\nThis isn't homework.\n\n387\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:07.960\nBut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.521\n>> Go ahead and\n\n389\n00:21:08.521 --> 00:21:12.918\ntry some of the other ones.\nI mean, you can see now why I had you,\n\n390\n00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:17.090\nway back in that first section of this.\nI said,\n\n391\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:23.330\nyou're gonna wanna get at least\na couple machines to test against.\n\n392\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:29.280\nAnd so, this is exactly why the one\nI chose, I think probably all of you.\n\n393\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.350\nI think you probably\nchose the machine too.\n\n394\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.873\nTry it against the Windows system and\nwatch what happens.\n\n395\n00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:40.510\nYou should get used to these things, and\nso you can see the different results.\n\n396\n00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.790\nThose different results will be\ninstrumental in stuff we're doing later\n\n397\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.430\non, because being able to see those little\n\n398\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.080\nthings that are reported back by doing\nbanner grabs and service identification\n\n399\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.480\nis gonna help you shape to a great degree\nwhat's gonna be next in the sequence.\n\n400\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.080\nSo we really kinda gotta be on top\nof those little details like that.\n\n401\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.170\nBut, you can see that getting the\ninformation probably isn't the hard part.\n\n402\n00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.110\nIt's just kind of knowing\nthe stuff that's in there but-\n\n403\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.830\n>> Deciphering once you're done.\n\n404\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.510\nAnd that's something Sean, it seems like\nwith a little bit of practice, I might be\n\n405\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.262\nstart to do some OS fingerprinting, right\nup here just by some results I am getting.\n\n406\n00:22:20.262 --> 00:22:25.631\n>> Yeah, and that's a very,\nvery good point, because you get familiar\n\n407\n00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:30.830\nenough with these systems,\nyou should be able to just look at that.\n\n408\n00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.050\nI mean, that's kind of the way\nI am when I look at this and\n\n409\n00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:38.680\njust, I can see the little things and go,\nI know what my next step is gonna be.\n\n410\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.610\nYou'll develop that.\n\n411\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.430\nIf you don't already have it,\nyou'll develop it.\n\n412\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.690\nYou're going, yeah, I got your number.\n\n413\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.930\nI recognize what specifically\nthat's telling me.\n\n414\n00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.740\nSo I will go ahead and\ntry this module over here or\n\n415\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.680\nthis exploit, and be right on\npoint with it and make it work.\n\n416\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.960\nAnd so, that's kinda the cool\nthing when you get down to it.\n\n417\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.988\nJust experiment try the things out.\n\n418\n00:23:01.988 --> 00:23:06.550\nAt this point there's\nnothing you can break.\n\n419\n00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.093\nSo you should be trying different\niterations of the commands, and\n\n420\n00:23:10.093 --> 00:23:12.251\nsee what those commands will do for you.\n\n421\n00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:14.420\nTry them against a different\noperating systems.\n\n422\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.716\nIf you are really kinda going all out, and\nyou've got your Metasploitable system,\n\n423\n00:23:18.716 --> 00:23:23.153\nyou've got a Window's system, and you got\nsome other systems out there, try those.\n\n424\n00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:27.785\nAnd remember, like Mike was saying, if you\ndon't have permission don't mess with it,\n\n425\n00:23:27.785 --> 00:23:29.905\nunless it's one of your system.\n\n426\n00:23:29.905 --> 00:23:33.655\nIn which case, you gave yourself\npermission to do it, don't just start\n\n427\n00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:37.356\npoking around with this, because\nthere is a potential with this tool.\n\n428\n00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:40.695\nIf you don't recall,\nI'll just tell you again.\n\n429\n00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:43.158\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is a potential here,\n\n430\n00:23:43.158 --> 00:23:46.101\nsince there's not much of a safety net.\n\n431\n00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:51.055\nYou go ahead and tell it to target\nsomething, it will target something.\n\n432\n00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:52.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fortunately,\n\n433\n00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.210\nthe stuff we're doing up to this point,\nwe haven't got to exploits and payloads.\n\n434\n00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.340\nWe're not to the point\nwhere we really have\n\n435\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.910\na high chance of causing that problem.\n\n436\n00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.432\nBut later on you could.\n\n437\n00:24:03.432 --> 00:24:07.521\nWhich brings us to another point,\nyou may want to before,\n\n438\n00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:12.612\nwhen you go into the next sections of\nthis course, you may wanna consider\n\n439\n00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:17.203\nshutting down your virtual machines,\nand making a copy of them,\n\n440\n00:24:17.203 --> 00:24:22.233\njust in case you do cause damage,\nyou can restore them pretty quickly.\n\n441\n00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:24.335\nI mean, it's how you learn,\nyou will cause damage,\n\n442\n00:24:24.335 --> 00:24:27.840\nyou will find out what not to do and what\nnot to poke at, and look at the wrong way.\n\n443\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.050\nThat's how we all learn.\n\n444\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.700\n>> Snapshots are a beautiful\nthing [LAUGH].\n\n445\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.598\n>> Yeah, take your snapshots and\ndid we mention the one,\n\n446\n00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:36.057\nthe virtual machines\nthat were on Microsoft?\n\n447\n00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:37.520\nI can't recall if we did.\n\n448\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.220\n>> I don't know if we did or not.\n\n449\n00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.110\nWe'll find that link and\nI'll throw it up there.\n\n450\n00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.750\nMaybe we can talk,\nwe'll bring it up tomorrow.\n\n451\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.640\nWe'll talk about setting\na little lab in our next episode.\n\n452\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.549\n>> Okay.\n>> And we'll throw that one out there.\n\n453\n00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:51.886\nWell, ladies and gentlemen looking at the\nclock it's about time to wrap this one up.\n\n454\n00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:53.590\nSo I hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n455\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.931\nFor now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n456\n00:24:56.931 --> 00:24:57.930\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n457\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.005\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n458\n00:24:59.005 --> 00:24:59.900\n[SOUND] [BLANK

00:00:16.440\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.410\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.330\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.990\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.170\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.860\nAnother exciting day here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.700\nWe're gonna continue our\nMetasploit series, and\n\n10\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.580\nin this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about vulnerability scanners.\n\n11\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.930\nWe're gonna talk some concepts about\nwhat they are, how we use them.\n\n12\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.160\nI know you should be familiar at\nleast with the basics of them.\n\n13\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.260\nAnd then we'll take a look later in\nthis episode or another episode.\n\n14\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.840\nWe'll take a look at using some of these\nvulnerability scanners that are built into\n\n15\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.000\ngood old Metasploit.\n\n16\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.070\nSo, Sean, let's start off talking about\nwith what a vulnerability scanner is.\n\n17\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.190\nYeah, let's really position this.\n\n18\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.540\nThis whole segment or\nsession we need to really understand what\n\n19\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.440\na vulnerability scanner is, and\nwhat vulnerability scanning is period.\n\n20\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.820\nIt's probably better for\n\n21\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.090\nus to kinda look at the big issue,\nwhat vulnerability scanning is.\n\n22\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.070\nAnd vulnerability scanning is,\n\n23\n00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.170\nreally if you think about the name,\nit kinda gets you there.\n\n24\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.070\nBut what are we really specifically doing?\n\n25\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.700\nWell when we do vulnerability scanning,\nit means we are in some way, shape, or\n\n26\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.390\nform using processes and\ntechniques, or what have you.\n\n27\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.160\nTo look for weaknesses in a system, and\n\n28\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.820\nthat can be done any number of ways,\nand it will be done any number of ways.\n\n29\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390\nThe stuff we have in Metasploit,\n\n30\n00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.060\nthere's quite a few tools in there that\nare specifically designed to look for\n\n31\n00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.870\nvulnerabilities, as well as\nleverage those vulnerabilities.\n\n32\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.250\nAs We've kind of already seen,\nin some of our prior segments.\n\n33\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.670\nSo you can use Metasploit to do\nsome of those things manually.\n\n34\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270\nYou can use Metasploit to\nautomate some of that.\n\n35\n00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.150\nBut you don't have to use Metasploit.\n\n36\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.440\nYou can use tools.\n\n37\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.260\nHeck, end map would be in some circles\nbe considered with the right switches.\n\n38\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.910\nWould fall under the category of\na vulnerability scanning utility.\n\n39\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.250\nBut it's not gonna be a complete one.\n\n40\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.470\nIf you wanna really kind\nof bump up the stakes.\n\n41\n00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.460\nWe have full blown vulnerability scanners\nin the form of, well the common ones\n\n42\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.980\nwe have are things like Nessus,\npretty much everyone's heard of that one.\n\n43\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.920\nWe have OpenVas built right in the Kali,\n\n44\n00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.177\nwhich is a close cousin of Nessus.\n\n45\n00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:37.620\nThen Metasploit actually has a relative in\n\n46\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.900\nits product portfolio called Nexpose,\nso Rapid7 puts that out.\n\n47\n00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.520\nAnd you'll find those two\nwork really nice together.\n\n48\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.240\nImagine that, right?\n\n49\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.340\nSo you've got that.\n\n50\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300\nBut there's plenty of\nvulnerability scanners out there.\n\n51\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.870\nThere's some that even go way,\nway up and above what we have access to,\n\n52\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.040\nat a free or community level.\n\n53\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.870\nAnd it's not just by a little bit,\nit's by leaps and bounds.\n\n54\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.640\nHeck, we looked at some of the other ones,\n\n55\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.680\neven in our explanation of the forensics,\nwhen we went through that course.\n\n56\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.910\nWe saw things like Netsparker and\nstuff like that.\n\n57\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.190\nSo those are full blown suites, and yeah,\n\n58\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.870\nyou can really go to town with\nthis if you wanna spend the money.\n\n59\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.410\nYou can go to stuff like Canvas and\nCore Impact,\n\n60\n00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.780\nand spend tens of thousands\nof dollars on these things.\n\n61\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.280\nFortunately, in most cases\nyou don't need to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.620\nYou can just use regular off the shelf\ntools, and the different techniques\n\n63\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.590\nwe have already learned from doing things\nlike the CEH and stuff we're seeing here.\n\n64\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.550\nMetasploit.\n\n65\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.093\nWe can use those to kind\nof craft our own solution.\n\n66\n00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:50.502\nIt also brings up the question though,\nwhat's the better way to go.\n\n67\n00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:53.916\nIs it better to use individual tools,\nto look for\n\n68\n00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:56.594\nthose little problems here or there.\n\n69\n00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:59.445\nOr is it better to use\na whole suite to do that,\n\n70\n00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:03.760\nwhich includes all these\ndifferent things it can look for.\n\n71\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.360\nAnd really the answer for\n\n72\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600\nthat is it really kind of depends\non what your expectations are.\n\n73\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.180\nAnd what you're okay with,\nusing one or the other.\n\n74\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.540\nIf you do choose to say,\nI'm gonna go this way or that way.\n\n75\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.710\nIf you go with the individual tools,\n\n76\n00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.100\nit means that you can really kind of fine\ntune what your gonna be looking for.\n\n77\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.930\nSo you can get the right tools and\nstart poking at those individual spots.\n\n78\n00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.300\nDownside of it is,\nif you are gonna grab individual tools and\n\n79\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.938\npoke at these individual spots to look for\nvulnerabilities.\n\n80\n00:04:39.938 --> 00:04:47.670\nHeck, you'll find them or usually find\nsomething, I guess is the way to put it.\n\n81\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.760\nYou usually find something, but\nyou're not going to find everything,\n\n82\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.480\ncuz really you're doing it as\na manual individual thing.\n\n83\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.945\nSo one person, group of people are still\ngonna be kind of limited on how\n\n84\n00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.975\nmany vulnerabilities\nthey can catch that way,\n\n85\n00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:05.789\nas well as how fast that\nprocess is gonna go.\n\n86\n00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.235\nI mean, you can imagine if you're running\ncommands manually or even scripting it,\n\n87\n00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:11.622\nit's gonna take awhile.\n\n88\n00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:14.808\nCuz you're gonna have to\ncustomize a lot of stuff and\n\n89\n00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:16.700\ndo all sorts of that nonsense.\n\n90\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.870\nIf you go to the other side of the house\nand use something like, Nessus or\n\n91\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.190\nNexpose or any one of those\nthose full suites of scanners.\n\n92\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.030\nYeah, those are great.\n\n93\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.240\nThose really speed things up\nsubstantially when you use them.\n\n94\n00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.900\nHowever if you use those suites,\nthose suites are why they are faster,\n\n95\n00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.220\nand they will pick up a lot more in\na shorter amount of time than you could.\n\n96\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.370\nIt's also only gonna look for\na certain type of thing,\n\n97\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.050\nthat is pretty much a one size\nfits all solution for everybody.\n\n98\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.640\nSo that's kind of an upside and downside.\n\n99\n00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.870\nIt'll catch the common things,\n\n100\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.250\nmaybe the low hanging fruit,\nmaybe a few things up above that.\n\n101\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.260\nBut it's not gonna break\ntoo much outside of that.\n\n102\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.830\nSure, you can customize them.\n\n103\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.460\nEvery one of those vulnerability scanners,\n\n104\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.100\nyou can customize,\nin some cases to an extremely high degree.\n\n105\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.910\nBut it's still gonna be a situation where\nyou're manual and using individual tools,\n\n106\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.990\nare gonna be able to really focus and\npound on individual vulnerabilities.\n\n107\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.230\nSo you can see the pros and cons with\nthe two, and you're probably never,\n\n108\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.750\nto be honest, never gonna go purely\none direction or the other direction.\n\n109\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.190\nYou're gonna use one and\nthe vulnerability scanner,\n\n110\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.730\nand then you're probably gonna use\nindividual tools to supplement that.\n\n111\n00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.490\nSo you're making sure you're\ngetting all the standard stuff, and\n\n112\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.860\nthen you can spend your time not\nsearching for the standard stuff.\n\n113\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.350\nYou can poke on individual\nareas of concern.\n\n114\n00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.900\nOr stuff that the report that came out\nof your vulnerability scanner, and\n\n115\n00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.470\nall of them generate reports.\n\n116\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.310\nYou can look at those reports to see\nwhat is an area of concern that you may\n\n117\n00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.850\nwant to zoom in on more,\n\n118\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.960\nand really kinda just pick at it and\nsee if there really is an issue there.\n\n119\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.449\nSo, you're gonna find out what\ncombination works best for you.\n\n120\n00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.998\nYou're probably always gonna\nuse the vulnerability scanner\n\n121\n00:07:05.998 --> 00:07:07.033\nplus individual tools.\n\n122\n00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:10.998\nIt's just in what ratio and\nmixture you decide, is gonna best for\n\n123\n00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:13.780\nyour particular situation, really.\n\n124\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.291\n>> Okay.\nNow, when it comes to doing these\n\n125\n00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:20.341\nvulnerability scans and\nusing these vulnerability scanners,\n\n126\n00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:24.623\nhow does that fit in to our penetration\ntesting model, if you will?\n\n127\n00:07:24.623 --> 00:07:33.680\n>> They do occupy a whole portion of\nthe penetration testing spectrum.\n\n128\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.620\nBut it is important to understand\nwhat part they actually occupy.\n\n129\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.959\nJust right out of the box, the part\nthat they're gonna occupy is some of\n\n130\n00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:47.911\nthe initial parts, where you're\nlooking for those weaknesses, so\n\n131\n00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:51.613\nyou can go in further and\nexploit those individual weaknesses.\n\n132\n00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:56.689\nSo you're talking about something\nreally at those first few stages.\n\n133\n00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:01.380\nIt's usually not gonna come in At the\nlater stages just because a vulnerability\n\n134\n00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.391\nscan, if you're talking\nthe way it's intended,\n\n135\n00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:08.520\na vulnerability scan is designed\njust to look for those weaknesses.\n\n136\n00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.100\nA pen test, by definition,\nmeans you're going in.\n\n137\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.600\nAnd so,\nvulnerability scanners don't do that.\n\n138\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.410\nThey'll tell you, hey,\n\n139\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.425\nthere it is, that door's unlocked,\nbut it's not gonna walk through it.\n\n140\n00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:21.340\nThat's your job to walk through it.\n\n141\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.904\nNow, having said that,\n\n142\n00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:27.222\nthere are places where you can use\na vulnerability scanner later on in\n\n143\n00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:32.285\nthe process if you really kinda know how\nto string together the right solution and\n\n144\n00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:36.184\nfigure out how to actually\ncustomize to get the right result.\n\n145\n00:08:36.184 --> 00:08:40.871\nAnd we're gonna actually see some\nof that cuz Metasploit really\n\n146\n00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:45.555\nkind of lets you get a vulnerability\nscanner to do its thing, and\n\n147\n00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:51.232\nthen be able to use it again later on in\nthe process to get even better results.\n\n148\n00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:55.768\nWhich is really cool when you start\nbringing all these tools together and snap\n\n149\n00:08:55.768 --> 00:09:00.815\nthem together, kind of like LEGO's, to get\na solution that's best suited for you.\n\n150\n00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.600\nSo yeah, that's where\nvulnerability scanning comes in.\n\n151\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.750\nAnd vulnerability scanning,\njust for the record,\n\n152\n00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:11.510\nit can be something that is\ndone completely on its own.\n\n153\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.340\nNothing says, if you do a vulnerability\nscan you even have to do pen testing.\n\n154\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.810\nThere's quite a few companies,\n\n155\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.980\nI mean, probably got people here\nthat are watching the course or\n\n156\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.830\ngoing through this and probably\nhave seen vulnerability scans done.\n\n157\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.980\nMay have done them themselves.\n\n158\n00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.760\nAnd that's it, they never actually\nran a pen test after that.\n\n159\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.220\nThey just did it as a routine audit.\n\n160\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.830\nAnd they're totally fine as that.\n\n161\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.800\nThere's no reason that you always have to\nassume that a vulnerability scan has to be\n\n162\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.330\nfollowed up by taking advantage\nof every one of those weaknesses.\n\n163\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.060\nSo that's just kind of\nthe lowdown on it and\n\n164\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.920\non how it fits in and\nwhere you can expect it to fit in.\n\n165\n00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.180\nBut you may find other\nplaces to pop it in there.\n\n166\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.040\nThey're using them really for\neverything nowadays to assess networks.\n\n167\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.140\nThey can assess everything.\n\n168\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.575\nAnd it's important to keep this in\nmind when we do vulnerability scans,\n\n169\n00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.985\nyou're not only assessing\noperating systems but\n\n170\n00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.695\nyou're assessing hardware\nin a lot of cases too.\n\n171\n00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:18.845\nIt can be stuff at the computer level,\nboth the OS and the hardware.\n\n172\n00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:24.015\nIt can be routers and switches and\nother infrastructure devices.\n\n173\n00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:28.115\nThey're even using them a lot nowadays,\nand heck we've already seen this,\n\n174\n00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:32.800\nwe saw this in our previous segments,\nthat there's actually stuff in Metasploit\n\n175\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.320\nthat allows you to\nanalyze Android devices.\n\n176\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.245\nA lot of vulnerability scanners\nactually include that.\n\n177\n00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:42.570\nNessus includes that.\n\n178\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.380\nThere's plugins that specifically say,\n\n179\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.700\nyou wanna look for mobile devices like\ntablets and phones and stuff like that.\n\n180\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.371\nIt can do that, both on the Android and\non the iOS side.\n\n181\n00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:57.090\nSo, they're using it across the board to\nbe more vigilant on what's happening.\n\n182\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.790\nThey may even schedule these\nthings to do on a regular basis.\n\n183\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.450\n>> So not only can these scanners be\na part of my penetration test, if that's\n\n184\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.210\nwhat we're doing, it can be a part of\nmy routine maintenance on my network,\n\n185\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.510\njust once a week, once a month.\n\n186\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.230\nOr like you said an audit or\nsomething like that.\n\n187\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.300\nAnd now it includes even mobile devices.\n\n188\n00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.810\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\n189\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.760\n>> Yeah.\nThey're really an integral part\n\n190\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.190\nof kind of like every day\nlife now as far as IT goes.\n\n191\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.529\nYou were saying in a previous segment\nabout Metasploit being of use to\n\n192\n00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:30.140\na network administrator.\n\n193\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.070\nThis would be one of the areas\nwhere it would fit in.\n\n194\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.870\nIf the network administrator wanted\nto grab this tool and just look for\n\n195\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.960\nvulnerabilities, Metasploit's\njust fine doing that.\n\n196\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.640\nThere's things that it can actually sweep\na system and flag vulnerabilities for\n\n197\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.400\nyou, if you know how to run that.\n\n198\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.940\nAnd we will be taking\na look at how to do that.\n\n199\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.980\nBut it could help you out with that,\nyou know.\n\n200\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.480\nAnd then something else to kind of think\nabout is it's not just the network admin\n\n201\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.280\nthat wants to do it for\ntheir own purposes.\n\n202\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.960\nIt may also be done for\nHIPAA compliance, PCI compliance,\n\n203\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.830\nor whatever industry you work in.\n\n204\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.860\nIf it's regulated in some way,\nshape, or form, then they very well\n\n205\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.560\ncould be saying it's mandated that you\ndon't have to do a pen test as often, but\n\n206\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.440\nyou do have to do a vulnerability scan and\nshow that you looked for\n\n207\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.010\ncertain things, and\nyou got specific reports that\n\n208\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.670\nare on file that they can look at and\naudit just to show that yes you\n\n209\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.790\nare being vigilant about keeping\nan eye out for any sort of weaknesses.\n\n210\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.770\n>> Nice, and then I'm assuming most of\nthese tools probably do include some\n\n211\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.575\ntype of reporting capability,\nthey're gonna go through and\n\n212\n00:12:38.575 --> 00:12:42.675\nscan my system, or my network,\nand then report that back to me?\n\n213\n00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:47.595\n>> Yeah, and that's where they\nkind of really earn their pay\n\n214\n00:12:47.595 --> 00:12:52.725\nthere is that the reporting capabilities\nof a lot of these tools they can go,\n\n215\n00:12:52.725 --> 00:12:56.285\nno pun intended, off the charts\nas far as what they can include.\n\n216\n00:12:56.285 --> 00:13:01.028\nYou have ones that will just\nspit out a simple chart with\n\n217\n00:13:01.028 --> 00:13:05.520\nvulnerability and priority and\nstuff like that on it.\n\n218\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.360\nAnd it's fine.\n\n219\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.870\nIt gets you the information.\n\n220\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:13.490\nBut some of them will spit out\nthese pie charts and bar graphs and\n\n221\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.850\nrefer you to certain knowledge based\narticles, in the case of Microsoft, or\n\n222\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:24.110\nthese vulnerability database, links for\nother operating systems and other systems.\n\n223\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.300\nAnd so they'll give you just so much.\n\n224\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.720\nAnd you can even put templates and\nstuff like that in there.\n\n225\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.960\nSo they will drop it into that.\n\n226\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.700\nAnd so you can, in some cases,\nhave a ready-made report\n\n227\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.090\nthat you can just take on into\nthe boss's office or whatever.\n\n228\n00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.240\nI mean, they'll spit it out\ncompletely into even a PDF\n\n229\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.000\nformat after you get the template and\neverything else set up.\n\n230\n00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.620\nThey'll put all the nice pretty\ncolors on it, and everything else,\n\n231\n00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.920\nand just spit it out to a PDF.\n\n232\n00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.670\nAnd you just take it and\ndrop it some place and you're done.\n\n233\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.190\n>> Nice.\nNice.\n\n234\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.040\n>> Yeah.\nSo that's one of the features that is\n\n235\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.250\nprobably gonna be something\nthat is compelling for you.\n\n236\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.620\nIf you have to generate a lot\nof reports off of this stuff,\n\n237\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.650\nif you are in an industry that's\nregulated, yeah, come on.\n\n238\n00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.960\nAnybody here that is or\nhas been in a regulated\n\n239\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.710\nindustry knows that they're really\nstickler about things being a certain way.\n\n240\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.740\nAnd they're very quick if things aren't\nthat way to say, oh, we're fining you.\n\n241\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They'll know and\n\n242\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.820\nthey'll jump down your\nthroat really quick on that.\n\n243\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.690\nSo, that may be where it's worthwhile for\nyou to spend that extra money on it.\n\n244\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.220\nAnd there's a lot of reporting tools out\nthere that can also help you with it, too.\n\n245\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.630\nSo, don't think if you use\nindividual tools, you're stuck.\n\n246\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.140\nYou do have reporting tools for that.\n\n247\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.890\nI mean, heck,\n\n248\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:48.617\nwe saw in the Kali course that there was\nreporting tools built right into Kali.\n\n249\n00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:52.163\nAnd I'll be the first one to tell you,\nthose aren't cutting edge.\n\n250\n00:14:52.163 --> 00:14:54.270\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> They're reporting tools.\n\n251\n00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.700\nThat's all I'm claiming.\n\n252\n00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.050\nI'm not saying that they're\ngood reporting tools.\n\n253\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.820\nI'm saying they're reporting tools.\n\n254\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.280\nSo that's just something to remember.\n\n255\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.700\nYou may want to seek a better solution\nto it, and there are free solutions for\n\n256\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.420\nthat, but there are reporting tools\neven if you're gonna do it manually and\n\n257\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.800\nnot use one of these scanners.\n\n258\n00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.450\nBut just keep that in mind.\n\n259\n00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.950\n>> The reporting is probably one of\nthe parts where the more you pay,\n\n260\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.570\nthe better you get type thing.\n\n261\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.410\nYeah.\n\n262\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.270\nYou can get.\n\n263\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.540\nThere's a really kind of fancy\nin the area if you wanna do it.\n\n264\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.170\n>> Right.\n\n265\n00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.170\n>> Or\nif you guys have Mikayla's email address.\n\n266\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.776\nShe'll be watching this, she'll know.\n\n267\n00:15:31.776 --> 00:15:35.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, we run these scans,\n\n268\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.250\nwe're gonna get these reports or this\ninformation's gonna get dumped back out to\n\n269\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.050\nus about the vulnerabilities it found.\n\n270\n00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.240\nBut they don't do anything.\n\n271\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.570\nThey don't let me take\nadvantage of the vulnerability,\n\n272\n00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.970\nI can't click on it and try to send\nan exploit or something like that.\n\n273\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.330\nSo what do we do with our results then?\n\n274\n00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.652\n>> The results you can,\n\n275\n00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:56.482\nthere's a number of paths you\ncan go once you get that result.\n\n276\n00:15:56.482 --> 00:16:01.446\nThe ones we're kind of looking at are\neither you run the vulnerability scan, and\n\n277\n00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:05.469\nyou dump that stuff into a report\nof some type, whatever that is.\n\n278\n00:16:05.469 --> 00:16:09.888\nAnd You're done,\nthat's the end of the process.\n\n279\n00:16:09.888 --> 00:16:13.944\nOr you can go and use the type of\nstuff that we're doing here and\n\n280\n00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:18.156\nnot just run the vulnerability scan,\nbut you run that scan, and\n\n281\n00:16:18.156 --> 00:16:22.134\nthen you can take those results over,\nand generate lists and\n\n282\n00:16:22.134 --> 00:16:25.580\nstuff like that,\nthat you can use with other tools.\n\n283\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.480\nTo do more in depth stuff, so\nonce you find the vulnerabilities you\n\n284\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.160\ncan bring that over and say,\nI know where the vulnerabilities are.\n\n285\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.080\nNow, I'm gonna target those\nvulnerabilities specifically.\n\n286\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.680\nNow, that this guy found them,\nI know where they are.\n\n287\n00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.310\nNow, I can act on the ones\nthat really need my attention.\n\n288\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.440\nWhich is really cool.\n\n289\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:48.480\nSomething spots it, and then you just kind\nof move in on those individual targets and\n\n290\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.000\nfocus your attention there.\n\n291\n00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.530\nSo that's a big, big, big help,\n\n292\n00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.010\nand if you're looking at tools like\nan expose, they're really good at it.\n\n293\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:57.885\nSame company.\n\n294\n00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:58.494\n>> Right.\n\n295\n00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:02.449\n>> It finds it, and Metasploit comes\nin and it's like, tag it and bag it.\n\n296\n00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:04.502\n>> Oh really, good.\n>> It goes in right there and does it.\n\n297\n00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:06.430\n>> You mean, like here's five\nexploits that'll hit that one.\n\n298\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.262\nWhich one would you\nlike to use type thing?\n\n299\n00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:08.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n300\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.910\n>> It could get to be that good if you\n\n301\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.110\nreally wanna go to town.\n\n302\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:18.410\nYeah, it can do that, and just for the\nrecord, it's not to say that if you, if\n\n303\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.270\nyou have one off the other vulnerability\nscanners you are kinda stuck,\n\n304\n00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.250\nbecause, hey you didn't get an expose,\nand now you want to use Metasploit.\n\n305\n00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.276\nOh well, you're gonna lose that\nability to get that close integration.\n\n306\n00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:33.302\nIt's not really that way,\nbecause you can even use Nessus and\n\n307\n00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:37.794\nexport stuff to a standardized format,\nusually it's like XML, for\n\n308\n00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:41.610\nexample, or\nsome sort of comma-delimited format.\n\n309\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.530\nAnd you can take that, and\nyou can bring that into Metasploit.\n\n310\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.860\nSo remember, Metasploit does have\na database sitting back there.\n\n311\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.680\nSo you can actually create\na new section of that database,\n\n312\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.330\nbring your results in, and\n\n313\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:58.410\nthen tell your tools to use those results\nas their basis to do their scanning on.\n\n314\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:04.025\nAnd operations on, so\nyou're not completely stuck there.\n\n315\n00:18:04.025 --> 00:18:06.470\nIn fact, I wanna say completely stuck,\nit makes sense.\n\n316\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.723\nIt sounds like you're\nactually losing something.\n\n317\n00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:13.497\nYou can say, yeah, you're probably losing\nsome of the ease of having expose in\n\n318\n00:18:13.497 --> 00:18:16.480\nMetasploit, but\nyou can still get the job done.\n\n319\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.662\n>> [CROSSTALK] Power of all\nthe different tools you can use, and\n\n320\n00:18:19.662 --> 00:18:23.159\nyou can still bring all of those to bear,\njust not nice and tidy and\n\n321\n00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:26.423\nthe programs aren't maybe\ntalking to each other as easily.\n\n322\n00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:29.178\n>> Yeah, for as me, as long as I get,\n\n323\n00:18:29.178 --> 00:18:34.880\nas long as it's relatively easy for\nme to do, and there's a point.\n\n324\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.033\nYou've got, everyone's gotta have\ntheir own pain threshold on that.\n\n325\n00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Really no other way to put it.\n\n326\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.502\nEveryone's got their own pain threshold or\ntolerance on that.\n\n327\n00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:46.460\nYou've got to decide just how much you're\ngonna give up if you wanna use another\n\n328\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.014\nvulnerability scanner and\nintegrate with Metasploit,\n\n329\n00:18:50.014 --> 00:18:53.710\nis you've gotta decide just\nhow far apart those are.\n\n330\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.480\nAs far as what do you have to do between\nhere and here to make the two talk.\n\n331\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.040\nSome of those things are gonna be, there's\na very, very small gap between the two and\n\n332\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.370\nyou just gotta do very little in here.\n\n333\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.840\nOther one, I mean,\nyou've got a huge section between it\n\n334\n00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.960\nthat you've got to fill in yourself,\ndoing all sorts of things.\n\n335\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.730\nSome people have come to the rescue.\n\n336\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.070\nAs far as that goes,\nyou have some vulnerability scanners,\n\n337\n00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.830\nthe more popular ones.\n\n338\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.950\nSome people have third party.\n\n339\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.940\nOther people have written little\nplugins and stuff like that,\n\n340\n00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.790\nthat will bridge the gap.\n\n341\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.670\nSo that's kind of a cool thing.\n\n342\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:35.950\nSo those things can help you out, but\nyeah, you've got to decide just how much\n\n343\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.260\nwork you're willing to do\nin between those points.\n\n344\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.468\nIf you very close,\nyou don't have a lot of work to do.\n\n345\n00:19:41.468 --> 00:19:46.930\nAnd if you're in the same CAD of expose\nand the Metasploit camp are together.\n\n346\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.450\nThere's really nothing there,\nit's a miniscule difference.\n\n347\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.180\nIf you go to the other ones, you have\nvarying degrees in there and for me,\n\n348\n00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.460\nwhen I look about exchanging data\nbetween programs, this goes back from my\n\n349\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.910\nold mechanical engineering days when\nI was supporting those guys and\n\n350\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.480\nworking with those guys.\n\n351\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.735\nI remember working with the CAD programs,\nand\n\n352\n00:20:07.735 --> 00:20:09.565\nall these database programs at the time.\n\n353\n00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:13.605\nAnd they would say, everybody was\npointing, oh it's perfect, 100%,\n\n354\n00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:15.172\ndata exchange, no problem, it's easy.\n\n355\n00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I was like, you're a liar.\n\n356\n00:20:18.125 --> 00:20:21.013\nNowadays, when I hear that, you go, you're\nlying, and you know you're lying, and\n\n357\n00:20:21.013 --> 00:20:22.452\nyou look me in the face when you're lying.\n\n358\n00:20:22.452 --> 00:20:23.022\nHow dare you?\n\n359\n00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.297\n>> It's never 100%,\n\n361\n00:20:25.297 --> 00:20:27.850\nyou always lose something\nin the translation.\n\n362\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.940\nI always told clients at the time.\n\n363\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.700\nAnd in the 20 plus years\nsince I was in that industry,\n\n364\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.710\nthat doesn't seem to change.\n\n365\n00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.190\nWhen you move data from\none point to another and\n\n366\n00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:41.120\nit's not the same application, you're\ngonna lose something in the translation.\n\n367\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.920\nJust be prepared for\nit and you'll be fine.\n\n368\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.488\nMaybe there are some people out\nhere who disagree with that, but\n\n369\n00:20:48.488 --> 00:20:50.153\nthat's been my experience.\n\n370\n00:20:50.153 --> 00:20:53.050\nSo you'll have to decide that here too,\njust how much.\n\n371\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.500\nFortunately, it's gotten better,\nbecause we do have formats like XML, and\n\n372\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.740\nthat has helped out tremendously.\n\n373\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.443\nBut you'll still run cases where\nthere's a big divide between those,\n\n374\n00:21:06.443 --> 00:21:11.873\nthat you're gonna have to find some\nway to bridge it or deal with it.\n\n375\n00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:15.287\n>> Nice thing about XML is, you can modify\nit, maybe bring some of those tags that\n\n376\n00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:18.850\none program made that the other\nprogram doesn't understand.\n\n377\n00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:19.840\nSo fantastic.\n\n378\n00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.410\nThat's a lot of information on\nvulnerability scanners there,\n\n379\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.670\nwe're gonna use these.\n\n380\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.600\nWhether we're doing it as\npart of routine maintenance,\n\n381\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.570\nor just audits on our network for\ncompliance, or if we're gonna use them\n\n382\n00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.530\nas part of a penetration test that we've\nbeen hired to do, or for our company.\n\n383\n00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.090\nSo a lot of uses for\nthese vulnerability scanners.\n\n384\n00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.220\nWe saw that there's actually\nquite a few options we've got to.\n\n385\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.200\nWe can go with individual tools.\n\n386\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.210\nWe can go to full-blown suites.\n\n387\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.180\nReporting capabilities are gonna\nbe varied among the different\n\n388\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.690\nvulnerability scanners.\n\n389\n00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.810\nMost of them don't do any type of action.\n\n390\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.760\nThey're gonna report this\nstuff back to us then, and\n\n391\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.340\nthen we're left on our own to\nfigure out what we wanna do.\n\n392\n00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.460\nWhether we take that to the next step and\nact on that vulnerability or\n\n393\n00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.710\nwhether it's just going into a report and\nbeing turned in.\n\n394\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.940\nA lot of good information.\n\n395\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.100\nSean, anything else we want to\nthrow in there when it comes to\n\n396\n00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.770\nvulnerability scanners?\n\n397\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.200\n>> I'll throw in one little detail on\nthis, just to make sure we're clear.\n\n398\n00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.643\nHere, we're pretty much,\nwhen we run a vulnerability scan, and\n\n399\n00:22:19.643 --> 00:22:23.884\nwe will do that we'll run a vulnerability\nscan and we're kinda gonna say, yeah,\n\n400\n00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:27.100\nstuff that we find we assume\nwe're gonna act on it.\n\n401\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.140\nJust because something pops\nup in a vulnerability scan,\n\n402\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.535\nlet me make it clear it's not something\nthat should send up a huge red flag.\n\n403\n00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:37.065\nOr whatever, and you have to jump in and\ndo something about it.\n\n404\n00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:39.545\nThat's something that you have\nto figure out when you look\n\n405\n00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:44.325\nat those vulnerabilities, you'll have to\ndecide, is that a serious enough issue for\n\n406\n00:22:44.325 --> 00:22:49.360\nyou to go in and do something about it,\nor you just leave it as it is.\n\n407\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.890\nNothing says because there is a problem\n\n408\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.570\nthat it perceives there that you\nhave to do something about it.\n\n409\n00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.650\nSo always remember that.\n\n410\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.900\nWhy we will be taking kind\nof the stance here for\n\n411\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.680\nthe purposes of training you and getting\nyou prepped on Metasploit will be when you\n\n412\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.680\nfind some of these that we are gonna act\non them with folks on specific ones.\n\n413\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.810\nBut in the real world you find a bunch\nof vulnerabilities, you can get\n\n414\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.380\na whole report and be all riddled with\nvulnerabilities, and they're all low\n\n415\n00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.800\npriority or none of them are a big deal,\nand you're like, I know where they are.\n\n416\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.013\nThat's all you're really looking for\nin the vulnerability scan.\n\n417\n00:23:23.013 --> 00:23:26.600\nThey're there, I know they're there,\ndo I need to do anything?\n\n418\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.630\nWell, maybe not, probably not.\n\n419\n00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.180\nIt's just be aware of that.\n\n420\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.390\nSo don't get that confused with what\nwe do and the way the real world works.\n\n421\n00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.590\nBecause, like I said,\nyou may never do anything with it.\n\n422\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.760\nYou may run a vulnerability scan and\nnot touch anything.\n\n423\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.550\n>> There's maybe some risk\nmanagement involved there.\n\n424\n00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.140\nWe start looking at them and going okay,\nyeah, this might classify it as a risk,\n\n425\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.230\nbut to our network and in our scenario,\nthe cost to patch that up or\n\n426\n00:23:54.230 --> 00:24:00.380\nprevent it, doesn't warrant the actually\nfollowing through with that.\n\n427\n00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.740\n>> Yeah, that's absolutely correct.\n\n428\n00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.951\nIt is a risk management thing and a risk\nassessment thing is just because it's\n\n429\n00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:12.012\nthere, doesn't mean that you need to\ntrip over yourself trying to fix it.\n\n430\n00:24:12.012 --> 00:24:16.520\nAnd that's something that people that\nare new to this do have problems with.\n\n431\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.330\nThey're like, oh my god.\n\n432\n00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.875\nThere's vulnerabilities or I need to\ndo something about it it's like no,\n\n433\n00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:25.357\nyou don't need to do anything about\nit at all you can leave it as it is.\n\n434\n00:24:25.357 --> 00:24:27.775\nIt's kinda like saying you could have,\n\n435\n00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:33.735\nin California where I live\nyou can say my house or\n\n436\n00:24:33.735 --> 00:24:38.935\na house down the street or\na warehouse is vulnerable to tornadoes.\n\n437\n00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:41.845\nOh, yeah, a tornado,\nyour house is tornado proof.\n\n438\n00:24:41.845 --> 00:24:44.725\nIt's like, and when's the last\ntime you heard a tornado up here?\n\n439\n00:24:44.725 --> 00:24:47.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they happen but not that often, so\n\n440\n00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.690\nI'm not gonna freak out and\n\n441\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.610\ngo, oh, yeah, I need to kinda\ngo through and do some stuff.\n\n442\n00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:56.620\nSo just that's kind of a crude analogy,\nbut it works.\n\n443\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.780\nYou can see where I'm going with that.\n\n444\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.993\n>> Absolutely.\n\n445\n00:24:58.993 --> 00:25:00.900\nWell, Sean, a lot of good info there.\n\n446\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.520\nWe've got more episodes coming your way.\n\n447\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.870\nWe're gonna take a deeper look\ninto these vulnerability scanners.\n\n448\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.200\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n449\n00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.220\nAnd I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n450\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.196\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n451\n00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:17.450\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.970\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.980\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.760\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.370\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.200\nAnother exciting day here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.920\nWe are continuing on with our Metasploit\nseries, and in particular, this one we're\n\n9\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.840\ngonna take a look again at vulnerability\nscans, but this time we're gonna\n\n10\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.620\npull some vulnerability scanners up and\nshow you guys how they work, right Sean?\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.680\n>> Yeah, we're kinda gonna work our\nway kinda sorta up the scale here,\n\n12\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.160\nif you will, on vulnerability scanners,\nand the first one that we're gonna\n\n13\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.380\nreally kinda take a look at,\nit's not really fully in\n\n14\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.810\nthe category of vulnerability scanners,\nbut it's getting you there.\n\n15\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.460\nBecause it's something that you\ncan use to identify a system, and\n\n16\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.980\npotentially find certain\nthings on a system.\n\n17\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.920\nJust some really neat\nstuff you can do with it.\n\n18\n00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.780\nSo, the first one we're gonna take\na look at, is kind of an old utility,\n\n19\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.240\nreally powerful utility,\nbuilt for Linux and Windows.\n\n20\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.570\nWell it's called Netcat.\n\n21\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.190\nWe've talked about that one before.\n\n22\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.940\nSo that's what we have going on here.\n\n23\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.460\nWe're gonna kind of put Netcat through its\npaces and see just exactly what it can do.\n\n24\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.810\n>> Nice.\n\n25\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.910\nAll right, lets take a look at it.\n\n26\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.890\nYeah, NetCat's one that's\nbeen around forever.\n\n27\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.020\nI think they call it the Swiss Army Knife\nof tools, because it does quite a bit.\n\n28\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.670\n>> Yeah, in fact they literally\ncall it that on their page.\n\n29\n00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.420\nIt's the Swiss Army knife of tools, so\n\n30\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.210\nthere's a lot of Swiss Army Knives\nin this security field.\n\n31\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.470\nI think we use that term a lot,\nnow that I think about it.\n\n32\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.890\n[LAUGH] And that,\nthat's a swiss army knife.\n\n33\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.330\n>> Well you know,\nyou got the different models right.\n\n34\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.730\nSo you got the 10 piece,\nthe 24 piece, I don't know.\n\n35\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.280\n>> There you go.\n\n36\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.034\nIf we had a whole product line.\n\n37\n00:01:56.034 --> 00:02:00.531\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, but, yeah it's, Netcat's,\n\n38\n00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:02.510\nit's got some miles on it.\n\n39\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.210\nI can't even remember how old it is.\n\n40\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.950\nI know it's been around for quite a while.\n\n41\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.800\nSo it's been around for quite a while.\n\n42\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.380\nIt actually does have a cousin that you\nmay have heard me mention called CryptCat.\n\n43\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.716\nThat's newer and\n\n44\n00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:23.450\nits real main difference is that it\ndoes stuff in an encrypted format.\n\n45\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500\nSo you can't eavesdrop on it which\nis obviously going to be a big deal\n\n46\n00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.920\nwhen you are doing the stuff\nthat Netcat can do.\n\n47\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.020\nBut Netcat is,\nobviously it's a command line utility.\n\n48\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.800\nYou can use it to,\nreally depending on what switches you use,\n\n49\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.250\nyou can get it to do a lot\nof different things.\n\n50\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.490\nAnd so, we're gonna see that to\nget it to talk between Linux and\n\n51\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.120\nWindows systems, Linux to Linux,\nLinux to Windows.\n\n52\n00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.290\nYou can get it to deliver payloads.\n\n53\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.470\nYou could even use it, believe it or not,\nyou could use it as a crude kind of like\n\n54\n00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.610\nchat system if you really\nwanted to do that.\n\n55\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.510\nThere's a way to do that right inside this\n\n56\n00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.610\nprogram just using a few switches\nto pass stuff back and forth.\n\n57\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.390\nSo it's really you know,\nquite cool when you get down to it.\n\n58\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.670\nYou'll also find out when you look\nat this, when you get Netcat,\n\n59\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.640\nyou'll find out why when you\nsee the stuff it can do,\n\n60\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.845\nwhy antivirus systems a lot of them will\nsay hey, you're not putting that here.\n\n61\n00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:27.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a big, big problem.\n\n62\n00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.620\nAnd that's something just to kinda warn\nyou about right out of the gate here.\n\n63\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.070\nAs we get into NetCat is if you\ndownload this for any system you're on,\n\n64\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.550\nit's more than likely gonna get flagged\nas being malware and get blocked.\n\n65\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.050\nSo it's another one of those cases.\n\n66\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.180\nIn the case of if you're using Kali, you\nknow, Kali, we're saying the host around\n\n67\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.890\nit, if your virtualizing at least, the\nhost around us providing the security and\n\n68\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.490\nwe're kinda sandboxed so we don't have\nthat stuff but if you download it onto\n\n69\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.700\nyour Windows box, hopefully\nyou've got an antivirus on there.\n\n70\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.770\nIt's gonna get blocked outright.\n\n71\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.190\nAnd that does bring you to something\nthat you do need to be aware of.\n\n72\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.460\nThere are actually at least\ntwo versions of NetCat\n\n73\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.270\nyou're going to run into\non the Windows platform.\n\n74\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.400\nOne of them will do everything\nthat we're gonna be showing here.\n\n75\n00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.590\nThe other one will not do everything.\n\n76\n00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.880\nSpecifically, it won't allow remote\nexecution of things, and that's the big\n\n77\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.860\nreason why they block NetCat,\nis NetCat can be dropped on a system.\n\n78\n00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.730\nAnd once it's on that system,\n\n79\n00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.250\nI can get it to do remote execution\nof whatever I want there.\n\n80\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.980\nOnce I put it there I can use\nit to transfer files over and\n\n81\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.200\nexecute those files, so you can imagine\njust how dangerous that can be,\n\n82\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200\nespecially if I bundle that thing up.\n\n83\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> In a Trojan and entice you in some way,\n\n84\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.660\nshape or form to install that.\n\n85\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.720\nIt's game over.\n\n86\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.920\nOpens up a port and bang,\nbang, bang, bang, and\n\n87\n00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.655\nI'm sending stuff up to your system and\ntaking control of it.\n\n88\n00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:15.073\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n89\n00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:19.820\nYou'll get an appreciation of that\ntrust me by the time we are done here.\n\n90\n00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.270\nSo, let's get things going here\nby taking a look at Netcat.\n\n91\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.280\nNetcat you got really kind\nof a couple options here.\n\n92\n00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.170\nYou can run it right through Metasploit.\n\n93\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.390\nWe know that.\n\n94\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.730\nOr we can run it right\nfrom the command line.\n\n95\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.450\nI am just keeping with the theme here.\n\n96\n00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.230\nI'm running it right here inside\nof Metasploit in this point.\n\n97\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.535\nNow Netcat the command for it is NC.\n\n98\n00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:53.935\nSo you just go through and\nif you type NC and hit enter,\n\n99\n00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:55.775\nit will bring up its own command prompt.\n\n100\n00:05:55.775 --> 00:06:00.005\nIf you want to do it that way hey,\nmore power to you.\n\n101\n00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:03.050\nI don't really use it in this\ninteractive mode too much.\n\n102\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.880\nWhat I do is I will do NC and then put all\nthe switches after it, and you'll see I've\n\n103\n00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.700\nalready got some stuff set up here\nready to go that uses exactly that.\n\n104\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.180\nSo just so you know, if you see that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.140\n>> and you're going,\n\n106\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.930\nwhy does it say command line on mine and\nnot in his?\n\n107\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.040\nThat's why, you hit NC and enter and\nit took you right to that command prompt.\n\n108\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.640\nSo things you can do with you know,\nwith Netcat.\n\n109\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.990\nOne of the things we can do that it's very\nvery useful for, is to do banner grabbing.\n\n110\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.230\nBanner grabbing we've done\nbeen down that road before.\n\n111\n00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.290\nWhat banner grabbing does is it can go\nto a specific service on a system and\n\n112\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.860\nor port connect to it and try to pull\ninformation off of it to identify\n\n113\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.033\nwhat is going on and so we can use\nNetcat to do that pretty easily.\n\n114\n00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:59.215\nThe way we would do that,\nis you'd just do the nc command, and\n\n115\n00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:01.675\nyou're gonna target an IP address.\n\n116\n00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:05.847\nNow, what I want to do, since I have my\nMetasploitable system sitting over here\n\n117\n00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:07.147\nI am just gonna take a look.\n\n118\n00:07:07.147 --> 00:07:14.187\nI can see my IP address over here and\nyou can see its 235.132.\n\n119\n00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:18.467\nOkay so I've got that going.\n\n120\n00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:22.790\nAnd so what I'll do is do,\nI'll go over here and\n\n121\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.520\nI will type 192.168.245.132,\nand then you'll\n\n122\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.040\nput a port number in after it, so go to\nthat IP address, connect to that port.\n\n123\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.300\nWhat it should do is it\nshould sit there for\n\n124\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.550\na moment or two, sometimes it'll\ncome right back and say connected.\n\n125\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.350\nOther times it'll just sit there.\n\n126\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.240\nSo it looks like it's\nconnected in this case, so\n\n127\n00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.990\nwhat I can do is, I will do get http.\n\n128\n00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.518\nIt's port 80, so it's an HTTP port.\n\n129\n00:07:54.518 --> 00:07:57.312\nAnd do /1.1.\n\n130\n00:07:57.312 --> 00:08:01.417\nAnd what this will do,\nwhen I pull this, is it's looking for\n\n131\n00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:04.969\na web server there,\nI've connected right to that.\n\n132\n00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:10.040\nAnd I'm saying use that protocol in that\nversion and extract what you can using it.\n\n133\n00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.135\nSo you see something that looks like HTML.\n\n134\n00:08:15.135 --> 00:08:20.200\nOkay, so it looks like that but\nas we go through it, it's saying,\n\n135\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.020\nit gave me a 400 error so nothing there.\n\n136\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.250\nWe've seen those types of errors before,\nthe 400 series.\n\n137\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.460\nThe request or\nwhatever interaction you try to do,\n\n138\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.940\nit wasn't correct, or it didn't\nhave a resource to present you, so\n\n139\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.570\nit spit it back saying, I don't know what\nyou're looking for, but didn't have it.\n\n140\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.360\nYeah, so, you've got that.\n\n141\n00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.320\nBut as you go through it you can see at\nthe bottom, we've got those address tags.\n\n142\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.370\nThat's something of interest.\n\n143\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.310\nWe can see down there Apache 2.2.8 and\nwe see it's Ubuntu,\n\n144\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.210\nand then we see some other\ninformation after it.\n\n145\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.110\nSo that's handy.\n\n146\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.710\nThat's something that we put on\nthe pile Information that we have.\n\n147\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.120\nI mean, that's good information.\n\n148\n00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.670\nYou can do the same thing\nwith other ports if you want.\n\n149\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.840\nYou can do the same type of thing\nwhere you do NC and tap away and\n\n150\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.020\ndo the port number where I've got\n80 you can replace it with that.\n\n151\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.310\nAnd then do a get request for\nthat specific service in there and\n\n152\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.800\nsee what it returns.\n\n153\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.680\nAnd so this one I just chose 80 cuz it's\none we all really quickly associate with.\n\n154\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.690\nAnd we can look at that pretty easily and\nsee what's happening.\n\n155\n00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.700\nSo that's just one really quick\nthing you can do with net cat.\n\n156\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.740\nYou know, I connected to it,\nI got some information, good.\n\n157\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.270\nSo I know what this is, I know the web\nserver, version at least some of it.\n\n158\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.630\nI've got that it says Ubuntu and a few\nother things there, and so that's good.\n\n159\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.130\nAnd I'm just kind of assuming here\nat this point that you would have\n\n160\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.380\ndone a port scan prior to this.\n\n161\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.155\nI just happen to know from having these\nwicked awesome skills, I can sense it, no.\n\n162\n00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:12.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I just happened to know that\n\n163\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.970\nthat was already open on\nthe Metasploitable system.\n\n164\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.040\nI could've gone through and\n\n165\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.740\nrun Nmap, and very quickly hey,\nit's port 80 has been found.\n\n166\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.740\nWe know how to do that.\n\n167\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.355\nI'm assuming that you have typed\nin Nmap with whatever flags,\n\n168\n00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:31.520\nand said return it to me,\nyou would have found the same thing.\n\n169\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.340\nYou should know how to do that by now.\n\n170\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.320\nSo, I just went in and said connect to\nthe port, and see what you can give me.\n\n171\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.900\nSo, if you look at it,\nit's scanning, in enumerations,\n\n172\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.960\nyou use the terminology from CEH/g-land or\nwherever.\n\n173\n00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.830\nThat's what that is.\n\n174\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.370\n>> So now you're gonna take that\ninformation that you got from Nmap on your\n\n175\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.790\nscan and then use each one of those port\nnumbers possibly and try to use Netcat and\n\n176\n00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.620\nsee what information you can get\nback on each one of those ports.\n\n177\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.350\nThey're basically\nfingerprinting the application?\n\n178\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.001\n>> Yeah.\n\n179\n00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:00.370\n>> That a good way to look at it?\n>> You could definitely look at it,\n\n180\n00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.030\nis that yeah you are indeed\nfingerprinting the application and or\n\n181\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.530\nthe OS depending on just specifically\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n182\n00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.080\nSo yeah I've got\ninformation really on both.\n\n183\n00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.240\nI've got the web server and\nthen I've got the information on the OS.\n\n184\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.870\nI don't have a clear information on\nthe OS, but you can bet if I wanted\n\n185\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.620\nto put the challenge to everyone out here\nand say try to find out what the OS is\n\n186\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.080\noff of that without looking at what that\nsystem is to figure out a way to do it.\n\n187\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.400\nI'm sure you can think of a handful of\nways to do that right now with what we've\n\n188\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.950\ngiven you.\n\n189\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:43.970\nSo, you've already seen one of\nthem again so far this week.\n\n190\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:52.670\nBut that's just pulling a banner or\ndoing a banner grab right off that port.\n\n191\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.160\nAnd by the way, you could,\non that get request in there,\n\n192\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.390\nyou could on that get request, you could,\nif you knew there was a file called\n\n193\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.770\ndefault or index or whatever html.\n\n194\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.780\nYou could actually put that in there and\nsay get space,\n\n195\n00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.590\nthen file name, then space http whatever\nand it would pull down that file.\n\n196\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.550\nSo, you could do that.\n\n197\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.240\nObviously, it's not a browser so\nit's going to puke up a bunch of code like\n\n198\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.610\nthis, but you would still get\nsome information off of it.\n\n199\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.960\nSo that's just kind of an FYI\nif you do want to try that.\n\n200\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.080\nOkay, so that's just really basic\nstuff you can do with Netcat.\n\n201\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.490\nThere are other things\nyou can do with this.\n\n202\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.240\nIt really is,\ndoes fit that Swiss army knife definition.\n\n203\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.260\nYou know, if you look at,\nyou just pull up the help on it, sorry.\n\n204\n00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:49.010\nYou pull up the help,\nyou can see it's got a lot of\n\n205\n00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:54.890\noptions built in to it.\n\n206\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.810\nI like this application because\nthey don't mess with it.\n\n207\n00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.350\nIf you look right up top on the first\ntwo things, Then, dangerous, And\n\n208\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.780\nyou know it's dangerous cuz they put\ntwo exclamation points after it.\n\n209\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.530\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n210\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.280\nTwo exclamation points,\ngotta be extremely dangerous.\n\n211\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.440\n>> Yeah, three?\n\n212\n00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.570\nThe UN's coming in at that point.\n\n213\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.890\nBut you can see that there's quite\na few things you can do there.\n\n214\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.980\nWe're gonna be using some of these.\n\n215\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.940\nNot all, but\nwe're gonna be using some of these.\n\n216\n00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo this is highly, highly configurable.\n\n217\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.610\nAnd you can get pretty creative with this.\n\n218\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.100\nYou can get really,\nreally creative with this.\n\n219\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.960\nSo that's just the basic stuff with it.\n\n220\n00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.810\nThere are other things\nyou can do with this.\n\n221\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:41.510\nOne of the ones I'll show you that you\ncan do is this command prompt right here.\n\n222\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.870\nI've got Netcat,\nit's going to verbose mode.\n\n223\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.720\nAnd I got some other switches in there.\n\n224\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.660\nAnd you can see an IP address, that IP\naddress is my Metaspoiltable system.\n\n225\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.570\nAnd then I've got the 1 to 1024.\n\n226\n00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.270\nThat probably gives away\nright there what's going on.\n\n227\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.490\nAnd so if I hit Enter on that,\nand what did it do?\n\n228\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.542\nNetcat just did a quick port scan for me.\n\n229\n00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:03.130\n>> Wow, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n230\n00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.550\n>> So,\nthat's kind of a neat thing to have.\n\n231\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.710\nThis isn't the best way to do it,\nto be quite honest.\n\n232\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:15.519\nNetcat is really not optimized for\nthis, but optimized I did it.\n\n233\n00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:18.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> You got the results you were looking\n\n234\n00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.750\nfor, right.\n\n235\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.150\n>> Yeah.\nIt did accomplish the task.\n\n236\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.660\nSo I can see right there that\nit spit back information saying,\n\n237\n00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.860\nyeah there's open ports.\n\n238\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.100\nSo yeah.\n\n239\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.700\nIn a pinch, didn't have NMAP available and\nyou did have Netcat,\n\n240\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:40.620\nyou could use it to accomplish that\njust by doing a few switches in there.\n\n241\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.610\nBoom.\nYou've got a simple port scan.\n\n242\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.690\nSo, I could have- you know, before I\ndo my banner grab, just with netcat,\n\n243\n00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.770\ntype in this command, look at it, and\nyou know you can see down that list,\n\n244\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.750\noh there's port 80 right there,\nalmost about in the middle of the list.\n\n245\n00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.075\nBoom, put that in there\nto my Netcat command.\n\n246\n00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:00.155\nAnd pull a banner out of it and\n\n247\n00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:05.645\nI've already done the first two steps and\nI've excluded NMap out of the equation.\n\n248\n00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:10.845\nObviously NMap can go far above and\nbeyond that this can do but yeah.\n\n249\n00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:15.885\nIn a pinch you can use this and\nit's always helpful to be adaptable but\n\n250\n00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:18.975\njust to kind of show you\nthe versatility of this tool.\n\n251\n00:15:18.975 --> 00:15:23.300\nYou can kind of see where it gets\nits name as the Swiss army knife\n\n252\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.160\nas we've been saying.\n\n253\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.670\n>> Banner grabbing, port scanning.\n\n254\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.925\nIt can dump files, retrieve files.\n\n255\n00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:30.108\nIt's doing quite a bit.\n\n256\n00:15:30.108 --> 00:15:31.180\n>> Yeah.\n\n257\n00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.130\nIt's doing that.\n\n258\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.240\nAnd then, as the saying goes,\nthere's always more.\n\n259\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.565\nLet me show you here.\n\n260\n00:15:38.565 --> 00:15:43.221\nSo I've got Netcat running\nhere with an IP address.\n\n261\n00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:46.865\nThen I've got this 1972 after it.\n\n262\n00:15:46.865 --> 00:15:48.050\nOkay.\n\n263\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.082\nLet's look at something over here.\n\n264\n00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:53.056\nSo I've got an Ubuntu 904 system and\n\n265\n00:15:53.056 --> 00:15:58.240\nI've also got in my Metasploitable\nsystem sitting over here.\n\n266\n00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.391\nAnd then I've also got Windows XP system.\n\n267\n00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:09.331\nAnd if you look on the Windows XP\nsystem it's got the 192168 245.134.\n\n268\n00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:15.280\nSo if we keep that in mind,\nwe go over here, we see on my Kali system.\n\n269\n00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.390\nWell, low and behold,\nit's got that IP address in there,\n\n270\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.200\nbut let's see what's going\non cuz you're probably or\n\n271\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.650\nyou may already be seen where\nthis is going kinda somewhat.\n\n272\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.760\nSome of you may have already done this,\nbut let's take a look at what's happening.\n\n273\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.530\nSo I've got XP sitting over here.\n\n274\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.510\nI can see the IP address, but\nlet's look what I've done with Netcat.\n\n275\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.020\nNetcat, if you look at it, right here.\n\n276\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.620\nMaybe we can zoom that up\na bit to give you a little\n\n277\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.360\ncloser look at what's going on.\n\n278\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.536\nYou can see it says nc-l.\n\n279\n00:16:51.536 --> 00:16:54.240\nThat's saying to listen.\n\n280\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.498\nSo go to -v, that's verbose, so\nit's gonna spit out information.\n\n281\n00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:02.360\n-p for port.\n\n282\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.880\nSo it's going to listen.\n\n283\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.310\nIt's gonna give me information.\n\n284\n00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.140\nIt's listening on a certain port,\nso we're stringing that together.\n\n285\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.000\nAnd then we have -e, and\nyou can see right after it says cmd.exe.\n\n286\n00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.760\nWell, we know that's an executable,\nand so -e must mean execute, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.730\nSo, and I hit enter on that and\nyou can see right there.\n\n288\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.270\nListening on, and it says, 1972.\n\n289\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.410\nSo, yeah.\n\n290\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.190\nOh, Windows XP system needing updates.\n\n291\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.603\nYeah.\nGet off my Cloud, right?\n\n292\n00:17:32.603 --> 00:17:33.606\nYou can leave.\n\n293\n00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.516\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But,\n\n294\n00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:37.420\nlet's see where that's going.\n\n295\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.180\nSo I've got NetCat over there,\nsitting there, standing at attention,\n\n296\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.400\nwaiting for orders, so\nI'm gonna go over to my Kali system.\n\n297\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.770\nAnd there's my Netcat deal.\n\n298\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.910\nOkay.\nSo we'll go ahead and hit enter, on this.\n\n299\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.120\nWell, let me click in here and hit enter.\n\n300\n00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.420\nAnd it's got that, so\nit's just sitting there waiting.\n\n301\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.230\nBut, look at what it did.\n\n302\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.130\nThat's a Linux system, and\nlook what it's telling me.\n\n303\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.844\nIt's telling me it's\nWidows XP version 5.1.\n\n304\n00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.500\nIt's like whoa, wait a minute.\n\n305\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.310\nWhat's happening there?\n\n306\n00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.420\nWhy is it telling me that?\n\n307\n00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.080\nWell, let's see exactly\nwhy it's telling you that.\n\n308\n00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.890\nIf you do an ipconfig,\nit shouldn't work on a Linux box, right?\n\n309\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.220\nBut, it's working.\n\n310\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.950\nSo what's happening there?\n\n311\n00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.800\nLook at the IP address,\nthat's not the IP address of that box.\n\n312\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.430\nSo you're already scratching your head\nthere a bit going, what's going on?\n\n313\n00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.650\nMaybe you are.\n\n314\n00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:37.230\nIf I go over here and\ndo a directory on it, look at it.\n\n315\n00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.060\nDocuments and settings, IE user desktop.\n\n316\n00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.383\nYeah, can you see where you are right now?\n\n317\n00:18:44.383 --> 00:18:47.042\nYou're not on that Linux box.\n\n318\n00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:51.741\nWhat's happened here is you're not\ninteracting with the Linux box now,\n\n319\n00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:55.850\nwhat happened is, is that NetCat\nis listening on the other box.\n\n320\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.748\nAnd it's saying as soon as you get\na connection to port 1972, and\n\n321\n00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:02.784\nI just chose that at random.\n\n322\n00:19:02.784 --> 00:19:06.891\nYou pick that,\nas soon as it connects to that port,\n\n323\n00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.150\nit's saying on that Windows box.\n\n324\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.820\nSomeone connects to that port.\n\n325\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.880\nGo through that list, and fire up cmd.exe.\n\n326\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.660\nAs soon as I get an incoming,\nan inbound connection on that.\n\n327\n00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.997\nFire up cmd.exe,\nwhich is the command prompt,\n\n328\n00:19:20.997 --> 00:19:22.956\nwhich is exactly what I'm seeing here.\n\n329\n00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:30.500\nAnd so, I've got a command prompt or\ncommand shell on my system.\n\n330\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.980\nIt just basically shot it\nback down the line to mine.\n\n331\n00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.750\nAnd now, I'm going through and\ndoing stuff.\n\n332\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.550\nNow just to kinda put this in context\n\n333\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.530\nhere, if I went through and\nlooked at this.\n\n334\n00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:49.040\nReally, if I just closed all this out,\nor minimized all that.\n\n335\n00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.710\nAnd just to, whoops.\n\n336\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.250\nAll right, we'll go over here and\nstart doing directory, and\n\n337\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.160\nstart doing my cd and switching.\n\n338\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.040\nAnd doing all that good stuff.\n\n339\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.820\nI'm looking at it.\n\n340\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.540\nIf I go over to the Windows box,\nyeah, look.\n\n341\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.933\nDidn't touch anything over there.\n\n342\n00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:05.819\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n343\n00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:10.028\nif I could actually hide that in someone's\nsystem and start interacting with it,\n\n344\n00:20:10.028 --> 00:20:11.681\nthey're not seeing anything.\n\n345\n00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:14.130\nNothing's changed there.\n\n346\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:21.287\nEven the command prompt right here\nthat's actually got Netcat running.\n\n347\n00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:26.291\nThere's no evidence that I've actually\nrun anything at all, except Netcat.\n\n348\n00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.439\nSo this other stuff I'm doing,\n\n349\n00:20:28.439 --> 00:20:32.880\nit's connected to it accepted\nthe connection and it's going.\n\n350\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.660\nSo the sky's the limit at that point.\n\n351\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.430\nSo really kind of let that sink in.\n\n352\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.776\nThat should tell you right there why\nyour anti virus programs are saying,\n\n353\n00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:47.000\nno we're not letting this on this\nbox because that's just dangerous.\n\n354\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.622\nThis is exactly why,\n\n355\n00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:53.660\nis that if I get you to open this\nup as a Trojan, it's game over.\n\n356\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.370\nI can put anything there where cmd.exe is,\nand just say,\n\n357\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.000\nfire it off and get it to do that.\n\n358\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.870\nThat doesn't have to be be cmd.exe,\nit could be a key log or something.\n\n359\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.210\nSomething that could do something for me.\n\n360\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.060\nIt could be cmd.exe because maybe I wanted\nto interact with that system remotely.\n\n361\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.920\nSo it could be some really\ncool things going on here.\n\n362\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.983\nAnd if you really kinda wanna push the\nlimits of this, if you're on the outside\n\n363\n00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:29.295\ncoming in from the internet, and\nyou're connecting to a system.\n\n364\n00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:33.840\nAnd you are able to connect to a system,\ncrack a password, and do a privilege\n\n365\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.540\nescalation, and then maybe drop this\non the system at some point, oh, yeah.\n\n366\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.410\nThink about what you could do.\n\n367\n00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.680\nYou open up that hole in the system,\nyou connect to it remotely.\n\n368\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.470\nAll you have to do at that point is\nyou basically have a foot in the door,\n\n369\n00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.680\ntoe in the door.\n\n370\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.010\nOnce you got there, you can use\nthat system to map out from there,\n\n371\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.020\nmap out the network and\nopen up other stuff.\n\n372\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.317\nBecause anything you can do from\na normal XP box in this case,\n\n373\n00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:02.040\nyou can do right through\nthat shell from my Kali box.\n\n374\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.714\nSo I've got that shell opened up here and\nready,\n\n375\n00:22:06.714 --> 00:22:10.480\nand listening for whatever I wanna do.\n\n376\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.773\n>> Nice.\n>> So, yeah,\n\n377\n00:22:11.773 --> 00:22:16.573\nthat should really kinda give you\nan idea of the nastiness that\n\n378\n00:22:16.573 --> 00:22:21.110\ncould kind of await you if\nyou get this on your box.\n\n379\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.200\nOkay?\nBut,\n\n380\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.640\nit's not the only one that\ngets to share in the fun here.\n\n381\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.340\nHere is Ubuntu, and\nUbuntu has a similar thing.\n\n382\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.621\nYou can see this is that .128, and\nyou can see the same syntax in there.\n\n383\n00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:38.242\nAnd that's the cool thing about Netcat.\n\n384\n00:22:38.242 --> 00:22:42.982\nAcross the systems, it has a similar\nsyntax right across the board, so\n\n385\n00:22:42.982 --> 00:22:46.275\nyou can just take this\nwherever you need to.\n\n386\n00:22:46.275 --> 00:22:50.317\nSo what I have here is, you can see,\nit's doing the same type of thing.\n\n387\n00:22:50.317 --> 00:22:52.765\nIt's listening on that\nport in an executable.\n\n388\n00:22:52.765 --> 00:22:56.740\nIt's saying, do this,\nopen up a shell there.\n\n389\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.180\nSo it means if I go over to, and\nI'll just kill this connection.\n\n390\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.380\nOr heck, I didn't even have to kill that\nconnection I can leave that up there and\n\n391\n00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.730\ngo over here, and do NetCat basically,\n\n392\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.432\nsame command i've got running.\n\n393\n00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:18.390\nRight up here at the top.\n\n394\n00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.220\nSo type in the IP address.\n\n395\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:25.600\nAll I gotta do is swap it out with\nthe IP address of this Unbutu system,\n\n396\n00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.440\nwhich happens to be,\nI've got it right here, 245.136.\n\n397\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:39.580\nSo, I just go over here, and\ntype it in 192, was it 168.245.\n\n398\n00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.850\nWhat'd I say, 136?\n\n399\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.530\n>> 136, I believe, yes.\n\n400\n00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.830\n>> And then, just type in the port number.\n\n401\n00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.350\nAnd it should give me\na same type of thing.\n\n402\n00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.050\nI should be able to do stuff like LS or\nwhatever on there.\n\n403\n00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.250\nAnd there you go!\n\n404\n00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.826\nAnd I've got two shells open,\n\n405\n00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:58.742\ntwo different systems through\nthe console right there.\n\n406\n00:23:58.742 --> 00:24:00.002\nSo, heck!\n\n407\n00:24:00.002 --> 00:24:02.701\nYou could transfer files from\nhere to here if you want.\n\n408\n00:24:02.701 --> 00:24:06.422\nI have no problem whatsoever with that.\n\n409\n00:24:06.422 --> 00:24:08.595\nSo in a few really quick steps,\n\n410\n00:24:08.595 --> 00:24:14.200\nI won't worry about the distribution\nmethods of getting Netcat onto a system,\n\n411\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:21.370\nbecause we've kinda already covered that\nground through trojans, creating your own.\n\n412\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:26.150\nOr you could just figure out any\nnumber of ways to get it on a system.\n\n413\n00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.580\nSo you've got it on the system.\n\n414\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.770\nNow what could you do when\nyou get it on a system?\n\n415\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.609\nJust drop these switches in and\nyou can start doing this stuff.\n\n416\n00:24:35.609 --> 00:24:39.330\nYou can start running all your networking\ntools, your examination tools and\n\n417\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.220\nstart swimming around that network or\n\n418\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.910\ncompromising that system,\ncreate a user account, who knows.\n\n419\n00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:50.430\nHeck, you get onto that system and\nyou establish enough of a beach head\n\n420\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:56.018\non that system that you can at least run\nNetcat, you might be able just to do that.\n\n421\n00:24:56.018 --> 00:25:00.780\nRun Netcat with a lower\nprivileged account, run that, and\n\n422\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:06.520\nthen use that to download a keylogger or\nsomething and install it on there.\n\n423\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.280\nAnd use that as your way to bait somebody\ninto typing in their username and\n\n424\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.190\npassword to get on a domain or\nthe network or whatever.\n\n425\n00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.730\nCapture that, have that beamed back to\nyou, and now you log in with that and\n\n426\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.100\nyou've got even higher privileges now.\n\n427\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.170\nSo you can really just do bang,\nbang, bang, right down the list.\n\n428\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.171\nSo there you go.\n\n429\n00:25:26.171 --> 00:25:27.633\n>> [LAUGH] That's pretty impressive stuff.\n\n430\n00:25:27.633 --> 00:25:32.070\nI mean, Netcat just starts out as a\nscanner and turns out to be so much more.\n\n431\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.050\nIt can do the scanning, but\nit can also basically be a backdoor or\n\n432\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.430\ngive you that remote\ncontrol over that machine.\n\n433\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.888\nPretty much do anything you want.\nRun scans, you could execute programs.\n\n434\n00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:45.530\nIf you have that shell, you could have\ndone anything you wanted at that point.\n\n435\n00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:50.090\n>> Yeah, we haven't even got to stuff\nlike, with Netcat, transferring files.\n\n436\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.784\nThat would be the next step beyond this.\n\n437\n00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:56.620\nNetcat itself, there's nothing\nsaying that I have to just use\n\n438\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:02.000\nNetcat to open up a channel to that\nsystem to start sending it commands.\n\n439\n00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.610\nI could actually use Netcat itself to\ndirectly push a file onto that system, and\n\n440\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.130\nthen go to the next step of running it, so\n\n441\n00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.870\nit's all well within\nthe capabilities that you have here.\n\n442\n00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:19.824\nAnd you can go ahead and look through\nthat whole list of switches in there and\n\n443\n00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:23.901\nfind all different creative\nways of doing things.\n\n444\n00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:29.745\nYou can see kind of a peak at\nthe file transfer capabilities.\n\n445\n00:26:29.745 --> 00:26:33.181\nThey've got file names and\nfile and all that in there.\n\n446\n00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:36.290\nThey're already telling you,\nhey, we can do stuff with files.\n\n447\n00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.490\nThat should get the gears turning,\n\n448\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.310\ngoing hey, let's see exactly\nwhat they can do with files.\n\n449\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:46.540\nSo if I can open a connection to it,\nI can push a file onto it.\n\n450\n00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.440\nSo you didn't have to really.\n\n451\n00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.950\nIf you open up a connection to someone's\nsystem, you can just go ahead and\n\n452\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.630\nuse this to push that keylogger\nthat you've already downloaded and\n\n453\n00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.750\ninstalled, just push it directly\nonto their box and have it install.\n\n454\n00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:08.640\nSo a few really quick things and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n455\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.030\nI mean,\nyou've established with a very small\n\n456\n00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.900\nfootprint utility and very little effort.\n\n457\n00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.970\nI know I probably have a tendency to kind\nof shoot through these things kind of\n\n458\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.280\nquickly, but\nyou can see in a very few switches\n\n459\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.940\nwe were on the systems and\nbasically owned it at that point.\n\n460\n00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.070\nTo a certain degree we owned it.\n\n461\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.598\n>> Absolutely, all you did was\nget Netcat on that other system,\n\n462\n00:27:35.598 --> 00:27:38.425\ntell it what port to listen on, and\nit was just waiting for your call.\n\n463\n00:27:38.425 --> 00:27:40.667\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n464\n00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:43.990\nIt was waiting there for my call.\n\n465\n00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.680\nSo pulled a banner,\ndid a port scan and then\n\n466\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:54.625\nopened up shells to two different systems\nand got it being presented right here.\n\n467\n00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:56.525\nAnd again, tip of the iceberg.\n\n468\n00:27:56.525 --> 00:28:01.011\nYou can connect to stuff like,\nthey mention Telnet in the help there.\n\n469\n00:28:01.011 --> 00:28:04.715\nYeah, you can use it to\ncommunicate with Telnet stuff and\n\n470\n00:28:04.715 --> 00:28:09.785\nopen up a Telnet type session,\namongst a whole bunch of other things.\n\n471\n00:28:09.785 --> 00:28:13.935\nSo it's incredibly powerful for\nwhat it is.\n\n472\n00:28:13.935 --> 00:28:19.220\nSo that should, like I said,\nreally put in context why all your\n\n473\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:24.270\nmalware scanners are like, get this off\nthe system now, just get it outta here.\n\n474\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.050\nThat they're gonna delete it, destroy it,\nwhatever it takes to get it off the system\n\n475\n00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.560\ncuz they know what can\npotentially be lurking there.\n\n476\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.850\nSo just be aware of it,\nyou're more conscious of things now.\n\n477\n00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.868\nPlay with it and\nsee exactly what you can do, but\n\n478\n00:28:39.868 --> 00:28:45.911\nthis is just the beginning of the whole\nprocess of working with Netcat.\n\n479\n00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:46.747\n>> Very good.\n\n480\n00:28:46.747 --> 00:28:48.387\nAll right, well, Sean, I'll tell you what,\n\n481\n00:28:48.387 --> 00:28:51.860\na lot of great information about\nvulnerability scanners, especially Netcat.\n\n482\n00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.590\nI know we've got more vulnerability\nscanners to go over, but\n\n483\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.210\nlooking at our clock it's about time for\nus to wrap this one up, so we will.\n\n484\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.090\nBut stay tuned,\nwe've got more episodes coming your way.\n\n485\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.345\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n486\n00:29:03.345 --> 00:29:04.425\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n487\n00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:05.551\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:06.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.080\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.530\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.370\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.980\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.020\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.030\nExcited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.220\nWe've got another exciting\nMetasploit episode coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.650\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking at vulnerability scanners, and\n\n11\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.820\nI know we've taken a look at vulnerability\nscanners in a couple previous episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.290\nWe're gonna continue that on and\ntake a look, Sean,\n\n13\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290\nlike last time we looked\nat one called NetCat,\n\n14\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.970\nwhich did a little bit of vulnerability\nscanning and then a whole lot more.\n\n15\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was a great episode.\n\n16\n00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.250\nGo check that one out if you missed it.\n\n17\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.980\nThis one, Sean, you've got some other\nvulnerability scanners in mind for\n\n18\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.630\nus to take a look at, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.120\nYes, what we're gonna be doing here is\nwe're actually gonna be seeing one of\n\n20\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.460\nthe big boys as far as\nvulnerability scanners go.\n\n21\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.470\nSo looking at things like Netcat,\nand then Nmap,\n\n22\n00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.010\nwhich like we were saying could be thrown\nin that category under some conditions.\n\n23\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.840\nThat's one thing.\n\n24\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.450\nThat's one level.\n\n25\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.380\nBut now we're gonna bump it up and\nraise it to another level.\n\n26\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.510\nAnd then we're gonna see just how that\nplays in with Metasploit, itself.\n\n27\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.790\nSo, that's what we really kinda\nhave on tap for this one.\n\n28\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.940\nSo we're gonna talk about two.\n\n29\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.100\nWe're only gonna actually,\nreally interact with one.\n\n30\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.930\nBut there's two that are really\nof interest and can help you out.\n\n31\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.220\nOne of them is Nessus.\n\n32\n00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.600\nAnd I will, by the way,\ninclude Nessus and OpenVAS.\n\n33\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.590\nIt's kind of the same thing.\n\n34\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.570\nSince they are pretty much cousins\nI'm not gonna keep going through and\n\n35\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.580\nsaying Nessus and OpenVAS.\n\n36\n00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.940\nGonna just assume it's both.\n\n37\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.670\n>> And refresh my memory there,\nSean, Nessus is the paid version,\n\n38\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.910\nOpenVAS being the branch\nthat remained open to us?\n\n39\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.820\n>> Yeah.\n\n40\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.330\nYeah at one point they're the same thing,\nand\n\n41\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.760\nthere was a fork in the road where\nthey said oh this is a good product,\n\n42\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.850\nwe should charge for\nthis and they went that way.\n\n43\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.270\nAnd now the paid version has a,\n\n44\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.250\nwhat they typically call like\na community edition something like that.\n\n45\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.050\nIt's free for home and personal use,\nand educational use as well.\n\n46\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.850\nAnd then you have Nexpose.\n\n47\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.000\nNexpose, or sorry, you have OpenVas\nwhich went the other direction and\n\n48\n00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.670\nsaid, we're just gonna make the whole\nthing free and keep it that way.\n\n49\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.690\nSo, they've diverged from\neach other somewhat, but\n\n50\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.800\nyou can see the common\nroots between the two.\n\n51\n00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.080\nSo they're the same but\nthey're different I guess,\n\n52\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.540\nhowever you want to quantify that.\n\n53\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.440\nThat's what the situation is.\n\n54\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.100\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nthrow them both in the same bucket,\n\n55\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.000\nbut yeah when you get down\nto them look at them both.\n\n56\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.750\nThere are differences, but\nWe're not going to worry about that here,\n\n57\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.430\nit's just not part of the equation.\n\n58\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.260\n>> Okay, sounds good.\n\n59\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.530\nSo, let's see, Nessus is one that we've,\nis that part of Metasploit?\n\n60\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.100\nIs there a community version in there?\n\n61\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.610\n>> Nessus or Nexpose?\n\n62\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.180\n>> Nexpose.\n\n63\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.850\n>> Nexpose,\nit does have a community edition,\n\n64\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.100\nit's not part of anything you\ndownload with Metasploit.\n\n65\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.010\nBut you can get it on it's own.\n\n66\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.370\nAnd it comes in a Linux version,\nand it also has a Windows version.\n\n67\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.300\nSo you've got both bases covered, and\n\n68\n00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.520\nif you actually can have Meta-Sploit and\nLinux, and\n\n69\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.640\nyou can have Nexpose in Windows, or\nvice versa, And they can still share data.\n\n70\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.330\n>> Oh, nice.\n\n71\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.310\n>> So that's a really cool thing.\n\n72\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.990\nAnd it actually goes back to\nsomething that we kinda touched upon\n\n73\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.000\npreviously, is that since\nXML's being generated and\n\n74\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.920\nthat's the medium of exchange between\nthe two, XML's XML, text is text.\n\n75\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.800\nAnd XML is just a formatted\nversion of text.\n\n76\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.090\nAnd so.\n\n77\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.950\n>> Doesn't really care what the underlying\noperating system is if it can read the XML\n\n78\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.400\nfile one way or the other.\n\n79\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.530\n>> Yeah.\nDoesn't care one bit.\n\n80\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.010\nSo, you generate however you see fit.\n\n81\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.410\nAnd bring it into Metasploit.\n\n82\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.860\nSo you could literally generate that\nXML on the other side of the planet if\n\n83\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.710\nyou wanted to on whatever system.\n\n84\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.840\nYou don't care,\njust tell the person to email you the XML,\n\n85\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.650\nstick it on a flash drive or\nwhatever and you can bring it in.\n\n86\n00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.930\nOr just do it yourself, you've got them\nboth on the same system or whatever.\n\n87\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.420\nJust go ahead and\nyou can use them together.\n\n88\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.774\nSo we're gonna have both an expose and\n\n89\n00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:44.410\nMetasploit on the exact same system\nhere just to keep it simple,\n\n90\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.440\nand probably that's the way\nyou're gonna do it anyway.\n\n91\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.810\n>> Sounds like a common scenario.\n\n92\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.270\nIf I've got my pen test machine,\n\n93\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.700\nI'm going to have all those tools\nloaded up on that same box.\n\n94\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.720\nBut good to know that if somebody in\na remote office had access to one of these\n\n95\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.390\ntools, they could run it and\nthen send me the results.\n\n96\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.110\nAnd I could tie it in\nwith everything else.\n\n97\n00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.810\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a really really cool thing to have\n\n98\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.420\nthat, to be able to generate\na whole list of stuff,\n\n99\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.500\ndo your scan and\ngo through the whole process\n\n100\n00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.540\nof doing whatever type of scan you want\n>> And\n\n101\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.090\nthen just shoot that out to an XML\nfile and then just take it over.\n\n102\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.290\nBy the way,\nwhen you generate these in XML,\n\n103\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.270\nthat's just one of the ways you\ncan generate data out of Nexpose.\n\n104\n00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.370\nYou can have the nice pretty formatted\nreport with all the colors and stuff\n\n105\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.910\nlike that in it, or you can just fire it\nright out to an XML file and you're done.\n\n106\n00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.370\nSo you can do that repeatedly too, so\nonce it's got the scanner results,\n\n107\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.740\nyou can tell it XML one time, or\ngo back and say, okay, that guy's got XML,\n\n108\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.180\nnow I have the same thing to show\nthe actual manager so you can do that.\n\n109\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.440\nSo pretty cool capability.\n\n110\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.220\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n111\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.490\nAll right, so Nessus then,\nyou want to start there?\n\n112\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.760\nYou want to start with an Nexpose?\n\n113\n00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.799\n>> Well, what we're gonna do is since\nwe're going to look at the two we've got,\n\n114\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.930\n>> We have an Nexpose in Nessus and\n\n115\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.440\nwe're talking Metasploit as a Rapid 7\nproduct and Nexpose is a Rapid 7 product.\n\n116\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.430\nAnd we want to, you know, we'll just show\nthe two since it makes it nice and easy.\n\n117\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.540\nNessus, it's not,\nit wouldn't be that much tougher because.\n\n118\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.410\n>> Really, once you run the scan,\nit's just getting stuff out on the backend\n\n119\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.100\ninto Metasploit, and so\nyou're gonna see that.\n\n120\n00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.070\nYou're gonna see why it really\ndoesn't matter as far as in\n\n121\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.540\na lot of cases whether it's Nexpose,\nor Nessus.\n\n122\n00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.060\nOr really any type of\nvulnerability scanner,\n\n123\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.690\nif you wanna play along with that.\n\n124\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.910\nAny type of vulnerability\nscanner that can puke out XML,\n\n125\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.020\njust regular, simple, unadultered XML,\n\n126\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.680\nif it can do that it should in theory be\nable to bring it right into Metasploit.\n\n127\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.280\nI can't speak in every case, but\nI can speak for the Nexpose and\n\n128\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.780\nNessus issue that yeah, they can go\nahead and shoot it right out to that.\n\n129\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.590\nBut the key is having just that plain,\nsimple, unmonkeyed with XML.\n\n130\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.410\nAs long as you have that\nyou should be good to go,\n\n131\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.710\nbut your mileage may vary if you\ndecide to use something else.\n\n132\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.580\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n133\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.840\nAll right, so where do we start that?\n\n134\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.980\nOkay.\nSo what I've done just to keep\n\n135\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.520\nthings simple here,\nis I'm gonna run everything for\n\n136\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.390\nwhat we have right here just in Windows.\n\n137\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.430\nBecause it just makes it easier, you're\nnot squeezing everything on screen as\n\n138\n00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.240\nmuch, cuz there's gonna be\na lot of stuff going on.\n\n139\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.820\nSo I want to make sure\neverything's captured.\n\n140\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.596\nHowever, with that being said everything\nwe're doing in here can be done\n\n141\n00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:55.687\nover on the Kali side 100%.\n\n142\n00:07:55.687 --> 00:08:01.007\nIt really doesn't matter,\ncommands are the same, interfaces.\n\n143\n00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:04.318\nInterfaces might You look\na little different, but\n\n144\n00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.553\neverything's in the same place.\n\n145\n00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:10.201\nIf it's different,\nit's gonna be because of your browser or\n\n146\n00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:13.580\nwhatever, you're viewing it in and\nnot anything else.\n\n147\n00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.220\nEverything's in the same place, the fonts\nmaybe different the stuff like that,\n\n148\n00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.130\nthe buttons may look different,\nbut who cares?\n\n149\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.245\n>> Right.\n>> It's the same thing, really.\n\n150\n00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.978\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So with that being said,\n\n151\n00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:28.338\nwhat I have is I'm gonna\nstart on the Nexpose side,\n\n152\n00:08:28.338 --> 00:08:34.086\nand I have Nexpose actually\nrunning here on my system.\n\n153\n00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:37.998\nTo make things easy, the reason why it\ntook us a little bit of time there to get\n\n154\n00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:40.810\nstarted on this one is it took\nme some time to run a scan,\n\n155\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.170\na little longer than I expected.\n\n156\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.560\nBut what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nshow you how a scan actually works.\n\n157\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.556\nI already have a scan completed.\n\n158\n00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:51.130\nSo I'm gonna show you how it works.\n\n159\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:57.193\nI won't bother running that, and\nthen we'll see how we get that from here,\n\n160\n00:08:57.193 --> 00:09:02.242\nover in to Metasploit which is\nactually a really cool process.\n\n161\n00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:05.420\nAnd then we'll see what that means\nonce you get it in to Metasploit.\n\n162\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.858\n>> And probably good for\nus to know those scans aren't instant.\n\n163\n00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:12.019\nIt's not like you're\ngonna click a button and\n\n164\n00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:14.742\nthen expect results to pop up\non your screen immediately.\n\n165\n00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.684\nThey can be kind of time consuming,\n\n166\n00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:17.960\ndepending on-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n167\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.036\n>> How many systems you're scanning.\n\n168\n00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:21.870\nIt's got a lot of vulnerabilities\nthat it's looking for, right?\n\n169\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.810\n>> Yeah, if you scan a range of IPs and\nyou can seriously put\n\n170\n00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:33.400\nsome big ranges of IPs in\nthere to tell it to scan.\n\n171\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.940\nAnd you tell it to scan for\n\n172\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.330\nall the vulnerabilities into\na really aggressive scan.\n\n173\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.314\nYou could probably time that scan\nwith a calendar at that point.\n\n174\n00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:46.731\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna take some time to do,\n\n175\n00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:49.108\nso really consider that.\n\n176\n00:09:49.108 --> 00:09:53.056\nAs far as when you look\nat a vulnerability scan,\n\n177\n00:09:53.056 --> 00:09:56.412\nit is worth mentioning when you do this,\n\n178\n00:09:56.412 --> 00:10:01.280\na vulnerability scan is something\nthat is gonna be noisy.\n\n179\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.320\nSo when you do this, you probably aren't\ngonna do it as part of a pen test.\n\n180\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.990\nIt's gonna be something that\njust chatters away like crazy.\n\n181\n00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.490\nSo we're really for all intents and\n\n182\n00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:16.220\npurposes at this point,\nsomeone has given us a white box test and\n\n183\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.480\nthey know we're there and\nwe're just rocking and rolling with it.\n\n184\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.802\nIf you would not wanna try\nto be stealthy with this.\n\n185\n00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:26.707\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you try to be stealthy with this,\n\n186\n00:10:26.707 --> 00:10:27.856\nit's wrong.\n\n187\n00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:30.834\n>> The big neon sign's\npointing down at you like.\n\n188\n00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:31.538\n>> Yeah.\n\n189\n00:10:31.538 --> 00:10:32.751\n>> Sean's hideout is right here.\n\n190\n00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:34.011\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n191\n00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:36.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're walking through a parking lot\n\n192\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.680\nwith a chain full of cans and everything\nbehind you and they're clanking around.\n\n193\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.822\nIt's like what are you looking at man?\n\n194\n00:10:41.822 --> 00:10:46.780\nSo yeah, this would not be\nthe stealthiest way to do things.\n\n195\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.550\nSo what I've got in here though is\nI've only done one scan with it.\n\n196\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.690\nThat's why the stuff up top\ndoesn't look too interesting.\n\n197\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:00.570\nBut just to give you an idea of\nwhat's happening here, is that we see\n\n198\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.910\nthis graphic up top, as we run more\nscans and we keep this thing going.\n\n199\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.390\nYou will see it actually build a graph and\ntell you what the different risk,\n\n200\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.480\nwhat your risk profile of your\nsystem changes over time.\n\n201\n00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.145\nIt will do little neat things like that,\nso that I think is a really cool thing\n\n202\n00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:23.680\ncuz you can at a glance in this console,\nsee what's happening without having\n\n203\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.210\nto jump through all of these\nextra hoops to visualize it.\n\n204\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.864\nSo that's kind of a neat thing.\n\n205\n00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:36.378\nAnd then we've got, you can see I\nhave a site created down underneath\n\n206\n00:11:36.378 --> 00:11:41.340\nthat it tells me I have one asset\nin that site which is correct.\n\n207\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.842\nThe only thing I went after is\nthat Metasploitable system.\n\n208\n00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:50.281\nAnd you can see I have the IP\naddress sitting over there.\n\n209\n00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:52.585\nI got a site name, and then so\n\n210\n00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:57.113\nthat's just giving me a really\nquick at a glance stuff.\n\n211\n00:11:57.113 --> 00:11:59.816\nI think it's kinda funny that\nthey say highest risk asset and\n\n212\n00:11:59.816 --> 00:12:01.252\nit's giving me the IP address.\n\n213\n00:12:01.252 --> 00:12:02.964\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should try the only asset in\n\n214\n00:12:02.964 --> 00:12:03.679\nthat site.\n\n215\n00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:07.354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n216\n00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:10.009\nyou could also say it's the lowest for\n[CROSSTALK] why be a pessimist?\n\n217\n00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:12.296\n[LAUGH]\n>> Half empty or half full, right?\n\n218\n00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:17.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> You'll see on these things that you can\n\n219\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:22.554\nclick on a number of these things,\nand get additional information.\n\n220\n00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:25.393\nSome of these things you\ncan just click on and\n\n221\n00:12:25.393 --> 00:12:29.015\nyou will see what's going on\nwith that specific asset.\n\n222\n00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:33.225\nOne thing I've noticed with Nexpose,\n\n223\n00:12:33.225 --> 00:12:40.633\nis that you really have to be mindful\nof the memory you're giving it.\n\n224\n00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:43.638\nThis is one of the other reasons why\nI went through and pulled it out,\n\n225\n00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.490\nthat virtual environment is that,\nthat virtual environment,\n\n226\n00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.968\nI'm gonna be running k li, and then I'm\ngonna be running this on top of it, and\n\n227\n00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:52.181\nthen gonna be running all\nthese other machines.\n\n228\n00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:57.172\nIt's like no, let me just for\ndemo purposes, to make things nice and\n\n229\n00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:59.253\nefficient and reasonable.\n\n230\n00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:04.569\nLet me go ahead and\njust run this outside of that environment,\n\n231\n00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:10.010\nso it's got the most amount of\nmemory I can allocate to it.\n\n232\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.600\nDo expect Nexpose.\n\n233\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.189\nIt wants a minimum of\neight gigs of memory.\n\n234\n00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:16.634\nIt ain't gonna stick with that.\n\n235\n00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:18.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It'll go ahead and use more.\n\n236\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.130\nSo the more the merrier,\nI guess is the key thing we've got here.\n\n237\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.530\nSo what I can see in here,\nis I clicked the IP address of an asset.\n\n238\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.330\nAnd you can see just some\nof the information on it.\n\n239\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.264\nMan, you can see that\nMetasploitable system.\n\n240\n00:13:35.264 --> 00:13:36.849\nBang, bang, bang, bang, bang.\n\n241\n00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.062\nWhat can you say?\n\n242\n00:13:38.062 --> 00:13:40.349\n[LAUGH]\n>> 200, what is that?\n\n243\n00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:41.423\n>> 370.\n\n244\n00:13:41.423 --> 00:13:42.125\n>> 370?\n\n245\n00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.524\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] nice.\n\n246\n00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:44.412\n>> So it's not bad.\n\n247\n00:13:44.412 --> 00:13:45.811\nIt's not bad.\n\n248\n00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:49.162\n>> They said they were gonna make you a\nvulnerable system that we could scan, and\n\n249\n00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.461\nthat's what they've done.\n\n250\n00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:54.461\n>> That system,\nthere's a lot of vulnerabilities there.\n\n251\n00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.649\nThat system needs some counseling it's so\nvulnerable.\n\n252\n00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:58.833\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n253\n00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:02.710\nit's got some stuff happening in here.\n\n254\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.950\nSo you can see what the results of\nwhat a vulnerability scan will do.\n\n255\n00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.520\nI could, flip through these page after\npage, after page, looking at these.\n\n256\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.750\nAnd that's all well and good.\n\n257\n00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.290\nFor one asset, yeah whatever,\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n258\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.470\nBut it's gonna take some time.\n\n259\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.260\nYou can also see when you look\nat right there in that column.\n\n260\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.903\nThis is your integration right here.\n\n261\n00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:27.620\n>> Oh, wow.\n\n262\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.241\n>> It's telling you hey,\nI've got something for that.\n\n263\n00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:32.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can nail that right now.\n\n264\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.530\nSo you can go through these\npage after page of this stuff,\n\n265\n00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.360\nand you'll see that it has some of them\nactually flagged and saying, yeah,\n\n266\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.935\nI've either got something ready for or\nthere's multiple things in here for it.\n\n267\n00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:52.390\nSo that if I've got one of those\nthings sitting next to it,\n\n268\n00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.830\nI know that there's something\nin Metasploit right now\n\n269\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.480\nthat can get used as a way to\nestablish a beachhead on the system.\n\n270\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.562\nThe next question would be is do you have\nsomething that can run at that point?\n\n271\n00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:11.960\nDo you have a payload that you can drop\nonto that system and run at that point?\n\n272\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.430\nSo there's really two phases there.\n\n273\n00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.550\nSo you gotta have an exploit, and\n\n274\n00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.567\nthen to take advantage of\nthe vulnerability then you gotta have\n\n275\n00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:24.676\na payload to drop off that is specific to\nthat system that can do your dirty work.\n\n276\n00:15:24.676 --> 00:15:26.075\n>> I gotcha.\n\n277\n00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:30.266\n>> So but you kind of see,\nyou kind of see what's going on there,\n\n278\n00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.900\na lot of nasty stuff going on.\n\n279\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.860\nBut and that's really extreme if you see\na system like that in production with\n\n280\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.780\n370 vulnerabilities and I don't know if\nwe go all the way to the end of that.\n\n281\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.210\nLook at it.\nGo all the way to the end.\n\n282\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.590\nThey're like all serious.\n\n283\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.156\nOh moderate, they go down to moderate.\n\n284\n00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.814\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I feel a little bit better now.\n\n285\n00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:51.574\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:15:51.574 --> 00:15:54.237\n>> Fire your system admin if that's in\n\n287\n00:15:54.237 --> 00:15:55.306\nproduction.\n\n288\n00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.676\nYou'll notice by the way,\nit does say on that Metasploit.\n\n289\n00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:01.543\nExploitable system, when you start it up\ndoesn't have a banner right there saying,\n\n290\n00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:03.658\ndo not put this\ninternet-facing at any time.\n\n291\n00:16:03.658 --> 00:16:05.175\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Duh.\n\n292\n00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:11.770\n[LAUGH] So, all right so\nwe've got these list of things.\n\n293\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.020\nHere you can see some, the actual\nlist of the exploits right there.\n\n294\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.490\nI mean so there, again,\nis our integration,\n\n295\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.499\nRapid7 product to Rapid7 product.\n\n296\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.390\nNessus is not gonna do that.\n\n297\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.010\nIn Nessus you'd have to do more\nresearch if you just had this.\n\n298\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:33.130\nI mean that's really helpful because\nif I'm looking to see how Metasploit\n\n299\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.580\nfits into the picture I've got\nthat right here, listed in expose.\n\n300\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.200\nI can go right over and\nsay, oh, well, what is it?\n\n301\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.790\nAnd click on the module, and\nboom, I've got what I need.\n\n302\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.540\nSo you're really gotta like that.\n\n303\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.670\nSo there's just the details and\nthe bio on it.\n\n304\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.630\nSo we've got quite a few things.\n\n305\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.220\nOkay, so whatever.\n\n306\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.907\nSo we've got all this stuff happening.\n\n307\n00:16:59.907 --> 00:17:03.800\nAll right, so that's a completed scan.\n\n308\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.000\nI went through that kinda quickly,\n\n309\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.620\nnot because I was trying to point\nout anything specific at this point.\n\n310\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.964\nI mean, I did point out some things,\nbut I'm not doing it for any specific\n\n311\n00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:19.688\nreason except to show you that yeah,\nthere's a scan being completed and done.\n\n312\n00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:21.610\nSo I've got the results,\n\n313\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.730\nI've all ready taken them into\nto cut down some of the time.\n\n314\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.010\nHere I've all ready taken\nthose into Metasploit but\n\n315\n00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.660\nI'm going to show you how I did that.\n\n316\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.000\nSo you can see how it's done, but you\ndon't have to wait for the whole process\n\n317\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.800\nof doing the import, and sit here and\ngoing, okay, when's this gonna happen?\n\n318\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.900\nI've already done it for you.\n\n319\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.560\nBut let's talk about,\njust since we're here in Nexpose,\n\n320\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.670\nlet's talk about actually doing the scan.\n\n321\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.815\nSo the way you do a scan in Nexpose,\nif you're gonna set this thing up,\n\n322\n00:17:53.815 --> 00:17:58.760\nis to give you an idea,\nis you are going to create a site,\n\n323\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.290\nfirst time you go in, that site's gonna\nrepresent kind of like a grouping\n\n324\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.320\nof computers, so\nyou can name it whatever you want.\n\n325\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.640\nSo I can name it ITPro.\n\n326\n00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.800\nI could put that in there, and\n\n327\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.560\nI could rank it if I wanted\nto put that stuff in there.\n\n328\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.870\nAnd you can see that you could\neven go down the list and\n\n329\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.430\nput a whole bunch of other\ninformation in there.\n\n330\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.850\nAnd that will be stuff that it can pull\nand shove on a report if you want.\n\n331\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.060\nSo you might consider,\nthough I'm not gonna do it here,\n\n332\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.260\nyou might consider\npopulating that later on.\n\n333\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.710\nSo next thing we have, assets.\n\n334\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.690\nAssets are gonna tell you what\nyou are gonna be scanning.\n\n335\n00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:44.000\nSo if I was gonna scan the system that I\njust did, I would drop in it's IP address.\n\n336\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.030\nOr I do some sort of notation like that.\n\n337\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.940\nIf I want to scan a whole range,\nthat's totally acceptable.\n\n338\n00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.940\nSo you have that going on.\n\n339\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.600\nNext thing, this is where you can,\n\n340\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.829\nif you're playing ahead of things,\nkind of like a long game here.\n\n341\n00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:05.467\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n342\n00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:09.052\n>> You could already have when\nyou did your reconnaissance,\n\n343\n00:19:09.052 --> 00:19:10.790\nyou could build a list of.\n\n344\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.880\nCuz we said when you do\nyour reconnaissance,\n\n345\n00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.930\none of the things you're looking for\nis subnets, ranges of IPs.\n\n346\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.667\nBut then we said [LAUGH] there's not gonna\nbe something living behind every one of\n\n347\n00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:21.930\nthose IPs.\n\n348\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.580\nSo you're not just gonna want\nto drop a subnet in here and\n\n349\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.650\nsay scan it and go for it.\n\n350\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.290\nYou think it takes long when it\nknows there's something there?\n\n351\n00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.865\nWait til you scan a bunch of\nstuff that there's nothing there.\n\n352\n00:19:35.865 --> 00:19:39.210\n[LAUGH] It will take its\nsweet time doing it.\n\n353\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:46.070\nSo if you want to,\nif you have a bunch of subnets\n\n354\n00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.040\nout there, or ranges that you picked\nup during your reconnaissance phase,\n\n355\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.080\nif you're being smart about this,\n\n356\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.260\none of the ways you could do this\nis you can take that IP subnet and\n\n357\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.870\nthen shoot it through something like an N\nmap would be a perfect candidate for this.\n\n358\n00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.750\nRun it through N map.\n\n359\n00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.762\nDo a quick ping sweep.\n\n360\n00:20:04.762 --> 00:20:09.505\nPipe it out to a text file,\nthen go over here to the exclude and\n\n361\n00:20:09.505 --> 00:20:12.865\ndo a browse and you could, or\nthere's also an include too,\n\n362\n00:20:12.865 --> 00:20:15.865\nyou could actually go out there and\nsay just scan these hosts.\n\n363\n00:20:15.865 --> 00:20:18.535\nDon't worry about the other stuff and\nyou're done.\n\n364\n00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:21.605\nSo you could customize it that way.\n\n365\n00:20:21.605 --> 00:20:25.260\nIf you wanted to add or\nyou know get rid of things.\n\n366\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.980\nSo [COUGH] here's the include, exclude.\n\n367\n00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.870\nYou kinda see the two.\n\n368\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.490\nIf you have the text file over here,\nof hosts that were live in there.\n\n369\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.080\nJust grab that and done.\n\n370\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.750\nThat makes it really, really simple.\n\n371\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.540\nHonestly, you know how to\ndo that at this point.\n\n372\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.810\nYou should know how to run Endmap and\ndo a quick Ping sweep across a range.\n\n373\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.590\nYou should be doing that.\n\n374\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.470\nSave yourself some time.\n\n375\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.440\nI'm not doing that.\n\n376\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.250\nI only got one host.\n\n377\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.630\nI only want to scan one host, so\nI'm not going to go overkill on this.\n\n378\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.056\nYou also have the ability just to kind\nof go through customizing the scan.\n\n379\n00:21:01.056 --> 00:21:02.495\nI'm not going to put anything in here, but\n\n380\n00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:06.395\nyou can put credentials in\nthere to log into services, and\n\n381\n00:21:06.395 --> 00:21:10.785\nwhat this will do is this will use those\ncredentials to log into the service and\n\n382\n00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:15.435\nthen do the vulnerability scan under\nthat context of those credentials.\n\n383\n00:21:15.435 --> 00:21:18.995\nAnd the benefit of doing that\nis it actually will give you\n\n384\n00:21:18.995 --> 00:21:22.560\neven more vulnerabilities, which you know,\nyou think about it there's\n\n385\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.290\nonly 370 on this thing as it is, I don't\neven want to think about what it is.\n\n386\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.700\nThat would be frightening.\n\n387\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.343\nI'd start drinking if I saw how\nmany vulnerabilities came up with\n\n388\n00:21:32.343 --> 00:21:32.890\nauthentication.\n\n389\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.345\nI don't even drink, so\nthat's saying a lot.\n\n390\n00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:40.790\n[LAUGH] But\nthere's my authentication and stuff.\n\n391\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.740\nThen you have a template option.\n\n392\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.180\nSome of the stuff is optional.\n\n393\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.360\nAuthentication's optional.\n\n394\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.420\nOver here on the templates,\nthis is where you\n\n395\n00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.930\nreally kinda get to decide just what\nthe scan is going to look like.\n\n396\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.430\nAnd so what you're seeing here when\nyou look through these templates,\n\n397\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:05.090\nyou can do some pretty cruel stuff here,\nsuch as it is.\n\n398\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:11.490\nIt gives you a little bit of\ndescription about what the scan does.\n\n399\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.000\nSo it gives you that\nlittle bit of description,\n\n400\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.050\ntells you what it might be doing.\n\n401\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.330\nChecks and all that doing.\n\n402\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.750\nIt tells you even, hey,\nwhere this stuff came from.\n\n403\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.040\nThe stuff, you can build your\nown templates if you want.\n\n404\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.170\nSome of these things come directly from,\n\n405\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.110\nor all the ones I have\nhere come from Rapid 7.\n\n406\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.080\nThey shipped with the product.\n\n407\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.340\nBut you can tweak these things or\ncreate your own.\n\n408\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:37.360\nSo what you gotta think of is just\nhow aggressive you wanna get.\n\n409\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.480\nThe scan that I did completed here.\n\n410\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.590\nIt took ten minutes to scan just\nthat Metasploitable system.\n\n411\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.050\nAll I did was a discovery scan.\n\n412\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.850\nI didn't even do the discovery aggressive.\n\n413\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.820\nI just did the discovery scan.\n\n414\n00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.070\nIf I did an aggressive, I don't know.\n\n415\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.136\nThis machine would be smoking right now.\n\n416\n00:22:53.136 --> 00:22:54.220\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n417\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.630\nSo you have those things but\n\n418\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.400\nnotice they've got stuff in here if\nyou are scanning Windows systems.\n\n419\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.300\nIt's got Microsoft hot\nfixes that it's missing,\n\n420\n00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.260\nit can look specifically for those.\n\n421\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.300\n>> There is a HIPPA compliance one.\n\n422\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.130\n>> Yeah.\n>> That would be really handy.\n\n423\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.910\n>> Yeah, that's a good catch there,\nit's a good one to point out,\n\n424\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.690\nbecause you have HIPAA compliance,\n\n425\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.180\nyou have PCI audits in here, and\nyou even have Sarbanes-Oxley stuff.\n\n426\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.040\n>> Wow.\n>> So\n\n427\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.600\nyou've got three big\nones covered right there.\n\n428\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.080\nAnd there's nothing to say that you\ncan't go to those working groups,\n\n429\n00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.360\nor whoever manages those\nparticular regulations.\n\n430\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.385\nAnd they may actually already\nhave something set up for this.\n\n431\n00:23:34.385 --> 00:23:35.120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n432\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.630\n>> Or you just create your own.\n\n433\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.560\n>> Right.\n>> Only have to create it once.\n\n434\n00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.630\nOnce it's in there, you can just use\nit over and over and over again and\n\n435\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.250\nyou can even schedule those scans.\n\n436\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.950\nThat's the really unique thing about this\ntoo is that you can keep telling it run\n\n437\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:54.590\nthe scan every so often for\nme automatically and just get the reports.\n\n438\n00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.369\n>> And\nmaintain that compliance at that point.\n\n439\n00:23:57.369 --> 00:24:01.593\n>> Yeah, so you could say every\nthree months run this scan,\n\n440\n00:24:01.593 --> 00:24:05.729\nand it'll go ahead and\nThen scan it, say on a Saturday or\n\n441\n00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:09.290\nsomething if that happens\nto be a down day.\n\n442\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:16.810\nHave it run the scan, and\nthen get the results and pick through it.\n\n443\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.820\nThen you have engines, this test tells\nyou when it's actually gonna do the scan.\n\n444\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.760\nAlerts if it comes up,\n\n445\n00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.520\ngiving you information about certain\nthings as they happen or as it picks up.\n\n446\n00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.490\nThen there's your schedule.\n\n447\n00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.600\nOnce you've got everything completed,\nyou're going to go over here and\n\n448\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.290\njust save your site configuration.\n\n449\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.240\nI'm just saving it.\n\n450\n00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.540\nI'm not going to scan it.\n\n451\n00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.160\nBe careful which one you hit.\n\n452\n00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.931\nIf you hit save and scan,\ntelling you what it's gonna do.\n\n453\n00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:49.890\n[LAUGH] You might as well say, well,\nyou're either gonna cancel that scan or\n\n454\n00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:54.020\nyou're gonna go out and hunt any game,\nclean it, cook it up and\n\n455\n00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.990\neat it up before you come back and\nit's done.\n\n456\n00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:02.700\nSo that being said,\nI've got my site's being created,\n\n457\n00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:08.260\nI've got my scan sitting there,\nso hey, we're in good shape.\n\n458\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.790\nI could run that scan right now,\nand if I get time in here,\n\n459\n00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:19.110\nI will run a scan after he's said and\ndone everything else.\n\n460\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.470\nI'll show you just how\nnoisy these scans are,\n\n461\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:27.358\nI can run on my Meta-Sploitable system,\nI can run a pack system for\n\n462\n00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:30.780\nlike TCP dump and\njust watch that thing go nuts.\n\n463\n00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.610\nYou'll see, crystal-clear,\nif i do something like that,\n\n464\n00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.590\nif I can fit it in here, you'll see\njust how noisy these things are.\n\n465\n00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.640\nAnd that you're just not being\neven the least bit stealthy.\n\n466\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.270\nSo there you go.\n\n467\n00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:51.840\nThere's everything all set up and\nready to go.\n\n468\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.490\nSo what we're gonna say is,\nwe're gonna fast forward here, and\n\n469\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.670\nsay, hey, the scan's completed.\n\n470\n00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.990\nSo I've got that scan\nthat I did previously.\n\n471\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.200\nWhat I'm gonna do is go\nover here to Reports.\n\n472\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.170\nSo I click on this Report tab, and\n\n473\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.290\nit's got the report that\nI generated previously.\n\n474\n00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:17.030\nOkay, so now that report is one,\nyeah, I did generate previously and\n\n475\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.840\nwe're gonna see how that's created, I'm\nnot gonna even look at that one right now.\n\n476\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.810\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a brand new report.\n\n477\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.420\nCuz we've got to get this,\n\n478\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.990\nwe're gonna assume that we have the data\nalready stuck inside of Nexpose.\n\n479\n00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.910\nNow, we've got to export that and\n\n480\n00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.430\nget it over into Metasploit,\nbecause what we have here is great.\n\n481\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.600\nWe actually have actionable\ninformation here.\n\n482\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.057\nYou saw that it told you there's\nstuff in Metasploit right now that\n\n483\n00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:45.440\ncan exploit that.\n\n484\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.470\nHey, that's all well and good.\n\n485\n00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.730\nWell, now what we've got to do is\nfigure out how we, if we're going to\n\n486\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.670\ngo ahead to that system and exploit it,\njust off of what we're being told.\n\n487\n00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.410\nOf if we need to go ahead and\nshoot it directly over to Metasploit.\n\n488\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.100\nAnd manipulate it and\ntransform it more over there.\n\n489\n00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.920\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nassume that we do really wanna get it over\n\n490\n00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.630\nto Metasploit.\n\n491\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.310\nSo, we'll do create report.\n\n492\n00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.850\nYou name the report, and\nI'll say it's a test report.\n\n493\n00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.590\nAnd what we'll do is when you go through,\n\n494\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:19.860\nyou're gonna customize the report and,\ncuz you can't just leave it as it is.\n\n495\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:25.140\nSo what you'll do is you'll take\nthe actual report and say okay,\n\n496\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:32.090\nin this case I have just a site, so\nI will select this high rule site.\n\n497\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.240\nI'll select that one.\n\n498\n00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:37.520\nAnd click Done on there.\n\n499\n00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.590\nSo, it's got the information on that.\n\n500\n00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.420\nI am gonna say Export, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.700\nSo, if you wanna do document,\n\n502\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.440\ndocument will give you the nice\npretty looking report.\n\n503\n00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.290\nSo, it kinda talks about what we were\ngoing into in an earlier segment.\n\n504\n00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.750\nAs you can bring the pretty\nlittle report out.\n\n505\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.490\nI don't care about that for this.\n\n506\n00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:00.380\nI don't need Metasploit that could care\nless about what colors, or graphs,\n\n507\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.130\nor points or whatever you got in there.\n\n508\n00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.670\nThat's, it says need human readable stuff.\n\n509\n00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.010\nSo what we're gonna do,\nis we will do click export.\n\n510\n00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:13.690\nWe will do the Nexpose simple xml,\nso we'll grab that.\n\n511\n00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:19.340\nAnd then again, okay, so\nmy site is still selected so we are good.\n\n512\n00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.622\nSo, that looks great.\n\n513\n00:28:22.622 --> 00:28:25.300\nSo you can see it says 1 selected site.\n\n514\n00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.370\nOkay, so that looks good for us,\n\n515\n00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:33.800\nso what I'll do is I will do a Save and\nrun the report.\n\n516\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:40.890\nIt's gonna work it's magic and\nthen boom, we have another report here.\n\n517\n00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.180\nSo, if you wanted to get\nthat out at this point,\n\n518\n00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.400\nwhat you would do is just go over here and\n\n519\n00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.980\nthe easy way to do it is just click\non this, and there's a bunch of XML.\n\n520\n00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.950\nThat's just for one asset by the way.\n\n521\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.930\nSo we've got all that\nstuff being spit out.\n\n522\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:05.130\nYou can just save that in your browser\nas an XML file and you're ready to go\n\n523\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:10.520\nto the next step, which would be to\ntake it right into into Metasploit.\n\n524\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.590\nSo we've got our XML describing\nwhat it found the data.\n\n525\n00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:22.040\nAnd if you go through this that's\na big chunk of stuff we've got there.\n\n526\n00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.770\nSo\n>> A lot of the same stuff we were seeing\n\n527\n00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.440\nat the end of that scan where I was\nlisting all those vulnerabilities.\n\n528\n00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.210\nSame information, just in XMLs so I can\nnow import it into another application.\n\n529\n00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.980\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n530\n00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.540\nCuz that's all XML does.\n\n531\n00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.750\nXML doesn't tell you how\nit's gonna be presented.\n\n532\n00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.050\nAll it does is describe\nwhat data we have there.\n\n533\n00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.650\nSo it took the data we had from\nthe vulnerability scan and\n\n534\n00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.040\njust said, here you go.\n\n535\n00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.340\nAll those things that were on that\nlittle stuff we'd click through.\n\n536\n00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.730\nAnd we're saying, oh, there's\nsomething for that and that and that.\n\n537\n00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.820\nThat's what this is.\n\n538\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:58.157\nAnd when they say Nexpose simple XML,\nit really strips a lot\n\n539\n00:29:58.157 --> 00:30:05.620\nof the value added stuff that the value\nadded stuff that Nexpose puts in there.\n\n540\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.170\nIt strips that all off,\nand says, okay yeah,\n\n541\n00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.350\nhere is just the basic stuff that you\nneed to take it over into something else.\n\n542\n00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.500\nAnd it's saying that I know another\nprogram will understand that.\n\n543\n00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.000\nSo there's stuff I've got.\n\n544\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.310\nI won't give it to you because\nit's just not gonna get it.\n\n545\n00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.260\n>> Some of those other reports that\ninclude more information might be more\n\n546\n00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.930\nappropriate if you're sticking with\nRapid7 products, whereas that simple one,\n\n547\n00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.790\nif I could go between a different program\nthat strips a lot of that extra stuff out.\n\n548\n00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:35.230\n>> Yeah, that would be exactly right, and\n\n549\n00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:41.010\neven in this case you would\nthink that just to qualify it\n\n550\n00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:46.510\nbecause you pointed out that\ngoing to another Rapid7 product.\n\n551\n00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.330\nWell, Metasploit is obviously\nanother Rapid7 product,\n\n552\n00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.050\nwhy aren't we,\nwhy don't we want extra stuff?\n\n553\n00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.020\nWell if what we're doing,\nwe're looking for\n\n554\n00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:02.200\nvulnerabilities here and\nwe're looking for ways to get into that.\n\n555\n00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.920\nWell, we don't need all that extra\nstuff to identify vulnerabilities,\n\n556\n00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.700\nwe just don't.\n\n557\n00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.780\nSo get rid of it, we don't want it and\nit's just going to complicate things.\n\n558\n00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.390\nWe just wanna take the stuff\nabout what system it is,\n\n559\n00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.430\nwhat vulnerabilities are present and\ngrab those things and\n\n560\n00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.410\nshoot it right over in the database and\ncall it a day.\n\n561\n00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.250\n>> Nice.\n\n562\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:20.770\n>> That's it.\n\n563\n00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.730\nThat's all we want and we can\naccomplish that with the simple XML.\n\n564\n00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.500\nWe are done at this point.\n\n565\n00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.150\nThe next step would be taking\nthat over into Metasploit.\n\n566\n00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.950\n>> Very good.\nAll right well, Sean, I'll tell you what,\n\n567\n00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:34.940\na lot of great information.\n\n568\n00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.050\nGot to see that vulnerability\nscanner in action,\n\n569\n00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.590\ngot to see the results\nof one of those scans.\n\n570\n00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.460\nAnd how to export that information\nout into an XML file that we can then\n\n571\n00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.905\ntake over to something like, Metasploit,\nand take further action on it.\n\n572\n00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:48.615\nI'm dying to see it,\n\n573\n00:31:48.615 --> 00:31:51.905\nI know everybody else out there is dying\nto see what we do with that information.\n\n574\n00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:54.065\nBut we're about out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n575\n00:31:54.065 --> 00:31:57.970\nSo Sean, anything else you wanna\nthrow in before we wrap this one up?\n\n576\n00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.708\n>> Yeah.\nStay tuned for the conclusion.\n\n577\n00:32:00.708 --> 00:32:02.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> How's that for\n\n578\n00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.350\na cliffhanger for everybody.\n\n579\n00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.530\nGets you out on the edge\nof your couch there.\n\n580\n00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.480\nSo, yes, exactly.\n\n581\n00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.430\nStay tuned for the next episode,\nwhere we are gonna take that information\n\n582\n00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.740\ninto Metasploit,\nshow you how to work with it there.\n\n583\n00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.760\nBut for now.\n\n584\n00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.000\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n585\n00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.790\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n586\n00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.087\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n587\n00:32:18.087 --> 00:32:24.040\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.460\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.530\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.420\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.020\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.290\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.140\nWe've got another exciting episode coming\nyour way on our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.390\nThis one's gonna be a continuation.\n\n10\n00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.840\nWe're continuing on with\nour vulnerability scanner.\n\n11\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.370\nSo if you missed the previous episodes,\nmake sure you go back and watch those.\n\n12\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.000\nWe kinda broke down what\nvulnerability scanners were.\n\n13\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.959\nWe took a look at a couple tools that,\n\n14\n00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.640\nI think you said, kinda almost\nqualify as a vulnerability scanner.\n\n15\n00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.750\nIn that last episode, though,\nwe broke out an expose.\n\n16\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.340\nAnd we ran a scan.\n\n17\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.880\nWe got to see the report\nthat it generated.\n\n18\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.250\nNow, we're getting ready to see how we can\ntie that information in with Metasploit.\n\n19\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.537\nCuz we got all this information back.\n\n20\n00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:57.790\nThe scanner, scan the system\nfound all these vulnerabilities.\n\n21\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.680\nNow, we wanna try to take that\ninformation over to Metasploit, and\n\n22\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.400\nfigure out what we can do with\nsome of those vulnerabilities.\n\n23\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.340\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right,\nis this is a situation\n\n24\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.580\nthat we are talking about Metasploit, so\nwe just spent all this time talking about\n\n25\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.630\nvulnerability scanners, and we saw how,\nin the expose in the previous segment,\n\n26\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.780\nhow it does its job, and\nwe can kinda ascertain,\n\n27\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.170\neven from what little we looked at,\nwe saw that it can do quite a bit.\n\n28\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.599\nBut now, the big question comes in is\nwe finished off with taking an XML,\n\n29\n00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.364\nthat's simple XML out of an expose.\n\n30\n00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:38.010\nWhat do we do with it?\n\n31\n00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.190\nWell, what we are gonna do with it is we\nare gonna figure out how we can take that\n\n32\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.770\nraw XML, and bring it right into\nthe Metasploit environment.\n\n33\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.720\nAnd it actually turns out that it's,\nthere's some steps involved there, but\n\n34\n00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.520\nit's not really all that difficult,\nonce you've kinda got the feel for it.\n\n35\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.770\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at just how that\n\n36\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.880\nis actually gonna be done.\n\n37\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.369\nSo the way I'm gonna take care of this for\nyou and show you how it's done is I have,\n\n38\n00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:19.565\nup here on my screen,\nI've got my Metasploit consult.\n\n39\n00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:22.664\nAgain, this is right here in Windows, so\n\n40\n00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:28.380\nI'm not really doing anything\nspecial here or different here.\n\n41\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.740\nOther than it being on Windows,\nthe console is gonna work the same here\n\n42\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.270\nas it would on the Linux side,\njust to reiterate that point.\n\n43\n00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.290\nSo once we have those points all clear,\nwhat\n\n44\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.110\nwe're gonna do is we are gonna see what,\nhow to actually get the database set up.\n\n45\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.880\nAnd then, how to bring those results in.\n\n46\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.920\nSo two step process.\n\n47\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.490\nObviously, were gonna get the database\nset up and ready to accept data, and\n\n48\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.660\nthen we got to bring the results in.\n\n49\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.660\nNow, what I've already done\nis I have set that up, but\n\n50\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.210\nI'm gonna show you the commands and\ntalk about what they're doing.\n\n51\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.680\nSo you could do the same thing.\n\n52\n00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.305\n>> Okay.\n\n53\n00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:10.610\n>> So just for the purpose of not standing\naround and making this like a really,\n\n54\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.713\nreally, really, really long segment,\nI have already gone through and\n\n55\n00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:16.204\nknocked that out for you.\n\n56\n00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:21.606\nAgain, we've set up the database,\nso the first thing we have,\n\n57\n00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:27.206\nand maybe we can kinda zoom that up\nhere a bit, is we have right there\n\n58\n00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:32.835\nat the bottom of the console we have\nthe db connect command in play.\n\n59\n00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:38.162\nThe db_connect is gonna tell us\nto connect to a database quite\n\n60\n00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:44.250\nfrankly it says it right up there,\nup top in our command list.\n\n61\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.240\nAnd that's the start.\n\n62\n00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.320\nAnd that command was, by the wa,y\nthe stuff that you when you typed help.\n\n63\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.940\nIt's the last group of commands\nthat tells you how to do stuff.\n\n64\n00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.277\nSo what we have here is\nwe have DB connect and\n\n65\n00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:58.080\nit's telling you the space\nof the database, and\n\n66\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.214\nthen after that is a name and a,\nyou tell it what the IP address is.\n\n67\n00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:05.056\nAnd I hope everyone knows what that is.\n\n68\n00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:08.129\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then, we have that, and\n\n69\n00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.700\nthen you have the Metasploit framework.\n\n70\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.116\nFolder where it's going.\n\n71\n00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:17.395\nSo if I was to go ahead and run this,\n\n72\n00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:22.385\nif I run it now on mine the way\nit is it would error out.\n\n73\n00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:26.437\nIt wouldn't be any sort of critical or\nnasty error.\n\n74\n00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:29.149\nIt would basically be one of those\nerrors that says, what are you doing,\n\n75\n00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.048\nthis is already setup.\n\n76\n00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:31.487\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're already connected, yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:36.710\n>> Yeah, I've already set it up, like I\nsaid, so that would be all taken care of.\n\n78\n00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.330\nThe next thing would be is\nthat once that's setup,\n\n79\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.286\nyou have to do bring in that information.\n\n80\n00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:48.645\nNow, that thing you wanna be careful with\nwhen you're doing this sort of thing is,\n\n81\n00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:53.164\nit's gonna, it's really,\nreally to get messed up on it, if you take\n\n82\n00:04:53.164 --> 00:04:57.780\na really close look at this, you can\nkinda see, there is a change to it.\n\n83\n00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.000\nThat command looks like\nit's changing just a bit.\n\n84\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.810\nYou can see the little slashes\nare going one way versus the other.\n\n85\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.478\nYeah, watch that because-\n>> Windows versus Linux right.\n\n86\n00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:09.754\n>> Yeah, that's gonna screw you up.\n\n87\n00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:10.311\nYeah.\n\n88\n00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:11.754\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you have those fun and\n\n89\n00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:12.936\ngames waiting for you right now.\n\n90\n00:05:12.936 --> 00:05:14.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n91\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.700\nyou're basically outside\nof the Metasploit console.\n\n92\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.550\nYou're gonna use the Windows way of\ndoing it inside the Metasploit console.\n\n93\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.360\nI don't care if it's Windows,\nguess what you're doing.\n\n94\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're gonna be using\n\n95\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.980\nthe Windows stuff.\n\n96\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.511\nIt's gonna mess you up and you're gonna\nsit there going, that command's right!\n\n97\n00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:37.629\nAnd grit your teeth and all that,\nand you're gonna figure out that you\n\n98\n00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:43.930\ndid slashes the wrong way and after all it\ngot over everything you're gonna be good.\n\n99\n00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.468\nBut anyway, after I replace\na couple keyboards in other words,\n\n100\n00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:50.759\ncuz I smashed the first two,\ncuz this command won't work.\n\n101\n00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.883\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:52.581\nExactly.\n\n103\n00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:55.773\nIt just gets calmed down,\ntake a shot of tequila or\n\n104\n00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:59.280\nwhatever it takes,\njust don't take it, just fix it.\n\n105\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.138\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:04.155\n>> Anyway, so what we've got, is we have,\n\n107\n00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.654\nonce we do the DB import, it will,\n\n108\n00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:12.900\ndepending on the size of the XML file it's\ngonna bring that all into the database.\n\n109\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.680\nIt really shouldn't take too long.\n\n110\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.720\nBut who knows?\n\n111\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.680\nIf you get a big enough XML\nfile it could take 5, 10,\n\n112\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.590\n20 minutes to do or\nmaybe even longer than that.\n\n113\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.592\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right, you scan a whole subnet and\n\n114\n00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:30.171\nhad a report that contained\ninformation on many many resources.\n\n115\n00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.150\nCould increase that length of import time.\n\n116\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.670\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n117\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.418\nSo be prepared for that, don't necessarily\nexpect it to just come right back and\n\n118\n00:06:39.418 --> 00:06:42.390\nsay, hey, guess what, it's all done.\n\n119\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.253\nIt may not do that, but\nit could depend on the resources,\n\n120\n00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:51.790\nyou've allocated the stuff like that\nto it, and just how much you scan.\n\n121\n00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.140\nSo once we've got that, I've got\neverything imported into the database,\n\n122\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.140\nso my next command actually check out\nthings is this one I have right here,\n\n123\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.580\nthis db_hosts, and with the -c and\n\n124\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.800\nyou can see it's telling it to\nput it in a column format, and\n\n125\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.560\nit's saying address services and\nvuls vulnerabilities.\n\n126\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.890\nSo what I can do is I can\njust hit Enter on that.\n\n127\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:26.327\nAnd there's only one host, so it's not\ngonna have this big shoot scroll by list,\n\n128\n00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:32.114\nbut it does have that being displayed\nright there, telling the address,\n\n129\n00:07:32.114 --> 00:07:36.716\nit found some services on there,\nvulnerability as well.\n\n130\n00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:37.993\nLook at that, 357.\n\n131\n00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:38.911\nSomeone's lying.\n\n132\n00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:40.419\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n133\n00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.938\n>> So you have that.\n\n134\n00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:48.241\nYou can also see up top,\nif you're paying close attention to it,\n\n135\n00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:52.640\nyou can see one of the things that\nI've been using this for a while.\n\n136\n00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.774\nAnd I still have a tendency to go back and\nuse some of these commands.\n\n137\n00:07:56.774 --> 00:08:00.828\nI did db_host As you can tell,\nit's telling me yeah, stop using that,\n\n138\n00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:01.502\nall right?\n\n139\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.406\nIt's like, [SOUND] smacking me\non the wrist going, stop it.\n\n140\n00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:05.089\n>> It's nice of them to\nshorten that up a little bit.\n\n141\n00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:06.623\nGet rid of that db_, that was nice.\n\n142\n00:08:06.623 --> 00:08:08.607\n>> Yeah, that was like three extra clicks.\n\n143\n00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:10.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or three extra button presses there.\n\n144\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.810\nSo it's gone through and it's displayed\nthat for me so, hey, that's okay.\n\n145\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.860\n>> So at this point you've taken that\nXML data that we got from Nexpose,\n\n146\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.030\nyou've imported it into that database.\n\n147\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.253\nAnd now you're just running queries\nagainst that database with these commands,\n\n148\n00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:28.099\nso db_host or host.\n\n149\n00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:32.324\nAnd you're saying, show me the host's IP\naddress, how many vulnerabilities, and\n\n150\n00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:33.799\nwhat was the other one there?\n\n151\n00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.320\nAnd how many services\nare running on there.\n\n152\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.590\n>> Yeah, you've got that right there.\n\n153\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.050\nYou will notice that it also,\nif you look up top on that list of stuff,\n\n154\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.530\nyou can see you can just put hosts loot,\nwhich is always a funny one.\n\n155\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.233\nI feel like I'm playing an RPG or\nsomething.\n\n156\n00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:51.180\n>> [LAUGH] right.\n\n157\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.140\n>> So you've got loot,\n\n158\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.140\nnotes if they're present, and then you see\nvulnerabilities, workspaces if you got it.\n\n159\n00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.010\nIt can display all that on its own.\n\n160\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.270\nHere we just said display the hosts\nwith this stuff next to it and\n\n161\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.460\njust call it a day.\n\n162\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.870\nSo we got that, we're happy.\n\n163\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.460\nOne host, I mean yeah,\nwe're not gonna whole big thing there, but\n\n164\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.020\nwe don't need a whole big deal\nto illustrate this point.\n\n165\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.720\nSo, you've got that,\nnow if that's not what you wanted,\n\n166\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.160\nwell, you can actually\nget more out of that.\n\n167\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.270\nThere is other stuff that can be extracted\n\n168\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.900\nfrom this database if you\nreally get down to it.\n\n169\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:39.823\nIs you can run this db_vulns command,\nI probably could just run vulns instead,\n\n170\n00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:44.194\nvulnerabilities and, whoop,\na lot of stuff scrolled by.\n\n171\n00:09:44.194 --> 00:09:46.772\n>> And that's the 357 vulnerabilities\nthat were in that database.\n\n172\n00:09:46.772 --> 00:09:47.457\n>> Indeed it is.\n\n173\n00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:48.457\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n174\n00:09:48.457 --> 00:09:52.236\nyou are seeing all those\nvulnerabilities listed out.\n\n175\n00:09:52.236 --> 00:09:54.045\nAnd you could go through that and\n\n176\n00:09:54.045 --> 00:09:59.300\nsee what's happening there with all those\nvulnerabilities if you really wanted to.\n\n177\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.054\nThis is probably not\nthe best way to view that.\n\n178\n00:10:02.054 --> 00:10:05.698\nBut you can see the stuff\nright in there saying,\n\n179\n00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:10.711\nhere's all the vulnerabilities I found,\nwith all the places you\n\n180\n00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:16.110\ncan reference that information if you\nreally want to take a look at it.\n\n181\n00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.826\nAt this point,\n\n182\n00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:23.820\nagain, this is probably not the way\nyou'd want to look at this data here.\n\n183\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.330\nThis is just kind of like\na sanity check for you.\n\n184\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.450\nIf more than anything to say, yeah,\nit brought the vulnerability stuff that we\n\n185\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.460\nsaw in the XML file, it brought all\nthat stuff over, so there it is.\n\n186\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.580\nYou could use this by copying and\npasting and\n\n187\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.440\ndoing stuff like that, but\nnot an efficient use of your time.\n\n188\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.950\nHowever, what you would use this for\nis if you\n\n189\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.950\nwant to maybe create some scripts and\nstuff like that inside of Metasploit.\n\n190\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:55.470\nYou could tell it to pick out certain\nthings out of here that it's found.\n\n191\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.490\nSo you've got the information to target\nspecific things, so that's what it would\n\n192\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:04.170\nbe for is more to run queries against\nthan actually viewing that data.\n\n193\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.881\nSo what we've got right now is,\n\n194\n00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:12.288\nwe have information in the database.\n\n195\n00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:16.320\nSo you could use this\nnow to do other stuff.\n\n196\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.970\nYou could take this data and\nfeed it into our other tools.\n\n197\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.930\nYou could tell some of our later ones,\nhey, run this tool and\n\n198\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:29.220\ngrab this out of the database and drop\nthat stuff in and run whatever against it.\n\n199\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:29.720\n>> Mm, nice.\n\n200\n00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.010\n>> So\nthat would be the next step from on that.\n\n201\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.190\nBut now we've actually got\nthat stuff out of Nexpose,\n\n202\n00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.390\nwe've pulled it all the way\nover in to Metasploit.\n\n203\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.670\nSo now, it really is actionable\nstuff right out of Metasploit.\n\n204\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.080\nAnd you saw really,\nit's not that hard to do.\n\n205\n00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.355\nThat was, within a few commands,\nI have the stuff in there.\n\n206\n00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:55.240\nAnd I've confirmed the stuff is in there.\n\n207\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.050\n>> Right, yeah, so now you could take\nother reports that you've run and\n\n208\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.930\njust keep adding them to\nthe same database, I guess?\n\n209\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.831\nYou can just start compiling\nall this information?\n\n210\n00:12:03.831 --> 00:12:04.750\n>> It's your choice.\n\n211\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.150\nYou can add it into this database,\nor you actually can tell it\n\n212\n00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.396\nto destroy that database and\ncreate a new one in its place.\n\n213\n00:12:13.396 --> 00:12:15.621\nAnd it does use that term, destroy.\n\n214\n00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:20.140\nSo it's really telling you,\nyou shall destroy this database.\n\n215\n00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.850\nSo you can do that.\n\n216\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.820\nYou can create an additional one in there\nif you want and bring the data into there.\n\n217\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.780\nIt's kind of your call.\n\n218\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.805\nBut you have all of those\noptions available to you.\n\n219\n00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:31.913\n>> Nice.\n\n220\n00:12:31.913 --> 00:12:37.338\n>> But hey, right here you've got\nyour stuff brought right across and\n\n221\n00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:40.490\nnow you've got targets to go against.\n\n222\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.060\nYou have things that you can specifically\ntarget and cause mayhem with.\n\n223\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.032\nSo we're on a good track right here.\n\n224\n00:12:50.032 --> 00:12:53.110\n>> Absolutely, we got to see that whole\nprocess all the way from beginning\n\n225\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.000\nto end where we ran\nthe vulnerability scanner.\n\n226\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.380\nWe got that information collected up,\nwe've dumped it out.\n\n227\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.044\nWe could have done a nice CEO-level or\nC-level report.\n\n228\n00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:04.161\nInstead we did an XML export of that data,\nand\n\n229\n00:13:04.161 --> 00:13:07.670\nthen we were able to pull it\ninto that Metasploit database.\n\n230\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.000\nAnd now we can take action\non it though Metasploit.\n\n231\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.260\nSo a great little demo there.\n\n232\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.120\n>> Yeah, so we've got our information\nbrought across, but let me kind of show\n\n233\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.960\nyou another way to accomplish that if\nyou really wanted to accomplish it.\n\n234\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.880\nWhat I'm gonna do is I have\na different way of doing it.\n\n235\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.060\nI have my Metasploit console over here.\n\n236\n00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.230\nAnd what I'm gonna do this time is,\ninstead of just saying\n\n237\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.450\nI am going to bring my Nexpose data over,\n\n238\n00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.910\nis there another way I can do that\nthat's maybe just a little quicker?\n\n239\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.715\nAnd the answer really is, yes,\nthere is a way to do it quicker.\n\n240\n00:13:45.715 --> 00:13:50.067\nAnd what that is, is actually running\n\n241\n00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:56.180\nNexpose right inside of Matasploit itself.\n\n242\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.080\nWhy do that extra step if you could\njust say, hey, just do it from here and\n\n243\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.570\nput it in the database.\n\n244\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.350\nI don't need to do all this extra stuff.\n\n245\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.690\nSo the way you do it, you run the load\nnexpose command, and it will go ahead and,\n\n246\n00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.660\nwell, load everything in for\nyou and say it's ready to go.\n\n247\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.750\nAnd once you've done load nexpose,\n\n248\n00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.530\nyou can check the status of\nthe connection in there, if you want,\n\n249\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.460\njust cuz it will go ahead and\nhave that running.\n\n250\n00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:35.100\nThen what you'll do is, there is a command\nright here called nexpose_connect.\n\n251\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.360\nAnd what that's gonna do\nis that's gonna connect\n\n252\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.370\nthat to the system,\nin this case, my host system.\n\n253\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.380\nAnd it's gonna connect to,\ncan see it's got my username.\n\n254\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.140\nMaybe we can zoom that up for you a bit\njust so you can get a better look at it.\n\n255\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.703\nYou can see it's got the nexpose_connect,\nand\n\n256\n00:14:56.703 --> 00:15:01.381\nthen it's got my user name,\nwhich is sporiyano.\n\n257\n00:15:01.381 --> 00:15:07.870\nIt's got a colon, and then it's got the\npassword in there, at sign, IP address.\n\n258\n00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.741\n>> Screen shot [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.700\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH],\nit's not my real password.\n\n260\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.110\nAll right, but it's got that in there.\n\n261\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.950\nAnd what you will do is, and this one I\n\n262\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.990\nmade a little bit of a typo on cuz I had a\nlittle fat fingers for there for a second.\n\n263\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.740\nWhat you'll do is you'll\nport number on there\n\n264\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.540\nto tell it what port Nexpose's\nrunning on that system.\n\n265\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.590\nAnd so it happens to be 3780 by default.\n\n266\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.020\nYou can change that, so\n\n267\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.320\ndon't just all of the sudden assume\nthat you can dump that number in.\n\n268\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.533\nAnd then the ok is there's an SSL\ncertificate that is used by\n\n269\n00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:52.517\nthe Nexpose website, or\nthat you'll have installed in your system.\n\n270\n00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:59.199\nThat says, heck, we've got to do\nthe SSL connections, and all that.\n\n271\n00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:03.582\nSo, the ok says,\ndo you want to accept that certificate and\n\n272\n00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:05.519\nGoes ahead and does that.\n\n273\n00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:10.393\nOnce you've got all that jazz\ndone you can start running\n\n274\n00:16:10.393 --> 00:16:15.170\nall your different types of scans and\nstuff like that.\n\n275\n00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.370\nYou could create a site and\na scan and all that from there.\n\n276\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.490\nBut the thing is is that I'll let\nyou worry about how to create\n\n277\n00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.290\nthe scans and all that.\n\n278\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.390\nIt's just simple command-line stuff,\nand all that, to do.\n\n279\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:32.520\nBut once you have that connection\ndone to it, you load Nexpose.\n\n280\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.920\nYou know what an Nexpose does now.\n\n281\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.420\nAll you gotta do is, I'm connected to it,\nI have my user account.\n\n282\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.410\nJust think of it as you\nare talking in Nexpose,\n\n283\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.010\nyou've logged in, now that you're logged\nin with that username and password.\n\n284\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.550\nNow you can go in and start telling\nit how you want the scan to work.\n\n285\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:56.540\nAnd pipe your whatever in, your IP\naddresses, your range or whatever in, and\n\n286\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.040\ngo to town with it, and it will start\nputting that right in a database for you.\n\n287\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.790\n>> So no report generated in this at all,\nit's just going right into the database.\n\n288\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.470\n>> Yeah, it'll go directly into the\ndatabase for you, so you'll have all that\n\n289\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:15.270\ninformation just ready to go and\nyou do what you need to with it.\n\n290\n00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:21.780\nSo in a few steps you can just\nreally quickly get stuff done.\n\n291\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.570\nAnd for the record, in Nexpose obviously,\n\n292\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:31.150\nwith the two being from the same vendor,\nit has, they created that Nexpose module\n\n293\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.720\nthat gets loaded right into Metasploit to\nmake this all nice and simple and easy.\n\n294\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.690\nThere's a third party one\nthat was created for Nessus.\n\n295\n00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.980\nSo Nessus has the ability to do that too.\n\n296\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.870\nThe commands obviously won't be identical.\n\n297\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.655\nIt'll be the same concept,\nbut not identical.\n\n298\n00:17:48.655 --> 00:17:54.565\nBut you will have a little bridge module\nthat you can load in that will say,\n\n299\n00:17:54.565 --> 00:17:59.145\nokay well, you can load this in and\nit will talk right out to Nessus and\n\n300\n00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.915\nallow you to do whatever\nyou want to at that point.\n\n301\n00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.865\nSo, really really cool to do that.\n\n302\n00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:06.445\nOther vulnerability scanners,\n\n303\n00:18:06.445 --> 00:18:11.735\nthat's kind of why we tend to\ntalk about Nexpose and Nessus,\n\n304\n00:18:11.735 --> 00:18:17.650\nbecause those ones they integrate pretty\nwell with one really well of course,\n\n305\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:23.130\nthe other one it integrates\nyou pretty well also.\n\n306\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.180\nBut the reason why we talk about those\nones is because you can not only import\n\n307\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.125\ndata over but there's this integration\nwith the Metasploit that we can do.\n\n308\n00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.840\nAnd one being from the vendor directly,\nand\n\n309\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.320\nthe other one being a third party\ncreated said hey, why not us?\n\n310\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.840\nThe other ones, hey again,\nyou're my Hutch Mayberry.\n\n311\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.190\nI can't speak to if they have that module\nthat will allow you to do the stuff\n\n312\n00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.330\ninside of Metasploit but\ndoesn't mean you're stuck.\n\n313\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.990\nWe already know that if you\ncan export out simple XML,\n\n314\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:57.830\nall you got to do is just jump\nthrough a few number of hoops\n\n315\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.390\nto bring XML in into the database itself,\nand you're still good.\n\n316\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.230\n>> Nice.\n\n317\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.950\nSo very flexible and we've got a lot of\nchoices of how we want to set it all up,\n\n318\n00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.190\nwhat tools we want to use to perform this.\n\n319\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.910\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n320\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.270\nA lot of flexibility and power here.\n\n321\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:21.800\nI just showed you two ways to bring\ninformation between two products,\n\n322\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.920\nto move information between two\nproducts in a few number of steps.\n\n323\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.620\nAnd neither one of them, at least in my\nopinion, [LAUGH] was all that difficult.\n\n324\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.180\nI know it's easy for me to say that, it's\nnot that difficult, but It really isn't.\n\n325\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.910\nThe first time you do it, it's gonna\nbe kind of a little unusual to you.\n\n326\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.560\nBut just kind of focus what's going on\nwith it, and you'll see there's a definite\n\n327\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.430\nlogical structure to it, makes sense, and\nyou can do it pretty quickly, and be done.\n\n328\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.160\nAfter that, it's just type type\ntype stuff in, and you're done.\n\n329\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.510\nSo yeah, that's just the way\nyou do it with those two.\n\n330\n00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.320\n>> Very nice, very nice.\n\n331\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.010\nAll right, well Sean,\n\n332\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.330\nwe saw a bunch of good information\nabout vulnerability scanners.\n\n333\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.500\nAny others that we should\nworry about besides,\n\n334\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.510\nI mean I know there's other choices.\n\n335\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.080\nIf we want that tight integration,\nan expose, or\n\n336\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.750\nNessus if we wanna use\nthat third party plugin.\n\n337\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.120\nOther scanners we should worry about?\n\n338\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.540\n>> Well, there's just,\n\n339\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.020\nit seems to be an endless stream when you\nget down to it of vulnerability scanners.\n\n340\n00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.810\nWe have all these ones.\n\n341\n00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.440\nWe have community ones, we have pro ones,\n\n342\n00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.250\nwe have these super deluxe whatever\nversions you wanna call them.\n\n343\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.980\nYou have them all across the spectrum.\n\n344\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.400\nSo you can go on and\non about vulnerability scanners and\n\n345\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.090\ntheir capabilities.\n\n346\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.040\nEveryone seems to have their favorite.\n\n347\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.370\nThere's a few that are talked\nabout all the time.\n\n348\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.550\nYou will hear Nessus come up all the time.\n\n349\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.900\nYou will hear Nexpose\ncome up a lot as well.\n\n350\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.390\nBut there's plenty of other ones.\n\n351\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:56.920\nWe saw them in both the CEH and\nwe saw it in the forensics course as well.\n\n352\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.930\nBut there's even ones outside of that.\n\n353\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.370\nSo, as far as specific concerns\nwith any of them, I would have\n\n354\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.480\nto say first of all,\n\n355\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.555\nI can't tell you everything with every one\nof them, that would just be impossible.\n\n356\n00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:19.170\nI'd be lying if I said that, however, I\nwould tell you that most of them will give\n\n357\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:25.330\nyou some way of exporting the data out,\nand that's the key thing.\n\n358\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.430\nI could care less what scanner you have.\n\n359\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:33.850\nIf you can get it out to that pure\nunadultered XML, you're probably in very,\n\n360\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.370\nvery good shape that you\ncan get it into Metasploit.\n\n361\n00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.070\nMetasploit is pretty flexible in that.\n\n362\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:46.640\nMetasploit will even, we use XML for\nhere, it even has the ability if there's\n\n363\n00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.150\na structure there that it recognizes,\nIt will basically auto detect it and\n\n364\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.740\nsay yeah, I know exactly what that is and\nbe able to work with it.\n\n365\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.875\nSo it's pretty cool in that respect.\n\n366\n00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:02.720\nSo as long as that vulnerability scanner,\nthose third party ones,\n\n367\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.010\nwhatever you want to call them.\n\n368\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.060\nThose other one's if you have a favorite,\n\n369\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.620\nas long as it has a standardized\nformat of some sort.\n\n370\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.710\nHopefully it's XML that's\nthe easiest by far,\n\n371\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.860\nif you can get it into one of those\nstandard formats though you're probably\n\n372\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:22.580\ngood at getting it right into Metasploit\nand being able to do whatever with it so.\n\n373\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.110\nJust keep that in mind,\nno matter what you're doing.\n\n374\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.170\nIf you are counting on doing\nan integration with Metasploit,\n\n375\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.190\nmake sure you have some\nmechanism to export this\n\n376\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.730\nstuff out before you fully commit to it.\n\n377\n00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.470\nCuz you don't wanna be\nkind of up the creek and\n\n378\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.260\nhave to do all these weird scripts and\neverything to transform the data.\n\n379\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.520\nYou guys have been there,\nI don't wanna go there, and\n\n380\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.110\nI don't know if you wanna go there,\nbut if you wanna save time make sure\n\n381\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.250\nit's got the ability to do something\nthat Metasploit understands.\n\n382\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.220\n>> All right Sean, so another great\nepisode dealing with our vulnerability\n\n383\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.810\nscanners, a lot of good information there.\n\n384\n00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.750\nSeeing how take that information\nthat these scanners are providing,\n\n385\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.018\nthings like Nessus and Nexpose and\nbringing it right into Metasploit so\n\n386\n00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:09.830\nwe can then take advantage\nof that information.\n\n387\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.880\nSo good info there, Sean.\n\n388\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.120\nWe're running out of time for\nthis particular episode, so\n\n389\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.210\nwe're going to call it.\n\n390\n00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.610\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n391\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.780\n>> And I'm Sean Oreano.\n\n392\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.236\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n393\n00:23:20.236 --> 00:23:20.736\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.668\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:16.620\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.130\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.380\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.240\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880\ncontinuing on with our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.173\nAnd in this particular episode,\n\n10\n00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:28.676\nwe're gonna continue talking\nabout vulnerability scanners.\n\n11\n00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:33.099\nBut this time Sean, we're gonna go away\nfrom those general purpose vulnerability\n\n12\n00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.510\nscanners, and hit some targeted scanners.\n\n13\n00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.410\nIs that right?\n\n14\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.970\n>> Yeah, that's the idea here is that yes,\n\n15\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.820\nwe've gone through kinda the low end stuff\nif you will, with things like Netcat.\n\n16\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.100\nThen we moved up to Nexpose and Nessus.\n\n17\n00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.910\nBut those all are tools that really\naren't quite exactly fully in Metasploit.\n\n18\n00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.258\nMetasploit has some stuff to\nbring to the table as well, so\n\n19\n00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:03.275\nwe wanna do is start setting the stage for\n\n20\n00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:09.480\nmoving up to the next point of finding and\nexploiting these vulnerabilities.\n\n21\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.900\nSo the objective here is to see okay,\nwell, what can you\n\n22\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.210\ntarget in the product and\nreally start causing mischief with?\n\n23\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.520\nSo that's where we're at.\n\n24\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.360\n>> All right, well, Sean,\n\n25\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.220\nthese are scanners then that I'm\ngonna find within Metasploit itself?\n\n26\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.840\nI don't have to go download them or\nanything like that?\n\n27\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.590\n>> Yeah, these are ones that\nare right in the Metasploit product.\n\n28\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.724\nThey are ones that are just ready to go.\n\n29\n00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:40.400\nWe have looked at when we started doing\nour searches and doing the show exploits\n\n30\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.070\nand show, our various things in the\nproducts, we saw big long lists of them.\n\n31\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.770\nAnd now it's time to start bringing some\nof those to bear to see exactly what that\n\n32\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.860\nmeans to define these holes,\nwhat can you do with those holes?\n\n33\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.727\nSo these are very targeted vulnerability\nscanners that tell you that they're there,\n\n34\n00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.580\nand then we are going to see if we\ncan actually do anything with them,\n\n35\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.140\nso that's where we're headed.\n\n36\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.290\n>> Nice, so target.\n\n37\n00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.140\nWhen you say they're very targeted they\nare looking for vulnerabilities like in\n\n38\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.670\na specific program, or application or\nprotocol, that kind of thing?\n\n39\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.310\n>> Any of those, yes.\n\n40\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.640\n>> Wow.\n>> They could be looking for\n\n41\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.580\nany one of those.\n\n42\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.100\nIt's just a question of when you do\nyour assessments of a system and\n\n43\n00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.160\nyou're doing all these\nvulnerability scans and\n\n44\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.750\nall that, the previous ones,\nyou find openings.\n\n45\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.740\nNow we're gonna say, okay,\nlet's target one specifically and\n\n46\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.180\nsee what's there and see if we\ncan actually do anything with it.\n\n47\n00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.880\nSo we're combining that\nthe idea of having an exploit,\n\n48\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.300\nand then even gonna bring\nin dropping off a payload.\n\n49\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.280\nSo two things here.\n\n50\n00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.730\nReally kind of neat to be\nmoving into this territory.\n\n51\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.400\n>> Nice, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.060\nWell, let's take a look and\nsee what we got then.\n\n53\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.481\n>> Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna look at two different things here.\n\n54\n00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:02.047\nWe're gonna look at seeing if we can\nfind a vulnerability in VNC, and\n\n55\n00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:07.840\nthen we're gonna see if we can find a\nvulnerability in the FTP product in here.\n\n56\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.160\nAnd the way we're gonna do that is, let's\njust kinda quickly go through how we would\n\n57\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.070\ndecide on this or how we might target\nthis is I would do something like, and\n\n58\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.040\nI completed this for you ahead of time\nhere so we didn't have to wait for\n\n59\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.960\nit, but it's just a simple NMap scan.\n\n60\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.450\nI went through and ran NMap with\njust some quick stuff in there.\n\n61\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.811\nDon't do a SYN scan, don't do any pings,\njust have at, and it went through and\n\n62\n00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:41.390\nran the last, and you can see it's\ngot plenty of vulnerabilities.\n\n63\n00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.020\nObviously on this Metasploitable\nsystem we've got no shortage of those.\n\n64\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.250\nSo, I see FTP in there, I see a whole\nbunch of other stuff in there.\n\n65\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.270\nGo down the list.\n\n66\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.020\nI mean, there's VNC, X11, so\nwe've got a bunch of stuff,\n\n67\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.850\nand really, just about everything\non this list in some way, shape, or\n\n68\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.760\nform, has something in\nMetasploit that can nail it.\n\n69\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.460\nIt's just a question of is it something\nthat you can use to deploy a payload.\n\n70\n00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.960\nSo remember, you can have an exploit and\n\n71\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.980\nthen you can have a payload\nthat it drops off.\n\n72\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.790\nSo you've gotta find that you have that\ncombination that can do something for\n\n73\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.770\nyou cuz you may not be able to\ndo something with everything.\n\n74\n00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.214\nSo I have gone through this list and\nI've found stuff that I want.\n\n75\n00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:35.440\nLike I said, FTP and I'm gonna see if\nI can do something to mess with VNC.\n\n76\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.360\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n77\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.710\nI see you've run your port scan,\nyou see what services or\n\n78\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.890\nprotocols are running on that system,\n\n79\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.830\nnow you're going to get your targeted\nscanner out and really hammer on that\n\n80\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.460\none particular port or protocol to see if\nyou can find any vulnerabilities there.\n\n81\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.380\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n82\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.514\nSo, like I said, I already decided\nthat I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n83\n00:04:54.514 --> 00:04:59.981\nchoose to do FTP and\n\n84\n00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:05.000\nVNC, so\nI've got those two already ready to go.\n\n85\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.750\nSo okay, got my scan and so\n\n86\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.750\nwhat I'm gonna do is I have to\nmake things easy on all of us, so\n\n87\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.632\nyou don't have to guys-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n88\n00:05:14.632 --> 00:05:16.803\n>> Watch me struggle with typing.\n\n89\n00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:24.740\nI have gone ahead and I have brought\na couple things here to bear pre-loaded.\n\n90\n00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.790\nI have this one, the first one,\nI'm gonna do use scanner and VNC,\n\n91\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.950\nand then VNC for no authentication\nis what that plugin's gonna do.\n\n92\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.370\nSo I'm gonna load that.\n\n93\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.390\nWhat this is doing is this will check to\nsee if, I mean, I see VNC there loaded.\n\n94\n00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.443\nAnd I'm thinking in my head, well,\n\n95\n00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:48.960\nbased on stuff I've seen in my\nother vulnerabilities scans and\n\n96\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.100\nthings that are open, it seems like this\nperson may be kind of asleep at the wheel.\n\n97\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.730\nAnd I see that this VNC is open,\nmaybe I did a banner grab against it and\n\n98\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.550\nfound a version, we can already do that,\nwe have that well within our skills.\n\n99\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.250\nSo I'm gonna use this one to see well,\nlet's see if this person's got anything\n\n100\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.330\nopen on this box that may\nbe of help to me with VNC,\n\n101\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.850\nso I see,\nI've got this actual scanner loaded.\n\n102\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.145\nI am gonna go through and do an info on\nit, and I'm gonna look up the info info\n\n103\n00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:34.645\nand same thing as yesterday,\nI look at it and I see.\n\n104\n00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:37.972\nI see my R host, R port, and threads.\n\n105\n00:06:37.972 --> 00:06:45.135\nWhat I want to do is I will set\nmy R hosts to my target system,\n\n106\n00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:49.972\nwhich is that Metasploitable system.\n\n107\n00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:53.462\nSo I'll do 192.168.245.\n\n108\n00:06:53.462 --> 00:06:57.342\nAnd then it is 132, so\nI will go ahead and hit that.\n\n109\n00:06:57.342 --> 00:07:00.260\nAnd it says our hosts.\n\n110\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.900\nSo okay, good, our host has been\nset to that, that's what we want.\n\n111\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:11.580\nNow I will do a run on that and hit Enter,\nand it's saying hey, guess what?\n\n112\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.570\nIt's got a VNC version there listed,\n\n113\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.140\nit's saying she's the standard VNC\nsecurity, so nothing special there.\n\n114\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.750\nSo, looks kind of interesting.\n\n115\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.470\nWe've got some stuff in place that\n\n116\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.220\nthe building blocks are there, but\nnow the big question is that, this guy's\n\n117\n00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.820\ndesigned it to help you out to say well\nokay, the building blocks are there,\n\n118\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.370\nthis person may very well be using the\ndefault authentication that comes with it.\n\n119\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.850\nThey haven't set it, essentially\nwhat amounts to a blank password.\n\n120\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.490\nSo let's see what that means.\n\n121\n00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:56.903\nThis is just one way you can use a scanner\nto find something and exploit it.\n\n122\n00:07:56.903 --> 00:08:00.445\nSo, very targeted on that service.\n\n123\n00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:05.245\nI did NMAP, found VNC Then I really\nzoomed in with this scanner inside of\n\n124\n00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:09.406\nMetasploit to say, what did it find and\nit's saying, yeah,\n\n125\n00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:15.440\nall systems are go we found a host it's\nthere there's the version, hey looks good.\n\n126\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.921\nSo what I'm gonna do is I will go over\nto one of my other consoles here,\n\n127\n00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:22.631\nlet me go to this one.\n\n128\n00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:30.250\nAnd I'm just gonna say at my console,\nKali actually has a built-in VNC client,\n\n129\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.845\njust like if you install\nMetasploit in Windows,\n\n130\n00:08:34.845 --> 00:08:39.660\nit actually has a VNC client here as well.\n\n131\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.050\nIt's nothing special or unique.\n\n132\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.685\nSo I will type in VNC Viewer.\n\n133\n00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:50.548\nHit Enter, and you can see that\nlittle box popped up and says, okay,\n\n134\n00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:53.100\nwhat VNC server do you want to talk to?\n\n135\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.851\nSo I just type in 192.168.245.132,\nhit Enter.\n\n136\n00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.451\nIt asks what the password is,\nand the default password for\n\n137\n00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:03.890\na lot of these is just password.\n\n138\n00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:09.489\nI hit Enter, and boom,\nI'm seeing this person's desktop or\n\n139\n00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:14.441\nhis clients, so I can go here and\njust scroll around and\n\n140\n00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:17.687\nstart doing some mischief in here.\n\n141\n00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:20.485\nI'm seeing stuff right there\non that's person's screen.\n\n142\n00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:24.943\nSo there's your VNC one\na couple quick steps.\n\n143\n00:09:24.943 --> 00:09:27.852\nFound it, confirmed the version, and\n\n144\n00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:31.655\n[SOUND] right on in without\nreally doing much at all.\n\n145\n00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:35.377\n>> If your basic port scan showed\nyou that that port was opened and\n\n146\n00:09:35.377 --> 00:09:40.246\nit thought it was VNC, then you used your\nspecific scanner to verify that, hey,\n\n147\n00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:44.940\nthat is VNC, here's your version number,\nit's definitely listening.\n\n148\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.100\nAnd then, you just use\nMetasploit's built-in VNC client,\n\n149\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.650\nthat VNC viewer, to try to connect to it.\n\n150\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.444\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n151\n00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:52.848\n>> Use the default password.\n\n152\n00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:54.207\n>> Exactly.\nIt didn't take much.\n\n153\n00:09:54.207 --> 00:09:57.039\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You blink, you miss that.\n\n154\n00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:00.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's that close or\n\n155\n00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.890\nthat fast to do something like that.\n\n156\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.020\nThat's pretty cool when you look at it.\n\n157\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:13.404\nLet's just go ahead and clear that off,\nso we got the VNC stuff done.\n\n158\n00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:20.829\nLet's take a look at another one,\nwhich is the FTP issue.\n\n159\n00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:25.915\nSo in this case,\nnotice what I'm doing here is that\n\n160\n00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:30.425\nI no longer using just a scanner anymore.\n\n161\n00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:33.155\nI bumped it up a bit and instead of using,\n\n162\n00:10:33.155 --> 00:10:38.062\nsaying use and in space scanner,\nwhat I'm doing is I'm saying use exploit.\n\n163\n00:10:38.062 --> 00:10:39.732\nAnd it's under the Unix stuff.\n\n164\n00:10:39.732 --> 00:10:42.507\nUnix, Linux,\nsame type of thing for us here.\n\n165\n00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:47.301\nFTP, and then this VSFTP.\n\n166\n00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:51.463\nWell, I could have gone through and\ndone, again, a banner grab against that.\n\n167\n00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:55.940\nAnd if I had, I would have seen\nthat it was running this as\n\n168\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.750\nthe actual FTP product on\nthe site to provide FTP services.\n\n169\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.950\nSo I'm assuming that\nwe've already done that,\n\n170\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.740\nthat we did net CAD or Nmap, or\nwhatever your weapon of choice is there.\n\n171\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.340\nWe did that and\n\n172\n00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:14.185\nwe retrieved that information saying\nit is that particular FTP client.\n\n173\n00:11:14.185 --> 00:11:18.376\nSo what I am gonna do is, I am gonna\nhit Enter on that, it loads it in,\n\n174\n00:11:18.376 --> 00:11:19.273\nit says good.\n\n175\n00:11:19.273 --> 00:11:24.410\nIt's got it loaded, so\nI will type in my info on it,\n\n176\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.548\nand so\nthere's my info on this particular plugin,\n\n177\n00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:34.326\nso what I'm gonna do is,\nand notice by the way,\n\n178\n00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:39.472\nthere are some things that\nare of interest in here.\n\n179\n00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:43.930\nPay attention to the stuff that's in info.\n\n180\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.780\nUnless you've used that plugin a lot,\ndon't get caught in something that's gonna\n\n181\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.550\ncause you to wanna punch through\nyour screen or something like that,\n\n182\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.400\ncuz this could be one of those cases.\n\n183\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.310\nNotice for all the different plugins and\nstuff like we've been using,\n\n184\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.368\nwhen we have used them a lot of times,\nI've been typing in set RHOSTS,\n\n185\n00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:03.740\nlook at this one, it says set RHOSTS.\n\n186\n00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.173\nDon't get screwed up on that and\ntype RHOSTS, because it will sit there and\n\n187\n00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:10.463\njust laugh at you and say,\nthat isn't defined, that isn't defined.\n\n188\n00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:14.366\nYou'll keep typing it in, and keep typing\nit in, and it'll keep saying not defined,\n\n189\n00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:17.962\nnot defined until you look and go in dot,\nwhatever, put plurals in a singular.\n\n190\n00:12:17.962 --> 00:12:22.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't have that issue.\n\n191\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.450\nSo I've got RHOSTS, you can see on there\nis already set, because I went ahead and\n\n192\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.580\njust set that for us to kinda\nspeed things up just a little bit.\n\n193\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.650\nSo I've got that being set.\n\n194\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.230\nYou can see the RPORT.\n\n195\n00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.890\nIf FTP was running on a different port,\n\n196\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.000\nyou just go set RPORT and\nput an incident to that.\n\n197\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.500\nSo easy, easy, easy one in there.\n\n198\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.470\nSo we got that first part of that set,\nbut again, this is not a scanner.\n\n199\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.310\nThis is an exploit module.\n\n200\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.050\nThis has moved out of just being\na simple scanner; it's gonna say,\n\n201\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.340\nwell, this vulnerability is there.\n\n202\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.100\nSo how can you use it?\n\n203\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.790\nSo we want to do that.\n\n204\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.820\nSo I'm gonna say show payload in here.\n\n205\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.700\nIt should be payloads.\n\n206\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.710\nIt's gonna say, there's a payload it has.\n\n207\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.140\nIt can deliver this to a system.\n\n208\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:28.600\nSo remember, exploit latches in there, and\nthen the payload is what's dropped off.\n\n209\n00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.420\nSo it has a payload in this exploit that's\ngonna be dropped off in that system.\n\n210\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.045\nThis one happens to have one.\n\n211\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:38.005\nOther ones could have multiple\npayloads that it can drop off.\n\n212\n00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:40.245\nSo that's what you're seeing here.\n\n213\n00:13:40.245 --> 00:13:43.755\n>> And it already knows what\nvulnerability, what exploit you wanna use,\n\n214\n00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:46.600\ncuz you're in that tool,\nyou've loaded that exploit up.\n\n215\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.260\nAnd then, we do show payloads that's\nfiltering that down to show you\n\n216\n00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.000\njust the payloads that can be used with\nalong with that particular exploit.\n\n217\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.070\n>> Exactly, it's intelligent enough\nto do that, and that can really\n\n218\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.960\nbreak it down and say to text it, and say,\nthis is the payloads that you can use and\n\n219\n00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.560\njust show you that, so it's definitely\nsmart enough to pick that up,\n\n220\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.480\nand so we're seeing the one that\nit's saying it can use with it.\n\n221\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.660\nIf it doesn't know, it will allow you\nto say, which one do you want to use?\n\n222\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.530\nIt'll show you a list, and\n\n223\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.040\nthen you get to choose and\nkinda go down your own path with that.\n\n224\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.357\nSomething else let me just point out\nbefore I do this last little bit here,\n\n225\n00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:27.934\nnotice that description.\n\n226\n00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:32.658\nThat description is giving you some\ninformation, saying blaby blah,\n\n227\n00:14:32.658 --> 00:14:38.023\nthis is what it does, but says this\nback door is removed on July 3rd, 2011.\n\n228\n00:14:38.023 --> 00:14:40.990\nMetasploitable has been around for\na while.\n\n229\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.360\nJust because you find something and\n\n230\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.270\nhave an exploit for it doesn't mean it's\ngonna work, don't always assume that.\n\n231\n00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.100\nIt doesn't say Metasploit's pretty\npowerful, but if they patched it and\n\n232\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.410\ntaking care of it doesn't mean it's there,\nbut again, close to 2011,\n\n233\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.580\nJune 30th,\nwe're a little over four years afterwords.\n\n234\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.153\nCome on.\nPeople are still getting vulnerable to\n\n235\n00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:01.034\ncode read in.\n\n236\n00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:03.121\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do I need to really say that this is\n\n237\n00:15:03.121 --> 00:15:03.930\ngonna happen?\n\n238\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.480\nThis is not gonna work anymore.\n\n239\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.100\n>> Right.\n\n240\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.630\nSo there might be a patch out, but\n\n241\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.600\nwe're just gonna find people\nthat haven't patched for it yet.\n\n242\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.205\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which I'm sure there's plenty of.\n\n243\n00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:12.343\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n244\n00:15:12.343 --> 00:15:13.860\nThat's exactly right.\n\n245\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.290\nSo what we're gonna do is we wanna\nuse that particular payload.\n\n246\n00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:24.607\nSo the way I use that payload\nis I use the set command,\n\n247\n00:15:24.607 --> 00:15:28.637\nand I do a Cmd, Unix, Interact.\n\n248\n00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:30.216\nSo I got that.\n\n249\n00:15:30.216 --> 00:15:30.971\nBoom.\n\n250\n00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:33.375\nI got that one.\n\n251\n00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:37.670\nDid I go through and\nmake a little mistake there someplace?\n\n252\n00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.740\nI think I did which I\ntyped it in previously.\n\n253\n00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.720\nI'll just cheat since I typed it in.\n\n254\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.380\nJust we went ahead and\nset payload is what I screwed up on.\n\n255\n00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.770\nSo set payload equal to that.\n\n256\n00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.069\nAnd by the way, there is a set,\nthere's also an unset command.\n\n257\n00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:03.670\nSo if you need to clear something out,\nyou can do that too.\n\n258\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:09.235\nAnd then, for some of them there's\nalso a set g As one keyword,\n\n259\n00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:12.740\nand that's a global variable.\n\n260\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.149\nSo you do have that available,\nso be aware of that.\n\n261\n00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:18.911\nAll right, so if I go to my info now,\n\n262\n00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.980\nI got all the good stuff\nlooking like it's in place.\n\n263\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.759\nAll I got to do left now\nis just do my exploit.\n\n264\n00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:31.340\nYou hit that and\nyou just kind of sit here and wait.\n\n265\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.040\nIt says found shell, hm, okay.\n\n266\n00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.815\nIt went ahead, it says open it up.\n\n267\n00:16:35.815 --> 00:16:39.530\nIt found the shell,\nit's got some other stuff in there.\n\n268\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.900\nWell, command, so it's a Unix system.\n\n269\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.310\nYou can do something like uname -a,\n\n270\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.640\nhit Enter and yep,\nwe are definitely attached to that system.\n\n271\n00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.180\nIt just opened up a shell, it pushed\nit right in, found the exploit and VNC.\n\n272\n00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.648\nDropped off the payload,\nit opened up a shell in there,\n\n273\n00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.390\nand I'm interacting with the system.\n\n274\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.930\n>> Wow.\n>> Notice I didn't, as opposed to what\n\n275\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:05.322\nwe did earlier with Netcat, Netcat I\nhad a listener deployed there already.\n\n276\n00:17:05.322 --> 00:17:06.777\nYou did not see me do this and\n\n277\n00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:11.000\nI promise you I was not running something\nhere of screen going, I got them now.\n\n278\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.260\nNo, that Metasploit\nsystem is sitting there,\n\n279\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.395\nI haven't touched it, it's just been on.\n\n280\n00:17:18.395 --> 00:17:24.281\nAnd I just did the scan,\nfound a potential vulnerability,\n\n281\n00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:31.006\nwent through a banner grab,\nwhich we didn't do, do a banner grab.\n\n282\n00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:36.839\nAnd then just ran this exploit and said\nlet's see if we can exploit a hole there\n\n283\n00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:42.600\nand then push a system-specific payload\noff in there and have it open it up.\n\n284\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.150\nAnd you saw, right here in real time,\nhit Enter and\n\n285\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.770\nit opened it up and I've got a shell.\n\n286\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.540\nNow I'm just starting to\npipe commands over and-\n\n287\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.279\n>> Pretty much whatever\n\n288\n00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.104\nyou want at that point.\n\n289\n00:17:53.104 --> 00:17:56.260\n>> Yeah, I've got power at this point.\n\n290\n00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.910\nAnd now you can do your privileged\nescalations and all that good stuff there.\n\n291\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.320\nSo this was really kinda to\nshow you just where it's going.\n\n292\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.990\nIn this whole section we just went\nfrom doing vulnerability scans,\n\n293\n00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.150\nsimple ones at the beginning, to more\ncomplex and increasingly more complex.\n\n294\n00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.090\nThen we brought the stuff into Metasploit.\n\n295\n00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.320\nAnd now we got to the point where\nwe're using the actual scanning\n\n296\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.110\nwhich we did with VNC first.\n\n297\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.530\nWe did scanning and\nfound it and connected to it.\n\n298\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.630\nAnd then we just went\nthrough here instead of VNC,\n\n299\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.220\nwhich they left it with\na bad configuration.\n\n300\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.310\nHere I found a real vulnerability there\n\n301\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.240\nthat I leveraged to push\nmy way onto that system.\n\n302\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.940\nSo we've come a long way.\n\n303\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.980\nSo we've already gone from all\nthe early phases of scanning,\n\n304\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.880\nall the way on through to vulnerability,\nto just exploiting those holes in there.\n\n305\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.770\nAnd so\nwe're gonna be doing more of that, but\n\n306\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.940\nit shows you how it\nproceeds right on through.\n\n307\n00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.070\n>> Yeah, that's impressive.\n\n308\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.830\nMetasploit made it really easy to do.\n\n309\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.650\nYou didn't have to get anything\non that other system first.\n\n310\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.060\nHe was able to do it all remotely and\n\n311\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.640\nreally take advantage\nof that vulnerability.\n\n312\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.869\nAnd now you've got a shell which\nyou can run anything you want.\n\n313\n00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:06.520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, that is impressive.\n\n314\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.300\nWell, Sean,\nlot of great information there.\n\n315\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.180\nWe've taken a really good look at\na lot of different types of scanners,\n\n316\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.210\ndifferent levels of scanners.\n\n317\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.670\nPolish it off with using\nthose specific scanners and\n\n318\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.080\nthen actually dumping a payload\nover there on the remote system.\n\n319\n00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.300\nAnything else you wanna throw in\non this one before we wrap it up?\n\n320\n00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.932\n>> Nothing except that was cool,\nwasn't it?\n\n321\n00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.615\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:29.452\n>> I would have to agree with you there,\n\n323\n00:19:29.452 --> 00:19:30.078\nthat was pretty darn cool.\n\n324\n00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:34.154\n>> It's always cool, I really, I don't\ncare how long I've been doing this,\n\n325\n00:19:34.154 --> 00:19:38.677\nthere's something cool about what you just\nsaw there, I still get, oh is it gonna,\n\n326\n00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.350\nI get all excited and all that.\n\n327\n00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.475\nMaybe this little geeky thing, I don't\nknow, about watching that little pause,\n\n328\n00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.471\nand all the sudden, pop!\n\n329\n00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:46.985\nIt comes up with a shell and\nyou're like, oh yeah!\n\n330\n00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.215\nOh yeah, yeah,you got it!\n\n331\n00:19:48.215 --> 00:19:49.945\nIt's something exciting about that.\n\n332\n00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:52.075\nAnd then even with all\nthese modern GUIs and\n\n333\n00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:54.395\nall that,\njust the fact that it's text coming up.\n\n334\n00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:57.095\nThere's something cool about\nthat text going around.\n\n335\n00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.576\nJust me, but I don't know,\nI get that little rush off of it so.\n\n336\n00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:02.664\n>> I've got a feeling that a few of\nour viewers are probably the same way.\n\n337\n00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.877\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully that's the way you guys\n\n338\n00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:05.605\nare here so.\n\n339\n00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:08.330\nAll right well, Sean,\nwe appreciate all of that.\n\n340\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.380\nHope you guys enjoyed\nwatching this episode.\n\n341\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.360\nFor now signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n342\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.100\n>> And I'm

00:00:14.360\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.920\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.980\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.530\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.680\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.570\nExcited that we're doing another\nepisode in our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.080\nAnd we're gonna continue on\nlooking at exploits I guess.\n\n10\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.680\nAt the last episode we kind of started\ngetting a hint or a feel for what we might\n\n11\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.780\nbe able to do with some of these exploits\nthat are loaded up into Metasploit.\n\n12\n00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.590\nNow Sean, I think we're gonna take\na closer look at maybe a little bit\n\n13\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.870\nmore detail.\n\n14\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.386\n>> Yeah, that's really the objective here.\n\n15\n00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:48.500\nIs we kind of we've seen what\nan exploit can do, and we went through\n\n16\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.390\nit just to give you a taste of things to\ncome at the end of the scanning section.\n\n17\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.570\nSo let's take a look at how we got\nthere and what that all means.\n\n18\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.640\nAnd then once we've done that,\nthen we'll get into doing some, well,\n\n19\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.410\nreally a couple newer exploits.\n\n20\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.160\nWe can't do them all, or\nanything cuz there are just so\n\n21\n00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.840\nmany different combinations.\n\n22\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.940\nBut we'll take a look at how\nwe find out certain things.\n\n23\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.320\nHow it's strung together.\n\n24\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.290\nAnd then we'll take a look at these couple\nnew attacks and see how we find a new one.\n\n25\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.611\nAnd then it's up to you guys to take it\nfrom there and see what you can find out.\n\n26\n00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:33.140\nAnd a lot of exciting stuff, really,\nwhen you start looking at exploits.\n\n27\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.780\nHopefully if you were looking\nat the scanning section and\n\n28\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.600\nyou saw that last little bit and even\na couple of other things in there, we were\n\n29\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.270\nable to punch holes in the system and open\nup shells remotely and stuff like that.\n\n30\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.370\nYou saw that and like,\nwhoa, wait a minute.\n\n31\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.670\n>> Probably,\n\n33\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.720\nhopefully, opened up your eyes and\n\n34\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.880\nreally got you excited to kinda\nsee just how we get there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.910\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n36\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.840\nYeah it didn't even seem\nall that difficult.\n\n37\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.120\nI know we've got a vulnerable set\nof systems sitting there, but\n\n38\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.750\nthere's several of those out there, right?\n\n39\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.926\nI mean, that's the whole\npoint of doing fantesters,\n\n40\n00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.096\na lot of people out there with vulnerable\nmachines and once you've found that,\n\n41\n00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.574\nas far as taking advantage of it,\nthere was just a few clicks.\n\n42\n00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:16.278\nKnowing the right exploits to load up, the\nright payload to deliver, and wham, bam,\n\n43\n00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:17.820\nthank you ma'am, I'm in there.\n\n44\n00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.520\n>> That's really it.\n\n45\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.610\nIt doesn't take much.\n\n46\n00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.600\nYou just gotta know when you gotta\nkeep an eye on what to look for, and\n\n47\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.500\nyou'll develop that eye over time.\n\n48\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.560\nIf you don't already have it, you'll\ndevelop it, start seeing these things, so\n\n49\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.380\nonce you see those, then you'll start,\nokay well, I've got an exploit for that.\n\n50\n00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.043\nLet me see if the exploit can give me\nanything and if it gives me anything,\n\n51\n00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:46.163\nthen maybe I can see if there's a payload\nI can use to push through that exploit,\n\n52\n00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:50.993\nthat vulnerability to run locally on\nit's system and do something for me.\n\n53\n00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:56.709\nA lot of cases that thing it's gonna do\nfor you is either executing something for\n\n54\n00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.402\nyou there or it's gonna be just\ngranting you a shell remotely that\n\n55\n00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:04.986\nyou can start monkeying\naround with the system and\n\n56\n00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:08.760\nget better results and\nstart seeing what they have.\n\n57\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.680\nSo the end result there when you get\nthat shell is just start seeing if you\n\n58\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.310\ncan maybe implant stuff on the system,\nyou extract information off the system, or\n\n59\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.010\nany number of things can\nhappen at that point.\n\n60\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.450\nYou can do even further reconnaissance,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n61\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.180\nYou can start go moving around the system\nand taking a look at additional things.\n\n62\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.410\n>> Yeah, once I'm inside that network,\nthat might open up avenues, new lines\n\n63\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.500\nof attack, or new lines of scanning and\nenumeration, and things like that.\n\n64\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.520\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n65\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.880\n>> All right,\nwell let's walk through then and\n\n66\n00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.230\nmaybe break down that process\na little bit more about how we\n\n67\n00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.180\nfound that vulnerability, how we decided\nwhat to use to take advantage of it.\n\n68\n00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.560\n>> Okay, yeah,\nLet's do take a look at that.\n\n69\n00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.807\nWe've seen many ways to look at a system\nand to start seeing what's there.\n\n70\n00:03:57.807 --> 00:04:03.050\nBut, we haven't it kind of where\nwe fully connect the dots between,\n\n71\n00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.710\nfind the information that\nhadn't used that information.\n\n72\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.565\nSo, my intention here is to in\nthis first portion is to show\n\n73\n00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:15.650\njust how you start covering information,\nso stuff we've kinda already seen, but\n\n74\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.760\nthen looking at it maybe with\na different spin now that you've seen\n\n75\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.050\nwhat the exploits can do,\nthat little taste we gave you.\n\n76\n00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.660\nNow, seeing what the end result is,\nmaybe we can see okay well,\n\n77\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.760\nhow do we connect the dots to get there?\n\n78\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.330\nWhat am I missing or what am I not seeing?\n\n79\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.890\nAnd then we'll add some other stuff\nin along the way to give you an idea\n\n80\n00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.690\nof other stuff that Metasploit can do\nto help you really refine that attack.\n\n81\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.020\nSo really neat.\n\n82\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.140\nSo what we wanna do to kinda set this\nthing up is the attack that we had,\n\n83\n00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.700\nthat we pulled at the end\nof our scanning section.\n\n84\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.480\nOne of the two was the FTP one.\n\n85\n00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.460\nYeah, the FTP one,\nas opposed to the VNC one.\n\n86\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.080\nThe VNC one was just\na misconfiguration someone did.\n\n87\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.910\nSomeone made a mistake,\nleft a default password in place price and\n\n88\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.990\nwe pounced on that and got in.\n\n89\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.590\nThe FTP one was a back door\nin that system that we took\n\n90\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.470\nadvantage of and used it to open up stuff\nin the system and get further into it.\n\n91\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.900\nSo that's the one we're gonna\nfocus on is to see how did you\n\n92\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.580\ndetermine that you had\nan exploit that would fit that.\n\n93\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.440\nWell, let's see that.\n\n94\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.010\nSo what I've got on my screen here\nis I'm am gonna be starting from\n\n95\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.340\na simple command prompt here.\n\n96\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.230\nThe way we can do it is we\ndo have a number of ways.\n\n97\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.380\nWe may have actually gone through and\ndone just a Netcat,\n\n98\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.210\nthat is a logical Thing to a step to take.\n\n99\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.270\nSo we can do a netcat and\n\n100\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.680\ndo it to Port 21 and see if that gives\nus anything and nope, hey, right there!\n\n101\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.890\nThat was really quick.\n\n102\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.570\nIt said vsftpd and\nit's giving me the version number.\n\n103\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.060\nI mean, that's quick and to the point.\n\n104\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.450\nThat's the cliffnotes version of it.\n\n105\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.850\nSo you've got stuff to\nrun with at that point.\n\n106\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.120\nHowever, you could also do if you really\nkinda want to break it down another way,\n\n107\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.590\nyou could do Nmap.\n\n108\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.990\nNmap's gonna help you out.\n\n109\n00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.020\nAnd you would do the dash a command and\n\n110\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.500\nto keep things nice and simple,\nI will just narrow the ports down to,\n\n111\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.190\nwell, I'll narrow it down to port 21,\nI won't even scan everything else.\n\n112\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.070\nI know what I'm looking for.\n\n113\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.270\nI'm at least gonna say, we know it's FTP.\n\n114\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.740\nYou could've done a full NMAP scan ahead\nof this and seen all the stuff, and\n\n115\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.160\nwe've seen that many times, even during\nour explorations in Metasploit, so\n\n116\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.140\nwe'll assume that's been done.\n\n117\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:57.530\nSo I am going to type in the IP address,\nand just gonna let this thing do its job.\n\n118\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.010\nAnd Nmap,\nwe should expect what this is gonna do.\n\n119\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.230\nIt just went through and\npuked a bunch of stuff up here.\n\n120\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.450\nAnd what are we seeing?\n\n121\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.590\nWell, we're seeing more\nthan Netcat gave us.\n\n122\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.415\nNetcat gave us hey, It's a VSFTPD.\n\n123\n00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:16.905\nWell, what we're seeing here is\nwe're seeing definitely it's Linux.\n\n124\n00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:22.455\nWe're seeing that when you look\nunder the ports state is open.\n\n125\n00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:24.725\nYou can see the version, VSFTPD there.\n\n126\n00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:26.395\nSo it's been confirmed and\n\n127\n00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:31.255\nthat kind of already serves to\ndo in NetCat and do it here.\n\n128\n00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:33.360\nYou can do either/or, it's up to you.\n\n129\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.710\nBut it already serves kinda one\nof the things that we had talked\n\n130\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.680\nabout in previous sessions and\nin previous discussions and\n\n131\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.130\nother courses that we've done.\n\n132\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.796\nIt is always good to kinda double check.\n\n133\n00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:50.033\nAnd so we've got two tools that we\nknow are reliable that are both lining\n\n134\n00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:55.720\nup saying, yep this is where we both\nagree that it's this specific service.\n\n135\n00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.310\nSo.\n\n136\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.832\nYeah, we're good there.\n\n137\n00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:02.980\nAnd then we got the operating system\nversion, and some good stuff like that.\n\n138\n00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.600\nBy the way, just to let you know,\n\n139\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.745\nsometimes with the diverse set of\noperating systems we have out there.\n\n140\n00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:13.555\nDon't always rely on NMAP or\n\n141\n00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:19.125\nany one tool to give you an accurate\nidea of what an operating system is.\n\n142\n00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:23.695\nIt has been known to come back and\nsay, either I don't know.\n\n143\n00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:28.790\nOr just kind of give you\nsomething that's off enough where\n\n144\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.900\nit might be believable but\nif you developed your eye and\n\n145\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.650\nkind of your common sense you're like,\nyeah that combination doesn't work.\n\n146\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.780\nSo if you have any doubt you might wanna\nsee if you can do further investigation.\n\n147\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:49.070\nFor right now we've got good,\nactionable information here.\n\n148\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:55.860\nWe've got its VSFTPD, we have the IP\naddress, we've got what we want.\n\n149\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.430\nI mean, heck, you can even see here,\nin Nmaps result,\n\n150\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.510\nit's saying it's anonymous FTP\nlogin allowed, it's even got that.\n\n151\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.360\nSo you've got some good stuff to act upon.\n\n152\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.916\n>> Absolutely.\n\n153\n00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:14.250\n>> So, once we've got that,\nI'm good, I'm ready to go.\n\n154\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.440\nI will come over to Metasploit,\nwhich I've already got loaded here,\n\n155\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.780\nand in the Metasploit\nconsole I have used exploit,\n\n156\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.190\nthat we saw in another segment,\njust got it here again.\n\n157\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.440\nI'm finding that, yeah,\nit's right there saying hey, here you go.\n\n158\n00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.590\nNow just for the record,\nwe saw way back during our\n\n159\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.520\nfirst segment of this course, when we\nwere exploring different commands and\n\n160\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.830\ngoing through all this stuff, we saw\nthat there's a search command in there.\n\n161\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.440\nWe can do search, port scan,\nand all that jazz.\n\n162\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.030\nYou very easily could have\nhere gone through and\n\n163\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.450\ndone search and typed FTP and\nsee what you had.\n\n164\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.375\nIt's gonna to puke out a lot on there so\nyou might want to say you know something\n\n165\n00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:06.655\nlike search, VSFTPD and\nsee what that gives you.\n\n166\n00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:11.125\nTo narrow it down so\nyou do have the search command that can\n\n167\n00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:15.155\nhelp you out to really kind of narrow\nthat down if you're not quite sure.\n\n168\n00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:20.610\nJust something else to kind of put\nthere to make things easier on you.\n\n169\n00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.610\nBut we already know what the module is,\nwe've been through that.\n\n170\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.130\nSo we've got the module ready to go here.\n\n171\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.060\nSo yeah, I'll do the same thing,\nI'll load it, and there you go.\n\n172\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.010\nIt's got the exploit loaded,\nI can pull up the info, and\n\n173\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.350\nwe see all the data that\nwe had seen before.\n\n174\n00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.950\nAnd again, always take a quick\nlook at what the info is saying.\n\n175\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.610\nI kind of make it a point of, not all\nthe time, but I try to make a point to run\n\n176\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.785\ninfo when I have any doubt in my mind, or\nit's not something I use all the time,\n\n177\n00:10:56.785 --> 00:11:00.355\nI'll run info just to take a look\nto see what the options are.\n\n178\n00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:02.195\nThere's really no reason\nwhy you shouldn't.\n\n179\n00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:06.435\nIt's quick, it's easy, and\nit's gonna eliminate a lot of just those\n\n180\n00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:09.775\nspitting nail-type moments where\nyou're like, why isn't this working?\n\n181\n00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:12.330\nThis will take care of that.\n\n182\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.710\nSo I'm looking at it here, you can\nsee that RHOST has not been defined.\n\n183\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.310\nI can see the port is PORT 21,\n\n184\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.590\nso we could leave that there, but\nif you found a different port for\n\n185\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.250\nFTP, then go ahead and change it,\nthere's nothing saying you can't.\n\n186\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:33.145\nAnd think about this [SOUND] for\na second, is that when you\n\n187\n00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:38.250\nare looking at using this\nexploit against FTP, you know,\n\n188\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.586\nFTP the traditional port for\nthat has been port 21, okay?\n\n189\n00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:45.340\nSomeone can change that.\n\n190\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.810\nThere's not a single scrap of\nanything anywhere that says no that\n\n191\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.290\nis written in stone, it'll stay that way,\nand you'll like it and tough.\n\n192\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.780\nThere's nothing saying it has to be\nthat way, someone could change that.\n\n193\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.140\nYou gotta ask yourself\nif you can change that,\n\n194\n00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.910\nhow would you know to change it?\n\n195\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.350\nThink about it for a second.\n\n196\n00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.960\nIf you want to know if that was\na different port, or how or\n\n197\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.140\nwhy would you change to a different port,\nwell, someone should change it over there.\n\n198\n00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.740\nHow would you be able to tell that?\n\n199\n00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.120\nWell, you got tools that could help\nyou out with that really easily.\n\n200\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.641\nIf you run end map just by itself,\nwith a simple sin scan and\n\n201\n00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:30.016\ngive it a range of IPs or just that\nsingle IP, not gonna tell you that.\n\n202\n00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:33.260\nIt's gonna tell you hey,\nthese are the ports that are open, and\n\n203\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.650\nI either don't know it, or this is\nwhat's suppose to be running there.\n\n204\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.460\nNow, the magic comes in when you go\nthrough and you run that command and\n\n205\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.940\nput the minus A, capital A in there.\n\n206\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.770\nNow it is going to do banner\ngrabs off of it and it's going to\n\n207\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.550\ngo through all those ports it finds open\nand try to pluck a banner off of it.\n\n208\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.985\nAnd now all of a sudden hey,\nmaybe port 90 something\n\n209\n00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:55.195\nis where this person tried to\ndo security through obscurity.\n\n210\n00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:57.030\nSaid, oh shove it up there,\nthey won't know.\n\n211\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n212\n00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:01.975\nI'm gonna know, because Endmap pulled\na banner directly off the service and\n\n213\n00:13:01.975 --> 00:13:04.925\nis waving it in front of me,\nsaying yeah, they moved it.\n\n214\n00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:10.915\nAnd now I just go into Metasploit and set\nour port to be whatever that new port is.\n\n215\n00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:11.655\nAnd I'm ready to go.\n\n216\n00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:12.810\nSo, yeah.\n\n217\n00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.387\nIf someone decides to move it,\n\n218\n00:13:14.387 --> 00:13:18.790\nit's [LAUGH] far from being\nhidden from anything we've got.\n\n219\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.445\nThat's just kinda something to make\nus chuckle a little bit, really, so.\n\n220\n00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:25.445\n>> [LAUGH] It makes\nthe admins feel better.\n\n221\n00:13:25.445 --> 00:13:27.795\nThey're not using the default port,\nthey feel so much better.\n\n222\n00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:28.409\n>> Yeah.\nIt's like,\n\n223\n00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:29.875\nthey're there, you're doing a good job.\n\n224\n00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:30.995\nJust pat them on the head.\n\n225\n00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:34.165\nIt's really not gonna help them.\n\n226\n00:13:34.165 --> 00:13:38.035\nSo we saw that we can set the rhost.\n\n227\n00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:44.980\nAnd we set the rhost, we give it the IP\naddress, just kinda like we did before.\n\n228\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.150\n>> Okay, so that is gonna be our target so\nboom, it's gone out there.\n\n229\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.670\nIt's got the target so\n\n230\n00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.540\nif we do info we know that the thing\nis all configured for that.\n\n231\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.270\nWe can see that right up there.\n\n232\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:03.300\nBut what we want to look at is\nthe thing that we saw in the previous\n\n233\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.350\nsection, just to show it again.\n\n234\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:10.210\nWe did the show payload deal,\nor show payloads,\n\n235\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.890\nif I was a little not so\nquick on the jump there.\n\n236\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.530\nWe do show payloads, and\nit's gonna go through and\n\n237\n00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.790\nshow me the payloads that are available.\n\n238\n00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:26.152\nIt just happens to be that one, it found\nthe one that's compatible with this.\n\n239\n00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:30.180\nNow FYI, you know, if you,\n\n240\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:36.380\nit's not every plug in is gonna to say,\nI know what that operating system is.\n\n241\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.860\nAnd I'm going to find\na compatible pay load.\n\n242\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.400\nIt might just say, there's a whole\nbunch of payloads here, and\n\n243\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.860\nyou have to choose one.\n\n244\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.030\nIt doesn't really know.\n\n245\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.850\nWell something that goes\nin with that is right now,\n\n246\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:56.600\nthere's an option inside a lot of these\nexploits, is you can do Show Targets.\n\n247\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.720\nAnd right now it's saying zero,\nit's automatic, it can find it directly.\n\n248\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.790\nIt knows, it detected it, knows what it\nis, it's got stuff built in to find that.\n\n249\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.570\nSo it's very easy for this plug-in\nto say hey, I know what this is.\n\n250\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.900\nI'm ready to go.\n\n251\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.350\nNot all of them will do that.\n\n252\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.980\nSome of them will have a big long\nlist of stuff you can choose from.\n\n253\n00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.430\nIn fact, I have it in one of my\n\n254\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.288\nothers one I have pre-loaded here and\nI'll load it just to kinda show you.\n\n255\n00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:31.190\nThis is another one out here.\n\n256\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.080\nI do show targets, and\nthis one gives me a list.\n\n257\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:43.050\nSo it's saying hey, you tell me what you\nwant to look for, and it'll go find it.\n\n258\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:47.943\nJust choose the number off that list and\nset it to that, and it'll set target\n\n259\n00:15:47.943 --> 00:15:52.545\nto the number and it will assume that\nthat's the version that you want.\n\n260\n00:15:52.545 --> 00:16:00.159\nSo if it can't automatically detect it or\nit's not in it's best interest to do that.\n\n261\n00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.885\nYou're gonna have to do that.\n\n262\n00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:05.957\nSo if you don't get best results\nwhen you think you should,\n\n263\n00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:09.090\nyou may actually have to tweak that.\n\n264\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.040\nSo, most of the time, it's got your back.\n\n265\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.030\nIt will go ahead and save, no problem.\n\n266\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.830\nReasons why you might, you see on here\ndifferent languages and stuff like that.\n\n267\n00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.870\nDifferent languages that always brings in,\n\n268\n00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.920\nif you're talking about code pages and\nstuff like that.\n\n269\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.160\nThat always brings in issues.\n\n270\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.568\nWe don't even deal with those in here\nbecause that's a big, big, big problem.\n\n271\n00:16:35.568 --> 00:16:39.900\nOr big, [LAUGH] big area,\nI won't say problem, that sounds bad, but\n\n272\n00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.270\nit's something that you\nmay have to think about.\n\n273\n00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:49.480\nSo, we'll go back over\nto our whole deal there.\n\n274\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.370\nSo we got the actual system being\ndetected, so it knows the target.\n\n275\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.393\nIt's saying there's compatible payload, so\n\n276\n00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:03.120\nwhat you're gonna do\nis do the set payload.\n\n277\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.337\nAnd we're gonna set it equal to the\npayload that is right up there on screen,\n\n278\n00:17:08.337 --> 00:17:10.870\njust like we did before.\n\n279\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.520\nAnd once we do that, you hit Enter.\n\n280\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.570\nAnd yeah, it confirms that\nthe payload's been set to that.\n\n281\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:21.340\nAnd remember the relationship\nbetween exploits and\n\n282\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.810\npayloads, you have to\nkeep that one in mind.\n\n283\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.873\nIf anything's gonna cause you a grief or\nI shouldn't say if anything.\n\n284\n00:17:27.873 --> 00:17:32.018\nBut one of the things that will cause\nyou grief is not understanding that\n\n285\n00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.125\nrelationship.\n\n286\n00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:38.575\nExploit sounds like hey, it should be able\nto exploit a hole and go into the system.\n\n287\n00:17:38.575 --> 00:17:42.230\nIt's only doing the first part [LAUGH],\nit's not doing the second part.\n\n288\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.380\nAnd exploit you can think\nof like the wrapper and\n\n289\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.740\nthe payload is what's\ngoing inside that wrapper.\n\n290\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.770\nSo the exploit's delivering mechanism and\nthe payload is what's being delivered.\n\n291\n00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.400\nAnd that's why when you\nlook at the payload,\n\n292\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.180\nnot every payload's gonna be available.\n\n293\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.840\nWith every combination\nof operating system,\n\n294\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.700\nbecause it just may not be that\nsomething that doesn't work.\n\n295\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.810\nIf this payload right here is\ndesigned to work with Unix and\n\n296\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.170\nI hit a Windows system,\nwhy am I even bothering?\n\n297\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.130\nIt's not gonna work over there.\n\n298\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.930\nPresumably, it's not\ngonna work over there.\n\n299\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.760\n>> You never know.\n\n300\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.490\n>> Yeah, you never know.\n\n301\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.180\nI mean, there's always\nexceptions to every rule, but\n\n302\n00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.720\njust be aware of that\ncould be the situation.\n\n303\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.880\nNow, once you have the host set,\nyou've got the payload being set,\n\n304\n00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.850\ntarget if necessary.\n\n305\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.160\nAnd any other options,\ndouble check your options,\n\n306\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.550\ngo through info to make sure that\nthey're all the way you want it to be.\n\n307\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:50.250\nOnce you've got that, one of the things\nwe have with doing an exploit is exploit,\n\n308\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.380\nwhen you're ready to rock n roll with it.\n\n309\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.870\nYou just go through and hit exploit and\nit does its magic at that point.\n\n310\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.050\nSo once you go through and do that,\n\n311\n00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.620\nyou can see right here it's opened\nthe thing up as we saw before.\n\n312\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:12.370\nWe should be able to do just our standard\ncommands, cuz it's opened up that shell.\n\n313\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.700\nWe can go ahead and\nissue commands just like you would.\n\n314\n00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.010\nThe thing is with this,\nyou'll have to pay attention,\n\n315\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.020\nit can kind of get a little bit\ncrazy to a certain degree in here.\n\n316\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.140\nBecause when you start\nopening up that shell,\n\n317\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.720\nwhen you open up that shell to that\nsystem, think about how confusing it is.\n\n318\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.080\nRight now, the shell I have open its\na metasploit, a metasploitable system.\n\n319\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.462\nIt's an Ubuntu system\nI believe that's got,\n\n320\n00:19:40.462 --> 00:19:45.330\nan Ubuntu system with a bunch of\nvulnerabilities build it into it.\n\n321\n00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.820\nSo we've got a Linux system and\na Linux system,\n\n322\n00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.060\nthat's easy to not have to remember.\n\n323\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.040\n>> Which window am I typing in type thing?\n\n324\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.230\n>> Yeah, that would probably\nbe the biggest thing is that,\n\n325\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.790\nam I in that remote session still or\nam I not in that remote session still?\n\n326\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.670\nSo that would be the biggest thing.\n\n327\n00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:11.860\nBut what could really mess you up is if\nsomething we saw earlier with Netcat.\n\n328\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.760\nI had a Linux system and\nI'm opening up a shell or\n\n329\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.988\na shell is being opened to\nme from a Windows system.\n\n330\n00:20:17.988 --> 00:20:22.190\nAnd you're gonna have to keep that\nstraight, that can get really messy.\n\n331\n00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.700\nSo make sure when you're doing these\nexploits, I would also tell you.\n\n332\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.460\nIf you see some erroring out, you might be\n\n333\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.610\nhopping between two different things and\nit's an easy thing for people to mess up.\n\n334\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.360\nBut for the most part,\n\n335\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.730\nif you keep that straight really anything\nyou can do on the operating system.\n\n336\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.040\nIf you were sitting there locally,\nyou can pretty much do through that shell.\n\n337\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.900\nSo you've got access to that system and\nthat opens up all sorts of possibilities.\n\n338\n00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.320\nIt's possible for you to,\nlike I was saying,\n\n339\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.920\nmap out the environment from there.\n\n340\n00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:07.970\nThere's nothing saying, for\nexample, I can't go over to this\n\n341\n00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:13.120\nother system, this Metasploitable system\nand I believe I have Nmap over there.\n\n342\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.080\nI do, I've got Nmap on that\nMetasploitable system.\n\n343\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.940\nSo I could easily go over there and say,\n\n344\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.450\noh, okay, let's just do this deal.\n\n345\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:30.940\nI'll do a quick one,\ndo a -p from 1 to 50 and\n\n346\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:37.020\nthen I'll just tell it to\ngo look at an IP address.\n\n347\n00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.770\nSo on and so forth.\n\n348\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.790\nAnd do the same thing I would have done\nwith Nmap a thousand times before.\n\n349\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.000\n>> But now you're doing it from inside of\ntheir network from one of their machines.\n\n350\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.860\nAnd that's changing your perspective,\nwhich could give you different results.\n\n351\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.170\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n352\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.990\nYou could be just swimming around\nin that network now at this point,\n\n353\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.660\ncuz you've punched right through.\n\n354\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.660\nSo you established that beach head,\nopened up that console on it.\n\n355\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.150\nAnd now you can start using that to kind\nof be your forward point where you're now\n\n356\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.750\nobserving everything inside that\nnetwork and finding where to go.\n\n357\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.420\nAnd so\nyou gotta think about it in that context,\n\n358\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.170\nthis is why the shell is\nappearing local on your box.\n\n359\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.010\nIt's not really local there,\nit's presenting stuff from way over there,\n\n360\n00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.710\nso you can start figuring out\nwhat's going on over there.\n\n361\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.460\nJust keep jumping in further and\nfurther and further.\n\n362\n00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.730\nAnd so,\n\n363\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.910\nyou can see the definite possibilities\nhere if you think the right way.\n\n364\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:43.440\nI mean who's to say, I couldn't open\nup this and somehow get NetCat running.\n\n365\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.202\nAnd start transferring files over and\n\n366\n00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:47.910\nusing that to open up a whole\nanother cans of worms for him.\n\n367\n00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.612\n>> Absolutely.\n\n368\n00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:53.128\n>> So\njust keep that type of stuff in mind, so\n\n369\n00:22:53.128 --> 00:22:57.140\nthat's just kind of from end to end.\n\n370\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.250\nWe went from finding the vulnerability,\nwe showed you through Netcat and Nmap.\n\n371\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.390\nThe way to really kind of refine it and\nmake sure you knew what it was.\n\n372\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.668\nYou saw how to select the targets\ninside and set that up.\n\n373\n00:23:08.668 --> 00:23:11.560\nAnd then we just went ahead and\nopened that right on in and\n\n374\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.560\nstarted using commands native to the\noperating system to get our end result.\n\n375\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:24.370\nNow that's in the scheme of things,\nwe'll say it's easy\n\n376\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.410\nto look at that and say I'm just gonna\ncancel out of that shell from that system.\n\n377\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.090\nGonna go back to my local system here,\n\n378\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.070\nI'm just gonna go back to\nmy Metasploit console.\n\n379\n00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.650\nRemember that you have\noptions like show exploits.\n\n380\n00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.089\nAnd it will go ahead and\nshow you the list of exploits that\n\n381\n00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:49.347\nare loaded into Metasploit and\nthere are quite a bit.\n\n382\n00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:54.346\nSo be prepared for that, show exploits\nis probably not the best idea\n\n383\n00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:56.786\nto run by itself like that,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n384\n00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:58.146\n>> Because it's got a lot of stuff,\n\n385\n00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.075\nit's gonna shoot by.\n\n386\n00:23:59.075 --> 00:24:04.036\nIf it takes time like this by the way\nsometimes just to kind of a little\n\n387\n00:24:04.036 --> 00:24:08.650\nsafety tip here, is sometimes\nwhen you run the show commands or\n\n388\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.437\nyou type the search commands,\nthey will kind of lag quite a bit and\n\n389\n00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:16.160\nthe reason is because the database.\n\n390\n00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.910\nThe database is also used for\nindexes and stuff like that, so\n\n391\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.290\nit may take some time to get it going.\n\n392\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.050\nIf you continue to have problems with it,\nyou can do stuff like start and\n\n393\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.040\nstop the database service.\n\n394\n00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.600\nAnd you can even, there's a command in\nthere that even says to rebuild the cache.\n\n395\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.420\nAnd so once it's done that,\nthen that should take care of it, for\n\n396\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.320\nall intents and purposes.\n\n397\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:46.890\nSo what I've got here is, there's my list\nof exploits and yeah, there's just so\n\n398\n00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:53.120\nmany in here, you would not want\nto do this as a regular practice.\n\n399\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.330\nSo there you go,\nthere's just kind of a list of exploits.\n\n400\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.427\nWe've got a list of payloads in there,\nwe've got a list of scanners in there for\n\n401\n00:25:01.427 --> 00:25:02.969\nyou to do all sorts of things.\n\n402\n00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:08.143\nThere's a list of auxiliaries\nin there that we have yet\n\n403\n00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:12.312\nto get to that can do\nall sorts of cool stuff.\n\n404\n00:25:12.312 --> 00:25:13.708\nAnd that's the first\ntime that I've seen that.\n\n405\n00:25:13.708 --> 00:25:15.093\nLook at the top of the screen.\n\n406\n00:25:15.093 --> 00:25:18.398\nUFO Alien Invasion IRC\nClient Buffer Overflow.\n\n407\n00:25:18.398 --> 00:25:19.060\n>> Oh.\n\n408\n00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:19.760\n>> We've got everything.\n\n409\n00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.265\nWe got aliens even invading you.\n\n410\n00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:23.444\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So don't screw around [CROSSTALK].\n\n411\n00:25:23.444 --> 00:25:24.350\n>> Metasploit has you covered.\n\n412\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.050\nThat's right.\n\n413\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.745\n>> Yeah.\nDon't blink.\n\n414\n00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:29.212\nSo, yeah.\n\n415\n00:25:29.212 --> 00:25:33.900\nHopefully what we just went through\nwith showing it end to end,\n\n416\n00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.642\nof uncovering and using an exploit,\n\n417\n00:25:36.642 --> 00:25:41.773\ninstead of just kind of punching\nright through it like we did before,\n\n418\n00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:47.480\nhopefully that gives you the full\nperspective on things and how this works.\n\n419\n00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.785\nSo, keep that in mind when\nwe move into actually\n\n420\n00:25:51.785 --> 00:25:55.610\nusing other exploits,\nwhich we're gonna do.\n\n421\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.140\nWe're gonna use some other exploits here\nto see some other cool stuff that you can\n\n422\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.070\ndo to cause mischief or hack for\nfun and profit, as I like to say.\n\n423\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.910\n>> There you go [LAUGH].\n\n424\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.660\n>> So anyway, there's the skinny on that.\n\n425\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.960\n>> Well, Sean, that was a great look at\nit from beginning to end, as you say.\n\n426\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.279\nAnd we got to see it from scanning\nthe system, finding the open ports,\n\n427\n00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:19.219\nfiguring out what services are running\non those ports, finding a vulnerability,\n\n428\n00:26:19.219 --> 00:26:22.311\nthat could take it, or an exploit\nthat could take advantage of one\n\n429\n00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:24.423\nof the vulnerabilities on those services.\n\n430\n00:26:24.423 --> 00:26:26.587\nLoading up a payload,\nsending the thing over, and\n\n431\n00:26:26.587 --> 00:26:30.226\ngetting a shell opened up on that machine,\nand pretty much taking that machine over.\n\n432\n00:26:30.226 --> 00:26:33.750\nSo great end-to-end look\nof that whole process.\n\n433\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.720\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe wanna thank everybody for tuning in,\n\n434\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.360\nhope you enjoyed watching this show.\n\n435\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.610\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n436\n00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.496\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n437\n00:26:42.496 --> 00:26:43.616\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n438\n00:26:43.616 --> 00:26:49.770\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.020\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.620\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.880\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.500\nI'm doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.780\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.240\nWe've got another exciting episode coming\nyour way in our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.700\nIn this one,\nwe're gonna take another look at exploits.\n\n10\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.780\nAnd in particular, Sean,\n\n11\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.230\nI think we're gonna look at exploiting\na particular service, right?\n\n12\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.480\n>> Yeah,\nwe are going to dig into looking at Samba,\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.590\nnot the dance, but we're gonna\n>> [LAUGH] Thank goodness.\n\n14\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.380\n>> Yeah.\n>> We don't do that, yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.510\nWe can do that later.\n\n16\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.800\nSo, we're gonna look into\nthe Samba service which is really,\n\n17\n00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.520\nI guess the best way to put it,\nit's like a file sharing service,\n\n18\n00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.350\nor allows file sharing between UNIX,\nLinux, and Windows systems.\n\n19\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.460\nSo we've got that service available, and\n\n20\n00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.490\nmay actually be configured\nbetween these two guys.\n\n21\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.610\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna see\nif there's a way for us to exploit it.\n\n22\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.395\nI guess we shouldn't even say is there\na way, you know where this is going.\n\n23\n00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:20.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> So what we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n24\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.010\nsee that\n>> That service is available.\n\n25\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.160\nThen we are going to see how\nwe can punch into it and\n\n26\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.140\nwhat it means once we punch into it,\ncuz there's some neat stuff here.\n\n27\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.320\nSo that's what we're going\nto try to accomplish here.\n\n28\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.700\nIn this particular segment.\n\n29\n00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.720\nSo pretty cool I think\nas far as this one goes.\n\n30\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.225\nI don't know about you guys out there,\nI'm excited.\n\n31\n00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.625\n[LAUGH]\n>> You should be.\n\n32\n00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.030\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, what we're gonna do here is, I said\n\n33\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.840\nwe're gonna go after the Samba service and\nthe way we're gonna do that is,\n\n34\n00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.870\nup on my screen you can see that\nI'm using now one of my auxiliary\n\n35\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.080\n>> Modules.\n\n36\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.350\nThe auxiliary modules are the ones that\nreally offer the broadest amount of\n\n37\n00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.260\nflexibility, because they\ncan pretty much do anything.\n\n38\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.420\nThey can execute different types of shell\ncode and applications and everything else.\n\n39\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.345\nSo, these ones do have\na tremendous amount of power.\n\n40\n00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:19.815\nA tremendous amount of potential if\nyou're even developing your own,\n\n41\n00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.365\nyour own modules later on which you might.\n\n42\n00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:27.235\nYou might to decide to develop your own\nmodules but we won't worry about that now.\n\n43\n00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:29.755\nSo we've got,\nyou know this auxiliary module.\n\n44\n00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:34.860\nWe got, we'll assume we did our scan and\nwe found that the service is running.\n\n45\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.380\nSo we've located the actual module for\nit and\n\n46\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.290\nwe are going to go ahead and\nhit enter on it, and boom.\n\n47\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.890\nWe've got that loaded.\n\n48\n00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.100\nSo we're going to do a quick\ninfo on it and we see, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.710\nWhat have we got.\n\n50\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.810\nWe look through this and we are seeing\nthat we have our host variable so\n\n51\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.640\nlet's just go ahead and\nkind of knock that out of the way.\n\n52\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.090\nI will do my 192.168.245.132 and\n\n53\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.530\nI am going to enter that and\nwe are good there.\n\n54\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.811\nSo we've already targeted\nthat specific system,\n\n55\n00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.290\nso we're doing good there.\n\n56\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.830\nIs there anything else\nwe're gonna need to do?\n\n57\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.560\nYeah there are additional things and\nI've already gone through and\n\n58\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.150\ntyped this stuff in like I normally do.\n\n59\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.000\nSo other things people want to do is\n\n60\n00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000\nwe not there usually is a temp folder or\nsomething in there.\n\n61\n00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.750\nSo it's SMV share.\n\n62\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.800\nIs going to say, okay, well,\nthat's the one we're going to assume,\n\n63\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.650\nthe temp folder it's going to be a\nreadable and writeable location on there.\n\n64\n00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.120\nSo I'm going to set up the share, and you\ncould have actually done some stuff, ahead\n\n65\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.320\nof time to do some reconnaissance, to\nsee if this was actually a folder there.\n\n66\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.690\nSo we've gone through and we'll say\nwe found that out, and we're good.\n\n67\n00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.160\nSo we're gonna set the share to be that.\n\n68\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.848\nSo the share, and\nthe SOB share set to be TMP.\n\n69\n00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:05.690\nOkay so\n\n70\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.180\nwe've got all these ones set up,\nso it looks pretty good.\n\n71\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.900\nAt this point what we've got, so let's see\nif there's anything else we need to set.\n\n72\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.960\nIs there any targets in here?\n\n73\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.830\nSometimes I'll check\non this type of stuff.\n\n74\n00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.840\nNot all of them have it, so there you go.\n\n75\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.280\nThis one's saying this isn't an exploit\nmodule, I can't help you there.\n\n76\n00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.760\nSo it's telling me, oh, you're done.\n\n77\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.480\nIs there any payloads with this?\n\n78\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.610\nJust to kind of show you.\n\n79\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.380\nIt's going to look at it and say, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.880\nThere's some pay loads here, but\nwhen I look through these pay loads,\n\n81\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.490\nthese are things, you can see they're for\nVNC and for other stuff.\n\n82\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.690\nIt doesn't look like there's anything\nreally that's going to help us here.\n\n83\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.520\nSo I'm not really too\nconcerned at this point.\n\n84\n00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.380\nAnd that's really kind of\nthe whole list of payloads.\n\n85\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.410\nJust in case you didn't grasp on that.\n\n86\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.500\nThat's the whole list.\n\n87\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.010\nSo, what I will do is, so\nI've got this stuff set.\n\n88\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.770\nSo what I wanna do is I'm just\ngoing to go ahead and run this guy.\n\n89\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.920\nOkay so\nlet's take a look at exploiting Somba.\n\n90\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.240\nThe way we're going to exploit.- Exploit\nsamba is, we're going to use one of those\n\n91\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.155\nauxilary modules, which these very\nkind of powerful modules that\n\n92\n00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:34.655\nare part of Metasploit, but you can also\nenhance and add on your own if you want.\n\n93\n00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.625\nMore on that, you can look at\nmore on that at a later time.\n\n94\n00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.720\nWe're not going to get into that\nbecause that requires all sorts of\n\n95\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.690\nlittle high level programming skills and\n\n96\n00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.760\nstuff like that, that we don't\nhave time to get into in here.\n\n97\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.340\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna load in the Samba module.\n\n98\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.970\nSo we go ahead and load that in.\n\n99\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.100\nAnd you can see we get the same.\n\n100\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.770\nA prompt coming back saying,\nhey it's loaded in and\n\n101\n00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.030\nit's ready to start working with us.\n\n102\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.180\nSo what I'm gonna do, is do my deal\nwhere I'm gonna pull an info off of it.\n\n103\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.320\nAnd I'm gonna see in here\nthat it has our host,\n\n104\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.710\nSMB share, those are gonna be the two\nbig ones that I have to set for this.\n\n105\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.680\nSo, what I'm gonna do is, I am gonna\nset our host, remember singular, here.\n\n106\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.810\nI'm gonna set our host equal\nto my Metasploitable box.\n\n107\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.570\nSo, I have that all set out.\n\n108\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.727\nI'm gonna do 192.168.245.132.\n\n109\n00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:42.740\nI hit Enter on it, and\nit looks like it's happy with that.\n\n110\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.300\nAnd then I'm gonna do set SMVshare,\nand I'm gonna set that equal to\n\n111\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.800\nthe temp folder, and there so\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter on that.\n\n112\n00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.700\nAnd it's taking it, so\nonce we have that set,\n\n113\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.600\nnot a bad idea to run info to make\nsure you've got your bases covered.\n\n114\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.910\nIf you miss one of the variables, or\nsomething kinda gets a little sideways in\n\n115\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.790\nthere, you could get some weird\nresults with the exploit,\n\n116\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.540\nso you kinda wanna make sure that\nyou've got your bases covered.\n\n117\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.150\nYou don't necessarily need in every\ncase to have every variable set.\n\n118\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.790\nIt may be completely just nonsense to do\nthat, I guess for lack of a better word.\n\n119\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.390\nIt may be pointless.\n\n120\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.520\nSo here, we've got everything set,\nlooks good.\n\n121\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:46.197\nSo, what's really left there to do is\nto just go ahead and run the thing.\n\n122\n00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:49.546\n>> And exploited again, right there.\n\n123\n00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:52.666\nSo let's see what's going on there.\n\n124\n00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:55.644\nThat's kind of an interesting one.\n\n125\n00:07:55.644 --> 00:08:00.550\nIt didn't like it, but it went through and\nspit out some errors in there.\n\n126\n00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.990\nBut let's see, sometimes that happens.\n\n127\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.760\nAnd we'll see if that\ncauses any sort of issue.\n\n128\n00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.580\nI mean, these modules should go\nthrough without an error, but\n\n129\n00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.140\nsometimes I have found\nthat I do encounter this.\n\n130\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.870\nAnd it could be for different reasons.\n\n131\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.670\nIt could be an incompatibility issue.\n\n132\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:26.310\nIt could be that I'd run this previously\nwhen I was setting up the demo,\n\n133\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.670\nbut we'll see.\n\n134\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.360\nWe still may get the same result.\n\n135\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.230\nIt may just have not gone all the way.\n\n136\n00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.120\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI am gonna go over to\n\n137\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.750\nmy, just my regular command prompt in\nKali and see if I can get it to attach to\n\n138\n00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.010\nthat location,\nover in the Metasploitable box.\n\n139\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.500\nSo the way I'm gonna do that, is\npresumably if everything's gone right it's\n\n140\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.440\npunched in to that share and\nopened it up so I can just\n\n141\n00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.040\ngo in anonymously into there and\nstart moving around and looking at stuff.\n\n142\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.530\nSo you can see up top when I, or\nat the prompt saying SMB client, you\n\n143\n00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.100\ngo to that machine and then it's saying\n/temp, so go directly to that folder.\n\n144\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.230\nRemember, I set the share\nname to being equal to temp.\n\n145\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.690\nSo I'm saying go right there and\nsee what you get.\n\n146\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.020\nSo I've got SMB client, I hit enter,\n\n147\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.110\nit's saying enter roots password, well\nlet's see it's supposed to be anonymous.\n\n148\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.120\nI hit it and oops it successful.\n\n149\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.690\nDidn't really take much right there.\n\n150\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.900\nSo definitely the exploit works, so\neven though it spit out some weird\n\n151\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.000\nfunky errors it still worked so\nwhat we have it looks like,\n\n152\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.490\nyou know, we got in so\nit has got the SMB prompt in there and\n\n153\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.380\nlet's see if that gives\nus anything of value.\n\n154\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.650\nWell, that's kinda interesting.\n\n155\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:06.000\nWe've got some stuff there,\nlet's see if we can go to the root.\n\n156\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.650\nOh, fs folder.\n\n157\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.270\nWell, let's see what we got in there.\n\n158\n00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.930\nOh, well hey, look at that.\n\n159\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.830\n>> Scary [LAUGH]\n>> You know you just went right back in in\n\n160\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.640\na few steps and even though we had\nkind of a little bit of scary stuff\n\n161\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.020\nhappen there for a minute with a couple\nof errors, it still went in and\n\n162\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.980\nwe're on that system and\nwe can start doing what we need to.\n\n163\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.210\n>> Correct me if I'm wrong Sean,\n\n164\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.660\nit looks like you took advantage\nof a vulnerability in Samba.\n\n165\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.880\nYou connected to the share anonymously,\nbut then you didn't stay there.\n\n166\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.280\nYou actually went out of the share,\nback into the file system,\n\n167\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.340\nit's like you're kinda doing\na directory traversal there.\n\n168\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.760\nSo, who cares if there was anything\nexciting in the share or not,\n\n169\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.660\nyou just took advantage of that\nto get to their computer, and\n\n170\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.480\nnow you're just exploring\ntheir hard drive.\n\n171\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.000\n>> Yeah, exactly right.\n\n172\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.850\nThis is a backdoor/vulnerability\nthat's in there.\n\n173\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.690\nAnd I just use that to hop into it,\nand then just went out on the box.\n\n174\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.060\nAnd you can see that right there,\nI'm on that box.\n\n175\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.420\nIt's now up to me where I wanna take this.\n\n176\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.620\nI've got quite a bit of\naccess at this point.\n\n177\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.500\nSo you could just start browsing\ndirectories or folders in here.\n\n178\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.260\nWhatever.\n\n179\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.950\nYou can start going through there and\nseeing what they have.\n\n180\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.620\nMaybe doing the same thing, running stuff.\n\n181\n00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.210\nWhatever you want to do.\n\n182\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.840\nSo couple steps, really.\n\n183\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.160\n>> That's really scary,\nthat kinda surprises me.\n\n184\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.970\nI expected to get it in that share, and\nif there's something juicy in that share,\n\n185\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.420\nbe able to see it or\naccess it or what have you.\n\n186\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.030\nI didn't expect you to bounce\nout of the share just from\n\n187\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.110\nperusing the entire file\nsystem on that machine.\n\n188\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.200\n>> Yeah, didn't take much.\n\n189\n00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.310\nIt really did not take much to do at all.\n\n190\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.480\nAnd I would point out, at the beginning\nof this that, yeah we got that\n\n191\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.430\nerror message in there,\nsometimes that does happen.\n\n192\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.720\nAnd then we can look at this thing and\nsee what was happening.\n\n193\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.790\nWas it a problem in the code?\n\n194\n00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.460\nWas it a problem in the environment?\n\n195\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:10.530\nBut sometimes that happens and\nI made it a point just to push on to see,\n\n196\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.570\ndid it actually do what\nit was supposed to?\n\n197\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.110\nWas that nothing or\nis that just a hiccup or something?\n\n198\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.300\nLet's go ahead and\nsee if I can get anywhere with it.\n\n199\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.730\nAnd you can see here I did get something\nwith it but sometimes it fails for\n\n200\n00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.360\njust random reasons.\n\n201\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.990\nI've seen it fail because\nmaybe someone had passed or\n\n202\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.060\ntweaked the system just a little bit,\nenough to be off.\n\n203\n00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.250\nAnd when the plugin checked for\nsomething in that environment,\n\n204\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.770\nit wasn't what it expected to see,\nso it failed.\n\n205\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.910\nBut, usually that does not happen.\n\n206\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:51.090\nAnd I've run this plugin bunches of\ntime and I've not had that happen, so.\n\n207\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.290\nBut, hey,\nit's gonna happen from time to time.\n\n208\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.720\nYou gotta be adaptable to it,\nwhich we just went ahead and pushed on.\n\n209\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.610\nAnd, hey,\nwe're on that person's system now.\n\n210\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.620\n>> Perseverance, and we are in.\n\n211\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.560\nI like it.\n\n212\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.630\n[LAUGH] That's a really\ngood look at another yet\n\n213\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.220\nagain, another use of those exploits,\ntaking advantage of in this case Samba.\n\n214\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.050\nFinding the right exploit,\nthat would break something,\n\n215\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.620\nnot really break something, but\nallow us that anonymous access.\n\n216\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.950\nAnd then just running it and I'll tell\nyou, Metasploit makes it pretty darn easy.\n\n217\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.720\nIt gives you just about everything you\nneed right there in this one console.\n\n218\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.650\n>> Yeah.\n\n219\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.024\nWhat did we say in our\nfirst couple segments?\n\n220\n00:13:35.024 --> 00:13:41.490\nMade it clear that this is\nan incredibly powerful tool and\n\n221\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.120\nyou add this into your toolbox and\nstuff you already have for\n\n222\n00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.650\nmaybe being a CEH, or just to being pen\ntesting in general without the credential,\n\n223\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.290\nI mean you add this into it, you've just\nbumped it up to an incredible degree,\n\n224\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.020\nand just across the board,\nyou bumped up to incredible degree.\n\n225\n00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.370\nYou could do all sorts of things.\n\n226\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:10.230\nSome of this stuff you're seeing,\nI may overuse the term a lot or\n\n227\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.870\nsaying a lot, but it really is\nmind numbing when you look at it.\n\n228\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.910\nIt's like,\nthat shouldn't be that easy to do that.\n\n229\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.330\nYou just really don't think you should\nbe able to do it that easily but\n\n230\n00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.360\njust went right in.\n\n231\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.670\nAnd granted, yeah, it's a vulnerable\nenvironment, but we went right in and\n\n232\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.080\ndidn't really have to put much effort\ninto it to get into that system.\n\n233\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.530\nGet into a share and then all of a sudden\njust hop over the wall, climb over\n\n234\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.750\nthe fence, whatever you wanna call it,\nand we're on the box, and it's ours now.\n\n235\n00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.460\n>> That's great, I love it.\n\n236\n00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.890\nAll right,\na lot of really good information.\n\n237\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.000\nAnother example of another\nexploit that allows us\n\n238\n00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.330\nto really take over that remote machine.\n\n239\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:52.230\n>> We're gonna take a look at another\nexploit here, just for a moment.\n\n240\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.180\nSo we just saw what the exploit for\n\n241\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.800\nSamba could do well that's not\nthe end of the magic here really.\n\n242\n00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.300\nWhat we can do is we can take a look\nat another one just to kind of\n\n243\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.430\njust fill in some more stuff here,\n\n244\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.820\nwe're gonna take a look at an exploit for\nsomething called Disk CC.\n\n245\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.050\nAnd let me just kind of quickly\ntell you what that service is for\n\n246\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:22.710\nbecause there really isn't at 100%\nagreed upon what that acronym\n\n247\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:27.600\nstands for what Dis C C is really kind of\n\n248\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.590\na.- It's a distributed computing deal for\ncompiling deal for compiling code.\n\n249\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.240\nSo if I think I said anything distributed\ncompiling code if you want to look\n\n250\n00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.960\nat it that way you can.\n\n251\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.921\nBut what it is that you can link\ntogether a bunch of systems and\n\n252\n00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:46.814\nyou can speed up your compilation of\ncode which traditionally Is a very time\n\n253\n00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:49.313\nconsuming, and intensive process.\n\n254\n00:15:49.313 --> 00:15:52.543\nYou can just kind of spread\naround multiple systems, and\n\n255\n00:15:52.543 --> 00:15:56.797\ntherefore, you know use that principle\nof many hands make for light work.\n\n256\n00:15:56.797 --> 00:16:04.040\nYou can make it so your compilation of\ncode can take less time than it would.\n\n257\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.340\nSo that's what this is designed for.\n\n258\n00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.080\nThe problem is that the service\nis designed for that.\n\n259\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.010\nIt's not designed for, really, to be\nsecure or anything even relating to that.\n\n260\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it does,\n\n261\n00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.730\nits distributed computing function\nreally well, but as far as this other\n\n262\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.770\nstuff that we can possibly be problems,\nit doesn't take that into account.\n\n263\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:34.420\nSo that leaves the door open for\nus to do something nasty with it.\n\n264\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.250\nSo what we have here is, and\nI'm gonna show you on screen here,\n\n265\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.080\njust a quick way to exploit this service.\n\n266\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.520\nNow, if you had again,\nhad done your recon ahead of time,\n\n267\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.270\nyou would've seen this\nservice actually running.\n\n268\n00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.060\nSo we'll say we've already done that,\nmuch like we have previously.\n\n269\n00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.920\nSo what we have is we have\nan exploit specifically designed for\n\n270\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.750\nthe disk CC service.\n\n271\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:06.730\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm going to load\nthat exploit into the system, which I do.\n\n272\n00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.870\nAnd it's gone ahead and loaded it in.\n\n273\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.520\nLet's take a look at the info for it and\n\n274\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.710\nnot really much in\nthe way of options here.\n\n275\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:24.530\nSo I'll do set R host and\nI will do my IP address once again.\n\n276\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.050\nAnd I get that set.\n\n277\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.810\nOkay, so it looks like we're good there.\n\n278\n00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.330\nIf I do anything else like show payloads,\n\n279\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.680\nlet's just take a quick look is there any\npayloads we need to be worried about?\n\n280\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.513\nThere's some stuff there but\n\n281\n00:17:40.513 --> 00:17:44.236\nwe don't really worry about that\nI don't think at this point.\n\n282\n00:17:44.236 --> 00:17:48.676\nWe could, you can see that there's some\nstuff targeted at different systems.\n\n283\n00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:52.412\nWe can do our show targets,\nthis gives a target option as well,\n\n284\n00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:53.830\nit's auto targeting.\n\n285\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.213\nSo we've got all those things\nthat can work with that system,\n\n286\n00:17:58.213 --> 00:18:02.530\nwhich is actually kind of amazing\nthat it's got that broad.\n\n287\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:08.740\nAnd note the exploits that we\nhad previously or just said hey,\n\n288\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:13.010\nit auto-targeted but, and\nit had one exploit available in one case.\n\n289\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.440\nThis one's saying, yeah, I know what\nthe system is, but, that aside,\n\n290\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.800\nlook at all the stuff I've got to use.\n\n291\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.300\nYou choose what you want to use and\nI'll go with it.\n\n292\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.370\nSo it's got a really wide number\nof things that you can use.\n\n293\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.786\n>> So we like it when we see that\ndistcc running on a machine?\n\n294\n00:18:28.786 --> 00:18:30.911\n>> Oh, yeah you should just be\nwringing your hands going oh yes.\n\n295\n00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:33.601\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n296\n00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:37.580\nI'm not gonna even bother\nloading anything special.\n\n297\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.420\nLet's just go ahead and rock and roll and\n\n298\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.438\nrun exploit on this and\nlet it go ahead and do its thing.\n\n299\n00:18:45.438 --> 00:18:51.000\nAnd well, it looks like it\nreally quickly went through and\n\n300\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.610\nopened up a shell for me,\ndidn't even take that much time, really.\n\n301\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.470\nSo if I do my ls, oh hey,\nlook I remember that guy.\n\n302\n00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.455\nSo let's see if that gets me anywhere, and\n\n303\n00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:07.990\nit'll just, oh hey,\nwe know where we are again.\n\n304\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:13.442\nSo that was, I mean,\nthat you would have blinked and missed it.\n\n305\n00:19:13.442 --> 00:19:14.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you weren't careful,\n\n306\n00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.650\nyou would have blinked and\nmissed that thing.\n\n307\n00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:22.220\nAnd it just really quickly saw that\nservice running, went right on in.\n\n308\n00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.730\nAnd now I, once again,\n\n309\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.530\ngot right down to the file system\nlevel and not much time at all.\n\n310\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.058\nWhat else can you say really there?\n\n311\n00:19:32.058 --> 00:19:32.881\nIt was that quick.\n\n312\n00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.714\n>> I tell you, and\nit really seems to me, Sean,\n\n313\n00:19:35.714 --> 00:19:40.790\nto highlight the importance of doing\ngood reconnoissance and scanning.\n\n314\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.600\nCuz really that was what you needed.\n\n315\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.610\nAnd once you figured out\nwhat service was running, or\n\n316\n00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.110\nwhatever it is you're trying\nto take advantage of.\n\n317\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.160\nOnce you had that information, the rest of\nit seems to be finding the right tool to\n\n318\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.020\nrun, and typing in a couple commands,\nsetting a couple of variables and going.\n\n319\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.980\nSo, it really comes down to doing good\nreconnaissance and good scanning,\n\n320\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.730\nfiguring out what's running on that\nmachine, whatever your target is, and\n\n321\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:05.960\nthen that's it.\n\n322\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.760\nThere's gonna be an exploit most\nlikely to take advantage of it.\n\n323\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.320\n>> Yeah, that is really it.\n\n324\n00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.060\nIn fact,\nyou may recall when we were doing the CEH,\n\n325\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.750\none of the things I said during the\nreconnaissance phase there is I said or\n\n326\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.420\nas they called it,\nfootprinting in the CEH.\n\n327\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.470\nI said if you're gonna\nspend some time there,\n\n328\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.710\nyou've gotta decide when you're\ngonna cut bait and move on.\n\n329\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.230\nBut you're gonna spend some time there and\nyou should set some goals.\n\n330\n00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.170\nAnd once you figure out those goals are,\nand\n\n331\n00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:41.010\nyou've accomplished them, you get those\naccomplished you cross this off the list,\n\n332\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:45.020\nsee if there's anything else that\nmight be of interest and then move on.\n\n333\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.370\nYou'll be able to set those goals.\n\n334\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.300\nAfter seeing stuff like this,\nyou'll be able to set those goals much\n\n335\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.740\nmore closely with a much\nhigher degree of accuracy now.\n\n336\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.610\nAnd that together with\nan experienced developed eye.\n\n337\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.890\nYou could cause some real serious\ndamage here pretty quickly for\n\n338\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.750\nlack of a better word.\n\n339\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.640\nYou can get into a system.\n\n340\n00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.670\nSo yeah doing the reconnaissance and\ndoing you're,\n\n341\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.920\ndoing that well and thoroughly and\nit's really gonna pay off big.\n\n342\n00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.220\nThat is what we try to emphasize\nin CEH is that there's so\n\n343\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.000\nmuch information you can gather.\n\n344\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.220\nYou can't gather it all but\ndo spend some time there.\n\n345\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.810\nAnd once you've got that and you will\nspend a good amount of time there.\n\n346\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.160\nThe time you spend there will\nreally help you in later stages.\n\n347\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.890\nAnd that's exactly what you're seeing.\n\n348\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.900\nSo that was a very good point to bring up.\n\n349\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.195\nYou do well there, you'll get,\nreap huge dividends here.\n\n350\n00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:38.320\n>> Yeah, good.\n\n351\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.370\nAll right, well again, another great demo,\nanother example of how we can take\n\n352\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.830\nadvantage of vulnerabilities in these\nsystems just by doing good reconnaissance,\n\n353\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.280\ndoing good scanning, and\n\n354\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.060\nthen using Metasploit with all of\nthose exploits that it has in it,\n\n355\n00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.350\nall those payloads that it has in it, to\ntake advantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n356\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.410\nAll right.\nSean, again a couple great demos there.\n\n357\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.700\nAnything else you want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n358\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.586\n>> There's not anything real\nspecific I'd want to throw in,\n\n359\n00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:10.026\nbut you've seen kind of the different\nthings that exploits can do.\n\n360\n00:22:10.026 --> 00:22:14.247\nReally, when you look at what we had at\nthe tail end of our previous scanning\n\n361\n00:22:14.247 --> 00:22:17.534\nphase and here,\nyou've seen three different exploits.\n\n362\n00:22:17.534 --> 00:22:21.669\nAnd that's really enough to kinda\ngive you an appreciation for\n\n363\n00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:26.349\njust the type of things that we can do,\ngiven the proper information and\n\n364\n00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:29.220\nproper orientation ahead of time.\n\n365\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.448\nWe can really get into that system and\nget in there fast.\n\n366\n00:22:33.448 --> 00:22:33.982\n>> Right.\n>> And so,\n\n367\n00:22:33.982 --> 00:22:37.444\nwhat you should be doing at this\npoint is now kind of brushing\n\n368\n00:22:37.444 --> 00:22:39.535\nup on your reconnaissance skills.\n\n369\n00:22:39.535 --> 00:22:43.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And really kinda learn how to gather\n\n370\n00:22:43.109 --> 00:22:47.700\ninformation completely and\nseeing those little details.\n\n371\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.610\nAnd then just start trying\nmetasploit with different\n\n372\n00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:57.340\noperating systems, and different items.\n\n373\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.010\nAnd see what you can get out of it.\n\n374\n00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.850\nCuz there's literally so\n\n375\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.210\nmany different ways you could\nbust into a system using this.\n\n376\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:10.980\nSo yeah, you should really spend\nsome time setting up a lab,\n\n377\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.800\ntesting in different environments.\n\n378\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.380\nThis is a good time for\nyou even to consider maybe\n\n379\n00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.810\ngetting something like Nexpose,\nthe community edition.\n\n380\n00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:24.150\nGet that, and sweep some of the systems\nthat, if you get permission of course,\n\n381\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.230\nsweep some of the systems at your\nbusiness if you get a chance and\n\n382\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.890\nsee what vulnerabilities they have.\n\n383\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.070\nSee if metasploit has\nanything on those and\n\n384\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:37.860\nthat can get you kind of a foot in the\ndoor towards seeing what you can do and\n\n385\n00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.870\nreally kind of expand horizons and\nstuff like that.\n\n386\n00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.500\nSo, but you really gotta play with it and\n\n387\n00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.800\ntry these things out and\nsee what you can do.\n\n388\n00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.400\nOnce you get a handle on it,\nyou'll be doing this stuff left and right.\n\n389\n00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.420\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n390\n00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.260\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n391\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.560\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n392\n00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.128\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n393\n00:23:55.128 --> 00:23:56.567\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:16.231\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.150\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.681\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:18.263\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:19.760\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.080\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.790\nWe're continuing on in\nour metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.680\nAnd this one, Sean,\nwe're going into something called, and\n\n11\n00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.860\nmake sure I say this right,\nthe meterpreter.\n\n12\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.660\n>> Works for me.\n\n13\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's what we're gonna do.\n\n14\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.030\nAnd if you don't know what\nthat is that's okay because\n\n15\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.670\nSean is here to tell us all about it and\nshow us how it works.\n\n16\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.640\nSo, Sean, what the heck is a Meterpreter?\n\n17\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.179\n>> Well that's the big thing.\n\n18\n00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.440\nWhat is it and what is it gonna offer you?\n\n19\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.430\nWell, to kind of really understand why\nthe Meterpreter is such a big deal and,\n\n20\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.620\nwhy we're going to spend a good amount\nof time on it is the best way to\n\n21\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.930\nunderstand it is to kind of see what\nwent before so we can compare and\n\n22\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.200\ncontrast what we had before and\nwhat we're gonna be doing with this.\n\n23\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.190\nSo if you go back to previous\nsegments in this course,\n\n24\n00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.610\nespecially the ones we had immediately\nprior to talking about the meterpreter.\n\n25\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.530\nYou will see that we ran\na series of exploits and\n\n26\n00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.160\ndelivered pay loads to a system.\n\n27\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.120\nWe also did stuff even earlier with.\n\n28\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.670\nWith Netcat, and we said we could\nput Netcat inside a trojan, and\n\n29\n00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.470\ndump that in the system, and\nhave it open up as a listener.\n\n30\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.970\nWe had those options.\n\n31\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.340\nSo there are some neat things,\nwe push a command shell, have\n\n32\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.310\nit open up a command shell in our system\nto interact with a target someplace.\n\n33\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.130\nAll really great things, and I think\na lot of you probably had your minds\n\n34\n00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.180\nblown seeing that just how quickly and\neasily you could do a lot of that.\n\n35\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.530\nIt was just like a few taps\nof the button you were in.\n\n36\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.949\n>> If you missed those episodes make\nsure you go back and check them out,\n\n37\n00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:01.792\nthey were pretty cool.\n\n38\n00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:08.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, you've seen what's possible here.\n\n39\n00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.440\nWe did a little bit with those exploits.\n\n40\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.490\nWe got into it,\nwe browsed the file system a bit, but\n\n41\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.640\nwe didn't do too much more but\nyou could do a lot more.\n\n42\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.620\nConsidering you had a shell, I always-\n>> The potential was there,\n\n43\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.380\nwe're sitting at a command prompter,\na shell on that other machine.\n\n44\n00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.300\nWe happened to do a directory command or\n\n45\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.210\na list command that we could have\ndone anything we wanted, right?\n\n46\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.980\n>> Yeah, you have a pretty good\ndegree of flexibility there.\n\n47\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.690\nSo you did have a number of things you\ncan do which is really cool, yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.450\nWe opened up a shell,\n\n49\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.895\nwe did directory listings,\nI think we ran a couple things I recall.\n\n50\n00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:53.810\nBut, you can do some stuff there, but\n\n51\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.650\nthere actually is some draw backs\nto do any of those methods.\n\n52\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.030\nThose methods we had previously why they\ndo work things like, for example, Netcat.\n\n53\n00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.200\nNetcat is gonna get caught.\n\n54\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.390\nI mean almost 100% of the time it's going\nto get caught nowadays because somebody's\n\n55\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.020\ngot an antivirus out there which is\nthe norm to have an antivirus or\n\n56\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.070\nsomething on your system.\n\n57\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.950\nIf you haven't gotten any\nantivirus on your system and\n\n58\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.020\nhow much sympathy is someone\ngonna have for you nowadays.\n\n59\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.780\nIt's like what?\n\n60\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.358\nYou have what on your system\nwell you deserved it.\n\n61\n00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:29.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n62\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.320\nNetcat is more likely gonna\nget caught by those, so\n\n63\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.670\nthat pretty much knocks that out\nof contention almost immediately.\n\n64\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.380\nAnd then the other guys kinda\nhave some drawbacks that they,\n\n65\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.120\nthe firewalls could stop them,\nwe could have anti-malware stuff that\n\n66\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.310\ncould stop them, so there's some things\nthat are actually standing in your way.\n\n67\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.815\nDoesn't mean you shouldn't try them,\nit just means that,\n\n68\n00:03:54.815 --> 00:04:00.360\nthere's kind of barrier there to\nimplementation to varying degrees.\n\n69\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.540\nIt just really depends on a given\nsituation, how diligent someone is,\n\n70\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.340\nhow to date, maybe they're antiviruses.\n\n71\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.790\nThere's a good number of\nthings happening there.\n\n72\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.830\nSo you put those in, okay,\nwe've got a barrier there.\n\n73\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.350\nAll right, so we go ahead and\nwe try those and maybe they don't work.\n\n74\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.150\nOr maybe we'd decide we really wanna kind\nof keep a low of a profile as possible,\n\n75\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.208\nhow do we do that.\n\n76\n00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:29.224\nAre we gonna find another\nway to do a fancy t-logger?\n\n77\n00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:33.170\nAre we gonna find,\nto deploy key logger rather.\n\n78\n00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.110\nAre we gonna do a, let's try to do a\npacket sniffing to see if there's insecure\n\n79\n00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.890\nprotocol that perhaps we can\ngrab something that way.\n\n80\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.710\nIs there any of those things available?\n\n81\n00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.710\nYeah, those are all options, but\n\n82\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.310\nthey still require certain things\nto be in place to make it work.\n\n83\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.530\nSo that brings us to, what else can\nwe do and that brings us to and\n\n84\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.910\nthat's where the Meterpreter comes in.\n\n85\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.760\nThe Meterpreter, what it is,\nis essentially a shell environment,\n\n86\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.430\nbut to just say it's a shell is way\nunderestimating what you can do with this.\n\n87\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.540\nWith a Meterpreter, you can go to\na system, use an exploit against it,\n\n88\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.210\nand open up the interpreter environment,\nand once you do that,\n\n89\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.820\nyou have that shell environment where\nyou can start querying the system.\n\n90\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.690\nYou can do all sorts of\ninteractions with it.\n\n91\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.960\nAny interaction you can do by\nsitting in front of that box,\n\n92\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.140\nyou can do with the meterpreter which is,\nthat in itself is pretty cool,\n\n93\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.080\nbut that's really not the end of it.\n\n94\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.428\nAnd as the saying goes,\nbut wait there's more.\n\n95\n00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:45.761\nThere definitely is\nsubstantially more here.\n\n96\n00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:50.424\nThe meterpreter even has it's\nown built in commands up and\n\n97\n00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:55.968\nabove what the standard operating\nsystem would have on its own.\n\n98\n00:05:55.968 --> 00:06:00.540\nSo the meterpreter will come in and\nopen up just a text environment, and\n\n99\n00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.750\nyou might be tempted to go through and\nstart doing directory listings and\n\n100\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.720\nrunning stuff and\ndoing assessments, which is great.\n\n101\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.540\nYou could use that at that point\nto do a tremendous amount.\n\n102\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.040\nYou could be mapping out the network,\nyou could be doing all sorts of scans and\n\n103\n00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.220\nstuff like that, you could be\npulling information off of it.\n\n104\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.142\nSo, that in itself is pretty cool, but\n\n105\n00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:28.044\na meterpreter, with these additional\ncommands, allows you do to so much more.\n\n106\n00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:33.030\nAllows you to query specific\ninformation about that system,\n\n107\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.280\nwhat the environment actually looks like.\n\n108\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.630\nIt allows you to do\nadvanced file transfers.\n\n109\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.820\nIt allows you even to gain a foot hold or\n\n110\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.620\na good amount of head way\ntowards doing things like our\n\n111\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.430\npassword cracking in our privilege\nescalations and clearing our tracks.\n\n112\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.580\nAll those phases we talked about, the CEH\nand some of the phases we talked about in\n\n113\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.090\nother places, the meterpreter\ncan give you a very easy way,\n\n114\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.070\nrelatively speaking of course,\nof pulling that off.\n\n115\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.041\nAnd those commands are built right in and\nI'll save some of the other stuff in here.\n\n116\n00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.787\nThis is called a cliffhanger.\n\n117\n00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:17.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a bunch of other stuff even\n\n118\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.970\nabove those things that you can do which\nis probably gonna be jaw-dropping.\n\n119\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.270\nAnd by the time we're done you'll\nprobably be a little paranoid or\n\n120\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.148\na lot paranoid,\nbecause of other stuff you can do.\n\n121\n00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:32.639\nSo it's an extremely powerful and\ncapable environment and\n\n122\n00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.517\nit works across platforms\nwhich is even more cool.\n\n123\n00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:42.018\nSince it is a payload and it's designed\nto be a universally exploitable,\n\n124\n00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:47.164\nreversely runnable payload,\nall you have to do is find an exploit for\n\n125\n00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:53.110\na specific system, and if that exploit\nwill allow you to deploy the meterpreter\n\n126\n00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.469\nwith it, you can just exploit a system,\ndrop the meterpreter onto it.\n\n127\n00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:59.479\nAnd it will open it up.\n\n128\n00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.608\nThat means you can run it on pretty\nmuch any flavor of Linux if you have\n\n129\n00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.670\nan exploitable vulnerability on there.\n\n130\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.860\nPretty much any version of Windows that\nhas an exploitable vulnerability on there,\n\n131\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.920\nand the list goes on,\nand on, and on, and on.\n\n132\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.750\nAnd there's even several ways to\ndeploy the Meterpreter as a payload.\n\n133\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.130\nThere's not just one way,\nthere's actually probably about a dozen or\n\n134\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.100\nmore ways to have the Meterpreter\nget onto, once it gets onto\n\n135\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.550\na system to actually run at that point, so\nthen just give you one way of running it.\n\n136\n00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.480\nThey gave you multiple exploits\nthat can deploy it, and\n\n137\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.990\nthey gave you multiple versions of the\npayload that used different protocols, and\n\n138\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.710\nthen so on and so forth to make it work.\n\n139\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.992\nThey, for example,\nhave ones that work with IP6 and IP4.\n\n140\n00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:51.347\nThey have ones that work with DNS and\nall the little intricacies of DNS.\n\n141\n00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:55.462\nThey have ones that work over HTTP,\nand HTTPS, and the list goes on, and\n\n142\n00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:56.216\non, and on.\n\n143\n00:08:56.216 --> 00:09:02.730\nSo you're talking, like I said a lot\nof flexibility there with this,\n\n144\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.760\nand you put that together with the fact\nthat you can go across all these operating\n\n145\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.850\nsystems and get that shell, and still\nhave all these commands that are unique\n\n146\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.380\nto the interpreted environment plus\nall the stuff that OS already has.\n\n147\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.368\nI mean,\nit really kinda sets the stage for a lot.\n\n148\n00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:19.064\n>> That is impressive.\n\n149\n00:09:19.064 --> 00:09:22.640\nSo it's kinda the, I don't want\nto say the new version of Netcat.\n\n150\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.730\nBut it is something that we could\nkinda consider a replacement or\n\n151\n00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.322\na new modern version to\nsomething like like that?\n\n152\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.460\n>> Yeah.\nYou could make it to.\n\n153\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.980\nWell, yeah, and\nthen some of you would probably be right.\n\n154\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.550\nYou've got a lot of\nfunctionality already in Netcat,\n\n155\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.340\nbut then Meterpreter takes that and\nsays, I'll bring that in.\n\n156\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.460\nBut you can say it's also\nbringing in remote desktop stuff,\n\n157\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.210\nand it's bringing in all\nthese other things with it,\n\n158\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.815\nplus a bunch of other things you\nprobably haven't thought of in a while.\n\n159\n00:09:52.815 --> 00:09:55.680\nOr probably didn't even\nexpect to even be there, so\n\n160\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.665\nsome [LAUGH] really, really cool stuff.\n\n161\n00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:04.145\nAnd what makes it really neat is the fact\nthat as opposed to those other ones,\n\n162\n00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:08.115\nthe way it's constructed,\nit is much easier for\n\n163\n00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:13.085\nthis to slip under the radar of\ndetection than the other guys would.\n\n164\n00:10:13.085 --> 00:10:16.858\nSo that, you put all the stuff\nI've already said, and\n\n165\n00:10:16.858 --> 00:10:18.919\nwhich has been kind of vague.\n\n166\n00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:22.578\nWhat I'm saying some of these\nfunctions that Meterpreter has,\n\n167\n00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.959\nI've given you some specifics in there.\n\n168\n00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.529\nBut there's just so many,\ninstead of going to each one individually,\n\n169\n00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:32.620\nI'll let you see one, and introduce\nwhich one formally as we go through.\n\n170\n00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.280\nBut you can consider that,\nsomething can get under the radar and\n\n171\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.410\ndo all this stuff,\nit's really mind blowing.\n\n172\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.100\nIt's one of the coolest things you\nhave right inside of Metasploit.\n\n173\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> So-\n\n174\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.630\n>> And it is part of,\n\n175\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.500\nthat was my next question,\nthat it is part of Metasploit,\n\n176\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.370\nit's not something I have\nto download separately?\n\n177\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.250\n>> Right.\nIt's right there\n\n178\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.410\nin Metasploit right out of the gate.\n\n179\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.120\nThere's nothing special you\nhave to do to get this.\n\n180\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.910\n>> Nice.\n\n181\n00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.040\nNice.\n\n182\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.356\nAll right, so it sounds like something\nthat I really wanna take a look at.\n\n183\n00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:03.390\nAnd you're saying that it gives me\nthe ability to do remote commands.\n\n184\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.404\nYou mentioned remote desktop.\n\n185\n00:11:05.404 --> 00:11:09.436\nWhat other kind of things\ncan we do with this thing?\n\n186\n00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:13.293\n>> You could do things like,\nit actually does have for example,\n\n187\n00:11:13.293 --> 00:11:15.962\nit has the ability like\nI said to run stuff,\n\n188\n00:11:15.962 --> 00:11:21.103\nyou would already be able to run On the\noperating system, you were sitting there.\n\n189\n00:11:21.103 --> 00:11:25.678\nThink of something like if someone\nhad a system that had just\n\n190\n00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:29.600\nthe standard stuff,\nlike on the Windows side.\n\n191\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.490\nThere's already a lot that you can do.\n\n192\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.960\nBut Meterpreter brings\nadditional stuff to the table.\n\n193\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.293\nIt actually brings in its own,\njust in case there isn't one\n\n194\n00:11:37.293 --> 00:11:42.105\ninstalled locally on the box, it actually\nhas its own packet sniffers built into it.\n\n195\n00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:43.780\nIt has its own abilities to do that.\n\n196\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.300\nSo you could sync along the interface and\njust grab it, and\n\n197\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.740\nstart pulling packets off that system.\n\n198\n00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.280\nSo that's really cool,\nit already has that built in.\n\n199\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.320\nIt has stuff specifically to,\nafter you run whatever you're running,\n\n200\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.620\nit has stuff specifically designed to\ngo out there and clear those tracks,\n\n201\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.360\nwhich is, I think,\nanother really cool thing.\n\n202\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.599\nThat they thought ahead about that saying,\nyeah, well, there's gonna be evidence left\n\n203\n00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:13.907\nbehind, you're on a Windows system,\nthere's some logs out there?\n\n204\n00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.595\n[SOUND] Now there isn't, done.\n\n205\n00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:19.106\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They've got it set up like that,\n\n206\n00:12:19.106 --> 00:12:23.895\nand then they even have commands\nspecifically in the product that\n\n207\n00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:27.922\nare directly concerned with\nshutting down defenses.\n\n208\n00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:30.253\nThey've got it in some cases so\n\n209\n00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:36.180\neasy that you could shut down some of\nthe major defenses with a single command.\n\n210\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.360\nYou don't have to run several\ncommands to find it and\n\n211\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.210\ntry to kinda knock it down and\nknock it out.\n\n212\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.620\nNo, you're just like type a few\ncharacters in, hit Enter, and it's out.\n\n213\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.641\nIt's down for the count.\n\n214\n00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:50.567\nYou're gonna move onto the next thing.\n\n215\n00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:55.670\nSo, yeah,\nthere's just a lot going on here.\n\n216\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.830\nSo it depends on just how\nmuch of that you wanna use.\n\n217\n00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.310\nYou got to also consider the fact that\nwhen you're using a utility like this,\n\n218\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.380\nit's extremely powerful.\n\n219\n00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.860\nBut you also need to factor in that while\nit's extremely powerful and I'm telling\n\n220\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:17.220\nyou that you can slide under the detection\nmechanisms quite easily in a lot of cases.\n\n221\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.080\nThere is a limit.\n\n222\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.915\nDon't think this is something that makes\nyou essentially invulnerable to any sort\n\n223\n00:13:21.915 --> 00:13:22.637\nof detection.\n\n224\n00:13:22.637 --> 00:13:28.542\nIt's something that makes detection\na lot tougher on the defensive side,\n\n225\n00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:33.780\nbut if you get careless they\nare definitely gonna pick you up.\n\n226\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.053\nYou don't start getting a swollen head and\nbe like yeah, I have the power and\n\n227\n00:13:37.053 --> 00:13:38.880\nstart going through and doing that.\n\n228\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.479\nYeah.\nYou do have a lot of power.\n\n229\n00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:42.858\nI think with great power\ncomes great responsibility.\n\n230\n00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:45.776\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think that you still kind of have to\n\n231\n00:13:45.776 --> 00:13:47.236\nexercise patience and\n\n232\n00:13:47.236 --> 00:13:52.550\nall that stuff we've kind of been putting\nin your head all along with pen testing.\n\n233\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.490\nYou have to be patient, you have to\nbe very meticulous about something,\n\n234\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.900\nvery targeted,\ndon't start just poking around.\n\n235\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.060\nThe stuff we're doing today, we're not\neven gonna worry about the defensive\n\n236\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.970\nside except to go through and\nkind of cause them grief.\n\n237\n00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.190\nThat's about it.\n\n238\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.540\nWe're not gonna worry so\nmuch about them detecting us yet.\n\n239\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.140\nSo that's something that's\ngonna come later on.\n\n240\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.110\nOf course, there are ways for\nthem to detect us, but\n\n241\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.170\nthey've really got to be aware\nthat this is even possible.\n\n242\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.511\nAnd I can almost guarantee there's\nprobably a number of people who will watch\n\n243\n00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:29.533\nthis and their jaws are gonna drop.\n\n244\n00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:33.772\nYou've seen this stuff yesterday with\nall of those shells being opened already\n\n245\n00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.049\nyou're like, well that was really cool,\n\n246\n00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:39.770\nand then this comes to the table and\nsays, [LAUGH] yeah, forget that.\n\n247\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.801\nLet me show you how it's really done.\n\n248\n00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.410\nSo it will bring a whole\nother level to it.\n\n249\n00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:50.022\n>> Yeah, so I would imagine that\nthe Meterpreter as you were saying,\n\n250\n00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:54.250\nmight be able to slide under the radar,\nbut some of the commands we're running\n\n251\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.740\nmight not, so that's where you're\nsaying that caution comes into play.\n\n252\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.350\nJust because the Meterpreter\nitself doesn't get snagged\n\n253\n00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.610\nif you start running scans from there or\ndoing remote desktop things like that.\n\n254\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.200\nThat's where we get ourselves in trouble.\n\n255\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.970\n>> Yeah, absolutely, if you start\nchanging settings on the system,\n\n256\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.800\nwell that's probably gonna start\nraising some suspicions there.\n\n257\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.590\nIf well, of course, someone's looking or\n\n258\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.870\nif they have a system monitoring\nutility which is very common to have.\n\n259\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.600\nThat's gonna get picked up.\n\n260\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.298\nThere's also the possibility that\ndoing things that you may not\n\n261\n00:15:29.298 --> 00:15:34.351\nthink are all that bad,\nthat somebody's gonna be looking for that.\n\n262\n00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.890\nOne of the things it can do,\nis it can clear an event log.\n\n263\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.820\nIt has commands specifically for\nclearing Windows event logs.\n\n264\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.050\nYou're not doing anything, so you don't\nreally have to jump through any hoops.\n\n265\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.310\nYou just type a few things in and\nit's done.\n\n266\n00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.650\nThose things are gone.\n\n267\n00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.876\nBut those things are also,\nif you clear logs,\n\n268\n00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:51.616\nthat just doesn't leave it like that.\n\n269\n00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:56.891\nSomeone's gonna see that, that event log\nis blank or they're gonna see more than\n\n270\n00:15:56.891 --> 00:16:02.180\nlikely they're gonna see an event in there\nsaying this was cleared at such a time.\n\n271\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.129\nThat draws their attention immediately.\n\n272\n00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:08.425\nOf course they're gonna have to do some\nadditional investigation to see exactly\n\n273\n00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:11.330\nwhat happened, but\nyou have got their attention, and\n\n274\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.428\nthat's exactly what you don't want.\n\n275\n00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:18.280\nYou know once you've attracted their\nattention they're gonna start digging.\n\n276\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.400\nAnd humans like to solve a mystery and\ngo in there, so\n\n277\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.340\nyou've given them a mystery to solve.\n\n278\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.680\nIf you are more conservative,\nand stay off that radar,\n\n279\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.130\nyou can actually leave a few things here\nand there, but as long as they're smaller.\n\n280\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.430\nAnd they're not enough to draw attention,\n\n281\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.200\non themselves,\nSomeone's probably not gonna look.\n\n282\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.250\nOr they're gonna see it when it's too\nlate and the trail's gone cold and\n\n283\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.700\nI'm happy and\ngoing on to greener pastures.\n\n284\n00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.850\n>> Yeah, hopefully by the time we're\nout of there we've already turned\n\n285\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.340\nin our report on our pen test.\n\n286\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.100\nWe're like, ha, ha.\n\n287\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Missed a-\n\n288\n00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.300\n>> Yeah, it's really a question\n\n289\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.100\nof that yeah.\n\n290\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.530\nAnd you,\nthis is also one of those things that,\n\n291\n00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.570\nmake sure when you're using metasplit\nin a pen testing environment,\n\n292\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.830\nmake sure you are definitely\nkeeping track of everything you do.\n\n293\n00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.950\nBecause this is one of\nthose tools that it's so\n\n294\n00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.550\neasy to do stuff that It can be\nsomewhat easy to leave stuff behind.\n\n295\n00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.600\nYou may transfer files to a system and do\ndifferent things and get what you need to.\n\n296\n00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.090\nRemember to clean up after yourself\nbecause this makes it so easy.\n\n297\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.820\nIt's like, oh well okay,\nI've got the information I need to.\n\n298\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.520\nI dropped this off,\nthis off, and this off.\n\n299\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.750\nAnd okay, it's the system's vulnerable,\nthe system has this problem, whatever.\n\n300\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.230\nAnd you move on to the next phase.\n\n301\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.880\nDon't do that.\n\n302\n00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.890\nMake sure you've kept good notes so\nyou can get that stuff off there,\n\n303\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.420\nbecause if you're using it for, we're\nteaching it to you for benign purposes.\n\n304\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.590\nWe don't want you to do\nanything evil with it.\n\n305\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:52.750\nThat's we're specifically\nencouraging you not to do.\n\n306\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.130\nSomeone could use it if you open up\nthese holes and don't close them, or\n\n307\n00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.830\nleave something behind\nthat they can exploit.\n\n308\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.450\nIt's happened,\n\n309\n00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.180\nit's definitely happened where someone's,\nI think of stuff like netcat.\n\n310\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.450\nSomeone's used that in their testing and\ndropped it off then they've\n\n311\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.950\ndropped it off, did some testing with it,\nand connected and transferred files or\n\n312\n00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.420\nwhatever, and said okay, I'm good,\nI've confirmed that I can get this by.\n\n313\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.340\nAnd they're happy,\n\n314\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.520\nand they put it on the port report and\nthey say I've got it on your system.\n\n315\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.490\nThey never took it off the system,\nso now someone comes in and\n\n316\n00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.810\ndoes a scan and sees it there,\nand they go right on it.\n\n317\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.980\nIt's happened numerous times with,\nreally, everything in PEN testing,\n\n318\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.510\nand this is\n>> Happens to be because it's so easy\n\n319\n00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.960\nhere, once you know how to do it, that you\ncould very well leave something behind.\n\n320\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.915\nAnd that's not gonna look good for you.\n\n321\n00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you do that.\n\n322\n00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.850\nAnd that could actually lead to a lot\nof legal troubles if you leave that\n\n323\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.350\nbehind, too.\n\n324\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.320\n>> Yeah I could see that.\n\n325\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.530\nSo definitely a good point.\n\n326\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.320\nWe're talking about doing pen tests,\n\n327\n00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.200\nwe really gotta make sure we\nclean up after ourselves.\n\n328\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.430\nWe take advantage of some vulnerability,\nwe load up some exploit,\n\n329\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.320\nwe deliver some payload,\nwe wanna make sure we get that off.\n\n330\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.750\nWe wanna leave it there after we\nwalk away from that company and\n\n331\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.040\nleave them vulnerable to that.\n\n332\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.510\nSo gotta make sure we\nget that stuff ff there.\n\n333\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.590\n>> Yeah.\nHow many times have\n\n334\n00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.878\nyou even heard of stuff like that\nif you've been in pen testing?\n\n335\n00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:11.060\nI'm sure, you know, a lot of people out\nthere have heard of that happening.\n\n336\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.050\nPeople weren't using a tool and\njust leaving something behind.\n\n337\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.370\nAnd someone comes out and\nfinds it later on.\n\n338\n00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.620\nThere's been cases where people\nhave put stuff on the system that\n\n339\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.510\nthey think is just easy for them to do\nadministration, and that's exploited so\n\n340\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.510\nif that happens of course\nthis stuff is gonna happen.\n\n341\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:34.770\nThe one that we exploited\npreviously was Was VNC.\n\n342\n00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:40.030\nVNC is something that it's,\nVNC is not anything, it's not\n\n343\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.980\na piece of malware, it's not something\nthat's bad or designed for hacking.\n\n344\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.440\nIt's a legitimate tool and\nit has been for a long time.\n\n345\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.420\nAnd if you use it carefully and\nwith the right consideration,\n\n346\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.170\nIt's something that is perfectly\nfine to have there and it's safe.\n\n347\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.050\nSafe as it can be you know\nall things considered.\n\n348\n00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.740\nBut, if you're not careful and you do\nsomething like you did yesterday which is\n\n349\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.030\neasy for someone to download that tool and\nrun it and they're saying,\n\n350\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.440\noh, I got remote access and\nI can see the desktop.\n\n351\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.160\nThey forget about these things.\n\n352\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.200\nIt's quite easy for me to sweep\na system and find that it's there and\n\n353\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.220\npunch right into it and\ngo right on through.\n\n354\n00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.440\nAnd that's just if you make\na mistake on configuration.\n\n355\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:26.740\nWhat if you don't patch a system or\nany one of those things that allows to get\n\n356\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.940\nin and so this one of these,\nthis is, the meterpreter.\n\n357\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.380\nThe way we're going to get\nin on the system today is we\n\n358\n00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.350\nare going to start the whole process\nby actually you know, talking about\n\n359\n00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:45.320\nthe specific vulnerability we're\nusing to get us on to a system.\n\n360\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.940\nIt's actually a very common vulnerability.\n\n361\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.440\nAnd once you actually see\nwhat the vulnerability is,\n\n362\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.280\nit'll probably make you\nunderstand a lot more.\n\n363\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.960\nCuz every one of you that's been in IT for\nawhile for\n\n364\n00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.420\na reasonable amount of time, I think it's\nlike if you've been around for five,\n\n365\n00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.120\nsix, seven years, anywhere in there,\nyou actually seen or\n\n366\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.880\nheard of the specific vulnerability or\nsomething\n\n367\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.660\nthat took advantage of that specific\nvulnerability that we're gonna use.\n\n368\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.320\nThat caused a lot of problems for\npeople, so\n\n369\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.970\nwe're gonna be using the exact same\nvulnerability but for a different purpose.\n\n370\n00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:24.990\nAnd you'll get a new appreciation for\nit, for things at that point.\n\n371\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.530\nWe're gonna see kind of all that.\n\n372\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.550\n>> Tell you Sean,\nagain leaving us all full of cliffhangers.\n\n373\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.320\nWhich is not a bad thing [LAUGH] Alright\nwell a lot of good information Sean.\n\n374\n00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.730\nAnything else we wanna throw into?\n\n375\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.450\nI know we're all excited to see it,\nhow it works.\n\n376\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.240\nWe're just about out of time for\nthis episode,\n\n377\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.200\nso anything else you wanna throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n378\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.070\n>> I would recommend if you haven't\nseen the previous segments on opening up\n\n379\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:59.210\nshells through things like Samba and VNC,\ncause we had done those things in our\n\n380\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:05.940\nprevious sections with scanning and\nall that, and exploiting.\n\n381\n00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:12.150\nYou probably want to go back and at least\nview those so you can see what we did\n\n382\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.880\nthere, because a lot of those things are\ngoing to be pulled right over into here.\n\n383\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.760\nAs far as running the exploits and\nthe commands.\n\n384\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.310\nYou may wanna go and look at that,\nand see how it's done.\n\n385\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.020\nKind of get a feel for that.\n\n386\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.770\nAnd then you can go over here,\nand, you know, see what's similar,\n\n387\n00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.700\nas well as what's different\non the setup process.\n\n388\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.350\nSo I would strongly,\nstrongly encourage that.\n\n389\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.390\nIt's not something I'd say is required.\n\n390\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:40.010\nBut I would strongly encourage you to go\nback and look at those, so you can really\n\n391\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.860\nget a much stronger appreciation, and feel\nfor what we're going to be doing here.\n\n392\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.390\n>> Very good.\n\n393\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.860\nAll right.\nA lot of good information.\n\n394\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.650\nI hope everybody's as excited as I am\nto see how this meterpreter works.\n\n395\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.638\nBut for now, we're going to sign off and\nyou guys come back,\n\n396\n00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.879\ncheck the next episode.\n\n397\n00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:57.474\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n398\n00:22:57.474

00:00:16.520\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.540\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.350\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.210\nHow are you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.420\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.590\nExcited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.890\nWe've got another episode in\nour Metasploit series going on.\n\n10\n00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.210\nAnd this one we're actually continuing our\nthought process from the previous episode.\n\n11\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.040\nWe're covering the good old meterpreter.\n\n12\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.390\nSo if you missed that previous\nepisode make sure you go check it out.\n\n13\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.300\nWe kinda did an intro to\nwhat the meterpreter was and\n\n14\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.190\nsome of the things that we might be\nable to do with it but, Sean left us\n\n15\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.660\nwith a little bit of a cliffhanger, kinda\ngave us a hint of what we could do and\n\n16\n00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.660\nnow I think he's gonna do it again,\nI don't know.\n\n17\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.570\nWe're getting ready to take a look,\n\n18\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.760\nat least on how to get this thing started\nup, fired up, take our first look at it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.770\n>> Yeah that's what we're gonna do.\n\n20\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.574\nWe're gonna answer a bunch\nof question with it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.012\nThe first one being how long can\nit keep you guys in suspense.\n\n22\n00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:04.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in any case, yeah what we're gonna\n\n23\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.380\nlook at it is how do you get into actually\nlaunching this really powerful tool.\n\n24\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.070\nSo that's the big question is how\ndo you get in there and do that.\n\n25\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.730\nWell it is an exploit as we\nmentioned the first segment.\n\n26\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.410\nAnd the exploit releases\na payload onto a system.\n\n27\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.600\nSo we know that and we've actually\nseen that and that's why I was also\n\n28\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.850\nrecommending why I'm gonna go through\nthe process here one more time.\n\n29\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.840\nI was suggesting that you do in\nthe previous segment go back and\n\n30\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.050\nlook at what we had done\nin exploiting before so\n\n31\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.349\nyou can kind of see the process\na few times to get familiar with it.\n\n32\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030\nYeah so, that's what we're gonna do here,\nwe're actually gonna launch it,\n\n33\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.200\nand get it, and see how we get to\nthe point we can start the thing up.\n\n34\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.770\nSo, there's a few steps that\nare gonna happen there.\n\n35\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.400\nSo what we're gonna do is first of all,\nthe nature of the exploit we're gonna use.\n\n36\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.010\nYesterday, when we were talking about\nstuff, we looked at the Samba client.\n\n37\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.410\nWe went through and\nwe swept the Metasploitable system and\n\n38\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.390\nwe found Samba on there and\nwe used a Samba exploit specifically,\n\n39\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.710\nto target that, and then once we had\nit targeted we connected to it and\n\n40\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.250\nwe just started browsing the file system.\n\n41\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.080\nSo that was really easy to do.\n\n42\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.720\n>> It was.\n\n43\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.840\n>> We did that with VNC, same thing.\n\n44\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.300\nWe swept the system and found VNC was on\nthere so we just happened to have a VNC or\n\n45\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470\nnumber of VNC exploits, actually.\n\n46\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.450\nAnd we rolled those together and\n\n47\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.400\nput a payload and dropped it out there and\nit worked too, no problem.\n\n48\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.480\nSo we're doing this same thing here but\n\n49\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.862\nthere's gonna be some extra\nstuff happening, at the end, but\n\n50\n00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:01.998\nwe wanna talk about that first thing, that\nexploit that we're gonna put into play.\n\n51\n00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:07.180\nWe're not just going randomly\npicking something like samba or\n\n52\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.310\nVNC or anything like that.\n\n53\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.605\nWe have a very specific one we\nwanna use because it's one that\n\n54\n00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:17.290\nhas actually made some headlines for\nvarious reasons and\n\n55\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.387\nwe're only gonna show, we're gonna talk\nwith a couple of those things in here.\n\n56\n00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.317\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The one that we're gonna be\n\n57\n00:03:23.317 --> 00:03:27.925\nusing is one that, again,\nrelies on file sharing.\n\n58\n00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:32.395\nIt's a flaw in file sharing in\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n59\n00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:38.715\nAnd it's one that's actually been around\nfor a while, if you can believe that.\n\n60\n00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:40.260\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n61\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.418\n>> Say it isn't so.\n\n62\n00:03:41.418 --> 00:03:43.626\n>> I know.\n>> Are you saying Microsoft has not\n\n63\n00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:44.782\npatched a.\n\n64\n00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:46.546\n>> Yeah, hold on.\nLlet me say that with more conviction.\n\n65\n00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:49.042\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's actually been around for a while.\n\n66\n00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:51.313\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah,\n\n67\n00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:55.461\nit's when that was around for a while and\n\n68\n00:03:55.461 --> 00:04:00.585\nit did finally get patched\nafter something really\n\n69\n00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:06.000\ncatastrophic\n>> Happened that caused it to get patched.\n\n70\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.930\nSo the one we have relates to Microsoft's\n\n71\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.601\nknowledge base article, or\nyou can Google MS08-067.\n\n72\n00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:22.510\nI happen to have that up here on my\nscreen to show you on Microsoft's site.\n\n73\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.950\nWhat this is?\n\n74\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.291\nIt says a vulnerability in server service\ncould allow remote code execution.\n\n75\n00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:31.255\nYou don't say?\n\n76\n00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:33.217\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:35.108\n>> And just in case you guys didn't\n\n78\n00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.690\nnotice, its support for\nXP ended on April 8th of last year.\n\n79\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.550\nBut what we have in this article, it talks\nabout what the nature of this is and\n\n80\n00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.170\nyou can kind of when you go\nthrough this is it says right.\n\n81\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.580\nIt says right here what\nthe nature of this is.\n\n82\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.480\nThis is what we're exploiting right\nhere it says on Microsoft Windows\n\n83\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.950\n2000 based systems XP based and\nWindows Server 2003 based system.\n\n84\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.970\nThat this can be exploited over\nRPC without authentication and\n\n85\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.398\ncan run arbitrary code.\n\n86\n00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:16.440\nOkay, so\nthat's a big deal right there I mean,\n\n87\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.250\nand you know what's funny, you've\nactually heard that description before.\n\n88\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.180\nThis is Microsoft.\n\n89\n00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.106\nNo, sorry,\nI had to probably cut and paste.\n\n90\n00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:28.760\nBut you've heard that description.\n\n91\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.960\nIn all honesty, yes, you have heard that\ndescription to other Microsoft stuff\n\n92\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.000\nbefore, it's just a question of, yeah,\nit allows remote code to be exploited.\n\n93\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.550\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n94\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.920\nI know what remote code execution means,\nso can you be a little more specific?\n\n95\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.685\nThey were like, no.\n\n96\n00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:46.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n97\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.560\nso that's already big enough right there.\n\n98\n00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.853\nYou could run a remote code, but once you\nstart looking at some of the other stuff\n\n99\n00:05:54.853 --> 00:06:00.242\non here, there's some other stuff that's\nof interest here that could happen.\n\n100\n00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:06.267\nIt says if an exploit attempt failed this\ncould also lead to a crash in svchost.exe.\n\n101\n00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.280\nWell I don't know if you guys\nwere paying attention or not.\n\n102\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.990\nWhen you go through your task list,\nthere's a lot of svchosts running, so\n\n103\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.470\nthere's a lot of things.\n\n104\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.630\nThis could actually affect file sharing,\nprint sharing, name pipe sharing,\n\n105\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.610\nstuff like that, like it says,\nover the network.\n\n106\n00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.695\nIt has been addressed, and\nthe question is what caused this\n\n107\n00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:31.476\nto be addressed after being around for\n2000 based,\n\n108\n00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:35.746\nXP based, and 2003 server, that's a pretty\n\n109\n00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:40.751\nsignificant amount of time\nyou're talking about there.\n\n110\n00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:45.217\nI can almost see with 2000 and Windows\n2000 XP, most of us are pretty much\n\n111\n00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:49.093\nresigned to the fact or understand\nthe fact that XP is just basically,\n\n112\n00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:53.975\nthey put that, what I like to call the\nFisher-Price interface over Windows 2000.\n\n113\n00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:55.374\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With all the little bubbles and\n\n114\n00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:56.160\nstuff like that on it.\n\n115\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.020\nThat's pretty much what it is,\nwith some changes, of course, but\n\n116\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.670\nthat's pretty much what it is.\n\n117\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.590\nAnd then it just carry\nright on over to 2003.\n\n118\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.580\nI can almost understand the first two but\nthen you get over to that one.\n\n119\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.670\nOkay, whatever.\n\n120\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.545\nBut, what really causes to be\naddressed was a major, major,\n\n121\n00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:17.140\nmajor event that you a lot of you\nprobably that have spent some time,\n\n122\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.540\nthat have been in IT long enough spend\nsome time drinking Red Bulls and\n\n123\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.035\ncoffee and stuff like that,\ncleaning up the mess.\n\n124\n00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:24.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the mess that you cleaned up\n\n125\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.750\nwas known as this guy, as Conficker,\nwhat I have up on my screen.\n\n126\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.470\nConficker is the guy that actually\n\n127\n00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.670\nswept through everything and caused\nthem to say okay we've got to fix this.\n\n128\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:45.361\nAnd so yeah, a lot of you spent time\ngoing through and cleaning this up.\n\n129\n00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:49.340\nSo if this was in your nightmares for\na while and\n\n130\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.429\ncaused you not to get sleep,\nhey welcome back.\n\n131\n00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.005\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.718\n>> It's right here again so\n\n133\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:08:00.725\nit's kind of a fascinating\nthing when you look at it that.\n\n134\n00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:04.765\nWe're gonna use the same thing that\nConficker used to cause its damage.\n\n135\n00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:07.937\nWe're gonna be using\nthe same thing here to\n\n136\n00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:12.905\nbe running to at least to gain our\nfoothold to run the meterpreter.\n\n137\n00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:15.990\nSo, really think about that.\n\n138\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:22.780\nIt also, by the way, if you wanna do some\nresearch here, I'm giving this to you.\n\n139\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.160\nBecause if you do want\nto do that research,\n\n140\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.430\nyou can start looking on how\nCornficker was discovered and\n\n141\n00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.130\nyou can look at that knowledge based\narticle and start putting things together.\n\n142\n00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.094\nYou can play a little bit\ndetective there if you choose to.\n\n143\n00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:38.500\nYou can do that and kind of see,\nhow things came together.\n\n144\n00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.690\nAnd it gives you an understanding of\njust kind of what we're looking at.\n\n145\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.581\nAnd once you see how they found this, it\ncould also give you an idea of the process\n\n146\n00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:52.472\nthat goes into looking for problems and\ndefects on a system where Metasploit may\n\n147\n00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:57.005\nbe able to come in and help you to cause\nwhatever mischief you wanna cause.\n\n148\n00:08:57.005 --> 00:09:02.820\nAll right.\nSo we've got a vulnerability picked out.\n\n149\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.651\nWe know where we've heard of the\nvulnerability before even if they didn't\n\n150\n00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.039\nspecifically use the number for it.\n\n151\n00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:13.060\nMost of us have either\nencountered Cornficker or\n\n152\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.701\nwe've at least heard the stories from\nsomeone before that is really old and\n\n153\n00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.330\ngrumpy about the whole thing.\n\n154\n00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.010\nSo now we've kind of gotta look at,\n\n155\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:28.820\nhow do you actually exploit\nthat now we've got one chosen?\n\n156\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.300\nWe'll assume that you've done\nyour research or banner grabs or\n\n157\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.635\nwhatever you want wanna do.\n\n158\n00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:35.760\nEven your vulnerability scans\nwould help you out here.\n\n159\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.780\nYou've done those things and you've\nfound that you are vulnerable to this,\n\n160\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.880\nyou've got a system that\nhasn't been patched or\n\n161\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.660\nis still in a state where it\ncould be taken advantage of.\n\n162\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.770\nSo what we wanna do is with it selected,\nit's now time for\n\n163\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.680\nus to get in and\nstart taking advantage of the situation.\n\n164\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.590\nAnd that's really what it is, is taking\nadvantage of the whole situation.\n\n165\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.450\nSo, with that in mind,\nlet's go down the path\n\n166\n00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.370\nof taking advantage of that\nspecific vulnerability.\n\n167\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.310\nYeah, on a system.\n\n168\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.650\nSo, we've got a system that is vulnerable.\n\n169\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.250\nIn this case, it's an XP Service Pack\n2 system running back here.\n\n170\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.420\nIt's just running, I don't even have\nto interact with it, that's the thing,\n\n171\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.120\nI can just leave it there.\n\n172\n00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.690\nSo I'm just gonna, I have that\nWindows XP Service Pack 2 deal running.\n\n173\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.710\nOkay so\nwhat I'm gonna do is I know through my\n\n174\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.920\nprevious stuff and exploration,\nI know that that is indeed vulnerable.\n\n175\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.818\nSo what I'm gonna do is I have go\nthrough my list, I find an exploit and\n\n176\n00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:56.750\nthis exploit, it's even named with\nthat knowledge based article.\n\n177\n00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:02.259\nIf we zoom up here a bit,\nwe can actually see right there at the end\n\n178\n00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:08.010\nof the command line,\nyou can see it says MS0A_067_netapi.\n\n179\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.160\nIt's named after it.\n\n180\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.970\nThis is specifically from\nthat knowledge based article.\n\n181\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.617\nThey wrote this for that.\n\n182\n00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:19.670\nSo, that's how targeted these things get.\n\n183\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.130\nThey got a knowledge based article,\nsomeone looked at it, and was like,\n\n184\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.410\nI can write something for that.\n\n185\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.110\nAnd boom, they're right in.\n\n186\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.500\nSo, there we have.\n\n187\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.060\nSo, we've got an exploit.\n\n188\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.510\nSo, all we have to do, if we're gonna be\nfollowing along with the whole process\n\n189\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:37.350\nthat we did before, we load it on in,\nand boom, loads right on.\n\n190\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.210\nSo, we can see our red\nat our command prompt,\n\n191\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.190\nindicating that it has, indeed,\nbeen loaded in, so we are good there.\n\n192\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.620\nIt's saying, okay,\nnow it's awaiting instructions.\n\n193\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.500\nWhat we're gonna do is you can do an info,\nor you can do show options.\n\n194\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:00.390\nI know, by the way, yesterday I used\ninfo and I didn't use show options.\n\n195\n00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.800\nI used it once I think, and\nthen I said use your info one.\n\n196\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.380\nYou can use either.\n\n197\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:13.000\nAnd let me kind of tell you quickly here\nwhy you would use one over the other.\n\n198\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.210\nInfo, if you use info,\ninfo is going to give you more well, info.\n\n199\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.620\nIt's going to detail a lot more out for\nyou.\n\n200\n00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.550\nSo, that's good if you are just\nencountering that specific exploit,\n\n201\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.270\nor you want to have the extra\ninformation on hand.\n\n202\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.939\nIf I type info in here, you can see it's\ngot my description at the bottom and\n\n203\n00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:35.814\nit's got the references down there.\n\n204\n00:12:35.814 --> 00:12:39.702\nIf you need to have those things,\nthey're right there.\n\n205\n00:12:39.702 --> 00:12:41.020\nI mean, you can see in the references.\n\n206\n00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.710\nIt's got the TechNet article and\n\n207\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.870\na bunch of other things telling you\nspecifically about the vulnerability.\n\n208\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.820\nAnne's stuff from Rapid7\nabout the specific exploit.\n\n209\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.260\n>> Right.\n>> So if you need that, then hey,\n\n210\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.300\ncool, that's what you would use info for.\n\n211\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.760\nIf you don't need that and you just want\nto look at what needs to be configured,\n\n212\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.700\nthen you just do show options,\nand boom, and that's all cut off.\n\n213\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:11.250\nAnd you can see right\nhere it's just the facts.\n\n214\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.620\nSo I can see in here some\nstuff that I have to set.\n\n215\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.640\nI have, it says, our host.\n\n216\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.010\nSo, the remote host.\n\n217\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.680\nSo I do, set R host.\n\n218\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.070\nAnd I am going to use\nthe address of my remote system.\n\n219\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.940\nAnd just because I kinda forgot it here,\n\n220\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.210\nthat happens, what the IP\naddress of my remote system is.\n\n221\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.780\nIt's .138 in this case.\n\n222\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:46.117\nSo I am going to go over to my KLEE\nsystem, and type that bad boy in.\n\n223\n00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:54.534\nAnd so I've got set rhost to\n192.168.245.138 so I hit that.\n\n224\n00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:57.046\nAnd it's now pointed directly,\n\n225\n00:13:57.046 --> 00:14:01.610\nit's drawing a beat on that system,\nso that's good.\n\n226\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.680\nBut we're not done at all on this.\n\n227\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.320\nWe have to go and\nwe have to do another step here.\n\n228\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.560\nWhat we have to do is,\nthere's no payload loaded yet.\n\n229\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.010\nThere really is no payload.\n\n230\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.590\nSo what we can do is we can do show\npayloads and hit Enter on that.\n\n231\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.522\nAnd let's go ahead and\nsee what payloads are available.\n\n232\n00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:24.495\nOh, damn, that's a lot of payloads,\nain't it.\n\n233\n00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:25.633\n>> Got a few.\n[LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:28.204\n>> So you will see that there are quite\n\n235\n00:14:28.204 --> 00:14:30.960\na few payloads available with this.\n\n236\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.121\nAnd remember, all exploit does,\nis it finds that weakness\n\n237\n00:14:36.121 --> 00:14:41.500\non a system to push through, and\nto get that payload onto it.\n\n238\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.870\nOr we get an exploit that pushes\nthrough and drops its payload off.\n\n239\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.600\nSo this exploit is designed to\n\n240\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.380\nexploit a specific vulnerability\non the Windows operating system.\n\n241\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.552\nSo, all these things here will run on some\nversion of the Windows operating system.\n\n242\n00:14:58.552 --> 00:15:02.190\nIt may even target something\nvery specifically itself.\n\n243\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.426\nI mean, you can see in here when you start\nlooking at the actual slashes on it.\n\n244\n00:15:07.426 --> 00:15:09.620\nYou can see that we have Windows.\n\n245\n00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.200\nAll the ones on this screen I\nmean think about these too.\n\n246\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.170\nAll the stuff on this screen\nare all VNC based things.\n\n247\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.779\nI mean these are ones that open\nup things of a reverse HTTP and\n\n248\n00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:23.910\nTCP and all sorts of stuff.\n\n249\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.770\nThose all come with their own options.\n\n250\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.720\nThere's stuff with upload\nexecute in there, and\n\n251\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.560\nwe keep going on opening up shells,\ndifferent types of shells in here.\n\n252\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.900\nAnd then if we keep going up the list, and\n\n253\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.460\nI'm doing this just because I\nwanna show you just the cuz\n\n254\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.030\nwe saw stuff yesterday\nthat had only one payload.\n\n255\n00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.860\nIn some cases I loaded\none had maybe like three.\n\n256\n00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.750\nThis one just goes for broke and throws\neverything out at you, it seems like.\n\n257\n00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.285\nIf you look at what's on this screen,\nevery one of those is in some way,\n\n258\n00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:04.550\nshape or\nform designed to target The Meterpreter.\n\n259\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.550\nOr designed to deliver\na Meterpreter to that system.\n\n260\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:14.940\nYou can see ones in there that are doing\nall sorts of reverse connections.\n\n261\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.386\nYou have ones that exploit\nstuff in DNS and IP6.\n\n262\n00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:25.810\nYou see just a lot of them that are all\ndesigned specifically with that in mind.\n\n263\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.820\nAnd then, there's other ones for\nDLL injections and stuff like that,\n\n264\n00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.635\nthings we'll worry about at a later time.\n\n265\n00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:33.280\nAnd there's some more Meterpreter stuff.\n\n266\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.180\nI mean, they've got the deck\nstacked with this one.\n\n267\n00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.690\nI mean, they really have the deck stacked.\n\n268\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.670\nSo you've got just so\nmany things available to you.\n\n269\n00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.450\nI mean,\nlook at all those payloads that can be\n\n270\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.230\ndropped off with this specific exploit.\n\n271\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.345\nIt's almost not even fair.\n\n272\n00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:51.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] When you get down to it.\n\n273\n00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:56.244\nSo what we're gonna do is we need\n\n274\n00:16:56.244 --> 00:17:00.920\nto set a specific payload.\n\n275\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:07.250\nThat payload's gonna be this one,\nthe reverse TCP Connection.\n\n276\n00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.530\nSo I'm gonna say do a reverse TCP.\n\n277\n00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.780\nSo hit Enter on that, loads it in.\n\n278\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.250\nSo we're really just doing\nthe same things we did yesterday.\n\n279\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:22.030\nThis process is not really\nany different at all.\n\n280\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.710\nSo if I, again,\n\n281\n00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:30.530\ndo show options I bring up show options\nand take a look at what I have here.\n\n282\n00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.255\nI have the exploits options up top and\nI have the payload options down bottom.\n\n283\n00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:39.140\nSo we've got those two guys out there.\n\n284\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.796\nI'm gonna look through the list, and\n\n285\n00:17:40.796 --> 00:17:43.706\nyou see that every last one of these\nsettings has to be configured.\n\n286\n00:17:43.706 --> 00:17:46.190\nThey all say required.\n\n287\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.608\nPay attention to that,\nif you run an exploit,\n\n288\n00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:54.270\nor payload anything,\n\n289\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.170\nif somethings required,\nthat thing will not run without it.\n\n290\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.030\nWhat it will do is it will,\nif you try to run it right now,\n\n291\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.180\nit's gonna say, well,\nI can't exploit that.\n\n292\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.570\nBecause it will spit out saying LHOST is\nundefined, or something along those lines.\n\n293\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.170\nAnd you'll have to fix it.\n\n294\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.020\nSo just fyi, pay attention to it,\nit'll save you\n\n295\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.250\njust a little bit of time doing that,\nmaybe a little bit of frustration.\n\n296\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.436\nSo I'm gonna say set LHOST.\n\n297\n00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.810\nSo RHOST is remote, LHOST has to be local.\n\n298\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.530\nThe other end of it.\n\n299\n00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.540\nSo and if you think about it,\nit makes sense.\n\n300\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.720\nIf the RHOST is gonna\ntarget that remote system,\n\n301\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.920\nif this things gonna open up\na reverse connection to me and\n\n302\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.460\nput a shell on my system,\nwhich is what the Meterpreter is.\n\n303\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.360\nWell, then, I have to have a situation\nwhere it knows where I am.\n\n304\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.415\nAnd you'll also see on there by the way,\nyou'll see RPORT and LPORT.\n\n305\n00:18:53.415 --> 00:18:58.602\nRPORT 445, that's the standard service for\nfile sharing in this specific case.\n\n306\n00:18:58.602 --> 00:19:01.550\nAnd LPORT is just one I\nhave configured here.\n\n307\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.870\nI could configured it for another one.\n\n308\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.530\nThat the listener is gonna wait for\nsome connection to come in.\n\n309\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.510\nWhen it comes in\nan interpreter will open up.\n\n310\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.570\nSo gonna set that LHOST, and\n\n311\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.910\nI'm gonna set that LHOST\nto my local address here.\n\n312\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.046\nMy local address, it should be,\n\n313\n00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:27.881\nlet me double check to make\nsure I've got it, so it is 139.\n\n314\n00:19:27.881 --> 00:19:33.357\nI will go right back over\nhere to set LHOST and\n\n315\n00:19:33.357 --> 00:19:38.396\ndo 192.168.245.139.\n\n316\n00:19:38.396 --> 00:19:40.777\nI hit that.\n\n317\n00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:44.180\nRight at this point we\nare in really good shape,\n\n318\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.450\nto kinda take this to the next level.\n\n319\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.784\nNow, if you're following along and\nrunning this at\n\n320\n00:19:51.784 --> 00:19:56.716\nhome make sure just fyi,\nI had a little bit of this problem.\n\n321\n00:19:56.716 --> 00:20:00.810\nThat's the delay a bit today.\n\n322\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:05.750\nMake sure one of the things that could\ncause you a little bit of grief and\n\n323\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.510\nit makes total sense.\n\n324\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.413\nIt wasn't for the reasons you might think,\nbut we had some.\n\n325\n00:20:11.413 --> 00:20:14.550\nThe problem we had over here.\n\n326\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.420\nLet me go back over to Kali.\n\n327\n00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.160\nMake sure that you can, which [INAUDIBLE].\n\n328\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.910\nMake sure that you can\nping that other system.\n\n329\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.020\nIf this fails in your virtual environment,\n\n330\n00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.520\none of the first things you wanna do\nis see if you can ping between the two.\n\n331\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.640\nMake sure you have connectivity.\n\n332\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.197\nIf you don't have connectivity,\nwell, this ain't gonna work.\n\n333\n00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:43.179\nAin't nothing gonna work at that point,\nso make sure that's taken care of.\n\n334\n00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:47.462\nSo once we have that all done and\nconfigured,\n\n335\n00:20:47.462 --> 00:20:51.980\nwe are, I'll go over here,\nwe are ready to go.\n\n336\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:58.470\nWe got everything, just one more time to\nbe consistent, I will do the show options.\n\n337\n00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.960\nHey, everything's configured,\neverything's rocking and\n\n338\n00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.200\nrolling, I've got the remote system,\nthe local system.\n\n339\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.085\nI've got the ports.\nIt looks like everything's good.\n\n340\n00:21:06.085 --> 00:21:12.835\nAll we have to do now is run the command,\nexploit, and keep our fingers crossed.\n\n341\n00:21:12.835 --> 00:21:15.944\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As we run the term, exploit, and\n\n342\n00:21:15.944 --> 00:21:20.370\nyou'll see it's gonna go out there and\nit is talking to the client.\n\n343\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.540\nAnd all of a sudden, boom,\n\n344\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.040\nit's got the interpreter has\ncome right up at that point.\n\n345\n00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.940\nSo what we have is we actually have\nthat shell open remotely on its system.\n\n346\n00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.156\nThat is attached and\nit did it very quickly here.\n\n347\n00:21:32.156 --> 00:21:35.835\nAnd so, it typically will\nbe pretty quick like that.\n\n348\n00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:40.575\nYou can see it identified the system,\nit fingerprinted it, so if you notice\n\n349\n00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:44.915\nit says up top before I run the exploit\nit says automatic targeting there, so\n\n350\n00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:46.725\nit has to detect the system.\n\n351\n00:21:46.725 --> 00:21:49.604\nSo it spit it back out saying,\nhey, I know what system you are.\n\n352\n00:21:49.604 --> 00:21:53.441\nIt's saying it's attempting to\ntrigger the vulnerability, so\n\n353\n00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:56.740\nit's confirming\nthe vulnerability is there.\n\n354\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.790\nIt found it, and it quickly talked\nto it and opened up a session.\n\n355\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.970\nAnd you can see, right in the bottom,\n\n356\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:10.170\nsession one opened from my system to\nthe remote system, it's all ready to go.\n\n357\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.195\nAnd I can confirm it just by doing some\ncommands on there and it's gone through.\n\n358\n00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:21.880\nAnd shown me that it is actually\nconnected to that Windows system.\n\n359\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.310\nAnd so, that's just the start of things.\n\n360\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:31.350\nWe've connected, we've launched it,\nand so that sets the stage for\n\n361\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.420\nall other fun and games that we\nhave just coming around the corner.\n\n362\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.470\nSo just to kinda quickly\ngo through it here,\n\n363\n00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:45.720\nto make sure we understand the process\nthat was going on, we went through,\n\n364\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.970\nwe found that there was a vulnerability\nthere that we could take advantage of.\n\n365\n00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:57.090\nWe loaded the exploit that was appropriate\nto take advantage of that vulnerability.\n\n366\n00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.770\nAnd then, we just configured it.\n\n367\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.500\nWe loaded the appropriate payload, and\n\n368\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.560\nset all the options as needed, and\nran exploit, and then just waited.\n\n369\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.140\nAnd it came right back.\n\n370\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.898\nSometimes it will take a little\nlonger to come back, and if it does,\n\n371\n00:23:13.898 --> 00:23:16.906\nas long as we don't see\na flat out failure.\n\n372\n00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:18.171\nWe're good.\n\n373\n00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:21.700\nDo expect that sometimes that will happen.\n\n374\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.930\nYou have a slower network or something,\n\n375\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.370\nthis machine's just having\na little bit of issues, whatever.\n\n376\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.190\nIt could take a little\nmore time to come back.\n\n377\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.880\nI've seen that happen.\n\n378\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.520\nAnd if that happens, just wait it out.\n\n379\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.216\nIf it fails, there's things you can\nactually configure to make it wait\n\n380\n00:23:37.216 --> 00:23:40.246\na little longer before it times out or\nanything like that.\n\n381\n00:23:40.246 --> 00:23:49.170\nBut under normal conditions it\nshould come up reasonably quickly.\n\n382\n00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.203\nSo we are, like I said, in the system.\n\n383\n00:23:53.203 --> 00:23:55.550\nAnd what can we do?\n\n384\n00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.380\nWell, what do you wanna do at\nthis point would be the thing to\n\n385\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.410\nask when we show a bunch of things\nyou can do, but what do you wanna do?\n\n386\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.595\nI've already shown that,\n\n387\n00:24:04.595 --> 00:24:09.155\nand I have confirmed that I do\nhave access to the system and\n\n388\n00:24:09.155 --> 00:24:14.193\nI can run something like a simple\ncommand like sysinfo in here.\n\n389\n00:24:14.193 --> 00:24:18.523\nI could run it and I fingered\nthe system again, and says it knows\n\n390\n00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:23.589\nspecifically what that system is and\nthat is what it is if I flipped over and\n\n391\n00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:28.040\nlooked at the Windows XP system,\nthat would all check out.\n\n392\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.490\nRight across the board.\n\n393\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.803\nSo we've got it.\n\n394\n00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:36.360\nWe got a clear shot at causing\nmischief on this system right now.\n\n395\n00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.072\nAnd so, we're gonna be doing that.\n\n396\n00:24:38.072 --> 00:24:41.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n397\n00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.558\n>> The fun begins.\n\n398\n00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:48.350\n[LAUGH] All right, well, Sean, leaving us\nwith another cliffhanger then, aren't you?\n\n399\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.360\nCuz you're gonna show us how\nto get all this set up, and\n\n400\n00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.390\nthen we're gonna take our break.\n\n401\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.835\nWe're gonna stop this episode.\n\n402\n00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:55.692\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n403\n00:24:55.692 --> 00:25:01.820\nthe intention was here to kinda break\nit into obvious stages in here.\n\n404\n00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.470\nAnd we've got,\nthis is the first stage of the process,\n\n405\n00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.830\nyou wanna make sure you grasp that.\n\n406\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:13.210\nSo we took the time to really understand\nhow things progress through, rather\n\n407\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.380\nthan just say, hey, I'm picking something\noff the shelf and dropping it in.\n\n408\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.415\nI showed you exactly what it was using.\n\n409\n00:25:19.415 --> 00:25:21.755\nWe talked, already,\nabout how to find things.\n\n410\n00:25:21.755 --> 00:25:25.785\nTalked about which one we were using,\nwhere it came into play,\n\n411\n00:25:25.785 --> 00:25:27.445\njust went right on through.\n\n412\n00:25:27.445 --> 00:25:30.590\nSo we've got the first part of it done.\n\n413\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.490\nSo now, we get to in the next segment,\n\n414\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:39.540\nhave fun with the newly created\nconnection we have, that shell.\n\n415\n00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.769\nAnd that really is a lot of fun, trust me.\n\n416\n00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:45.554\n>> [LAUGH] I hope you guys are looking\nforward to it as much as I am,\n\n417\n00:25:45.554 --> 00:25:46.510\nI know I am.\n\n418\n00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.660\nSo, anyway.\n\n419\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.350\nThat's gonna do it for\nthis particular episode, though.\n\n420\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.290\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick,\n\n421\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.220\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n422\n00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.051\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:25:54.051 --> 00:26:00.200\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14.920\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.680\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oryiano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.890\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.520\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.160\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.090\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way today.\n\n9\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.770\nWe're still in our Metasploit series, and\n\n10\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.670\nin this episode we're gonna\ntake a look at Meterpreter.\n\n11\n00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.910\nNow if you've been watching the previous\nepisodes you know that we've done a couple\n\n12\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.600\non Meterpreter.\n\n13\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.840\nWe've seen how to get it loaded up.\n\n14\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.410\nWe've seen how to configure it.\n\n15\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.300\nNow Sean we actually want to\nsee how to use it, right?\n\n16\n00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.335\n>> Yeah that's a really good thing and\nthat's where the fun really starts.\n\n17\n00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean that's the thing we want to\n\n18\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.800\nmention.\n\n19\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.165\nWe're going to bring a lot of\nstuff together at this point,\n\n20\n00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:55.160\ncuz when we left Things off\nin the previous segment.\n\n21\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.820\nWe had just got to a point where\nwe had the Meterpreter prompt.\n\n22\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.120\nAnd we had confirmed that we actually had\na connection to our XP system out there.\n\n23\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.100\nSo we'd already got to\na pretty major point.\n\n24\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.610\nWe got connections, we went through\ninto quick directory listing.\n\n25\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.730\nAnd to confirm that we were at that point.\n\n26\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.290\nSo we're in the zone I\nguess is the way to say it.\n\n27\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.360\nThe question now is,\nwhat are we gonna do at this point?\n\n28\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.530\nWell there's seemingly an unlimited number\nof things you can do at this point.\n\n29\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.550\nIt's just really kind of up\nto you what you wanna do?\n\n30\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.311\nYou know, so,\nwhen you have a Meterpreter up,\n\n31\n00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.600\nMeterpreter gives you access\nto all these system commands.\n\n32\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.920\nit also gives you access to\nit's own commands, which really\n\n33\n00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.600\nchange the playing field dramatically\nonce you see, you know, what they are.\n\n34\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.440\nIt really does have a big,\nbig, big change on what you\n\n35\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.850\ncan do, and different actions\nyou can take at that point.\n\n36\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.492\nSo let's go back in to Meterpreter,\n\n37\n00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:12.310\nI've got Meterpreter back\nup here on my screen.\n\n38\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.950\nAnd just to kind of\ngive you a peek over on\n\n39\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.020\nwhat's happening on the XP system,\nthe XP system is just how I left it.\n\n40\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.130\nSo I do have that connection.\n\n41\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.600\nYou can see I just tabbed over and I\nstill out in that Meterpreter connection.\n\n42\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.350\nBut I've got, you know,\n\n43\n00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.140\nhere's the XP system,\nthere is no prompt open at the bottom.\n\n44\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.940\nIf I were to open up you know,\ntask manager and\n\n45\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.740\nlook at the processes running,\nthere's really nothing you know,\n\n46\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.430\njumping out at me that's out\nof the ordinary in there.\n\n47\n00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.650\nIt looks all entirely normal.\n\n48\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.780\n>> So as far as their concerned,\nthey don't know you're in there.\n\n49\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.650\n>> Yeah, it's business as usual.\n\n50\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.010\nNow, there's things they could look for,\nbut\n\n51\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.690\nit's stuff that they're probably\nnot gonna look for just because.\n\n52\n00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.250\nThey're not gonna look for\nit for no reason whatsoever.\n\n53\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.659\nYou'd have to do something to kind of\n\n54\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200\nstir up the hornet's nest I\nguess is a way to put it.\n\n55\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.240\nSo I right now have a system that this\n\n56\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.340\nperson could be typing out,\nsending an email or what have you.\n\n57\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.740\nSo I've got this system in here.\n\n58\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.990\nSo let me go back over to Kali.\n\n59\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.490\nSo we've confirmed that\nthat system is just fine.\n\n60\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.380\nThat person is not seeing\nanything out of the ordinary.\n\n61\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.380\nLike I said, we can do a sysinfo to\nkinda get an our orientation in here,\n\n62\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.890\nso that's pretty good.\n\n63\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.770\nI can, there's commands in here like\n\n64\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.450\na PS command to give you a list of\nprocesses that are currently running.\n\n65\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.330\nSo I'm going right through and\nI'm seeing the processes that are,\n\n66\n00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.190\nthey're on the system.\n\n67\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.895\nAnd we just went through the task right,\n\n68\n00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.785\nand I didn't expect you\nto memorize all that.\n\n69\n00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.485\nBut if you did you're insane,\n\n70\n00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:09.660\nso we can see in here the stuff that's,\nthe stuff that's running.\n\n71\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.120\nSo that's pretty good.\n\n72\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.760\nOkay so anything else we can do?\n\n73\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.960\nWell yeah there are other\nthings we can do.\n\n74\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.470\nYou're not really done here.\n\n75\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.600\nYou can go through and\ndo things like this.\n\n76\n00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.910\nAnd do a quick screen shot of this and\nlet's see what our screen shot gets us.\n\n77\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.530\nSo let's say en route, let's go and\npull that up and see what we have.\n\n78\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.850\nIt saved it right in the root.\n\n79\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.880\nWe got it.\n\n80\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.530\nIs it right?\n\n81\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.359\nThere we go.\n\n82\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.865\nLet's take a look.\n\n83\n00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:46.485\nOh, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.250\nWell, that looks pretty good.\n\n85\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know.\n\n86\n00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:54.315\nYou guys thinking at this point that hey,\nmaybe that's not right.\n\n87\n00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:57.073\nIt looks like it's a good match to me.\n\n88\n00:04:57.073 --> 00:04:58.275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n89\n00:04:58.275 --> 00:04:59.625\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:00.530\nYeah, I'd say that's right on.\n\n91\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.855\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n92\n00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:06.555\nAnd so I've got a good shot at\nthis person's system so far.\n\n93\n00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:09.186\nSo that's a, that's encouraging.\n\n94\n00:05:09.186 --> 00:05:12.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what else do we wanna do?\n\n95\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.980\nSo I'm seeing that.\n\n96\n00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.840\nThat's a very good start to be off on.\n\n97\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.950\nI can do plenty, and plenty, and\nplenty of other things on here.\n\n98\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.370\nLike I said, I've literally just started.\n\n99\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.580\nI'm just going to give you a quick\nlook at the command list on here.\n\n100\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.480\nI'm going to go through a lot of these\ncommands, and we're going to use these to\n\n101\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.690\nstring several of these commands\ntogether to do later actions.\n\n102\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.860\nSo, let's just take a quick\nglance at the list hear.\n\n103\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.880\nI mean, this thing has a pretty\ndecent list, as far as things go.\n\n104\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.570\nI mean, you can see it's got, like I said,\n\n105\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.870\naccess to all the stuff\nthe normal system has access to.\n\n106\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.120\nBut then, I look at, you know,\nsome other things in here.\n\n107\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.880\nAs I go through the list,\nyou can see that it has stuff to help,\n\n108\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.150\nto let us run this in the background.\n\n109\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.227\nPush it to a lower priority,\nso it's even less visible.\n\n110\n00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:17.780\nYou can load additional stuff.\n\n111\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.220\nYou can, you know, do all sorts of\nlittle interesting things here.\n\n112\n00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.600\nYou can move it to another process.\n\n113\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.310\nSo right now it's just\nsitting in one process,\n\n114\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.380\nyou could make it jump over to another one\nif you wanted to hide it a little better.\n\n115\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.870\nSo that's already a few things you can do,\nbut\n\n116\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.980\nlet's look at some of the other things.\n\n117\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.880\nWhen you get to the file system\ncommands in here, download a file.\n\n118\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.768\nI can literally just go over to,\nto my system that is got that,\n\n119\n00:06:47.768 --> 00:06:51.930\nmy Meterpreter open.\n\n120\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.040\nDid I lose my Meterpreter in here?\n\n121\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.190\nYeah this is how you,\noh this is the system I got it on.\n\n122\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.290\nThis is how you get lost in things.\n\n123\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.790\nSo let's take a look,\nsee what we got going on here.\n\n124\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.740\nThere's, let's see,\nthere's some files there.\n\n125\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:17.740\nLet's do download, and\nlet's see if we can do zipFLDR.dll.\n\n126\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.890\nSee if we can download that.\n\n127\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.570\nOh hey look, it went through and\ndownloaded that for me.\n\n128\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.410\nSo I'm pulling files off this person's\nsystem already at this point.\n\n129\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:35.060\nAnd notice I didn't say anything about\nhey, what user am I logged in as?\n\n130\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.890\nI just went right in.\n\n131\n00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.160\nSome systems do support the who am I deal.\n\n132\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.520\nThis one doesn't, but\nsometimes you can pull who am\n\n133\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.860\nI depending on the operating system you,\nyou penetrated.\n\n134\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.210\nsometimes it will tell you\nwhat user you're running as.\n\n135\n00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.880\nBut right now,\nI am just running as a regular user.\n\n136\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.183\nWe are going to work on bumping those up,\nbecause we are not done with that.\n\n137\n00:08:02.183 --> 00:08:06.013\nWe are going to work on getting\nmore privileges in here, and\n\n138\n00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:08.003\njust to kind of think about it,\n\n139\n00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:12.350\nWhen we look at our hacking process\nfrom before, what did we have?\n\n140\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.310\nWe scanned the system, we enumerated,\nthen we did things like\n\n141\n00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.070\ncracking passwords and elevating\nprivileges and then going through and\n\n142\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.250\ntrying to clear tracks and all that and\nput stuff behind to maintain access.\n\n143\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.060\nSo that's really kind of what we\nare doing here, is we're gonna try to do\n\n144\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.210\nthe exact same process and we can do\nit specifically with our interpreter.\n\n145\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:42.300\nSo what I wanna do is I'm gonna bring up\nmy help menu just one more time here,\n\n146\n00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.160\nand go through a few other things.\n\n147\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.770\nIn here, just to kinda give you an idea,\n\n148\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.420\nset up a few other little\ndetails you can do in here.\n\n149\n00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.550\nNotice, for the system commands in here,\n\n150\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.870\nthis is where it really starts to get\ninteresting and I ran the sysinfo.\n\n151\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.160\nBut take a look at some of the other\ncommands that are here on the list,\n\n152\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.580\nthat I'm gonna be using,\nhere, in a little bit.\n\n153\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.580\nYou have the ability to\nget process ID's and\n\n154\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.950\nget a SID, so if I get that SID I\ncan find out who I'm running as.\n\n155\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.570\n>> Wow.\n\n156\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.615\n>> I can even go through and use that\nSID later on to impersonate that user.\n\n157\n00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:22.074\n>> Hm, [LAUGH].\n\n158\n00:09:22.074 --> 00:09:25.430\n>> So if I was to go through right now and\ntype in get SID.\n\n159\n00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.280\nThrough, hey, it's got a SID right there.\n\n160\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.630\nI could do, what did I say,\na get process ID was the other one.\n\n161\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.820\nIt tells me what process ID\nhas been assigned to this.\n\n162\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.400\nSo it's starting to gain information.\n\n163\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.020\nBut let's do something\n\n164\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.130\nalong the lines of something that we\ntalked about in our CEH exploration.\n\n165\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.930\nWe talked about CEH,\none thing we talked about, like we said,\n\n166\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.002\nwas cracking passwords.\n\n167\n00:09:57.002 --> 00:10:02.500\nYou wanna be able to crack a password to\nbe able to gain access to an account.\n\n168\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.470\nAnd you may not always get the account\nthat you want to have access to,\n\n169\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.800\nso you may have to get\na lower privileged account.\n\n170\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.100\nOkay so, what we have here at the\ninterpreter is that actually makes it even\n\n171\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.980\neasier to do.\n\n172\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.940\nIt's almost cheating at this point,\nhow easy you can do things.\n\n173\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.530\nSo, if I want to crack a password,\n\n174\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.500\nyou've got really almost everything on\nthe table now, but, one of the things that\n\n175\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.120\nin interpreter makes really, really easy\nis, there's this command called hashdump,\n\n176\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.380\nwhich if you run it,\nit just goes like [COUGH] and\n\n177\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.950\npukes up all the stuff out of the SAM\ndatabase, so this is the local system now.\n\n178\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.880\nTake a good look at what's there.\n\n179\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.630\nIt's nothing that, if you've gone through\nour CEH and our forensics explorations,\n\n180\n00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.320\nit's nothing that you haven't seen before.\n\n181\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.810\nSo what we're seeing is, we see\nthe administrative account, guest account,\n\n182\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.020\nthe help assistant.\n\n183\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.920\nAnd Mike, you set this virtual machine up,\nso you got an account on there.\n\n184\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.440\nAnd then it's got one of our\nother Windows XP accounts.\n\n185\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.280\nAnd then after that, we have colon, and\n\n186\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.730\nthen an actual identifier for\nthe account, that unique ID for it.\n\n187\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.622\nSo we see 500, 501,\n1,000, 1,003 and 1,002.\n\n188\n00:11:18.622 --> 00:11:22.800\nOkay well you should\nalready kind of understand\n\n189\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.710\nwhat those numbers mean even\nif I blanked out the stuff\n\n190\n00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.010\nright at the beginning of those lines to\ntell you what the name of the account is.\n\n191\n00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.440\nSo I've got those first two things there,\nso I know what account's which,\n\n192\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.175\nI know the name and\nthe identifier that goes with it.\n\n193\n00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:37.690\n>> All right.\n>> But\n\n194\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.560\nthen let's kinda look over\nat what we have after that.\n\n195\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.070\nWe have a bunch of whole crazy\ncharacters sitting after it.\n\n196\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:49.130\nNow, that's where we really kinda want\nto focus our attention right now is,\n\n197\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.320\nwe look at those and\nyou should know if you've gone through and\n\n198\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.190\nviewed the other material,\nyou should know what those are.\n\n199\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.110\nYou should know that's not just one\ncrazy string of characters there.\n\n200\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.960\nThere's actually two\nthings hiding in there.\n\n201\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.420\nThere's an LM hash, and there's also\nthe NTLM stuff in there too, okay.\n\n202\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.040\nSo we've got hashes there for\nreally all the accounts.\n\n203\n00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.090\nWe have learned actually a couple\nof things here too by the way.\n\n204\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.740\nWe are seeing hashes.\n\n205\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.685\nWe know there is LM hash there, we can see\nthe NTLM stuff in there, but you're also\n\n206\n00:12:25.685 --> 00:12:32.285\nlearning that this person left that turned\non, that the storing of the LM hash,\n\n207\n00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:36.370\nthey could've gone on the registry or\ngroup policy and shut that off.\n\n208\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.400\nThey didn't, so\nit's being stored in there.\n\n209\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.390\nSo that is an immediate\nhole that I can exploit.\n\n210\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.790\nIf they didn't, I'd be left with a NTLM\nhash with nothing in the LM hash side,\n\n211\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.490\nand that raises the bar substantially.\n\n212\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.470\nBut since I do have LM hash is being\nstored in there and I've just gone\n\n213\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:03.460\nthrough and enumerated, all the accounts\nin the system right out of the SAM file.\n\n214\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.490\nIt's really no point in me starting\nwith any other account on there.\n\n215\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.050\nI might as well just go for\nthe jugular at this point.\n\n216\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.530\nAnd I will go through this\nlist of these hashes, and\n\n217\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.890\nif you notice you'll have,\nyou have the 500 then a colon, okay.\n\n218\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.200\nSo it's breaking between\nthe two fields there.\n\n219\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.250\nAnd I see the seven, and\nif we keep following\n\n220\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.835\nthat through we see all these\nlists of characters alpha numeric.\n\n221\n00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:34.445\nSo we get to another colon,\n\n222\n00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:38.225\nthat everything between those two colons,\nthat is the LM hash.\n\n223\n00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:41.895\nSo what I'm going to do is\nI am going to copy that.\n\n224\n00:13:43.915 --> 00:13:46.820\nNow just copy it just\nright off the screen.\n\n225\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.480\nAnd what I'm gonna use here is I'm\ngonna use that rainbow table technique.\n\n226\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.980\nAnd remember, just a review\nof a rainbow table technique,\n\n227\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.250\nwhat we're doing is we are getting a hash,\nand I don't know what that password is.\n\n228\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.850\nI just know that it is a hash\nthat represents the password,\n\n229\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.170\nas according to the LM hash protocol.\n\n230\n00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.600\nI wanna see what that\nhash actually represents.\n\n231\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.410\nSo rainbow table allows\nme to take a hash and\n\n232\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.850\ncompare it against a database\nof precomputed hashes\n\n233\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:26.220\nwith the intention of hey this hash\nmatch is one over the database.\n\n234\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.650\nIf it's hashed with the same mechanism\nyou should be able to see exactly what\n\n235\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.470\nthe original plane text was\ngoing into the whole process.\n\n236\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.330\nSo with that being said,\nI have the hash right here and\n\n237\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.970\nI am instead of creating all\nthe hashes on my own and again if you\n\n238\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.680\nremember back in the CEH it's one of\nthe things I also said the rainbow tables.\n\n239\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.010\nIt takes a long time let's set up\na rainbow table because not only do\n\n240\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.070\nyou have to set the thing up for\none hashing algorithm,\n\n241\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.320\nyou've got to set it for multiple hashing\nalgorithms because you don't know.\n\n242\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.650\nSo what I've got here is\nI am going to pull up\n\n243\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.050\nthis website that has already done it for\nme.\n\n244\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.210\nThis website called Crack Station dot net.\n\n245\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.100\nI'm going to open it up.\n\n246\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.190\nHeck, on the same system\nthat I'm doing it on.\n\n247\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.540\nI'm not opening on that guy's system,\nI'm opening on my local system here.\n\n248\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.930\nSo I am gonna go through,\n\n249\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.870\nI'm gonna take that hash, I'm gonna paste\nit into this field in here, and then.\n\n250\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.450\nI'm just gonna type in, since this has a\nlittle CAPTCHA deal in it to keep it from\n\n251\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.900\nbeing automated and people abusing it,\nI am going to just drop that hash in.\n\n252\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.930\nWhat this site does, by the way,\nis it's got a little note\n\n253\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.380\ndown there at the bottom saying those are\nwhat it supports, underneath the gray box.\n\n254\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.990\nYou can see what it supports,\nyou can't read it, but trust me, or\n\n255\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.190\ngo to it yourself,\nthe crackstation.net website.\n\n256\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.978\nIf you go there, it tells you it supports\nall these different hashing algorithms.\n\n257\n00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:53.670\nIt will auto-detect what it is.\n\n258\n00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.270\nYou can actually look at any hash, and\n\n259\n00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.190\nthere's ways of detecting\nwhich algorithm it used.\n\n260\n00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.989\nSo it looks at that hash I just pasted.\n\n261\n00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:04.858\nDo the CAPTCHA and say crack the hashes.\n\n262\n00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:09.770\nIt's gonna take a moment or\ntwo to look it up in its database.\n\n263\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.963\nAnd what will happen is it's gonna\ntry to come back with a match, or\n\n264\n00:16:12.963 --> 00:16:14.630\nas close to as a match as it can get.\n\n265\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.342\nIf I go down here I can see that my hash\nhas been color coded as being yellow,\n\n266\n00:16:19.342 --> 00:16:24.290\nand it's saying, if I look down here,\nit says it's a partial match.\n\n267\n00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.480\nIt tells me it does recognize it as an lm.\n\n268\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.250\nAnd it says oh well, that's a, that's for,\nthis is the result it thinks it is,\n\n269\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.480\nthe closest match it has.\n\n270\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.330\nIt has password and\nthen it has some characters after it.\n\n271\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.540\nSo it didn't find an exact match,\nbut it's thinking that's what it is.\n\n272\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.350\nSo I'm going to look at that and\n\n273\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:51.270\nif I'm going to kind of mix in some\ncommon sense with it, I'm gonna say.\n\n274\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.020\nI'm going to start probably just by\n\n275\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.700\nthinking it's just those\nfirst eight characters there.\n\n276\n00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.103\nAnd this is something I was asking you,\nMike,\n\n277\n00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:05.131\njust a few moments ago before\nwe started this segment.\n\n278\n00:17:05.131 --> 00:17:09.015\nI was asking the password, did you set\nit to, and you didn't even get finished.\n\n279\n00:17:09.015 --> 00:17:13.370\nI'm like okay yeah that was exactly\nwhat I got, it wasn't difficult at all.\n\n280\n00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.370\nIt wasn't like I had any special talent or\n\n281\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.710\nanything it's like yeah,\nI see it right there.\n\n282\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.590\nSo right now I know the name of\nthe user account, I know administrator.\n\n283\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.650\nI know it's on the local system and\nI've got a password, so\n\n284\n00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.130\nyou have enough right now to\nlog in that system remotely.\n\n285\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.470\nYou literally have that.\n\n286\n00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.440\nIf you wanted to, you could start\nworking on the other hashes.\n\n287\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.064\nThis one you can see, we'll actually\nbreak up to ten hashes at a time.\n\n288\n00:17:43.064 --> 00:17:46.119\nI could go on this site and grab or\n\n289\n00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:51.325\ngo out back to the computer,\nI'll grab another hash,\n\n290\n00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:57.629\nI'll grab it for, This account over here.\n\n291\n00:17:57.629 --> 00:17:59.410\nI'll grab it for the Mike account.\n\n292\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.635\nI already asked him, it ain't his real\npassword so don't get any smart ideas.\n\n293\n00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:05.652\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So but.\n\n294\n00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:11.448\n>> Don't show it on the Internet,\ncome on, that's my password!\n\n295\n00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:14.455\n>> So I'm gonna paste that in and\n\n296\n00:18:14.455 --> 00:18:19.507\nI am going to try to figure\nout that really clear and\n\n297\n00:18:19.507 --> 00:18:23.008\nvery well visible caption there.\n\n298\n00:18:23.008 --> 00:18:24.262\nYeah that's called sarcasm, people.\n\n299\n00:18:24.262 --> 00:18:25.100\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n300\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.170\n>> Like what the hell,\nI've gotta figure that so-.\n\n301\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.684\n>> [LAUGH] So I say skip,\ntry the next one, something [LAUGH].\n\n302\n00:18:32.684 --> 00:18:36.250\n>> Yeah, it's gonna come back and\ngo, no do it again.\n\n303\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.470\nSo yeah, incorrect caption, no kidding!\n\n304\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:47.221\nAll right, so that one looks more\nvisible so I will take that and\n\n305\n00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:53.100\nsay crack the hash for that and,\nda, da, da, very good.\n\n306\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.630\nThat one found an exact match.\n\n307\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.430\nSo it says it's exact and\nit says there's the hash,\n\n308\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.110\nthere's the type and\nit has a blank result.\n\n309\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.950\nWhich is telling me that probably\ndidn't set a password for it.\n\n310\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.450\nYou probably just typed\nin user account and\n\n311\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.080\nhit Enter because it probably\ndidn't force the issue.\n\n312\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.690\nSo I could try it and see if that works.\n\n313\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.720\n>> Right.\n\n314\n00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.920\n>> So what you've just seen here,\nis without really much effort,\n\n315\n00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.430\nI have obtained passwords just\nby the help of the Meterpreter.\n\n316\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.730\nI could have gotten in really\nquickly to a Windows box,\n\n317\n00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.970\nin this case, done a hash dump,\ngrabbed those hashes and\n\n318\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.710\nthe accounts and jumped right back out and\ngotten the passwords.\n\n319\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.170\nAnd now the question is, what are you\ngonna do with the power that you have?\n\n320\n00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.270\nYou could get to the point where you don't\nhave to use the Meterpreter at this point.\n\n321\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.450\nYou could say, okay, I've got\nthe Meterpreter gave me what I want.\n\n322\n00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.665\nI've got the account.\n\n323\n00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:51.437\nI've got a password, now it's time for me\nto just log into the system directly and\n\n324\n00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:52.700\nstart doing my mischief.\n\n325\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.106\nI don't need the Meterpreter anymore.\n\n326\n00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:58.860\nBut the Meterpreter still has some\nother stuff they can do for you.\n\n327\n00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.820\nIt's not limited to just this.\n\n328\n00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.430\nThis is just to show you how to combine\n\n329\n00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.840\nsome of the techniques\nthat we had talked about.\n\n330\n00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.170\nWe just combined them right here.\n\n331\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.380\nI used the Meterpreter and\nthat vulnerability and\n\n332\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.990\nall that to get into the system,\nopened up the console.\n\n333\n00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.250\nWell now what?\n\n334\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.420\nIt's a local system.\n\n335\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.820\nI know there's a SAM database there.\n\n336\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.690\nI dumped the SAM database, I found\nwhat I want, cracked the password, and\n\n337\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.110\nI'm right back in.\n\n338\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:34.240\nSo that's a significant jump right\nthere when you really get down to it.\n\n339\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.990\nSo the question is,\nwhat other things can we do at that point?\n\n340\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.960\nSo I showed you, or talked about,\nsome of these different commands up here.\n\n341\n00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.789\nAbout getting the SIDs and\nthe user IDs and stuff like that.\n\n342\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.480\nThere's some good stuff there.\n\n343\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.950\nBut you could also do a bunch of\nother things to turn that system even\n\n344\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.200\ninto a spying apparatus if you\nreally wanna get down to it,\n\n345\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.440\nyou have that capability in there as well.\n\n346\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.510\nSo, right now, it just got the password.\n\n347\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.850\nBut that just opens the door for\nother things.\n\n348\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.200\nThey even have stuff\nlike get system in here,\n\n349\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.630\nto see if you want to\nbump it up a bit more.\n\n350\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.620\nAnd take a look, by the way when I\ntype in that command, get system.\n\n351\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.940\nIf you guys missed it in that list there.\n\n352\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.769\nWhat get system does is, okay, well, I and\n\n353\n00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:34.070\nthe interpreters got you\na connection to that system.\n\n354\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.050\nAnd it's got that connection to\nthe system, and I can see, well,\n\n355\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.290\nis it gonna tell me anything.\n\n356\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:44.970\nI do a getuid look at what I\ndid I just ran get system and\n\n357\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:50.230\nthen I ran this getuid, get the user\nID look at what it's running as.\n\n358\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.970\nLook at what it just puked back at me.\n\n359\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.730\nIt told me that it was running as\nthe system account on there now.\n\n360\n00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.080\nWhen I typed get system just up above it,\nyou could see it took a second and\n\n361\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.630\nsaid, hey, I got system.\n\n362\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.522\nBoom, got it.\n\n363\n00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.193\nI confirmed it, I gotta getuid.\n\n364\n00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:11.750\nYeah, I'm running as system now, so\nit's a world's my oyster at this point.\n\n365\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.390\nWhat do you really wanna\ndo now at that point?\n\n366\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.857\nIt just took it over and grabbed it.\n\n367\n00:22:17.857 --> 00:22:19.150\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n368\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.880\nI mean, you can't escalate your\ncredentials any higher than that, right?\n\n369\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.998\n>> Yeah, you really can't.\n\n370\n00:22:23.998 --> 00:22:31.030\nIt's gone from really not having all that\nmuch to grabbing a password for a couple\n\n371\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.010\ndifferent accounts, the administrator and\nthen that account you traded.\n\n372\n00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.977\nAnd then I just said,\nlet's go one step further, and\n\n373\n00:22:38.977 --> 00:22:43.090\nI just seized and\ngot the system level access to it.\n\n374\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.800\nSo, yeah,\nyou can't get any higher than that?\n\n375\n00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.775\nSo, you can start tampering with\nthe system and doing all sorts of stuff,\n\n376\n00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:54.915\nalmost without restriction\nat this point so.\n\n377\n00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:57.959\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What else can really be said at that\n\n378\n00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:58.487\npoint?\n\n379\n00:22:58.487 --> 00:23:02.078\nIf you're not impressed,\ncheck your pulse, do something,\n\n380\n00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:05.840\nbecause that's really what\nwe're looking at at this point.\n\n381\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.400\n>> Absolutely.\n\n382\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.220\nThat is amazing.\n\n383\n00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.440\nAnd really not that difficult,\nonce we got that exploit loaded up and\n\n384\n00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.070\ndelivered our payload over there and\ngot that Meterpreter connection.\n\n385\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.750\nAnd it was a simple command like hash\ndump to grab those or get system.\n\n386\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.110\nI can remember that command.\n\n387\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.620\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.678\n>> And if you don't,\n\n389\n00:23:23.678 --> 00:23:26.255\nthis help file on here.\n\n390\n00:23:26.255 --> 00:23:31.561\nYou type in help on inside\nof the Meterpreter,\n\n391\n00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:36.876\nit's short, sweet, you like that, Guido?\n\n392\n00:23:36.876 --> 00:23:40.590\nIt's pretty short and\nsweet on what it provides.\n\n393\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.480\nIt tells you directly,\nthis is what it does.\n\n394\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.610\nAnd so, just choose the one off your\nlist that you need and go for it.\n\n395\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.130\nAnd our next step here\nis going to be combining\n\n396\n00:23:55.435 --> 00:24:02.145\ndifferent commands to see if there's\nany more stuff that we can do.\n\n397\n00:24:02.145 --> 00:24:03.195\nThere is.\nThere really is.\n\n398\n00:24:03.195 --> 00:24:04.115\nThat's the way to look at it.\n\n399\n00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:08.242\nThere really is a bunch of stuff that\nyeah, we can just stack on top of that.\n\n400\n00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:11.787\nBut to just quickly to\nput it in perspective.\n\n401\n00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:15.547\nLike I said, we'd already gone through and\nscanned the system and\n\n402\n00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:17.407\nfound the vulnerabilities and punched in.\n\n403\n00:24:17.407 --> 00:24:21.160\nSo once we did that,\ncracked a password, got an account and\n\n404\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.396\nthen escalated privileges,\nall really quickly.\n\n405\n00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:26.976\nSo that takes care of everything.\n\n406\n00:24:26.976 --> 00:24:30.844\nOnly thing we haven't done at\nthis point is put something\n\n407\n00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:33.300\nthere to maintain our access.\n\n408\n00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.950\nAnd then of course, covering our tracks,\nwe've still got that coming up.\n\n409\n00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.770\nAnd then we've got some other stuff that\nwe can do that we haven't even got to.\n\n410\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.282\nOur value-added features,\nif you wanna look at it that way.\n\n411\n00:24:45.282 --> 00:24:48.516\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But come a long, long way from just,\n\n412\n00:24:48.516 --> 00:24:51.014\nit's this system and that system.\n\n413\n00:24:51.014 --> 00:24:54.170\nAnd oh, I could see some open ports to,\nnow I'm in it.\n\n414\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:54.690\nI own it.\n\n415\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.530\nThat's my system now.\n\n416\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.530\nYou don't own it anymore.\n\n417\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:57.870\n>> Very nice.\n\n418\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.130\nAll right, well, Sean gave us a hint.\n\n419\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.290\nWe've got more of our\nMeterpreter coming your way.\n\n420\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.730\nBut for this episode, we are out of time.\n\n421\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.160\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n422\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.210\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n423\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.335\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n424\n00:25:12.335 -->

00:00:14.305\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.236\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:16.559\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:17.918\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.355\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:21.655\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n9\n00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.715\ncontinuing on with our Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.116\nAnd in this one we're continuing as well.\n\n11\n00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:31.395\nWe've been doing a couple episodes\non something called Meterpreter,\n\n12\n00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.185\nwhich is a utility we\nfind within Metasploit.\n\n13\n00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.710\nAnd we've seen some really\namazing stuff so far, Sean.\n\n14\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.310\nBut you said that's not all,\nthere's more to see with Meterpreter.\n\n15\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.680\n>> Oh yeah, there's definitely\na lot more to go on Meterpreter.\n\n16\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.570\nSo if you haven't had that wow factor yet,\n\n17\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.795\nyou're gonna see more of\nwhat you can do here.\n\n18\n00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:59.565\nBecause there's definitely\nplenty of things here yet to go.\n\n19\n00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:04.080\nSo, what we've done so\nfar is we grabbed hashes,\n\n20\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.800\nwe've retrieved passwords, and\nwe did that with very little effort.\n\n21\n00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.830\nIt didn't take really any\ntime at all to do it.\n\n22\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.855\nI was able to get system-level\naccess without too much trouble.\n\n23\n00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:17.197\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to be nice.\n\n24\n00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:18.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Too much trouble,\n\n25\n00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:21.030\nit wasn't any trouble.\n\n26\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.820\nSo what else do we have left?\n\n27\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.570\nWell, there's still things\nin there that you can do\n\n28\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.530\nto cause all sorts of little mischief and\nthings like that.\n\n29\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.820\nThere's various networking commands,\n\n30\n00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.690\nthere's various commands to do\ndifferent interactions with the system.\n\n31\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.505\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of\nthose because we haven't really talked\n\n32\n00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:43.642\nabout those yet.\n\n33\n00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:45.682\nAbout beyond just doing\nsome of these things,\n\n34\n00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:47.690\nhow are you gonna get files up there.\n\n35\n00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.600\nWell, you know the way we do\nthat is we'll go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.290\nwe'll take a look at what\nI've got here on my desktop.\n\n37\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.960\nI've got the Meterpreter\nscreen up again so\n\n38\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.160\nI've got just my Meterpreter prompt there.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.380\nIf I look at things the way it is right\nnow, one of the things we saw right at\n\n40\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.770\nthe beginning when we gained Meterpreter\non the system is, we went in and\n\n41\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.035\njust did an ls and\nsaw a directory listing.\n\n42\n00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:24.800\nOkay, that's nothing that's really kind\nof all that exciting when you look at it.\n\n43\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.775\nOkay, fine,\nyou were able to do a directory listing.\n\n44\n00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:31.050\nWhoopty-do, we've just seen a bunch of\nother stuff you can do that's a lot more\n\n45\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.525\nexciting in the scheme of things.\n\n46\n00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.910\nSo, how do we do other stuff?\n\n47\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.390\nWell, one of the other things we\ncan do is, if we look at this and\n\n48\n00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.580\nwe're saying let's look at the system\nthis way, I can do it, I'm okay with it.\n\n49\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.074\nYou can see if you read it,\nyou can see the columns,\n\n50\n00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:53.193\nyou can see the different permissions on\nit, the file sizes, whether it's a file or\n\n51\n00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:55.470\nfolder, or file directory more accurately.\n\n52\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.260\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n53\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.640\nBut if it's a Windows system,\nor whatever system it is,\n\n54\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.600\nyou want to go beyond that and\nreally look at\n\n55\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.880\nthe system as if you were sitting there,\nthere's a command called shell.\n\n56\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.330\nThat all you have to do\nis just go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.040\nhit Enter, type it in and\nhit Enter, and what happens is,\n\n58\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.340\nnow you can see the system as if\nyou were really sitting there.\n\n59\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.330\nNow your Windows commands will work\n\n60\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.170\nall that exactly as they\nwould be if you were there.\n\n61\n00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.400\nAnd this makes it, in my opinion,\neven easier to tell where you are.\n\n62\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.441\nBecause if you,\nat the Meterpreter prompt, did an ls,\n\n63\n00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:36.886\nI mean I'm doing an ls and\nit works as the way we'd expect it to.\n\n64\n00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:39.729\nBut ls isn't a native Windows command,\nfirst of all.\n\n65\n00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:45.522\nAnd second, of all it's become a little\nkind of tricky, if you're not being\n\n66\n00:03:45.522 --> 00:03:50.820\ncareful it can be a little tricky to\nkind of figure out where you are.\n\n67\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.750\nSo we want to be able to do that.\n\n68\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.870\nIf you looked at the files that\nwere there in that folder,\n\n69\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.320\nprobably most if not all of us could look\nat the files that are in that folder and\n\n70\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.150\nsay oh, well that's the Windows system\n32 folder that you happen to be in.\n\n71\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.765\nWell, here I can see very\nclearly that that's what it is.\n\n72\n00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:10.955\nAnd everything works.\n\n73\n00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.455\nI can go all the way up and\ndo all my commands,\n\n74\n00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:17.395\nand all my directories,\nand everything else.\n\n75\n00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:21.482\nI can navigate it,\nI can start finding things on that system.\n\n76\n00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:26.158\nI can do, if I go to,\nlet's say, the Windows folder,\n\n77\n00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:31.472\ndo my directory and see, well,\ndo I have Notepad available?\n\n78\n00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:34.452\nWell there's Notepad, no big deal, right?\n\n79\n00:04:34.452 --> 00:04:39.552\nIf you do execute and do notepad.exe,\nit will, well in this case it's\n\n80\n00:04:39.552 --> 00:04:44.907\nactually I don't even have to type that,\nI can probably just do notepad and\n\n81\n00:04:44.907 --> 00:04:50.358\nit will, well in this case not bring it\nup because we don't have a GUI there.\n\n82\n00:04:50.358 --> 00:04:54.213\nBut probably not the best [LAUGH]\none to choose in hindsight.\n\n83\n00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:55.559\nSomething to be said for\ntaping this stuff live, isn't it?\n\n84\n00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [COUGH] but you can get the point,\n\n85\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.240\nit actually tried to run it.\n\n86\n00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.670\nIf I go over to the XP system,\nwell it's not showing there.\n\n87\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.340\nSo which is [LAUGH] another thing\nkind of interesting as well.\n\n88\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.780\nBut you can see that I can\nrun a file right up there.\n\n89\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.370\nNow, if I wanted to run that same file\nfrom the Meterpreter prompt, I type exit.\n\n90\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.180\nAnd you can see if I type exit\nit should take a moment and\n\n91\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.870\npop up the Meterpreter prompt.\n\n92\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.130\nSo, I'm not seeing it yet.\n\n93\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.364\n>> So if you're backing out of your shell,\nthat's giving you access to all those\n\n94\n00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:36.715\nWindows commands and\nback out to Meterpreter.\n\n95\n00:05:36.715 --> 00:05:40.400\n>> Yeah, it should come back right\nwith the Meterpreter prompt,\n\n96\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.470\nunless I'm having some sort of weird goofy\nproblem or something on here sometimes.\n\n97\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.828\nOne of the things I'll tell you about\nthis right when this is happening is that\n\n98\n00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:54.431\nsometimes, when you're\nworking with Meterpreter, and\n\n99\n00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:57.532\nit happened here a moment\nago before we went live.\n\n100\n00:05:57.532 --> 00:06:03.225\nYou'll see that sometimes it will,\nthe system you're latching into,\n\n101\n00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:07.346\nthis XP system for example,\nit may actually crash.\n\n102\n00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.660\nAnd that's been known to happen.\n\n103\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.828\nSometimes if you can't get a connection\nright away it will go ahead and, just\n\n104\n00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:19.771\nby the process of getting a connection,\nwill cause that service to fail.\n\n105\n00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:22.050\nAnd now you won't be\nable to connect at all.\n\n106\n00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.619\nThe only way you'll be able to do anything\nwith that system again is to reattempt\n\n107\n00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:26.483\nthat connection.\n\n108\n00:06:26.483 --> 00:06:30.588\nAnd the only way to do that if that\ncrashes is to reboot the system.\n\n109\n00:06:30.588 --> 00:06:32.845\nAnd that means someone on that\nend is gonna have to do it and\n\n110\n00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:34.643\nyou don't know when they're gonna do that.\n\n111\n00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:39.335\nSo that could be things that happen there.\n\n112\n00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:44.202\nSo that's weird that that was happening\nthat way, but I can go right back.\n\n113\n00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.930\nI just did a Ctrl+C and did it that way.\n\n114\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.920\nNot the desired way to do it,\nbut I can do it that way.\n\n115\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:58.480\nSo if I want to run that\nexecutable from here,\n\n116\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.480\nfrom my system side instead\nof going on the other side,\n\n117\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.320\nI can just use an execute command and\ntype the name of that.\n\n118\n00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.640\nNow, the thing is, is that I did\nreset this connection before we\n\n119\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.680\nwent to our break,\nI did the getsystem command.\n\n120\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.117\nAnd here I went ahead and ran it again.\n\n121\n00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:26.720\nBut if I didn't do that, or in any case,\nI guess to put it right across the board.\n\n122\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.793\nIf you try to execute something on that\nsystem and you don't have permissions\n\n123\n00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:32.876\nto do it, you ain't gonna run it anyway,\nyou have to get those permissions.\n\n124\n00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:36.317\nSo remember that,\nis that when we crack a password and\n\n125\n00:07:36.317 --> 00:07:41.134\nwe elevate our privileges, the reason\nwhy we're doing that is to be able to\n\n126\n00:07:41.134 --> 00:07:43.666\nget more access to do all these things.\n\n127\n00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:46.425\nAnd one of them is,\nif you don't have high level access,\n\n128\n00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.217\nsome things just aren't gonna run.\n\n129\n00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:51.633\nWe all know that, that's the reason\nwhy we do user accounts and\n\n130\n00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:55.057\npermissions is to give that\ngranular type of access to things.\n\n131\n00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:57.684\nSo here, with the way Notepad is,\n\n132\n00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:02.950\nmaybe Notepad wasn't It wasn't\ngonna run with those credentials.\n\n133\n00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.874\nAnd here we know,\nit's cuz there's no GUI here, so\n\n134\n00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:08.920\nit's being rendered, it's not gonna run.\n\n135\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.570\nBut if there was a GUI, it's permissions,\nit still wouldn't do it.\n\n136\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.389\nSo just be aware of that,\nthat if some things don't run,\n\n137\n00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.820\nif there's no GUI or\nany other things blocking it.\n\n138\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.763\nAnd maybe that you just\ndon't have permissions, but\n\n139\n00:08:21.763 --> 00:08:23.310\nusually it's pretty vocal about that.\n\n140\n00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.880\nIt'll say yeah, you can't run this,\n\n141\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.890\nin which case you have to do\nsomething to get those permissions.\n\n142\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.805\nAnd so we've seen ways to do that.\n\n143\n00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:36.805\nGetSystem is a pretty aggressive\nway to do it, but it does work.\n\n144\n00:08:36.805 --> 00:08:39.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As you saw.\n\n145\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.650\nBut it's not the only way.\n\n146\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.020\nJust so you know,\nwhen we go through the help file in here,\n\n147\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.950\njust to kind of show you the command here.\n\n148\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.130\nIf you go through the system commands,\nif you go through it and\n\n149\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.580\nkind of start browsing\nwhat's going on there.\n\n150\n00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.950\nIf you take a look right towards\nthe bottom there is something called\n\n151\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.650\nsteel token.\n\n152\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.580\nWhat that will do,\nis if you run these steel token\n\n153\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.660\ncommand, you can see in here,\nit's saying, okay steel token for what?\n\n154\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.560\nAnd it's saying, PID.\n\n155\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.720\nOkay, PID is a process ID.\n\n156\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.800\nSo, what you can do is,\nwe need to get a process ID.\n\n157\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.590\nOkay, so how do we get that process ID?\n\n158\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.490\nWell, what we're gonna do is we can run\n\n159\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.380\nour command from our previous segment,\nis we run the ps command.\n\n160\n00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.710\nThe ps command, we hit enter, and it just\ngoes through and spits all this stuff up.\n\n161\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.340\nAnd we can just look at this list and see,\n\n162\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.630\nokay well, what has,\nwhat token do we want to steal?\n\n163\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.590\nWhat context do we want to steal?\n\n164\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.820\nSo if I go through this list and\nI'm seeing all these things, I can see,\n\n165\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.430\nwell I've got systems, so\nI'm not going to steal that.\n\n166\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.330\nIn fact, at this point, with that\nsystemental access, this is just,\n\n167\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.335\nthis is a pointless exercise really.\n\n168\n00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:56.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like I'm doing it just because.\n\n169\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.460\nSo what I'm gonna do here is that we're\ngonna forget about that for a second.\n\n170\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.310\nLet's say I wanna grab something else to,\nsome other process ID to impersonate it.\n\n171\n00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:16.060\nThe way I would do is, I have to get\nthe process ID, so I can see explorer.exe,\n\n172\n00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.400\nit's running under the XP Mike account.\n\n173\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.120\nSo I want to grab that one.\n\n174\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.783\nThe process ID is gonna be that\nnumber in the first column.\n\n175\n00:10:26.783 --> 00:10:29.918\nSo if I do steel token,\n\n176\n00:10:29.918 --> 00:10:34.545\nand then do process ID 1600.\n\n177\n00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:38.446\nIt just gone through and grabbed that.\n\n178\n00:10:38.446 --> 00:10:43.141\nWhat that means is if I can start\nusing that token to run processes, and\n\n179\n00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:47.020\nit will start running under\nthat particular token.\n\n180\n00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.690\nWhat's really cool about that is,\nkind of put that in perspective here.\n\n181\n00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.950\nIs if you're browsing that process list,\nand\n\n182\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.580\nyou're seeing something that's able to run\nand get access to something that you want\n\n183\n00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.980\naccess to, you can just go ahead and\ngrab that process ID off of it.\n\n184\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.960\nAnd then go run that process yourself,\nand you'll say hey I'm that person.\n\n185\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.670\n>> Like you were saying,\nyou've already got system level access so\n\n186\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.920\nyou really don't want to\nreduce your credentials.\n\n187\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.260\nIt's not often that you're trying to get\nless credentials as a pen tester, or\n\n188\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.260\nas a hacker.\n\n189\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.130\nBut what if this person, it wasn't\nyour after administrative access.\n\n190\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.010\nLet's say this person has access\nto some web app or database app or\n\n191\n00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.990\nsomething like that.\n\n192\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.700\nAnd they've connected to that, right.\n\n193\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.880\nThat means they've got that token,\nthat process on their system.\n\n194\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.680\nThat's what I want.\n\n195\n00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.250\nCuz I wanna access this database\nthat he's connecting to maybe, or\n\n196\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.500\nsomething like that.\n\n197\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.910\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be exactly right, is that\n\n198\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.450\nsomeone has access to something that\nyou want to have access to yourself.\n\n199\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.630\nEven though I have system access,\n\n200\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.950\nit doesn't mean I have access to something\nelse on another system, or what have you.\n\n201\n00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.340\nSo this would be something that\nI could go ahead and grab that.\n\n202\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:12:00.170\nSo [COUGH] just to kind of give you\nan idea of what you can do with that.\n\n203\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:05.080\nOnce you're done with that token,\nyou can see right here towards\n\n204\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.580\nthe top of this list,\nyou have something called a drop_token.\n\n205\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.640\nAnd once you do that, it'll go through and\nboom, we're done, let's see who we are.\n\n206\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:23.860\nIt's saying, okay, we're back as running,\nas the system in there.\n\n207\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.430\nSo that's pretty good.\n\n208\n00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:31.090\nWe've just gone through and done a couple\nquick switches back and forth there.\n\n209\n00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.353\n>> That's impressive.\n\n210\n00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:37.605\n>> You've done quite a bit,\nright there, the possibility,\n\n211\n00:12:37.605 --> 00:12:40.216\nthe door's open to do\nquite a bit at that point.\n\n212\n00:12:40.216 --> 00:12:43.349\nBecause now you can just start\nexecuting stuff as someone else,\n\n213\n00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:46.950\njust steal their token and\nimpersonate them, wherever you want.\n\n214\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.500\n>> And those aren't things that\nwould be easy to do without\n\n215\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.680\nthe interpreter helping me out here.\n\n216\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:13:00.060\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and maybe just\nto kind of bump this along a bit,\n\n217\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.710\nand fill in a few more gaps here on this.\n\n218\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.110\nAnd what you could do, or\nmaybe expand your horizons a bit.\n\n219\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.810\nYou can actually steal tokens\nthat have been issued or\n\n220\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.170\nbeing used through Cerberus.\n\n221\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.460\nSo think about what\nthe possibilities are there.\n\n222\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.100\nYou guys should know, if you work with\nActive Directory and all that, you should\n\n223\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.230\nreally understand how significant that is\nto have Cerberus sitting out there, and\n\n224\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.192\nme telling you, hey I can grab\nthe tokens you generate with that.\n\n225\n00:13:27.192 --> 00:13:28.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That should give you\n\n226\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.920\na lot of pause right there.\n\n227\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.948\nIt's like, say what now?\n\n228\n00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:39.133\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just to put things in perspective here.\n\n229\n00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.061\n>> Kinda scary.\n\n230\n00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:44.494\n>> Yeah, it really, really is,\nthat you can just go ahead and\n\n231\n00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:47.710\nstart grabbing those things.\n\n232\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.410\nSo really kinda neat.\n\n233\n00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:55.340\nSomething else I kinda wanna throw in here\ntoo, by the way, as far as executing stuff\n\n234\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.053\nremotely, is that you might decide\nwith what you have right here,\n\n235\n00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:05.610\nhaving system level access,\nor whatever level access.\n\n236\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:12.380\nMaybe working with the system this way,\nis kind of not your favorite way to do it.\n\n237\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.140\nWell, first of all,\nyou need to get used to it.\n\n238\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.850\nYou need to get over that.\n\n239\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.560\nIf you're not comfortable with\ncommand line, then you need\n\n240\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.038\nto question why you're looking at\nsomething on Metasploit, really.\n\n241\n00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:22.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n242\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.290\nI don't think anyone has that problem,\nas far as working with command line.\n\n243\n00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.760\nBut maybe you kinda wanna see if you can\nget a little bit more than that, and\n\n244\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.980\nget some sort of GUI on here.\n\n245\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.210\nThat is possible.\n\n246\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:40.070\nThere is a,\nI think it's a power shell module.\n\n247\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.790\nIf memory serves, a power shell module\nthat you could upload to a Windows system,\n\n248\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.350\nthat is power shell enabled.\n\n249\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.480\nAnd once you get it up there you run it,\n\n250\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.295\nand it will actually render the whole GUI\nto you, as a remote desktop type deal.\n\n251\n00:14:53.295 --> 00:14:55.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so once you have that,\n\n252\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.400\nyou're home free.\n\n253\n00:14:57.585 --> 00:15:00.102\n>> Then all you mouse\nclickers can be happy, right?\n\n254\n00:15:00.102 --> 00:15:01.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n255\n00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.305\n>> I'm right there with you,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n256\n00:15:04.305 --> 00:15:05.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> And if you want,\n\n257\n00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.680\nI mean you can look it up for yourself,\n\n258\n00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.610\nthis is not something that I need to\nwalk you the process of myself here.\n\n259\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.200\nBut if you really,\nreally gotta have that GUI, and\n\n260\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.000\nyou're just really hot on having that for\nwhatever reason.\n\n261\n00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.020\nYou can actually go and\n\n262\n00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:29.070\nrun after the command line in Windows,\ncuz we know we can do that now.\n\n263\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.840\nThe command line in Windows,\n\n264\n00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:36.210\nyou can run the stuff to actually enable\nremote desktop right there in a local box.\n\n265\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.990\nCuz you can do that through\nthe command line, so.\n\n266\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.840\n>> Right.\n\n267\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.755\n>> Just run the command.\n\n268\n00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:42.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And be done with it,\n\n269\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.358\nif that's what you want.\n\n270\n00:15:43.358 --> 00:15:44.341\n>> Right.\n\n271\n00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:47.006\n>> So just again,\njust to think about that.\n\n272\n00:15:47.006 --> 00:15:51.092\nJust because there's not a special command\nhere for it, doesn't mean that you can't-\n\n273\n00:15:51.092 --> 00:15:51.853\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n274\n00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:54.287\n>> That you can't go to that level.\n\n275\n00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:58.513\nYou just think it's like, well that\ninterpreter doesn't have that, but\n\n276\n00:15:58.513 --> 00:16:00.335\ndoes Windows have a way to do it?\n\n277\n00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.370\nWindows does have a way to do it.\n\n278\n00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:08.440\nSo, we can take care of that in\njust one quick shot, right away.\n\n279\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.860\n>> Executable for\nremote desktop, Mstsc right?\n\n280\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.440\nMicrosoft terminal services client, so.\n\n281\n00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.568\nFire the thing up and get remote access.\n\n282\n00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:17.950\nWow.\n\n283\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.567\n>> Yeah, you're just going through and\n\n284\n00:16:20.567 --> 00:16:23.849\nlike I was saying at the end\nof the last segment.\n\n285\n00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:27.855\nI was joking around saying hey the world\nis your oyster really at this point.\n\n286\n00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:31.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it really is, so.\n\n287\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.930\nIt's just a question of\nare you aware of it.\n\n288\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.120\nSo maybe you weren't thinking about\nthat when I start talking about this.\n\n289\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.806\nIt's like how could I get a GUI on that.\n\n290\n00:16:40.806 --> 00:16:45.819\nYou're probably just already impressed by\nwhat you have here, but now I've said,\n\n291\n00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:50.095\nwell you want a GUI just go ahead and\nenable it through what Windows has.\n\n292\n00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:51.220\nMetaterpreter doesn't have it,\n\n293\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.760\nbut it'll give you the ability to\nget over there and turn it on.\n\n294\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.310\nAnd so once you've gone over there and\nturned the thing on,\n\n295\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.010\nthen hey, you're cool.\n\n296\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.530\nSo a lot of neat things we have there.\n\n297\n00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:11.200\nSo just trying to make you really\n\n298\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.790\nthink about the different things\nthat are actually possible.\n\n299\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:23.850\nSo I was looking over here on\nthe questions that we had popping up\n\n300\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:29.880\nthrough here, I saw that one of\nthe questions here is that point logs,\n\n301\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.630\nand these exploits like local logs and\nanything else and correlated the output.\n\n302\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:42.330\nUnder certain circumstances, yeah these\nthings will show up in a log file.\n\n303\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.500\nSo, if you pull up log files,\n\n304\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.890\nyeah you might very well see it,\nbut it's not always the case.\n\n305\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:57.450\nDon't expect necessarily to see\nanything in a log file at all.\n\n306\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.590\nIn fact,\nif I was to go over here in my log file,\n\n307\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.650\nI don't really see anything\nthat's catching my\n\n308\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.455\neye as far as hey, there's something\nhere that is out of the ordinary.\n\n309\n00:18:13.455 --> 00:18:15.485\nSo it's just normal stuff.\n\n310\n00:18:15.485 --> 00:18:21.125\nNow if you had something\nelse like an IBS or\n\n311\n00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:24.950\nsomething along those lines,\nperhaps, perhaps you'll see it,\n\n312\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:30.360\nthere are ways to detect it, if you\nhad a host intrusion detection system.\n\n313\n00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.550\nThe stuff I'm doing should be\ntriggering some bells and whistles and\n\n314\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.100\nall that over there saying yeah,\n\n315\n00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.670\nthere's something happening here\nthat doesn't fit normal behavior.\n\n316\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.390\nThat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n317\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.720\nSo right now,\nyou can see the standard window stuff.\n\n318\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.910\nI'm off the radar.\n\n319\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:51.000\nThere's nothing here, but\nyou do have the ability with\n\n320\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.410\nother tools to enhance that and have those\ndifferent levels that will pick it up.\n\n321\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.140\nSo sometimes, if you're looking\nat the right way, you'll see it.\n\n322\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.560\nBut I do like that\n\n323\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.750\nquestion because it's like\nwhat about those logs right?\n\n324\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.880\n>> Right.\n\n325\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.750\n>> We've got those logs sitting out there,\nwe've got these logs on the system and\n\n326\n00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.090\nwhat do we do if there's\na log on that system.\n\n327\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:23.220\nWe just left some massive trail in\nthere that we're concerned someone's\n\n328\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.640\ngoing to see that and be able to\nsee what shenanigans we're up to.\n\n329\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.650\nBecause we've implanted something there.\n\n330\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.150\nYou know,\nyou choose what you want to implant.\n\n331\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.020\nYou better just run netcat\non there at that point.\n\n332\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.765\nUploaded it, ran it.\n\n333\n00:19:34.765 --> 00:19:36.695\nWith the switches and backed out.\n\n334\n00:19:36.695 --> 00:19:37.585\nFine.\n\n335\n00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:39.495\nOkay.\nNow you want to clear the event logs,\n\n336\n00:19:41.065 --> 00:19:41.995\nhow easy can you get?\n\n337\n00:19:41.995 --> 00:19:47.575\nJust type something like clear EBT and\nit's going to say did I type it in right?\n\n338\n00:19:47.575 --> 00:19:48.105\nIt's right.\n\n339\n00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:49.705\nOr clear EV.\n\n340\n00:19:49.705 --> 00:19:53.055\nIf you type in clear EV,\n\n341\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:00.010\ndo that, and just kinda do\na quick refresh there, and oh my.\n\n342\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.002\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gone.\n\n343\n00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:07.920\nI just went through and\nflattened those log files.\n\n344\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.300\nYeah there's something right here in my\nevent viewer saying that if I open it up,\n\n345\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.000\nand I would expect this to be there,\n\n346\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.650\nthe audit log is cleared,\nthat's gonna attract attention.\n\n347\n00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.860\n>> But it says by system.\n\n348\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.600\nSo yeah they're gonna know that-\n>> Good catch.\n\n349\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.300\n>> Exactly.\n\n350\n00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.880\nThey're gonna know that something's\nwrong if they were doing any auditing.\n\n351\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.620\nThey're gonna see blank log files and\nknow something's wrong,\n\n352\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.200\nbut as far as who did it,\nit looks like the system did it itself.\n\n353\n00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.960\nRight?\n>> Yeah, and\n\n354\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.140\nyou know,\nthat's a good catch to have that.\n\n355\n00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.580\nIn fact if I really want\nto cause some mischief and\n\n356\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.320\nmayhem here and\nplay a little pin the tail on the donkey.\n\n357\n00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.180\nI know you got a user account on here.\n\n358\n00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.780\nI'll steel his token,\nthen run that and blame it on him.\n\n359\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.570\n>> Got my token first and then run that,\nI would have shown up first.\n\n360\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.312\nThey're gonna come to me and say, why\nthe heck are you clearing your log files?\n\n361\n00:21:00.312 --> 00:21:01.171\nWhat are you up to?\n\n362\n00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:02.297\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n363\n00:21:02.297 --> 00:21:03.520\nAnd he'll be, I didn't do it.\n\n364\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.180\nAnd they're like, it says you did it.\n\n365\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.870\nAnd that's what they're trained to,\nas IT admins,\n\n366\n00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.830\nthey're trained to look at is,\nthis is what I see.\n\n367\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.590\nSo now if you're thinking\noutside the box and\n\n368\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.420\nknow about tools like this,\nthen you'll start, is this possible?\n\n369\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.340\nAnd then you'll start looking at other\nthings to see if perhaps there's\n\n370\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.980\nsomething going on.\n\n371\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.260\nBut the average IT admin's gonna look\nat you if you're saying I didn't do it.\n\n372\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.890\nGonna be like yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.\n\n373\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:34.630\n>> They're gonna have that\n\n374\n00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.600\nlight shining on my face,\n>> Yeah.\n\n375\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.260\n>> And\ndoing their little inquisition there.\n\n376\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.440\nWhat are you up to?\n\n377\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.360\nI swear it wasn't me.\n\n378\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.790\n>> Yeah, you know how it is.\n\n379\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.490\nWe're used to it in IT.\n\n380\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:51.700\nWe joke around about it, but we're used\nto the fact in IT that users aren't gonna\n\n381\n00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.200\nlie to me, they've never done anything\nthat could possibly harm that system.\n\n382\n00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.560\nWe're used to having that in our heads,\nso If someone tells you,\n\n383\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.060\nI didn't do it, yeah, whatever.\n\n384\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.220\nYou didn't do it, okay,\nsure, you didn't, all right.\n\n385\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.760\nAnd you just curse them out and\nleave, right?\n\n386\n00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.730\n>> [LAUGH] It's definitely not\ngonna be my first thought that oh,\n\n387\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.525\nmaybe somebody stole your token and did it\nthat way, somebody was impersonating you.\n\n388\n00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:15.450\nI'm gonna have a hard time believing that.\n\n389\n00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.620\nI'm gonna have that user,\nasking them all kinds of questions.\n\n390\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.370\nLike, look it shows right\nhere that you logged,\n\n391\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.540\nthat fact that you cleared that log file.\n\n392\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.040\n>> Yeah.\n\n393\n00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.610\nYeah, just quickly and easily,\nyou know did some nastiness, so.\n\n394\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.930\nReally kind of think about that.\n\n395\n00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.490\nAnd then, you know,\n\n396\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:40.500\nwe have some other stuff just to kind of\nthrow on a couple odds and ends here.\n\n397\n00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:49.810\nYou can go through if you are really\nsavvy with this, this REG command.\n\n398\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.620\nIt allows you to remotely\nedit that registry.\n\n399\n00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.960\nSo, if you wanna start shoving stuff\nin the registry or doing whatever,\n\n400\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.750\nyou can definitely have\nthe ability to do that,\n\n401\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.910\nbut you better- notice it's not that\nnice graphical thing you're used to.\n\n402\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.060\nSo you better really have it down.\n\n403\n00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.520\nBut that's not too difficult.\n\n404\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.260\nIt's just a matter of making sure you have\nan attention to detail with all that and\n\n405\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.460\nput it in the right spot.\n\n406\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.048\nBut, you have the ability to do that,\nand you're off to the races.\n\n407\n00:23:16.048 --> 00:23:16.571\n>> Wow.\n\n408\n00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:17.309\n>> I mean, so\n\n409\n00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:23.560\nwe've got a remote [LAUGH] registry editor\namongst a lot of our other little things.\n\n410\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:30.290\nThat are hiding out here and so you can\ntry a lot of little details in here.\n\n411\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.400\nYou're going to have to\nreally do these things\n\n412\n00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.520\nyourself to see which one's are of use to\nyou, which one's are of interest to you.\n\n413\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.600\nTry them all and watch what they do.\n\n414\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.020\nWe still have some more\nstuff that we're gonna show.\n\n415\n00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.500\nCuz to show you those last\nfew things they can do,\n\n416\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:55.077\nshouldn't say last few things, but\nsome really cool things it can do.\n\n417\n00:23:55.077 --> 00:23:57.849\nWe got that kinda coming up here so.\n\n418\n00:23:57.849 --> 00:23:58.621\n>> Good.\n\n419\n00:23:58.621 --> 00:23:59.231\n>> But.\n\n420\n00:23:59.231 --> 00:24:05.320\nHopefully you're impressed at\nthis point [LAUGH] already.\n\n421\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.070\nJust one more thing to kind\n\n422\n00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:14.250\nof talk about here at the end\nis this one called time stomp.\n\n423\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.620\nTime stomp.\n\n424\n00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.070\nWhat this does is you can see time stomp,\n\n425\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.530\nit asks you, hey,\nwhere do you want me to look for files?\n\n426\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.570\nAnd then you just set the switches on it.\n\n427\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.400\nOkay now what this is doing, this is\nspecifically one of those things that\n\n428\n00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.130\nwould be extremely useful\nas an anti-forensics tool.\n\n429\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:37.240\nBecause what you can do with this is,\nyou tell it where the files are,\n\n430\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.250\nwhat files it's looking for, and\nthen you just set the options,\n\n431\n00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.875\ntelling it what you want to change on it,\nand give the value, and it will change it.\n\n432\n00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:46.575\n>> Like that one there.\n\n433\n00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:49.885\nSet the base time stamp so\nthat in case shows blanks.\n\n434\n00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:53.679\nThat's gotta drive some\nforensic investigators crazy.\n\n435\n00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:57.175\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it definitely will.\n\n436\n00:24:57.175 --> 00:24:59.855\nIt will cause them to go nuts.\n\n437\n00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.030\nThey put this in the product.\n\n438\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:08.348\nSo, if you think as a pen tester, you\nwanna thwart the guys that are coming in\n\n439\n00:25:08.348 --> 00:25:11.657\nas forensics guys, and\nprobably testing their skills and\n\n440\n00:25:11.657 --> 00:25:14.991\nchecking their incident\nmanagement skills and all that?\n\n441\n00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.980\nOkay, I'll play that game.\n\n442\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.000\nI'll just go through and take note of all\nthe times and dates of the files going in.\n\n443\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.405\nAnd then on the way out, reset them\nback to the way they were and bail.\n\n444\n00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:27.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And go ahead.\n\n445\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.680\nDo all the forensics you want.\n\n446\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.380\nI mean you might find it eventually, but\n\n447\n00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:36.060\nI just added a whole new level of\ndifficulty to this type of stuff.\n\n448\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.890\nSo [INAUDIBLE] Guido's asking about all\nthe time levels accessed, modified.\n\n449\n00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.520\nLooks like those are all in that menu,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n450\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.251\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, d, all of the above.\n\n451\n00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what you can do.\n\n452\n00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.820\nYou've got all that stuff covered.\n\n453\n00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.140\nSo, that is definitely\nanti-forensics tool.\n\n454\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.190\nSo if you want to thwart\nsomeone coming in,\n\n455\n00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.240\nyou've got a way to actually thwart them.\n\n456\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.950\nAnd then you pointed out the EnCase stuff,\n\n457\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.070\nI mean it tells you what the mindset\nof someone writing this thing was,\n\n458\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:09.068\nis that, oh yeah I know EnCase, let me\njust go ahead and take care of that.\n\n459\n00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.620\nAll right, done.\n\n460\n00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.665\nWhat else can you really ask for\nat that point?\n\n461\n00:26:13.665 --> 00:26:16.287\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n462\n00:26:16.287 --> 00:26:17.146\n>> Very good.\n\n463\n00:26:17.146 --> 00:26:19.429\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentleman that's gonna do it for\n\n464\n00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:20.470\nthis particular episode.\n\n465\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.370\nI hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n466\n00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.940\nStay tuned,\nwe've got more Metasploit coming your way,\n\n467\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.290\nin fact we've got more\nMeterpreter coming your way.\n\n468\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.740\nSo if you thought that was cool\nhang tight, we've got more.\n\n469\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.620\nBut for now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n470\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.520\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n471\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.810\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:42.250\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.300\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.270\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.060\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.780\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.100\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.160\nWe have got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.050\nWe are continuing on with\nour Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.552\nIn this particular episode, we are going\nto continue on with Meterpreter.\n\n11\n00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:32.815\nNow we We've seen a couple episodes\nwhere we've covered Meterpreter.\n\n12\n00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:35.105\nIf you missed those,\nmake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n13\n00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:38.595\nBut we've seen how to get it started,\nhow to make that initial connection, and\n\n14\n00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.035\nsome pretty impressive commands,\n\n15\n00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:44.835\nthings we can do once we've established\na connection with that remote machine.\n\n16\n00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.655\nBut Sean tells me there's\neven more stuff we can do.\n\n17\n00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:52.675\nEven more fantastic, cooler, if that's\nthe word, cooler stuff that we can do.\n\n18\n00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.050\nSo Sean, what do you got for us next here?\n\n19\n00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.060\n>> Yeah well the next thing I'm gonna look\nat is kind of seeing what the next level\n\n20\n00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.830\nis, or what's some things that are outside\nthe norm you can do with Meterpreter.\n\n21\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.790\nWhat we've done so far is,\nwe have browsed the remote system,\n\n22\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.140\nwe've seen how we can execute\nstuff from the remote system,\n\n23\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.930\nwe've seen how we can crack passwords and\nescalate privileges, and\n\n24\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.710\nnothing to sneeze at, really,\nwe've done quite a bit there.\n\n25\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.860\nThe question is, is that,\nwhat are these other things we can do.\n\n26\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.570\nAnd what we're going do is we're going\nto see how we can use the Meterpreter\n\n27\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.880\nto turn our system into a remote\nsurveillance or spying device,\n\n28\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.700\nwhich is really kind of an interesting\nthing when you look at it,\n\n29\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.460\nbecause on top of all the stuff we've done\nso far, and to observe what's going on in\n\n30\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.960\nthe system and all that good stuff,\nnow we're gonna see okay, what can we\n\n31\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.910\ndo to find out who's doing what around it,\nand capture what they're doing.\n\n32\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.900\nSo kind of a frightening thing when\nyou look at it from one perspective.\n\n33\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.880\nBut kinda cool when\nyou're looking at it too,\n\n34\n00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920\nis you can see quite a bit and\nlearn quite a bit doing things this way.\n\n35\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.520\n>> Yeah, so\nnow you're telling me that after we've\n\n36\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.670\ntaken advantage of this machine, gotten\nall the information we could off of it,\n\n37\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.640\nwe're gonna turn around and have it spy,\nforce it gathering additional information.\n\n38\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.810\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n39\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.940\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n40\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.800\nWe're gonna start\ncapturing more information.\n\n41\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.680\nAnd, so an interpreter offers\nreally all of these things that\n\n42\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550\nallow us to do all these\nreally neat things.\n\n43\n00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.190\nSo what can it do?\n\n44\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.050\nWell, what it can do,\nis it has the ability to catch keystrokes,\n\n45\n00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.620\nso it can intercept that.\n\n46\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.530\nIt has the ability to use the camera,\nthe webcam on a system if it's enabled.\n\n47\n00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.920\nIt can take snapshots out of that,\nand send them back to you.\n\n48\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.610\nAnd it can even do things\nlike record audio remotely.\n\n49\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.360\nSo that's what we've got, that's what\nwe've got in our capability list.\n\n50\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.050\nAnd so we're gonna see what that is and\nhow that works, and\n\n51\n00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.490\nthen you can feel free to explore\nthe different possibilities.\n\n52\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.950\nYou know with that, but just saying you\nhave those is already a lot as it is.\n\n53\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.500\nSo let's kind of get into things and\nsee you know and how that actually works.\n\n54\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.980\nWell you know, first of all just kind of\ngo to give you the chunk of commands that\n\n55\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.840\ndo that, you can see that we've got,\noops I went right past it there.\n\n56\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280\nYou can see that I have,\nlet me maximize or\n\n57\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.560\nlet me change the view\non that a little bit.\n\n58\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.330\nYou'll notice that., I have,\nwhere is it, right there.\n\n59\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.040\nI've got some of them in the top and some\nof them bottom of the webcam commands.\n\n60\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280\nYou can see that I have\nthe key scan commands.\n\n61\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.060\nI've already shown the screenshot one,\n\n62\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.610\nwhich will be a good way of\nshowing you what's on screen, but\n\n63\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.450\nI want to turn out the other way, and\nstart looking at stuff around it.\n\n64\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.930\nSo what I have is those keyscan commands.\n\n65\n00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.150\nThose ones will do exactly,\nyou know, like you expect.\n\n66\n00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.960\nThose ones go through and\nwill if you do keyscan, start,\n\n67\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.560\nyou can start intercepting keystrokes and\nyou can start and stop at any time.\n\n68\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.260\nAnd you can even go through,\nas you can see, dump the keystroke buffer.\n\n69\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.840\nSo you can dump that out to a file,\nand bring that back to you and\n\n70\n00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.642\nopen it up and see what's in there,\nor you can do it there locally, too.\n\n71\n00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:25.620\nYou actuall can look at files and\nopen them up.\n\n72\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.530\nText files, you can open them up remotely\nusing what they call of the Cat command.\n\n73\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.550\nYou can do Cat and then the file name and\nit will open it up and let you view it.\n\n74\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.910\nSo that's another neat\ncapability we have there and\n\n75\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.560\nall you gotta do to run that\nis just do key scan, and\n\n76\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.170\nthen underscore start, hit enter and you\ncan see it just went ahead and started it.\n\n77\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.840\nAnd it's gonna stay like that\nas long as we're going ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.830\njust sitting here doing our thing.\n\n79\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.370\nAnd when we're done you just do\nthe keyscan_stop and it will, done.\n\n80\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.430\nIt's turned off and between that I\ncould have done the keyscan dump or\n\n81\n00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.990\nyou can even do it now, do a keyscan\ndump and just pipe it out to a file and\n\n82\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.270\nI have a text file with all those\nthings that someone had typed\n\n83\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.040\nduring that time period on that system,\nI will have captured that.\n\n84\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.180\n>> So, any keystroke logger is gonna\ncapture all those keystrokes, including\n\n85\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.180\ntyping into password fields that might\nbe obfuscated, or anything like that?\n\n86\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.140\n>> Yeah.\nIt would grab those things.\n\n87\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.920\nAs long as they're pecking\naway on that keyboard,\n\n88\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.740\nit's gonna intercept those things.\n\n89\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.826\n>> Fantastic.\n>> So, just built right in.\n\n90\n00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:41.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nothing special there.\n\n91\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.640\nIn terms of you have capabilities, it's\njust no software you have to implant or\n\n92\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.870\nanything like that.\n\n93\n00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.050\nSo that's just one thing you can do.\n\n94\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.660\nLike I said, you can get passwords and\nstuff like that.\n\n95\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.595\nBut there are other things in here, and\n\n96\n00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:01.298\nthat's where we have our\nwebcam-based commands.\n\n97\n00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:06.172\nOur webcam-based commands,\nyou can see that, if you look at them,\n\n98\n00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:10.300\nI can list my webcams on there,\nyou could do a webcam list.\n\n99\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.110\nYou know I don't expect to see any because\nthere is no, I've disabled the webcam on\n\n100\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.750\nthis anyway, and that system\ndoesn't have access to it if I did.\n\n101\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.210\nBut if that system did have a webcam list,\n\n102\n00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.270\nI would be seeing that,\nright now, would you say?\n\n103\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.330\nHere's the device right there and\n\n104\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.140\nall we'd have to do at that point is\njust choose what you wanna do up top.\n\n105\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.560\nDo you want to take a snapshot with it?\n\n106\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.190\nJust tell it which camera you\nwanna take a snapshot with.\n\n107\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.060\nSay webcam snap,\n\n108\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.720\nspecify it and it'll take a snapshot with\nthat of who's sitting in front of it.\n\n109\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.450\nIf that's not good enough for you and\n\n110\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.140\nyou want video,\nyou've got the web cam stream option.\n\n111\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.410\n>> Wow.\n>> You just tell it,\n\n112\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.350\nweb cam stream, tell it what device\nyou wanna stream it out of and\n\n113\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.870\nit will start grabbing\nthe video out of that instead.\n\n114\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.570\nSo and then you've got shad, if you\nreally want to take it to the next level.\n\n115\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.580\nBut of course, I think it kind of breaks\nout of the whole idea of being stealthy.\n\n116\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.690\nIt's like hey, what are you doing?\n\n117\n00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.670\n>> Absolutely not going to help me\nmaintain my anonymous nature there.\n\n118\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.280\n>> Yeah,\nI wouldn't consider that stealthy, but\n\n119\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.940\nhey everyone rolls a different way.\n\n120\n00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.080\nYou know, whatever.\n\n121\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.250\n>> We could have her put\na ski mask on first and then-\n\n122\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.272\n>> Yeah, whatever.\n\n123\n00:07:29.272 --> 00:07:30.663\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whichever way you wanna do it.\n\n124\n00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:36.021\nYeah, so but you've got those, and\nthen you can even see at the top\n\n125\n00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:42.049\nof the list for the webcam commands,\nyou even have the record mic command so\n\n126\n00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:46.736\nyou can do record mic and\nyou can tell it number of seconds or\n\n127\n00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:51.850\nwhatever after it and\nit will go ahead and turn the thing on.\n\n128\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.120\nHere I just said record mic, it was\nclicked really quick because I didn't\n\n129\n00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.270\nhave the time period, but\nyou could put a time period after that.\n\n130\n00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.980\nYou can see that it has record\naudio from default microphone for\n\n131\n00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.750\nx number of seconds.\n\n132\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.280\nYou just put the number of seconds you\nwant to have the thing turned on and\n\n133\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.680\nit will record it and give it back to you.\n\n134\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.010\nIn fact you'll see down there, it also\nmakes it easy because what did it do?\n\n135\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.320\nIt recorded it,\nin the command that I issued there, and\n\n136\n00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.110\nit saved it right up to\nroot as a wave file.\n\n137\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.500\nSo it brought it right back down to me,\nand hey, I can start playing that.\n\n138\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.955\nIf they were, who knows?\n\n139\n00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:32.815\nYou get this in the right situation and\nyou can open this up to some,\n\n140\n00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:36.195\nopen up a connection to somebody that\nhappens to be taking their notebook or\n\n141\n00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:38.445\nsomething like that,\nout to a conference room, let's say.\n\n142\n00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:42.305\nTurn the thing on and you can start\nlistening in on what's going on in there.\n\n143\n00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.900\n>> Wow.\n>> You know, take clips along the way.\n\n144\n00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.620\nIf that was something that\nwas worthwhile to do.\n\n145\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.930\n>> So we can capture keystrokes, we can\ncapture audio from their microphone,\n\n146\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.880\nwe can capture video from their webcam.\n\n147\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.660\nIt's pretty impressive.\n\n148\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.700\n>> Yeah.\nIt's really come kind of a long way.\n\n149\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.520\nWe've gone from just interacting\nwith the system to now,\n\n150\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.570\nusing the system to monitor\neverything in that environment.\n\n151\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.180\nAnd then you can even\nsee one more command,\n\n152\n00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.970\nI kind of want to talk\nabout is this UICTL.\n\n153\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.620\nUICTL, you can see, this allows you\nto kind of take control over or\n\n154\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.080\nmess with the person's keyboard and mouse.\n\n155\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.760\nSo if you wanted to do stuff\nwith that you could do it.\n\n156\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.300\nYou could send keystrokes to that system,\nor you can enable,\n\n157\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.340\ndisable, whatever that device forum,\nwhen you wanna tick someone off and\n\n158\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.350\ndisable their keyboard or their mouse and\nthen just sit back and watch the fun.\n\n159\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.800\nAnd so you've got quite a bit\nof capability there and\n\n160\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.513\nthat's not even including if you\ndownload stuff like that Powershell,\n\n161\n00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:52.902\nthe script that I was talking about,\nyou know?\n\n162\n00:09:52.902 --> 00:09:56.460\nThe Powershell one,\nyou upload that to a system and run it.\n\n163\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.800\nYou're gonna see a remote desktop\ntype thing come down your way, and\n\n164\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.690\nthen you can start browsing\nthe system that way, too.\n\n165\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.590\n>> Wow, yeah.\n>> So, there's kind of just the short,\n\n166\n00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:14.660\na kind of a short look at what you could\nuse, it turns into a surveillance device.\n\n167\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.610\nAnd if you want to go third party and\nstart seeing what else is out there,\n\n168\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.470\nthat opens up even more possibilities.\n\n169\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.790\nI believe that there's ones that allow\nyou to do stuff like access GPS's and\n\n170\n00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.630\nstuff like that.\n\n171\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.880\nSo that would even take you one step\nfurther beyond what we have here built in.\n\n172\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.300\n>> So now you've figured\nout where their laptop was,\n\n173\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.410\nas well as capture information off of it.\n\n174\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.110\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n175\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.745\nIt's, you know so that's really\nbumping things up quite a bit.\n\n176\n00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:40.850\n>> Mm-hm, I'll say.\n\n177\n00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.660\nAll right a lot of good stuff there.\n\n178\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.670\nYou know another one I think\nwe probably should talk about\n\n179\n00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.020\nis the anti virus software right?\n\n180\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.060\n>> Yes.\n>> Ways I can kill that, turn that off.\n\n181\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.930\nYes.\nThat is another interesting\n\n182\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.820\nthing that you can do.\n\n183\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.110\nThere are commands that you can run,\n\n184\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.920\nthat you can just terminate\nan antivirus on Windows.\n\n185\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.690\nThey have a specialized commands for\nthat, that will go in, and\n\n186\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.870\njust flip a switch and\nterminate the execution of your antivirus,\n\n187\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.770\nand once you have that out of the way,\nyou've got other stuff you can do now,\n\n188\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.110\nbecause you're starting to\nsystematically disable their defences.\n\n189\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.860\nYou choose what you're gonna do at that\npoint, cuz now the stuff that you couldn't\n\n190\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.780\nget in before, because the AntiVirus was\nthere blocking it, you've just put it so\n\n191\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.990\nsleep, and\nnow you're putting stuff on the system.\n\n192\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.910\n>> All right, wow.\n>> And if you do,\n\n193\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.811\nif you look through that list of things,\nof commands,\n\n194\n00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:42.830\nof things we're able to execute,\nyou may even have to kill the AntiVirus.\n\n195\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.390\nThere actually is the ability, on that\nlist, to suspend certain processes for\n\n196\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.340\na period of time, and so you may just find\n\n197\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.070\nthat you can suspend some of these\ndefensive processes just long enough\n\n198\n00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.130\nto slip something on to the system to\nbe able to do what it needs to and\n\n199\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.200\ntake up residence there before you\nbring those things back online.\n\n200\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.320\n>> Wow.\n\n201\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.730\n>> That's just another thing you can do.\n\n202\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.450\nAnd then there's stuff to scrape all\nsorts of information off a system and\n\n203\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.410\nstuff like that.\n\n204\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:18.380\nSo you've got just a lot of little\nfeatures out here that are waiting for\n\n205\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.050\nyou to discover them and\nplay around with them.\n\n206\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.362\n>> Yeah.\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\n207\n00:12:22.362 --> 00:12:23.720\nYou know, my first thought was ooh,\n\n208\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.150\nnow if they will turn off their\nAV I can get Netacad up there, but\n\n209\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:32.080\nI don't really need it if I've got\nMeterpreter running at this point right?\n\n210\n00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.230\n>> Yeah.\nIf you\n\n211\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.900\nare able to get a Meterpreter session\nopen, it gives you a lot, but\n\n212\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.910\nyou have got to think if you have\nthe Meterpreter session, you might be\n\n213\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:48.200\nusing it just briefly to drop something\noff in the system to install it,\n\n214\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.270\nand that way later on,\nyou can connect at will.\n\n215\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:13:00.110\nThis one, you have an active connection\nthat you've got on or it's just not being\n\n216\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.730\nused, the other ones can sit there and\nlisten for you to come back at any time.\n\n217\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.340\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n218\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.480\n>> So, that might be a benefit\nto having the other ones.\n\n219\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.770\nI mean, there's no one tool that's gonna\nsolve really all the problems, but\n\n220\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.640\nyou can combine them to get something\nthat's greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n221\n00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.300\n>> Alright, well really impressive\nsoftware there, Meterpreter.\n\n222\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.180\nAnything else we wanna talk\nabout with Meterpreter?\n\n223\n00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.020\n>> There are some other things you can do.\n\n224\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.460\nThere are some more advanced things that,\nyou know,\n\n225\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.280\nI won't even worry about\ngetting into them in here.\n\n226\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.050\nBut you can create your own\nspecialized scripts that will\n\n227\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.160\nrun things in Meterpreter.\n\n228\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.750\nYou can actually also have\nfiles that you can write\n\n229\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.700\nthat you can tell Meterpreter to\ngo to that file, and line by line,\n\n230\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.330\nrun all the commands and it'll just run\nright through the list automatically.\n\n231\n00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.910\nSo you just have to issue a command\nsaying go read what's in that file and\n\n232\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.840\nrun this stuff, and it will take\ncare of all that stuff for you.\n\n233\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.135\nSo if you have a sequence of commands\nthat you'd like to go through,\n\n234\n00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:05.935\nonce you gain access to specific systems,\n\n235\n00:14:05.935 --> 00:14:10.975\nyou can essentially have a batch file\nthat just reads right through and\n\n236\n00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.950\nruns these things for you,\nand takes care of business.\n\n237\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.550\nYeah, so\nthere's little things like that that\n\n238\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.810\nyou can do to really kind of get more\nmileage out of some of this stuff.\n\n239\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.570\n>> Wow.\n\n240\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.680\nWell, I tell you what, John,\nthat's a lot of good information.\n\n241\n00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.120\nIn quite a few episodes we\nwent over Meterpreter, so\n\n242\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.340\nmake sure you go back and\ncheck all of those out,\n\n243\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.130\nbecause we basically took it from\nbeginning and a lot of good stuff there.\n\n244\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.510\nAnything else we want to throw in\nbefore we wrap this up, sew it up?\n\n245\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.840\n>> Hey,\nif you have time to experiment I think.\n\n246\n00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.510\nThat's what it is I think for all of you\nout there, is really to experiment with\n\n247\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:51.660\nthis and start kicking the tires and\nplaying around and see what you can do.\n\n248\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.050\nYou will learn quite a bit, trust me.\n\n249\n00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.490\nAnd give you a whole new appreciation\nof things you can do, or\n\n250\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.650\nof how powerful this product is once\nyou start playing around with it too.\n\n251\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.730\n>> Absolutely, all right we hope\nyou enjoyed watching this episode,\n\n252\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.720\nI know we enjoyed filming it.\n\n253\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.600\nI'm signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n254\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.330\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n255\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.000\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n256\n00:15:12.000 -->

00:00:17.890\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.940\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.520\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow you doing today?\n\n6\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.710\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.157\nWe've got another fantastic\nepisode coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.742\nIn our Metasploit series and\n\n9\n00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:29.780\nin particular in this one we're gonna\nbe covering social engineering.\n\n10\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.553\nNow Sean, social engineering is one of\nthose things that we've probably heard\n\n11\n00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:34.800\nthat term here and there.\n\n12\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.213\nWe've seen it in a few\nof our other episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:42.460\nI know we covered it when we went\nover CEH, and our DFI classes.\n\n14\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.236\nBut it is a big part of any\ntype of penetration test,\n\n15\n00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.801\nso it's something that we've\ngotta cover here as well, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:53.490\n>> Yeah, it is definitely\nsomething we have to talk about.\n\n17\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.150\nAnd what we're talking about in this\nparticular section is something that we\n\n18\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.320\nsaw when we previously did Kali,\nas when we were going through the whole\n\n19\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.820\nprocess of exploring different parts\nof Kali and how it worked and all that.\n\n20\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.249\nOne of the things we hit upon briefly,\nwas the social engineering toolkit.\n\n21\n00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.018\nThe social engineering toolkit,\nif you watched that segment,\n\n22\n00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:21.621\nyou saw that it was something that had a\nwhole interface on it that allowed you to\n\n23\n00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.600\nconstruct different types of\nsocial engineering attacks.\n\n24\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.840\nAnd it was an interesting thing to look\nat just from when you're looking at just\n\n25\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.460\nstrictly from walking around that Kali\ninterface and how it works, but once we go\n\n26\n00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.580\nthrough and we mate that with Metasploit,\nit brings everything to a whole new level.\n\n27\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.470\nSo that's what we wanna kinda\nexplore through this whole section.\n\n28\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.640\nSo you've seen it before, you've seen\nus kinda go through menus and look at\n\n29\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.585\nthat it can do different types of phishing\nattacks and it can do stuff like that.\n\n30\n00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:01.545\nBut we can also mix in some of\nthe stuff that Metasploit has\n\n31\n00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:04.745\nbehind the scenes, and\nmake the things even more powerful,\n\n32\n00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:08.882\nand more capable than they\nwere just on their own.\n\n33\n00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:10.472\nSo some neat stuff, really.\n\n34\n00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:15.732\nBut we really need to kind of understand\nsocial engineering just a little bit\n\n35\n00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:16.992\nwhen we go into it.\n\n36\n00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:20.912\nBecause we've covered social engineering\nlike you said, in other places already.\n\n37\n00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:21.661\n>> We have.\n\n38\n00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:25.800\nIt's one of those things that maybe\ndoesn't get enough coverage sometimes.\n\n39\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.112\nIt's one of those things.\n\n40\n00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:30.530\nOne that was the first time\nI've ever seen any kind of tool\n\n41\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.850\ndesigned to do social engineering, has a\nvery human oriented type attack typically.\n\n42\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.295\nWe might be using emails to start\nthe scam or stuff like that.\n\n43\n00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:40.900\nAnd remember,\nwe talk about social engineering.\n\n44\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.040\nWe're taking advantage of human nature,\n\n45\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.520\ngetting people to give up information\nthat they shouldn't be most likely.\n\n46\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.584\nTaking advantage of the fact that\nthe human is sometimes the weakest link in\n\n47\n00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:52.172\na system.\n\n48\n00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.841\n>> Yeah that's really it,\n\n49\n00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:58.052\nthat's why you wanna employ some\nform of social engineering or\n\n50\n00:02:58.052 --> 00:03:03.058\nwhy it may be something that you'd\nconsider employing as part of your whole\n\n51\n00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:07.984\nprocess because you do have that weakest\nlink that carbon based element in\n\n52\n00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:13.068\nthe system that maybe the easier thing\noverall to get information out of when\n\n53\n00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:17.835\nyou get down to it because you can just\ndo so many things to manipulate and\n\n54\n00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:23.180\njust take advantage of human nature and\nhuman behavior to get a desired result.\n\n55\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.080\nI think we in the CEH,\nwe're talking about the fact that\n\n56\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.780\nyou may not even need to\nbreak a password or anything.\n\n57\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.641\nFor example, you may just be\nable to go and talk to someone,\n\n58\n00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:38.592\nask just out right what's your password\nand some people will give that to you, and\n\n59\n00:03:38.592 --> 00:03:40.097\nthey even should know better.\n\n60\n00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:43.188\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not even taking into account\n\n61\n00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:48.210\nthat you could do little clever tricks,\nif you wanna call it that.\n\n62\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.750\nTo ask someone, says what type of\npassword do you have or something?\n\n63\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.440\nThen just start talking to them and\nduring the conversation, guide it towards\n\n64\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.070\nthose particular things to get a good\nidea of what their password may be.\n\n65\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.884\n>> And really,\nif we're doing a thorough pin test,\n\n66\n00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:05.168\nif we don't include testing that part.\n\n67\n00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:08.520\nReally couldn't consider that\na complete pin test could you?\n\n68\n00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.426\n>> Well it depends on what\nthe client specs out.\n\n69\n00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:16.180\nA client may not want that,\nso if they don't then fine.\n\n70\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.680\nBut a lot of testers do\ninclude some sort of element\n\n71\n00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.460\nof social engineering\nas part of their suite.\n\n72\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.022\nIt might not be really pronounced or\nlarge part of it, but\n\n73\n00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:29.558\nit usually occupies some space of that.\n\n74\n00:04:29.558 --> 00:04:33.401\nBut how far you go with it or how much\nyou include, really depends on what\n\n75\n00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:37.757\nthe requirements of the test are, if they\njust want you to do the technical side of\n\n76\n00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:40.833\nit then you're probably not\ngonna get much chance to do or\n\n77\n00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:44.270\nmuch opportunity really to bring\nin social engineering part.\n\n78\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.210\nSo if you're doing, now if you're\ndoing a fully complete one then yeah,\n\n79\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.560\nI could definitely see it employing or\n\n80\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.930\ntaking up a large portion of\nall of your planned testing.\n\n81\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.710\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n82\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.940\nSo what types of social engineering\ndo we need to be familiar with or\n\n83\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.280\nwhat methods I guess?\n\n84\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.270\nWe're talking like shoulder surfing, and\ndumpster diving and things like that?\n\n85\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.305\n>> Yeah, those are some common\ntypes of doing social engineering\n\n86\n00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:20.400\nis looking over people's shoulders,\ndoing that shoulder surfing.\n\n87\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680\nThat would be a perfect example\ntaking advantage of human nature,\n\n88\n00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.010\nand just kind of the way people do things.\n\n89\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.957\nAnd then there's the dumpster diving is\n\n90\n00:05:27.957 --> 00:05:28.655\nan old-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:31.040\n>> School one that still really works.\n\n92\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.106\nBut there's plenty of other ones\nthat exploit things like trust,\n\n93\n00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:39.173\nI want to say exploit.\n\n94\n00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.228\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that take advantage-\n\n95\n00:05:41.228 --> 00:05:42.255\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:45.473\n>> Yeah, of things like not just human\n\n97\n00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:49.442\nnature and habit, but\nthings l like I said,\n\n98\n00:05:49.442 --> 00:05:55.410\ntheir trust,\nother moral obligation to do something.\n\n99\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.484\n>> Respect for authority,\nthings like that?\n\n100\n00:05:56.484 --> 00:05:58.672\n>> Respect for authority.\n\n101\n00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:02.630\nKind of compelling them or\nintimidating them to do something.\n\n102\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.750\nThere's a number of things that human\nbeings have built into them by force of\n\n103\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.720\nhabit and by society that you can\ndefinitely take advantage of and\n\n104\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.190\nit's just do you recognize\nthe opportunity and\n\n105\n00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.230\ndo you know what the tools are you\ncan use, when those things come up?\n\n106\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.170\nAnd once we've trained you how to do that\nthen you can be a very potent force for\n\n107\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.770\ngathering information.\n\n108\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.720\nNow, what we're gonna be doing with\nthe technical stuff here is just kind of\n\n109\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.540\nlooking at things like constructing\nphishing attacks and stuff like that.\n\n110\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.990\nSo using a technology as a delivery\nmessage to deliver exploits and\n\n111\n00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.630\nstuff like that out to someone's system.\n\n112\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.610\nSo it's not necessarily going into\nall the areas of the big bad world of\n\n113\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.950\nsocial engineering but\nit is definitely including parts of it.\n\n114\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.624\n>> So some things with social engineering\nyou really can't do through a computer.\n\n115\n00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.093\nIf you're doing name drop,\n\n116\n00:06:57.093 --> 00:07:00.459\nyou might have found some information\nduring our footprinting or\n\n117\n00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:04.210\nour reconnaissance phase maybe names\nof people that I wanna try to drop.\n\n118\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.960\nI call somebody on the phone, and\nI can do some name dropping or\n\n119\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.330\nin that email that I sent,\nforge some headers in there.\n\n120\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330\nTo make it look like it came\nfrom somebody that they would\n\n121\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.360\nthink was in a position of authority.\n\n122\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.080\n>> Yeah, you can definitely do those\nsorts of things and more, really.\n\n123\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.220\nSo what we wanna do is see\nwhat this kit can offer.\n\n124\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.874\nAnd like you said, this kit is\nkinda somewhat unique as far as\n\n125\n00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:35.070\ntools go because there are tools\nout there to be sure for\n\n126\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.633\ndoing social engineering but\nsince it's such a human based\n\n127\n00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:44.530\nthing that there's probably\nnot a tun of amount there.\n\n128\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.190\nBut they are out there as\nwe can see with this one.\n\n129\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:54.400\nThis is one of the ones that has gotten\nsome attention at it or in this area.\n\n130\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.900\nTools that we have out there\nhave done social engineering or\n\n131\n00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.120\nhave been used in it are things like\ninstant messaging and stuff like that.\n\n132\n00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.500\nBut if you get down to it,\ninstant messaging,\n\n133\n00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.630\nemail stuff like that wasn't\nspecifically designed for that purpose.\n\n134\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.960\nThey were designed to\ntransmit information.\n\n135\n00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.736\nWe would as social engineers,\n\n136\n00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:14.960\njust be taking advantage of\nthose to gain information.\n\n137\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.830\nSo this is a tool that's\nreally kind of designed for\n\n138\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.305\nthat purpose of crafting something that\ncan be used during a social engineering\n\n139\n00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:26.880\nattack to get more information or\nmore access than we would have otherwise.\n\n140\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.106\n>> And the types of information they can\nget with social engineering are really\n\n141\n00:08:31.106 --> 00:08:31.837\nunlimited.\n\n142\n00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:36.059\nIt depends on who I target I guess within\nthat company to targeting that person at\n\n143\n00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.780\nthe front desk might yield me so\nmuch information.\n\n144\n00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.689\nTargeting a department manager could\nyield different information and etc.\n\n145\n00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:48.553\nI keep thinking of that story you tell\nabout the guy that was doing the testing\n\n146\n00:08:48.553 --> 00:08:50.080\nwith the banks system.\n\n147\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.083\nYou have to tell that one one more time.\n\n148\n00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:54.039\n>> Sure, I think there's more\nI've told you because I know-\n\n149\n00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.531\n>> I've said a uniform.\n\n150\n00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.883\n>> Oh yeah, yeah, that one, okay.\n\n151\n00:08:56.883 --> 00:09:00.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you didn't catch that one,\n\n152\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.114\nthey had an individual that\nwas doing a pin test, and\n\n153\n00:09:05.114 --> 00:09:09.050\nthe way the guy did it\ndressed in a very or it said,\n\n154\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.330\nreasonably official looking get\nup with just a collared shirt and\n\n155\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.320\ngot himself a realistic looking badge.\n\n156\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.940\nAnd just walked into banks and\n\n157\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.860\nplugged in devices that would\nin turn plug into the network.\n\n158\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.200\nAnd he claimed he was from the power\ncompany and that they were\n\n159\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.790\nhaving some weird stuff going on\nwith the power grid in their area so\n\n160\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.590\nhe came in to test the stuff out to\nmake sure the bank wasn't affected.\n\n161\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.770\n>> Which gave him a good reason\nto plug things into the wall.\n\n162\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.494\n>> Yeah, [CROSSTALK] exactly.\n\n163\n00:09:41.494 --> 00:09:45.382\nAnd definitely to plug it into their\nnetwork cuz hey, I need this thing to\n\n164\n00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:49.410\nactually be able to send information\nto me, so I can monitor it remotely.\n\n165\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.950\nOh well, that makes sense.\n\n166\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.460\nAnd guys getting escorted by the bank\nmanager are all around the place and\n\n167\n00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.700\none case, he actually got into a vault and\nwas escorted right in there as part of it.\n\n168\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.550\nSo it shows that yeah,\nthere's different forms.\n\n169\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:12.930\nIn this case, it was just a person that\nprobably didn't even buy the shirt really.\n\n170\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Probably just went through and\n\n171\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.020\njust grabbed something off there and\nstuck it on and walked in.\n\n172\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.990\nThat's probably all it took.\n\n173\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.885\nSo the bar can be kinda low [LAUGH] and\nso, and some of these cases and\n\n174\n00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:27.320\nit worked for him.\n\n175\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.843\nHe got in and was able to,\nover the course of just a morning or\n\n176\n00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:36.370\nafternoon get access to three\ndifferent banks in that chain\n\n177\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.016\nbefore they caught the bank\nwho was his client.\n\n178\n00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:42.303\nFor this contacts say okay,\nwe get the point.\n\n179\n00:10:42.303 --> 00:10:45.435\nJust stop, we've got other issues\nwe've got to talk about first.\n\n180\n00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:46.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So-\n\n181\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.345\n>> I can just see the bank owner or\n\n182\n00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:51.754\nwhoever set it up,\ngoing time out okay, I give.\n\n183\n00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:55.083\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and you definitely can picture\n\n184\n00:10:55.083 --> 00:11:00.139\nthat type of scenario taking place,\nthat [LAUGH] so it was like oh yeah,\n\n185\n00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:04.613\nwe gotta stop, we gotta take care\nof this first and then go on.\n\n186\n00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:09.959\nAnd look at doing all\nthe other stuff along the way.\n\n187\n00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.223\n>> They probably had a big bank that\nthey've got regulations here in the states\n\n188\n00:11:13.223 --> 00:11:14.500\nthat they've got to follow.\n\n189\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.970\nThey probably had a pretty secure network.\n\n190\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.634\nWhen it comes down to it,\nthe problem is with social engineering,\n\n191\n00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:21.070\nwe're not attacking the network.\n\n192\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.471\nWe're attacking the people and\nthat's a lot harder to pack.\n\n193\n00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.822\nI can't download a patch to fix humans.\n\n194\n00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:31.691\nWe can educate them, we can teach them,\nwe can have classes and\n\n195\n00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.735\nmeetings and things like that and\n\n196\n00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:38.643\nthat's really the only way to help\nprevent those social engineering attacks.\n\n197\n00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:44.526\n>> Yeah, it's like anything\nespecially with social engineering,\n\n198\n00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:47.053\nyou have to keep on top of it.\n\n199\n00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:50.234\nIf you're not consciously\nthinking about something or\n\n200\n00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:54.520\nyou don't use a skill all the time,\nit is gonna become perishable.\n\n201\n00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.380\nAnd if you don't train people how\nto deal with social engineering or\n\n202\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.150\neven recognize it, because no one's\njust coming and and saying oh,\n\n203\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.410\nI'm doing social engineering, and\nI'm gonna through the process.\n\n204\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.910\nIt's not that obvious.\n\n205\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.650\nSo you need to train people\nhow to recognize these things.\n\n206\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.128\nHow to deal with them and\nyou need to do refresher training.\n\n207\n00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:19.390\nIt's like anything you talk about but you\nknow even more with social engineering I\n\n208\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:25.250\nwould say, so you develop a skill\nyou gotta keep it current.\n\n209\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.307\n>> Yep, users you have one you got\na turnover rate with your employees\n\n210\n00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:30.225\nusers that aren't doing it all the time.\n\n211\n00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:33.711\nIt's not something that they're having to\ndo every day, it's just something we've\n\n212\n00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.862\ntaught them say look, when somebody\ncomes through the building and you don't\n\n213\n00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:40.080\nrecognize them, stop them and ask them\nif you can help them, things like that.\n\n214\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.938\nBut if I don't remind them constantly\nof those kind of things hey, lock your\n\n215\n00:12:43.938 --> 00:12:47.813\ncomputer when you walk away things\nlike that, they forget, they get lazy.\n\n216\n00:12:47.813 --> 00:12:51.300\nAnd so it's like you say,\nit's a constant reminder.\n\n217\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.830\nI know companies that put\nposters up around the place,\n\n218\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.690\nfun looking little posters.\n\n219\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.280\nMy brother worked for a company that had\na forced screensaver that everybody had\n\n220\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.900\nto use, and it was stupid little\ncartoon characters doing little things.\n\n221\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.860\nAnd a little message would pop up and\nremind him hey, if you don't recognize\n\n222\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.390\nsomebody, ask them if you can help them or\ndon't leave your computer unlocked.\n\n223\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.565\nAnd a little skit with monkeys involved,\nwhatever.\n\n224\n00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:17.210\nBut the idea was,\nit was a constant reminder,\n\n225\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.050\nevery time that computer went to sleep or\nthat screen saver kicked in.\n\n226\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.880\nThey were reminded of that training,\n\n227\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.400\nso that's the kind of thing you have to\ndo to protect against social engineering.\n\n228\n00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.083\n>> Yeah, the smart organizations will\ndo refresher training on this on\n\n229\n00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:34.510\nsome schedule.\n\n230\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.157\nSome of the big organizations,\n\n231\n00:13:36.157 --> 00:13:39.695\nyou see them do it once a year,\nwhere they will have someone sit down,\n\n232\n00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:43.965\nmaybe one of those brown bag lunches type\nof deal, they'll have people sit down and\n\n233\n00:13:43.965 --> 00:13:47.085\ndo a quick refresher on it to\nmake sure everyone's on board.\n\n234\n00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:50.490\nPeople will sign off that they were there.\n\n235\n00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.390\nHopefully that does enough to\nkind of as stop the number,\n\n236\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.348\nwe slow down the number of social\nengineering attacks that we have people\n\n237\n00:13:59.348 --> 00:14:03.007\nstart to ask questions\nbecause people after awhile,\n\n238\n00:14:03.007 --> 00:14:07.426\nthey will just go back to their\nold behaviors in regards to this.\n\n239\n00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:09.800\nWe may tell them hey, challenge somebody.\n\n240\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.251\nIf you see them walking down a hallway or\nsomething, and\n\n241\n00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:18.696\nwhile they'll start doing that initially\nafter the training, we're hoping they do.\n\n242\n00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:22.430\nSomeone will do it cuz they may think\nthey're getting tested or whatever.\n\n243\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.810\nBut after a while, that just gets kind of\nokay, we can go back to the way we were.\n\n244\n00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:32.774\nAnd those habits go away and so\nwe try to do constant training,\n\n245\n00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:36.219\ndoing something like the kit we have here.\n\n246\n00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:38.543\nWhen we run that thing,\none of the things it helps us do,\n\n247\n00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:41.223\nit could also help us impart\nthe education and testing process.\n\n248\n00:14:41.223 --> 00:14:45.070\nAnd it definitely can be used, and it's\nintended to be used as a pen testing and\n\n249\n00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.250\nauditing tool.\n\n250\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:51.466\nSo it would actually also be something\nthat could help you make sure that people\n\n251\n00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:57.016\nare staying vigilant and really kind of\nmaking sure that the skills don't go away.\n\n252\n00:14:57.016 --> 00:15:02.911\nSo yeah, we talked about it,\nwe did Kali last week and\n\n253\n00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:07.640\nKali was just a basic\ntool we went through.\n\n254\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.910\nBut now, we're gonna use Kali and\nMetasploit and bring those two together\n\n255\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:17.100\nto really see what else we can do with it,\nwhich is actually a lot more.\n\n256\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.127\n>> Fantastic.\n\n257\n00:15:18.127 --> 00:15:19.170\nA lot of good information there.\n\n258\n00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.750\nA little refresher on social engineering,\n\n259\n00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.800\nbringing that back into\nthe forefront of our thinking.\n\n260\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.181\nIn our next episode we're gonna show you\nthat social engineering tool kit and\n\n261\n00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:34.586\nhow we can combine that with our\nMetasploit and use it that way.\n\n262\n00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:37.690\nSo Sean, anything else you wanna\nthrow in before we wrap this one up?\n\n263\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.500\n>> I think I'm good for right now.\n\n264\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.888\n>> All right,\nwell signing off for ITProTV.\n\n265\n00:15:41.888 --> 00:15:42.732\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n266\n00:15:42.732 --> 00:15:43.899\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n267\n00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:44.834\n>> And we'll

00:00:18.020\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.280\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.900\n>> I'm doing pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.890\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.910\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.810\nWe're continuing on with our Metasploit\nseries, and in particular, in this case,\n\n9\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.730\nwe're gonna be talking about good\nold social engineering tool kit, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.390\nhow we can integrate\nthat in with Metasploit.\n\n11\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.140\nWe've seen this before when\nwe did our Kali series,\n\n12\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.490\nwe took a brief look at that\nsocial engineering tool kit.\n\n13\n00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.190\nBut now Sean we're gonna take it a step\nfurther and integrate it with Metasploit.\n\n14\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.370\n>> Yeah, what we're really gonna do is\nsee just how the whole power of this is.\n\n15\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.380\nWhen we talked about Kali we saw it.\n\n16\n00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.080\nWe just kind of quickly browsed through\nit to see kind of what was there, but\n\n17\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.190\nwe really didn't do too much with it.\n\n18\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150\nYou know, just so you knew it was there,\nwhen you saw it in the menus you knew what\n\n19\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.955\nit was capable of cuz it's just going to\nkind of attract your attention being out\n\n20\n00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:16.285\nthere so, now is the time to kind of take\na little bit of a closer look at it.\n\n21\n00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:20.350\nAt least a quick and closer look at it.\n\n22\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.430\nTo kind of show you how it fits in with\nwhat we've learned with Metasploit.\n\n23\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.840\nAs well as give you know, give you\nan idea of the stuff with Metasploit and\n\n24\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.890\nwith this, how they work together.\n\n25\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.820\nAnd you're gonna find out there's\na lot of different ways and\n\n26\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.270\ncombinations of options\nyou can choose here.\n\n27\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.060\nSo [LAUGH] we could spend\na good amount of time on this.\n\n28\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.270\nWe're not gonna do that, but we could\nspend a good amount of time on it.\n\n29\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.660\nAnd to really, you know,\n\n30\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.320\nshow you all these different possible\ncombinations but we'll let you do that.\n\n31\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.970\nOnce you see what you can do with it and\nkind of some of the options,\n\n32\n00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.790\nthen you can see what playing with it and\ntrying things out on your own.\n\n33\n00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.950\n>> Nice.\n>> So yeah,\n\n34\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.170\nsome really kind of neat\nstuff sitting ahead here.\n\n35\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.940\nGood deal.\n\n36\n00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.070\nAll right, so we know social engineering,\nhow does it all fit together then?\n\n37\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.590\nI remember the SET toolkit, it kinda\nhelps us build that back story and\n\n38\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.810\nfluff up our social engineering attack.\n\n39\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.270\n>> Yeah.\nWhat the social engineering toolkit's\n\n40\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.390\ngonna do, is you could consider it\nthe back story, but what it's gonna do,\n\n41\n00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.030\nit's really concerned with,\nis configuring how you're going\n\n42\n00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.500\nto deliver it and\nwhat it's gonna do once it gets there.\n\n43\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.860\nAnd this'll make more sense once we\nkind of just walk through the process,\n\n44\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.360\nthe quick and dirty process of\ndoing just one type of attack here.\n\n45\n00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.850\nAnd then you can kinda go ahead and choose\nyour options later on when you play around\n\n46\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.930\nwith it when you decide if you're gonna\nuse it or not during a real PEN test.\n\n47\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.780\nBut it does opening up some fascinating\npossibilities along the way.\n\n48\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.730\nSo what we wanna do is,\nwe wanna kinda take a look\n\n49\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.770\nat the social engineering tool kit from\nthe perspective of what we've learned.\n\n50\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.900\nAnd just connect the dots.\n\n51\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.350\nLets take a quick and somewhat dirty\nlook at the social engineering toolkit.\n\n52\n00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.410\nAnd we're just gonna go\nthrough it far enough to kinda\n\n53\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.390\nshow you where kinda the Metasploit\nstuff is popping up.\n\n54\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.640\nAnd then, if you want to explore\nit further in your environment\n\n55\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.420\nyou can do that, just to kind of\nshow you that there is a linkage\n\n56\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.540\nbetween the two if you push that.\n\n57\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.710\nThat linkage between the two is reasonably\nstrong, and we only went through it,\n\n58\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.390\nlike I said, briefly, and very quickly,\nwhen we were exploring Kali.\n\n59\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.848\nNow what we're gonna do is, we are gonna\nsee what, maybe with better understanding,\n\n60\n00:03:53.848 --> 00:03:56.000\n[LAUGH] what's there.\n\n61\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.800\nSo what we're gonna do is here is our main\nmenu for the social engineering tool kit.\n\n62\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.430\nYou can see it's got a reasonable number\nof options there just to start out with.\n\n63\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.920\nNot a horrendous amount.\n\n64\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.675\nYou know it waits 'til\nlater to give you that,\n\n65\n00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:15.230\nto kinda [LAUGH] hit you with all that\n>> When you start yours up,\n\n66\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.350\njust to kind of make sure\nyou're cool with this.\n\n67\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.090\nYou don't start up the side of a,\ninside a Metasploit.\n\n68\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.410\nAt least, I didn't go through and do that.\n\n69\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.420\nWhat you're going to do is you can\nsee under the Kali Linux menu.\n\n70\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.610\nSo, you're just inside of Kali itself,\nyou're not inside of Metasploit itself.\n\n71\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.290\nYou are going to go to\nthe Kali Linux menu, and\n\n72\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.090\nyou will see the exploitation tools,\nand then you see the social engineering\n\n73\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.340\ntoolkit right down there at\nthe bottom of that last pop out menu.\n\n74\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.160\nIf you go under that one you'll see\nthat there's just the one option.\n\n75\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.280\nYou're gonna click on that.\n\n76\n00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.760\nThere's not gonna be\na bunch of options there.\n\n77\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.340\nIt's the only one,\nit looks pretty lonely and\n\n78\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.530\nisolated there [LAUGH] so\nyou can see it pretty easily.\n\n79\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.097\nThe reason why we even mention it in\nhere is, like we were saying during our\n\n80\n00:05:09.097 --> 00:05:13.516\ndiscussion, is that it draws your\nattention to it when you see all these\n\n81\n00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:17.732\nother tools that are technically\noriented and all that good stuff.\n\n82\n00:05:17.732 --> 00:05:21.243\nAll of a sudden you pop over here and,\nhey, there's something in there for\n\n83\n00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:23.890\nsocial engineering, hey,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n84\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.430\n>> Everything you've ever read,\nat least that I've ever read,\n\n85\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.500\nthere's no tools to do social engineering\nwith, it's a very human oriented thing,\n\n86\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.710\nand we can maybe use technology as\na delivery method for the email, or\n\n87\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.880\nthe phishing scam, or what have you.\n\n88\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.680\nBut I never expected to see an actual\ntool for doing social engineering.\n\n89\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.260\n>> Yeah,\nit is kinda an unusual thing to see.\n\n90\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.339\nI mean there's other stuff out there, but\n\n91\n00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:51.640\nthis is just something that since\nit's right there in this product.\n\n92\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.700\nSo Kali bundles it in.\n\n93\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.460\nYou will see it right\nthere in the product so\n\n94\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.540\nit's going to draw your attention to it.\n\n95\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.800\nSo let's take a look at it so\n\n96\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.710\nwe'll at least know [LAUGH] a little\nbit of what it's capable of and\n\n97\n00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.230\nthen you can put it in context with\nwhat you've seen with Metasploit so far.\n\n98\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.810\nSo what we got here is\nwe go to the menu and\n\n99\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.700\nwhen you start this up off the menu by\nthe way it brings up a big, like I said,\n\n100\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.530\nI don't know if you wanna call\nit a u-law or anything, but\n\n101\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.740\nit's a whole bunch of verbage that tells\nyou stuff about the product and makes you\n\n102\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.520\npromise that you're not gonna do certain\nthings with it, [LAUGH] scout's honor.\n\n103\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.740\nThat type of deal.\n\n104\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.470\nYou have to accept that to start it up,\nand when you do that, it brings you here.\n\n105\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.030\nSo just so if you know you're starting it\nup you're gonna see that, not this first.\n\n106\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.820\n>> Right.\n>> All right.\n\n107\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.010\nSo we go to the menu, and I'm just gonna,\nlike I said go through a quick and\n\n108\n00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.410\ndirty thing here just to show you where\nsome of this stuff starts popping up.\n\n109\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.480\nI'm gonna do a social engineering attack,\nand I just go ahead and hit 1.\n\n110\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.580\nAnd it's gonna ask you on the sub menu,\n\n111\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.130\nit asks you what type,\nwhat further type do you wanna do here?\n\n112\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.348\nAnd so you can see what we have some\ndifferent options included here.\n\n113\n00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:09.480\nWe have the spear fishing,\nwhich is the one we're going to use.\n\n114\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.390\nBut you can see you've got website ones,\ninfectious media generator.\n\n115\n00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.669\nThat sounds something like\nyou go to the doctor for.\n\n116\n00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.170\n[LAUGH] So we've got that.\n\n117\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.205\nAnd then you just keep\ngoing down the list.\n\n118\n00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:24.452\nArduino, wireless, you know, just keep,\nyou can go through the whole thing.\n\n119\n00:07:24.452 --> 00:07:28.640\nEven PowerShell, they got that covered\nif you're, if you want to dig into that.\n\n120\n00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.990\nSo we will just stick with\ndoing our spear fishing,\n\n121\n00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.080\nsomething that most\npeople [LAUGH] can have,\n\n122\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.800\nno what phishing attacks are,\nspear fishing's just a variation of that.\n\n123\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.830\nSo, what we get is, when we choose that\noption, we get another submenu here.\n\n124\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.090\nSo, we get the submenu, and you'll notice\nthat brings up a bunch of verbage here,\n\n125\n00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.865\nsaying spearphishing allows\nyou to do blobbity blah.\n\n126\n00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:55.115\nIt tells you all that.\n\n127\n00:07:55.115 --> 00:08:00.465\nBut one of the things that's noted in here\nis that you can spoof an email address\n\n128\n00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:06.015\nwhere it comes from when you're sending\nit out to a group of individuals.\n\n129\n00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:10.965\nSo what you can do here is that you can\ntell it if it's going to spoof that or\n\n130\n00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:13.895\nnot or how it's going to spoof it so\nto speak.\n\n131\n00:08:13.895 --> 00:08:16.690\nAnd you have that option\nright here to set.\n\n132\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.414\nI would make a point if you see\nthis when you go to the menus,\n\n133\n00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:25.507\nuntil you are really comfortable with\nthis, make sure you have gone through and\n\n134\n00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:30.296\ndone a quick glance at this at the very\nleast to make sure you understand what\n\n135\n00:08:30.296 --> 00:08:35.389\nthe options are, ramifications are of\nsetting that versus not setting that and\n\n136\n00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.933\nchoose wisely I guess.\n\n137\n00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.660\nMake sure you've got the right one\nchosen for your particular goal.\n\n138\n00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.390\nSo understanding what you're\ntrying to strive for, and\n\n139\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.300\nthen make sure that you got the proper\noptions set as you go through.\n\n140\n00:08:49.348 --> 00:08:54.550\nAll right, so we will go to the next one,\nwe're going to perform a spearfishing,\n\n141\n00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.570\nbut it's gonna be in the form\nof a mass email attack.\n\n142\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.930\nSo we're gonna go through and\nhit one on that.\n\n143\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.430\nAnd this is where we start kinda getting\ninto crossing over into stuff that\n\n144\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.110\nwe've been talking about for\nthe last couple days or so.\n\n145\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.830\nIs now we start seeing stuff\nthat's recognizable to us\n\n146\n00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.230\nfrom things that we've seen.\n\n147\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:19.140\nYou can look at this and you can see\na list of things that we can use to help\n\n148\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:25.780\ndeliver this and make this phishing\nattack more dangerous I guess,\n\n149\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.498\nthe way you want to put it or make so\nit's actually capable of doing something.\n\n150\n00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:33.250\nRather than just have someone click on\na simple link and provide an email and\n\n151\n00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.484\nother information on a site that provides\nadditional level of functionality.\n\n152\n00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:42.201\nWe're seeing here stuff that takes\nadvantage of flaws and for example flash.\n\n153\n00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:48.210\nAnd you can see PDF readers in there,\nQuickTime, you've got different things.\n\n154\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.380\nPresent, you can even see in there,\nwe have some Knowledge Base or\n\n155\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.050\nsome Microsoft articles referred\nto in there by the MS numbers.\n\n156\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.500\nIf you remember from our\nMeterpreter section,\n\n157\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.522\nthe way we started off\nthat whole to-do with\n\n158\n00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:12.350\nMeterpreter is we used\nan exploit to deliver a payload.\n\n159\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.900\nThat exploit was based on a flaw\nthat was found in the Windows\n\n160\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.340\noperating system and it was referred\nto by a number over there as well.\n\n161\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.000\nIt was what, MS08, I think 6 7.\n\n162\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.937\n>> 0 6 7.\n\n163\n00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:25.502\nYeah.\n\n164\n00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:28.548\nNet api?\n\n165\n00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:29.270\n>> Yeah.\n\n166\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.354\nYou win.\n\n167\n00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:33.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm not even gonna try it.\n\n168\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:41.610\nAnyway, so we have the list in here, and\nI'll just say, I'm gonna Choose option 9.\n\n169\n00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.360\nI'll go ahead and stick with that.\n\n170\n00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.370\nThen it brings me to my next section\nhere saying what do you want me\n\n171\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.730\nto drop off on that system?\n\n172\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.060\nSo we see here, if we go through\nthis list, well, what do we have?\n\n173\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.420\nWell, stuff that we kind of\nrecognize if we go back to our,\n\n174\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.280\nif you've watched an interpreter section.\n\n175\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.460\nYou remember that we used\nMeterpreter of course,\n\n176\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.210\nthat's why we called it that, right.\n\n177\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.340\nSo we see that make an appearance here.\n\n178\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.220\nYou can choose that as a way\nto get into the system or\n\n179\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.850\ndo something on the system, or you could\nuse one of the other ones on here.\n\n180\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.130\nAnd it tells you right there what it does.\n\n181\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:30.410\nYou can see, does it wanna open a VNC\nserver, does it wanna do Meterpreter or\n\n182\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.910\ndoes it wanna do something else,\ndeliver a payload?\n\n183\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.950\nWe've got various things here.\n\n184\n00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.430\nSo once we go ahead and choose something\noff there, I'll just say for kicks,\n\n185\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.920\nand like I said, there's no rhyme or\nreason here when I go through this.\n\n186\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.080\nIt's just to kinda show you what\nthe process kinda sorta looks like.\n\n187\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.220\nWhat we're gonna do here,\n\n188\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:54.160\nis we'll choose off this list\na specific payload we wanna use.\n\n189\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.610\nSo I'll say,\nokay I'll use just 4 to make it easy.\n\n190\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.955\nAnd so it asks you, okay what\noptions do you need to configure it.\n\n191\n00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.835\nSo it presents you with the option,\nsaying what's the LHOST.\n\n192\n00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:06.675\nSo the local host.\n\n193\n00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:09.445\nWho's it gonna phone home I guess,\nif you wanna put it in those terms.\n\n194\n00:12:09.445 --> 00:12:10.365\n>> All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n195\n00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:13.025\n>> So you type in the name of the host\n\n196\n00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:15.355\nthat it's going to call back.\n\n197\n00:12:15.355 --> 00:12:21.010\nSo I put the IP address\nas needed in there.\n\n198\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.790\nDo you want to dial up, what port do\nyou want to dial up on that system?\n\n199\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.470\nSo I will pop that in there.\n\n200\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.560\nIf you want to leave it as a default,\nyou can.\n\n201\n00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.140\nFor simplicity's sake I will leave\nit as the way it is right now,\n\n202\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.680\nbut you go ahead if you're\nusing this in the wild.\n\n203\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.110\nChange it to whatever is gonna work for\nyou.\n\n204\n00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.740\nSo I'll say, leave it as that.\n\n205\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.630\nAnd then it's gonna go ahead and\ngenerate the thing.\n\n206\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.810\nAnd, you know?\n\n207\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.380\nThere, the process, except for\nactually, you know,\n\n208\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.630\ncombining it with a file, and\ndoing all attachment type stuff.\n\n209\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.730\nExcept for that process, which I'm not\neven gonna worry about right here because\n\n210\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.070\nthat's just kind of the wrap up stuff of\nactually creating the final step of it.\n\n211\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.800\nYou can see that Metasploit made its'\nstuff available in here that you can\n\n212\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.430\nactually use to create your very\neffective social engineering attack.\n\n213\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.236\nYou can have a social engineering\nattack that delivers this.\n\n214\n00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:22.670\nAnd once a person gets this.\n\n215\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:28.370\nThe nastiness starts to happen depending\non what the options you chose and\n\n216\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.040\nhow you configured it.\n\n217\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.890\n>> Nice.\n>> So kind of a neat thing.\n\n218\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.600\nAnd there are other options that I would\nencourage you to explore inside of\n\n219\n00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.280\nthe social engineering toolkit.\n\n220\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.840\nThere's options for\ncreating different types of templates and\n\n221\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.600\nstuff like that to deliver it.\n\n222\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.690\nThat's kind of outside of\nwhat we're gonna worry about.\n\n223\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.710\nYou can take a look at those.\n\n224\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.810\nBut here you can see how you're putting\nthe actual punch in the email or\n\n225\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.060\nin the campaign in this case.\n\n226\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.640\n>> So in the end of this you'd have a file\nthat has that payload attached to it.\n\n227\n00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.740\nAnd then you attach that to your email.\n\n228\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.090\nAnd then they click on that.\n\n229\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.200\nThat's when they're\ngonna get the attacker.\n\n230\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.040\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n231\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.110\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n232\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.650\nWell, you know, relatively easy to do.\n\n233\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.570\nIt kinda walked you through each\none of the steps of that process.\n\n234\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.570\n>> Yeah,\nit does a lot of hand-holding for you.\n\n235\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:22.460\nYou still just can't go into it completely\ncold, but you can go into it and\n\n236\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.020\nget your bearings pretty\nquickly with what you gotta do.\n\n237\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.999\nYou may find yourself sometime going\nthrough this and saying well I\n\n238\n00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:35.188\nneed to double check to see which one\nof these is gonna be the best fit for\n\n239\n00:14:35.188 --> 00:14:37.390\nthat specific environment.\n\n240\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.920\nOr get me the most bang for my buck but\n\n241\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.790\nyou can still see that if you know that\nstuff you can just get through it pretty\n\n242\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:53.150\nquickly and create your campaign and\nall that with not much effort.\n\n243\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:58.610\nNow that you've been through the stuff\nwith Metasploit before using exploits and\n\n244\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.850\npayloads and all the configuration,\nmakes a lot of sense when you see it here,\n\n245\n00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.510\nwhen it starts prompting you for things.\n\n246\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.270\nOh, I know what's fitting together,\nand how things are working out.\n\n247\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.230\nYou see that right away.\n\n248\n00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.070\n>> Yeah,\nI can see where that'd be relatively easy.\n\n249\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.540\nYou figure, a lot of the stuff we've seen,\nwe've gone through our process,\n\n250\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.750\nour reconnaissance, our scanning and\nall of that to find a weak link or\n\n251\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.180\na way into that system that we could\nthen exploit and take advantage of.\n\n252\n00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.240\nWith this, I sent an email\nto everybody in the company.\n\n253\n00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.950\nWith that attack attached to it.\n\n254\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.080\nWhat are the odds of one person,\nout of the 500 people in that company,\n\n255\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.710\nclicking on it and\nactually opening that attachment.\n\n256\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.280\nI don't know, Sean.\nI would say pretty good.\n\n257\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.820\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, in the right conditions.\n\n258\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.150\n>> I mean one of those people\nis gonna click on that link.\n\n259\n00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.730\nCome on.\n\n260\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.540\nEspecially if you name it something\ninteresting, or something like that,\n\n261\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.640\nit's, I could see where that would\nbe extremely successful attack.\n\n262\n00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.360\n>> Yeah, this would be something\nas far as social engineering goes,\n\n263\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.280\nthis would be something\nthat would be useful for\n\n264\n00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.710\na company to do to just kind of test to\nsee how well their policies are working.\n\n265\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.210\n>> [LAUGH] See how many of\ntheir employees click on it?\n\n266\n00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.470\n>> Yeah.\nCompanies do this as part of their normal.\n\n267\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.750\nIf you're not part of a company that\ndoes this, you may know a company or\n\n268\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.570\nsomeone that works for a company that\nhas experienced these types of things.\n\n269\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.740\nIt's not unheard of for\nlarge enterprise environments to run\n\n270\n00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.960\nstuff like this to test to see how\nwell training's sinking in, how\n\n271\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.592\ndiligent people are being, and sometimes\nthey're just not happy with the results.\n\n272\n00:16:29.592 --> 00:16:32.775\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've personally seen the end result.\n\n273\n00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:36.260\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry, I'm sitting here\npicturing sending this email out and\n\n274\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.580\nattaching some kind of exploit to it.\n\n275\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.940\nBut basically, the exploit just puts\nup a pop-up on their screen that says,\n\n276\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.255\nyou need to come down to HR.\n\n277\n00:16:42.255 --> 00:16:46.500\n[LAUGH] So everybody that clicks on\nthe link, you got a line out of HR.\n\n278\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.830\nYou click on it,\njust prints out a pink slip.\n\n279\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.400\nThere you go.\n\n280\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.187\nSee you.\n\n281\n00:16:50.187 --> 00:16:53.271\n>> [LAUGH] That's classic.\n\n282\n00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:53.808\n>> Yeah.\n\n283\n00:16:53.808 --> 00:16:57.800\nIt's kind of interesting when\nyou see things like this,\n\n284\n00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.370\nthese spear fishing campaigns.\n\n285\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.210\n>> I don't wanna call it phishing because\n\n286\n00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.890\nthat's more just a kind\nof a shotgun tactic.\n\n287\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.870\n>> It's like a cast net, yeah.\n\n288\n00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.150\n>> Yeah, it's much more broad\nthan spear phishing is much\n\n289\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.520\nmore precise to an organization or\nsmaller group that you've selected.\n\n290\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.300\nThe companies that do, that have\ndone this sort of thing are these\n\n291\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.856\nlarge enterprise environments\nthat have seen do this.\n\n292\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.624\nIt's almost always been something where at\nthe end they're just shaking their head\n\n293\n00:17:28.624 --> 00:17:32.880\njust like I need [LAUGH] some pills or\n\n294\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.030\nsomething right now because things\nare going to get bad really quick.\n\n295\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:41.280\nThese things do have a way of\nrevealing stuff that you probably wish\n\n296\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.610\nin some sense wish they just\nstayed hidden someplace.\n\n297\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.120\nYou didn't have to deal with it.\n\n298\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.270\nSo it's really amazing to see.\n\n299\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.310\nBut this could be very useful,\nlike I said, outside or\n\n300\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.990\neven just a pure pen testing.\n\n301\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:59.290\nWhen you're doing a full pen testing suite\nyou might find a way as a system admin or\n\n302\n00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.710\nsomebody like that just to use\nsomething like this to test things out.\n\n303\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n304\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.290\nYou could use it as a way to\ntrain the employees about\n\n305\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.320\nthe dangers of clicking\non links in emails or\n\n306\n00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.990\nwhatever other method of attack we chose\nwith that social engineering toolkit.\n\n307\n00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.220\nVery good stuff.\n\n308\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.410\nAll right, Sean.\nWell a lot of great information there,\n\n309\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.418\nwe got to see that social engineering\ntoolkit in depth this time.\n\n310\n00:18:19.418 --> 00:18:24.002\nWe really get to look at how you would use\nthat to put together some type of social\n\n311\n00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.490\nengineering attacks.\n\n312\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.890\nSo, anything else you want to add to\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n313\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:34.762\n>> There's not much to add to it except to\ntell you that this is again something that\n\n314\n00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:40.220\nyou should take at least a little\ntime to kind of explore it a bit.\n\n315\n00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.730\nTo see you know,\njust kind of see what's there.\n\n316\n00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.510\nYou may find yourself not\ngoing that far into it or\n\n317\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.380\nmaybe find yourself\nusing it really at all.\n\n318\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.610\nBut now that you kinda got, now that\nyou're getting a really good understanding\n\n319\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.760\nof how Metasploit does its job,\nnow you can go over here to this and\n\n320\n00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.230\nsay okay, well I can see how set\nkinda fits into the picture.\n\n321\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.960\nAnd maybe it does have a role as\nfar as what you're going to be\n\n322\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.690\ndoing in your respective organization or\nduring your testing.\n\n323\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.050\nSo yeah, I would encourage you\ndefinitely to try some things out\n\n324\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.890\nto see how it fits in or if it fits\nin in the overall scheme of things.\n\n325\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.560\nAnd so just a great thing to do.\n\n326\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.890\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentleman,\n\n327\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.790\nI thank everybody for tuning in and\nwatching our show today.\n\n328\n00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.170\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n329\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.230\n>> And Sean Oriyano.\n\n330\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.338\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n331\n00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:36.859\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.485\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.621\nHello, and\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.070\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.060\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.540\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.850\nExcited we got another episode coming\nyour way of our Metasploit series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.870\nAnd in this one, Sean, we're gonna be\ntaking in a look at a program called,\n\n9\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.400\nand forgive me if I say this wrong,\nArmitage.\n\n10\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.150\nIs that how we're gonna say that?\n\n11\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.950\n>> That's how I'm gonna say it, too,\nso we can be consistent on that.\n\n12\n00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.480\n>> [LAUGH] Very good.\n>> I'm not sure what the official\n\n13\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.888\npronunciation is, but\nthat sounds good enough to me.\n\n14\n00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:39.565\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n15\n00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:42.560\n[LAUGH] So, tell us,\nSean, what is Armitage?\n\n16\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.730\nWhy should we wanna know all about it?\n\n17\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.180\n>> Armitage is, what it is, it's something\nthat's built on top of Metasploit, and\n\n18\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.760\nit gives you that GUI to Metasploit.\n\n19\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560\nBut to say it's just a GUI,\nkind of doesn't really do it justice.\n\n20\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.190\nBecause, it's much more than just that.\n\n21\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.700\nWhile it does give you that nice GUI that\nyou can go ahead and play around with,\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.165\nit It also gives you a way of organizing\nyour hosts that you're looking at.\n\n23\n00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:13.865\nIt gives you a way of running\nexploits just a lot quicker.\n\n24\n00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.375\nIt allows you to do almost the whole\n\n25\n00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:20.940\nprocess of pen testing using\nMetasploit from start to finish.\n\n26\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.450\nAnd even on top of that,\nthere's even more things you can do.\n\n27\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.490\nIt's actually kind of staggering, the\nnumber of things you can do in something\n\n28\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.600\nthat actually looks quite simple.\n\n29\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.810\nAnd it's worth mentioning,\nArmitage is free, so you can go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.580\ngrab that in any point\nin time if you want.\n\n31\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.210\nIt's already there in the product\nwith Kali when you get it, and\n\n32\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.970\nwith Metasploit in there,\nso you already got it.\n\n33\n00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.400\nBut you got Metasploit installed\nsomeplace else like in Ubuntu or\n\n34\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360\nwherever, you can install it over there.\n\n35\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.180\nSo it's amazing what it can do, what it\npresents, and the fact that it's free is\n\n36\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.780\nmusic to everyone's ears,\nI think, after they see it.\n\n37\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.790\n>> Yeah, free is always good.\n\n38\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.430\nFree is always good.\n\n39\n00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.170\nSo, why, what are we gonna do with this?\n\n40\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.080\nIt's just gonna give us a bit\neasier time loading up exploits,\n\n41\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.790\nloading up payloads, things like that?\n\n42\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.420\n>> Yes it does do that.\n\n43\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.370\nIt does actually load up the exploits and\npayloads a lot quicker, but\n\n44\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140\nit also helps you detect hosts,\nlets you scan hosts.\n\n45\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.450\nLet's you launch, I guess I would\nsay more advanced attacks, let's you\n\n46\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.290\naccess those things like the Meterpreter\nthat we saw in our previous segments.\n\n47\n00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.608\nIt let's you get a lot more information.\n\n48\n00:02:36.608 --> 00:02:41.090\nAnd then it also, what I think is\nthe really neat feature about it, it even\n\n49\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.780\nallows you to see representations of the\nhosts that you're scanning and looking at.\n\n50\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.270\nSo it can show you how they all relate.\n\n51\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.730\nAnd if you decide to go far enough with\nit, it'll even start linking them up and\n\n52\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.660\nshowing where your attacks are going.\n\n53\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.710\nIf you really want to punch into that, but\nit's got just a lot of neat capabilities.\n\n54\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.960\nAll it's really doing it's using the stuff\nin Metasploit, plus some of the tools that\n\n55\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.210\nare in the base system like you\nknow NMap and stuff like that.\n\n56\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.600\nIt's just bringing them all together into\none thing that you access through this\n\n57\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.520\nrelatively simple looking interface.\n\n58\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.450\nWith that in mind, you can just go\nthrough and click on stuff, and\n\n59\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.330\nright clicks and stuff like that and\nrun your attacks pretty quickly.\n\n60\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.590\n>> Nice.\n\n61\n00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.490\nIt's fascinating, and it's easy enough for\nme to sit here and say, oh yeah,\n\n62\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.340\nyou can do all this stuff with it and\nkinda go through all that,\n\n63\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.000\nbut once you actually see it you'll\nget a whole new level of appreciation.\n\n64\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.840\nYou might even wonder why after\ndoing all the stuff for these\n\n65\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.890\nlast few segments, would've been typing\nall of this stuff into the command line.\n\n66\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.580\nWhy, if we had this available,\nwhy we didn't just use it,\n\n67\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.640\nand why we going command line, but\nthere's benefits in doing everything,\n\n68\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.920\nso in this case,\nArmitage is a cool utility.\n\n69\n00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.370\nYou can do some neat stuff with it,\n\n70\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.280\nbut don't just completely\nrule out the command line.\n\n71\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.210\nIn fact, you still do have to do\na little bit through the command line,\n\n72\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.350\neven inside of this.\n\n73\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.780\nIf you're gonna access, for\nexample, the Meterpreter,\n\n74\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.710\nyou can still issue commands to it right\ndirectly through the Armitage interface.\n\n75\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.640\nSo, you're not completely free of it, but\n\n76\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.290\nit does make things a lot easier\nthan they were without it.\n\n77\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.020\nBut, like I said, don't just go ahead and\njust say, okay, I'm gonna dump all that\n\n78\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.740\nstuff out of my head that I just,\nall the command line stuff.\n\n79\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.680\nNo, it hasn't completely gone away,\nand it actually gave you\n\n80\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.920\na better understanding if you wanted to go\nwith Armitage for the bulk of your stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.960\nIt gives you a much better\nunderstanding of what Armitage is doing\n\n82\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.090\nunder the surface.\n\n83\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.080\nRather than just say, oh,\nI'm clicking on buttons and\n\n84\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.330\nthis happening, now you have\na much better understanding of it.\n\n85\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.385\nSo, I think that's,\nthat's a really kinda neat thing.\n\n86\n00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:04.275\n>> It makes me think back to my elementary\nschool teachers and math and stuff, and\n\n87\n00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:08.685\nyou had to learn the long division first\nbefore you could learn the shortcuts and\n\n88\n00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:09.235\nthings like that.\n\n89\n00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.600\nIt's always good to understand\nthe underlying technology,\n\n90\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.255\ncuz what if Armitage is giving you\ntrouble, or you want to tweak it in a way.\n\n91\n00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:18.925\nHaving an understanding of what's\ngoing on in the background\n\n92\n00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:21.040\nis definitely gonna be a big help.\n\n93\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.780\nAnd then as you said you can't throw away\nyour command line stuff at all because\n\n94\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.140\nwhat if you want to script it right?\n\n95\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.740\nIt's really difficult to\nscript a GUI interface,\n\n96\n00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.290\nwhere as all that command line\ncan be scripted an automated.\n\n97\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.990\nStill has its place, still important\nto understand but, graphical user faces\n\n98\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.051\nare nice when we can get them [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n99\n00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:41.688\nBut, yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:47.430\nUnderstand that stuff underneath is\nreally gonna pay a lot of dividends here.\n\n101\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.240\nAnd I guess, by the way, if we're\ntalking math, if you're under like 25,\n\n102\n00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.880\nit's common core now.\n\n103\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.128\nSo you know what we're talking about.\n\n104\n00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:56.838\n>> [LAUGH] In my age,\nwe called it mathematics.\n\n105\n00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:58.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Two plus two\n\n106\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.840\ndoesn't equal four anymore.\n\n107\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.390\n>> I know.\n>> Only if you want it to equal four.\n\n108\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.700\nIs it politically correct,\neverybody's nice, nobody's wrong.\n\n109\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.030\n>> Exactly.\n\n110\n00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.722\n>> And everybody gets a trophy.\n\n111\n00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:10.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n112\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.800\n>> Yeah, so it sounds really cool.\n\n113\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.450\nI'm dying to take a look at it.\n\n114\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.730\nI like the idea.\n\n115\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.260\n>> Yeah.\nWe're gonna be doing\n\n116\n00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.230\na lot of looking at this product to\nreally see just what it's about.\n\n117\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.820\nSome things I do wanna\npoint out as we're gonna\n\n118\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.150\nget ready to go into that environment.\n\n119\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.870\nSome things worth pointing out are the\nfact that we're gonna be using it as\n\n120\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.170\nGUI on top of the Linux environment.\n\n121\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.820\nIf you do wanna use it on Windows,\nwhich I know, there's probably\n\n122\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.930\nsome of our audience out there that\nwill decide to use this on Windows.\n\n123\n00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.110\nAnd there's no harm in running\nMetasploit on Windows at all.\n\n124\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.900\nIt is actually written for\nand supported over there.\n\n125\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.020\nUnfortunately, Armitage is not\nfully embraced over there.\n\n126\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.620\nSo while it means while you can get\nit running on top of Metasploit for\n\n127\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.770\nWindows, it does mean there's a,\na reasonable number of hoops for\n\n128\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.420\nyou to jump through to\nget it to that point.\n\n129\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.920\nSo, in essence it means that you're gonna\n\n130\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.260\nhave to download basically\na zip file from their site,\n\n131\n00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.000\nand then they've got directions on\nthe database you've gotta setup and\n\n132\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.170\ninstall and grab all these little\npieces and basically put it together.\n\n133\n00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:28.940\nTo get it to work, where as if it's in\nLinux it's a much more simplified, in fact\n\n134\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.990\nwith the way Metasploit is now, especially\nif you're using Kali, it's right there.\n\n135\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.680\nYou don't actually have to\ngo through any steps at all.\n\n136\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.131\nIt's running, there may be some\nlittle hiccup here or there, but for\n\n137\n00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:46.734\nthe most part there's not really any\ninstall to do unless you've really\n\n138\n00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:50.442\nstarted putting together your\nown environment on Linux.\n\n139\n00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:55.648\nSo I just wanted to point that out\nbefore anyone was wondering why they\n\n140\n00:07:55.648 --> 00:08:01.865\ncouldn't get a true Windows version, or\nwhy Windows had all these extra things.\n\n141\n00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:04.604\nYeah, he'll say, or the guy that\nmakes this actually has on his\n\n142\n00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:07.360\nsite specifically,\nit's like what about running on Windows.\n\n143\n00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.730\nHe's kind of like, [LAUGH] what about it?\n\n144\n00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.210\nWhat do you wanna know?\n\n145\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.008\nI'm not supporting it.\n\n146\n00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:14.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so just FYI, but.\n\n147\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.950\nI don't know if you really even need to\nhave it running on Windows, or have that\n\n148\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:25.460\nenvironment, because it gives you such a\nnice environment, just on its own, anyway.\n\n149\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.240\nSo, just FYI on that for you, so\n\n150\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.870\nyou don't get any kind of hiccups or\nweird surprises along the way.\n\n151\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.310\nWith that being said, I yeah,\nwe can take a look at it, since you-\n\n152\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.725\n>> And while you're pulling that up, Sean,\n\n153\n00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:41.481\nlet me just make sure.\n\n154\n00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:45.082\nIs it the Armitage,\nis it fastandeasyhacking.com,\n\n155\n00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:46.577\nis that their site?.\n\n156\n00:08:46.577 --> 00:08:52.320\n>> Yeah, that site, I think there's\nalso an Armitage site as well.\n\n157\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.740\n>> Okay, we'll throw a link out there for\nthe viewers while you're pulling that up.\n\n158\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.530\nSo.\n>> All right.\n\n159\n00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:04.280\nAll right, so let's just take\na quick glance over at the Armitage.\n\n160\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.070\nWhat I've got here on screen obviously,\nit's something\n\n161\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.390\nthat we've become very familiar with over\nour [LAUGH] all our courses with Kali and\n\n162\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.420\nthen the Metasploit stuff.\n\n163\n00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.210\nIt is just the Linux command prompt.\n\n164\n00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.540\nSo what I'm going to do,\nis kind of get you guys started on this,\n\n165\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.300\nas well as show you the interface.\n\n166\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.250\nBecause we have a lot of demos and\nwalk-throughs, and things, in the segments\n\n167\n00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.630\nafter this, with Armitage, so we're just\ngoing to go ahead and start things here,\n\n168\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.000\nby looking at the interface,\njust a bit and get the thing started.\n\n169\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.298\nNot in that order, but.\n\n170\n00:09:34.298 --> 00:09:35.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n171\n00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.025\nthere's only two ways\nto put that together.\n\n172\n00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:39.760\nFifty-fifty chance I screwed it up.\n\n173\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, the way you get Armitage going, you\n\n174\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.460\ndo not actually have to start Metasploit\non its own and then run Armitage.\n\n175\n00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:56.210\nYou can actually just type in Armitage\nright there at the command prompt, and\n\n176\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.790\nit'll take a second to go ahead and load\nall its business and all that good stuff.\n\n177\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.130\nOkay, once it starts loading stuff in,\none of the first things it's gonna do,\n\n178\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.120\nit's gonna bring this guy up,\nand it's saying,\n\n179\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.130\nhey, I need to connect to the database.\n\n180\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.400\nThat's what that is.\n\n181\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.230\nAnd so if you get this, and you will\nget it every time you start it up.\n\n182\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.610\nYou just go ahead and you'll probably just\nbe able to click Connect in your case.\n\n183\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.620\nThen you'll get this.\n\n184\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.530\nIt's going to say do you want me\nto start this, this Metasploit?\n\n185\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:29.100\nIf you typed Armitage from within\nMetasploit, and it started bringing it up.\n\n186\n00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.780\nYou shouldn't get this, but I didn't have\nit started up so, I will go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.050\nsay, yes, I'd like it to start it.\n\n188\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.690\nAnd it should go ahead and\nstart going about its whole process and\n\n189\n00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.290\nkind of getting the connection and\nall that.\n\n190\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:50.500\nI will point something out for you just\nFYI, if you're just starting this up for\n\n191\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.990\nthe first time sometimes it\nwill spit out an error at you.\n\n192\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.950\nAnd the error it spits out,\nit will say something like it can't\n\n193\n00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.350\nconnect to the database or it can't\nfind it, something along those lines.\n\n194\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.780\nIf that's the case and\nit says that it also gives you directions.\n\n195\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.530\nOn what to do to fix that.\n\n196\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.630\nIt's not really a catastrophic error.\n\n197\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:18.160\nI don't even know why specifically that\nerror is generated the first time.\n\n198\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.710\nI didn't go into it that far because\nthey give you a really quick fix for it.\n\n199\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.492\nIt's like, if it doesn't start up,\n\n200\n00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:28.847\nwhich Armitage isn't gonna start if\nthat database is having a hiccup.\n\n201\n00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:33.067\nIt tells you right in the dialog box,\nstart this service,\n\n202\n00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:37.050\nstop this service, and\nstart this and it'll be done.\n\n203\n00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.150\nIt's basically kind of\nrebooting a service and\n\n204\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.410\nstarting something and you're ready to go.\n\n205\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:47.650\nOnce you've done that, I haven't had to\ndo it again after that initial startup.\n\n206\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.190\nNow I can just start it\nup whenever I want and\n\n207\n00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.570\nI see the stuff that you guys just saw.\n\n208\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.690\nBut I never see any of the other\nstuff saying there's an error so\n\n209\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.990\nif you see that just\nfollow the directions.\n\n210\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.560\nThere's the first three steps\nin that dialogue and that's it.\n\n211\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.380\nThat's really it.\n\n212\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.620\nIt's a quick and easy thing to do.\n\n213\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.320\nYou don't have to get any\nmore nastiness than that.\n\n214\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.650\nSo what we're seeing here is assuming,\nyeah it's kind of dull looking everything\n\n215\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:19.270\nright now and as we go through our\ndemos and in our later segments we\n\n216\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.680\nwill see that this gets more populated and\nwill get more busy and get more exciting.\n\n217\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.520\nBut you can see interface\nis pretty simple.\n\n218\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.110\nLike I said it's not the most exciting\ninterface when you just look at it but\n\n219\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.680\nonce we start getting into things, you'll\nsee it gets more and more active, and\n\n220\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.270\nmore and more stuff will show up.\n\n221\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.390\nBut just to kinda give you a look\nat the different areas in here,\n\n222\n00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.510\nobviously we have the menus across\nthe top, the standard pull-down menus.\n\n223\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.030\nAnd you can access just about everything,\n\n224\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.810\nthrough there, but I have found that,\nfor the most part,\n\n225\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.110\nI don't access a lot of stuff through\nthere, if I access anything at all.\n\n226\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.290\nBecause a lot of stuff you can\naccess just by right-clicking on\n\n227\n00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.690\nobjects in the window.\n\n228\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.540\nYou can just right click on it,\nit will give you a shortcut menu, and\n\n229\n00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.010\nshow you stuff.\n\n230\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:10.330\nThat's actually context sensitive to that\nspecific object which is really cool.\n\n231\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.250\nAnd just saying it's context sensitive.\n\n232\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.090\nYou can take it at face value for\nright now but\n\n233\n00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.450\ntrust me just saying\nit's context sensitive.\n\n234\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.170\nThere is, it still is context sensitive\nwhen you see it later on, but\n\n235\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.360\nyou get a whole new appreciation for\n\n236\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.100\nwhat that means after seeing Metasploit\nin action, seeing what this guy does.\n\n237\n00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.975\nYou'll actually see just what\nit does is the menus for\n\n238\n00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:35.445\neach specific object,\nit's really kinda cool.\n\n239\n00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:41.035\nSo that's the pull down so you'll have\nthose going right across the top there.\n\n240\n00:13:41.035 --> 00:13:43.975\nWhat you see on the left\nhand side is things\n\n241\n00:13:43.975 --> 00:13:48.775\nthat you'll actually recognize because\nwe've been looking at these things.\n\n242\n00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:51.445\nYou can see we have a payload section so\n\n243\n00:13:51.445 --> 00:13:55.020\nif we were to go through and\nlook at the payload stuff.\n\n244\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.540\nWe have down here, we have Windows.\n\n245\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.570\nWe've busted into Windows\na few times during this whole,\n\n246\n00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.460\nduring these last few segments.\n\n247\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.480\nWell, there's Meterpreter.\n\n248\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.800\nWhy not just open up\nMeterpreter under Windows, and\n\n249\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.390\nyou can see I have the exploit sitting\nthere, right there, ready to go.\n\n250\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.760\nSo I'm just gonna slip\nthis over just a bit.\n\n251\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.040\nAnd you can see that there's\nthe Meterpreter stuff.\n\n252\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.030\nSo there's the payloads we can deliver.\n\n253\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.900\nIf I go up further in this I'll\nclose payloads for right now.\n\n254\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.845\nIf you go to exploits.\n\n255\n00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:33.715\nWell, exploits, there's the Windows\nexploits, if I go look through the Windows\n\n256\n00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:37.635\nexploits you can see there's a whole\nlist of them in there, ready to go.\n\n257\n00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:42.370\nThere's the ones relating to Samba,\nSMB, so I open that up.\n\n258\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:47.540\nAnd when I look through this list and\njust kinda glancing through,\n\n259\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.429\nthere's the one, the MS08067 net API one.\n\n260\n00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:53.060\nI found it right there.\n\n261\n00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.560\nSo it's got it all nice and\norganized for you so\n\n262\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.740\nyou can really quickly and\neasily find what you want.\n\n263\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.445\nSo that right there is worth\nthe price of admission.\n\n264\n00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:08.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just one of the things, because\n\n265\n00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.850\nthe stuff we had to do before looking for\nexploit, you're probably wondering how,\n\n266\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:17.730\nwhen I went through and I'm doing this\nstuff, doing show exploits and payloads.\n\n267\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.590\nHe goes, how does he know it's that one,\nor what the name of that one is?\n\n268\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.750\nBecause I studied, okay?\n\n269\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.477\nI wrote it down, I memorized it.\n[LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:15:24.477 --> 00:15:25.578\n>> That's why.\n\n271\n00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:28.658\nSo I'm memorizing that stuff.\n\n272\n00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:32.510\nIf I hadn't, if it was just something\nI was encountering for the first time.\n\n273\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:37.200\nI would have had to do, you know, you\nwould've seen me here doing research and\n\n274\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.710\nfinding specifically which one is gonna\nwork, and get some details about it.\n\n275\n00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.470\nAnd that would have required\ngoing through these list, and\n\n276\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.475\nlooking to see what I have.\n\n277\n00:15:46.475 --> 00:15:49.115\nNow they've got it organized quite easily.\n\n278\n00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.485\nI don't even have to go through and\ndo that search or anything like that.\n\n279\n00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:54.332\nSo makes it a lot simpler.\n\n280\n00:15:54.332 --> 00:15:57.622\nSo that's what that left hand panel does.\n\n281\n00:15:57.622 --> 00:15:59.236\nIt cuts down a lot of that time.\n\n282\n00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:00.770\nIt makes it easier.\n\n283\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.675\nNow what the other two windows you see\non here that are just completely black,\n\n284\n00:16:04.675 --> 00:16:08.760\nyou don't see anything in them right now,\nis in this one over on the upper right,\n\n285\n00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.810\nthat's where you're gonna see your hosts\npop up when you start scanning them.\n\n286\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.590\nYou'll see the actual representation\nof them show up in there.\n\n287\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.830\nAnd we'll be doing that in a bit, so\nI won't worry about doing it now.\n\n288\n00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.760\nBut you'll see them pop up in there.\n\n289\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.740\nAs I identify them and do my work\nwith them they will be right there.\n\n290\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.830\nAnd then along the bottom is\n\n291\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.240\nkind of a workspace area where you see\nconsoles and other things show up.\n\n292\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.530\nAnd you will be able to do many\ndifferent things in there.\n\n293\n00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.500\nYou will see Windows and\nMeterpreter show up.\n\n294\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.610\nYou will see things for\nspecific hosts show up.\n\n295\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.940\nA lot of different hings will\nactually show up in there, in fact,\n\n296\n00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.830\nyou can see there, right now,\nyou can see the MSL prompt for\n\n297\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.410\nthe metasploit prompt,\nis sitting right there.\n\n298\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:59.000\nSo we've got stuff already showing up and\nready to do things.\n\n299\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.360\nSo that's just kind of a quick look,\nat the interface,\n\n300\n00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.500\nyou really don't even have to leave this,\nto do anything, if you want to, you can.\n\n301\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500\nYou can still open up a command\nprompt in Kaylee, and\n\n302\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.640\ndo some stuff, but\nyou really don't have to leave this.\n\n303\n00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.330\nIn fact, if you look back at\nthe command prompt sometimes,\n\n304\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:21.350\nI mean, I've got the command prompt\nsitting back here, that's it.\n\n305\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.840\nOnce I go ahead and type r montage,\nand it does all this, and\n\n306\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.057\nit prompts me a couple times,\njust leave that alone.\n\n307\n00:17:28.057 --> 00:17:31.240\n[LAUGH] And just stay over here.\n\n308\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.050\nAnd start doing whatever you want or\n\n309\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.390\ndoing whatever you came to do I\nguess is the better way to put it.\n\n310\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.660\nThat's what the interface looks like, just\nto kind of give you a quick walk around of\n\n311\n00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.280\nthe shortcut menus and stuff like that.\n\n312\n00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.140\nWe'll start looking at those as we get\ndeeper into it because we'll have to start\n\n313\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.070\nlocating hosts, and\nsetting things up and running exploits,\n\n314\n00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.220\nand plenty of other things\nthat you haven't seen yet.\n\n315\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.710\nAnd we're gonna introduce\nthem here with Armitage for\n\n316\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.740\nthe first time to make it easier.\n\n317\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.495\nSo we've got a lot of exciting things,\nbut we'll get to those as we, you know,\n\n318\n00:18:03.495 --> 00:18:05.415\nkinda go through this a bit more.\n\n319\n00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:06.035\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n320\n00:18:06.035 --> 00:18:08.595\nWell I hope everybody out\nthere is as excited as I am to\n\n321\n00:18:08.595 --> 00:18:11.925\nsee what we can do with Armitage and\nsee Sean put it to work.\n\n322\n00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.865\nSo, Shawn,\nanything you wanna leave with this,\n\n323\n00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:16.605\nor throw in before we wrap this one up?\n\n324\n00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:20.455\n>> Yeah, just to kinda leet you\nunderstand, you know, where,\n\n325\n00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:25.325\njust to kinda quickly, where this fits\ninto the whole scheme of things, and\n\n326\n00:18:25.325 --> 00:18:29.580\nwhy you would actually want to use this.\n\n327\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.710\nWhere it fits in,\nthis is just an easier way,\n\n328\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.650\nand a quicker way to do a lot of things\nyou would through Medasploit, and\n\n329\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.790\nthrough your reconnaissance and\nscanning phases, anyway.\n\n330\n00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.250\nSo that's kind of where it fits and\nkinda why you would use\n\n331\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.950\nit because it makes just easier,\nmakes things quicker for you.\n\n332\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.739\nYou know they kind of bill it as.\n\n333\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.560\nAs a quicker way to do pen testing.\n\n334\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.970\nAnd I think you'll probably agree with\nthat statement after you've seen it,\n\n335\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.610\nthat it's a much quicker way to do things.\n\n336\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.170\nSo it's just something to\nenhance your capabilities, but\n\n337\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.310\nthat's just one thing it can do.\n\n338\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.720\nAfter you see all the stuff we're\ngonna show you with Armitage,\n\n339\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.370\nI'm sure you're probably, if you\nhaven't gotten to work with it before,\n\n340\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.960\nI'm sure you'll probably already\nbe already impressed with it.\n\n341\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.540\nBut there's some other things that\nwe're not gonna do in here, but\n\n342\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.370\nI'll just mention in this first segment so\nyou know this is there.\n\n343\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.950\nOne of the things they also\n\n344\n00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.400\nbill Armitage as they bill it\nas kind of a force multiplier.\n\n345\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.200\nWhich is, you know,\none of those Military terms,\n\n346\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.600\nyou know,\nthat you hear used over there a lot.\n\n347\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.470\nBut you don't hear it\noutside of that a whole ton.\n\n348\n00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:46.375\nBut I think it's actually a very\nappropriate term to be using here,\n\n349\n00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:51.245\nbecause what a force multiplier\nis supposed to do, it\n\n350\n00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:56.795\ngives you much more power and\ngreater standing than you would otherwise.\n\n351\n00:19:56.795 --> 00:20:02.225\nSo when we look at a tool like this\nit makes a single penetration tester\n\n352\n00:20:02.225 --> 00:20:04.165\ngreater than they would be on their own,\nor\n\n353\n00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:07.980\nenhances their skills more dramatically\nthan it would be otherwise.\n\n354\n00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:14.240\nSo, Armitage definitely does that just for\nindividual pen testers.\n\n355\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:20.130\nBut, if you really look at this tool,\nit has the ability to let you work.\n\n356\n00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:25.940\nThey have this teaming type of concept,\nwhere you can link up with\n\n357\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.320\nother people on your team\nthat are using this product.\n\n358\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.560\nYou can link up with them, and if you,\nfor example, are doing a pen test,\n\n359\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.170\nand you have another member of your\nteam that may be better suited\n\n360\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.340\nto take a look at something\nthat you're seeing.\n\n361\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.340\nYou can actually contact them\nthrough Armitage itself, and\n\n362\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.190\nthey can have it running over there, and\nthen you can actually work together.\n\n363\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.080\nSo you can do that sort of thing.\n\n364\n00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.970\nIt's a weird concept in the overall scheme\nof things, because it's kind of What?\n\n365\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:02.300\nWhen you see it, there's not\nreally anything quite like that.\n\n366\n00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.470\nAs far as I'm concerned there's\nnothing really quite like that.\n\n367\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.550\nYou might say that there are some\nother rough things like it but,\n\n368\n00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.480\nthis one you really are.\n\n369\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.160\nYou can team up with other people\non your team that have this, and\n\n370\n00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.640\nwork together to do your penetration test.\n\n371\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.160\n>> Nice.\n>> And so\n\n372\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.630\nthat's a incredibly awesome\nthing when you get to it.\n\n373\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.020\nAnd then Armitage even\nhas a bigger brother, and\n\n374\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.540\nthey say it's a completely\ndifferent product.\n\n375\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:37.960\nBut it's related, it is related, but\nit also is very different, these two.\n\n376\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.700\nIt's not free, first of all,\nit's called Cobalt Strike,\n\n377\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.825\nit is a much more powerful\nPowerful tool that Armitage is.\n\n378\n00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:47.785\nWhich is saying a lot.\n\n379\n00:21:47.785 --> 00:21:51.095\nBut it can do pretty much a lot of\nthe stuff that Armitage can do.\n\n380\n00:21:51.095 --> 00:21:53.305\nPlus it has all these extra capabilities.\n\n381\n00:21:53.305 --> 00:21:56.325\nIt even has threat assessment and\nmanagement capabilities.\n\n382\n00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:58.947\nIt has reporting stuff and\neverything else.\n\n383\n00:21:58.947 --> 00:22:01.347\nAnd Armitage has the ability\nto work with that too.\n\n384\n00:22:01.347 --> 00:22:05.787\nSo it can actually team up with\nthat if you want to do that.\n\n385\n00:22:05.787 --> 00:22:08.237\nThat tool runs about $3,500 per license.\n\n386\n00:22:08.237 --> 00:22:13.427\nSo unless you really got\na really good reason,\n\n387\n00:22:13.427 --> 00:22:15.767\nyou probably won't be touching that.\n\n388\n00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.367\n>> But I think it is worth mentioning,\n\n389\n00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:22.040\nbecause some of you might want to get\nthat functionality, and after we land\n\n390\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.140\nour first few big jobs as apprentice, we\ngotta go out and get that cobalt strike.\n\n391\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.150\n>> Yeah,\nthat's really the name of the game.\n\n392\n00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.250\nYou get something like that that speeds\nyour capabilities up so much and\n\n393\n00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.910\nyou can get through these jobs much,\nmuch quicker and turn them out.\n\n394\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.120\nYeah, that's peanuts as far as you're\nconcerned because you can turn out more\n\n395\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.650\njobs, and make more money,\nand be done with it.\n\n396\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.340\nSo, but that just kind of gives you where\nit kind of fits in, and what it does, and\n\n397\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.090\nwe'll fill in some more of those gaps, and\nblank spots that you may have in your head\n\n398\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.210\nalready saying I'm not sure\nI'm getting this or this.\n\n399\n00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.720\nWell don't worry.\n\n400\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.010\nWe're going to fill in some other\nthings with as we go through.\n\n401\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.540\n>> Very good.\n\n402\n00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.590\nAll right, well, you heard it.\n\n403\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.300\nMake sure you come back for\nthe next episode.\n\n404\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.450\nWe're gonna take a look at Armitage and\nsee what you can do with it.\n\n405\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.700\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n406\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.825\n>> And I'm Sean Oreiano.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n407\n00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:20.980\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.230\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.220\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.470\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.040\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.220\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.200\nExcited.\nWe got another\n\n9\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.230\ngreat episode coming your way,\ncontinuing on with our metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710\nAnd in this episode, we're actually\ngonna take another look at Armitage.\n\n11\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.510\nHave you missed our previous episode?\n\n12\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.090\nMake sure you go back and\ncheck that one out.\n\n13\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.710\nWe kinda told you what it was,\nwhat we expected to be able to do with it,\n\n14\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.220\nkinda where it fit in\nthe big picture of things.\n\n15\n00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.590\nAs well as took a look at the interface\nand kind of felt our way around.\n\n16\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.020\nNow Sean we're gonna take a closer\nlook at it and kind of set it up and\n\n17\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260\nstart to see how we can put it to use?\n\n18\n00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.610\n>> Yeah, that's what we have next in\nthis whole process of going through.-\n\n19\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.480\n>> You know, so we did see,\n\n20\n00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.530\nyou know what Armitage looked like.\n\n21\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.240\nWe saw, you know,\nit has a very simplistic interface and\n\n22\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.720\nit's probably not a crazy interface for\n\n23\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.240\nanyone to get around, even if it's\nthe first time they've seen it.\n\n24\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.890\nBecause the organization layout is like\na lot of apps that we've used in Windows,\n\n25\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.800\nand then there's ones in\nLinux that act the same way.\n\n26\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.950\nSo it's not a crazy interface.\n\n27\n00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.740\nSo we got that out of the way, but\n\n28\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.490\nthe interface looks kinda lonely\nwithout anything happening in it.\n\n29\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.940\nSo what our next step is to start\nthe process of getting things\n\n30\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.190\nInto this whole interface and\nthen start working with it.\n\n31\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.500\nSo if we look at our process just to\nput this in context, what we are going\n\n32\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.090\nto be doing is we are going to be\nfinding hosts that we can interact with.\n\n33\n00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.670\nAnd that is what we do\nwith Metasploit too.\n\n34\n00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.170\nWhen we went through that, we talked about\ndoing the reconnaissance process, which we\n\n35\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.960\ndidn't do too much of because that's a lot\nof open source stuff and things like that.\n\n36\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.290\nBut that's something that we would do but\nwe can do the scanning, discovering hosts,\n\n37\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.285\nand then populating the hosts that we're\ngoing to look Look at into Armitage.\n\n38\n00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:07.275\nSo that's what we really have to\ndo is that part of scanning and\n\n39\n00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:10.075\nlocating them and\ngetting them into Armitage.\n\n40\n00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:14.345\nFortunately, that is actually a very,\nvery easy thing to do.\n\n41\n00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:17.545\nIt's just a question of,\nwhat option do you wanna use?\n\n42\n00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:19.985\nIt does give you options.\n\n43\n00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:23.835\nAt least one option you will recognize.\n\n44\n00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:25.980\nIt's not a new face.\n\n45\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.300\nThe other ones are techniques\nthat we have discussed,\n\n46\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.220\nor seen in some way, shape, or form.\n\n47\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.240\nBut, their just being presented,\nmaybe, in a slightly different way.\n\n48\n00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.250\nSo, with that being said,\nwe'll just go ahead and get into it, and\n\n49\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.130\ntalk about what we have going on here\nwith Armitage, to get stuff in there.\n\n50\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.920\n>> Nice.\n\n51\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.860\nSo, let's take a look at\nthe interface just again.\n\n52\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.640\nSo what we have on this interface is,\nyou can see nothing is in it.\n\n53\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.320\nSo the first thing that we want to do,\n\n54\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.290\nis we want to start getting\nhosts Into Armitage.\n\n55\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.850\nAnd the way we can do that is,\nyou can go right up here.\n\n56\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.470\nEasiest way to do it, I found,\nis to go right up here to the top and\n\n57\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.120\nto this Hosts menu and\njust add the stuff in right there.\n\n58\n00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.470\nAs you'll see on this Hosts menu,\nwe have the Add Hosts ability.\n\n59\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.870\nWe also, you'll notice,\nwe can Import Hosts.\n\n60\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.580\nI'm not gonna use that one, but I'll just.\n\n61\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.200\nPay it lip service here is you can\nuse other utilities outside of\n\n62\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.670\nArmitage to scan and look for your hosts,\nor you could've built a list of hosts.\n\n63\n00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:37.625\nYou know, manually if you want it.\n\n64\n00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:41.866\nAnd you can get that list from whatever\nsource, and just import that directly into\n\n65\n00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:45.445\nArmitage and it will populate it\nwithout even really doing the scan.\n\n66\n00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.701\nYou know, so if you know what the hosts\nare and you've already built that list,\n\n67\n00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.417\nyou don't have to scan it with Armitage.\n\n68\n00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.807\nIt'll just bring them in and\n\n69\n00:03:51.807 --> 00:03:56.087\nthey'll show up, and you're off\nto the races onto your next step.\n\n70\n00:03:56.087 --> 00:03:59.787\n>> Could be handy if you've done some\nreconnaissance with some other tools\n\n71\n00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:02.193\ninitially in your plan.\n\n72\n00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:03.773\nMaybe you've already got a list of hosts.\n\n73\n00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:07.803\n>> Yeah, you could have very easily built\nthat list through any number of methods.\n\n74\n00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:14.826\nWhen we were doing our whole show on Kali,\nwe showed a lot of ways to do that.\n\n75\n00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:19.870\nYou could have used any of those\nmethods to build that list.\n\n76\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.370\nBut you could have also used some\nof these other third party tools\n\n77\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.030\nthat have occasionally popped out.\n\n78\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.590\nWe haven't shown the whole list\nof third party tools because it's\n\n79\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.674\nalmost never-ending.\n\n80\n00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:35.650\n>> [LAUGH] But you could export lists\nof hosts from things like Nessus,\n\n81\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.950\nYou could do that,\nyou could export stuff from netsparker.\n\n82\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.930\nWe talked about that in\nour forensics course.\n\n83\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.830\nIt's there.\n\n84\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.450\nAnd there is a bunch of other\nones that you can do that from,\n\n85\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.760\nthat you can just get that list over\nthere, and discover the host and\n\n86\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.890\nbring them right on into here, and\ndo your business with them here.\n\n87\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.120\nThat's kind of just a FYI.\n\n88\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.020\nFunny enough,\nthe one I didn't see on that list is, and\n\n89\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.220\nI found it kind of conspicuous by\nit's absence, is they have a list on\n\n90\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.970\nthe Armitage set up that long of\ndifferent pieces of software you can\n\n91\n00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.240\nexport stuff out of, and bring them\ninto here It didn't have an expose.\n\n92\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.660\nAnd I'm assuming that was just a case\nof someone forgot to add it in when\n\n93\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.320\nthey were typing in these 30 or\n\n94\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.970\nso whatever software package is because\nthat would sound really strange to me.\n\n95\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.370\nThat couldn't get stuff over here because\nyou can't export and do stuff from\n\n96\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.280\nthere as we saw so I'm assuming\nthat you can do it from there too.\n\n97\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.210\nBut anyway, so\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to,\n\n98\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.910\nlike I said,\nwe have to add these hosts in.\n\n99\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.540\nSo ways we add hosts,\nwe can go to this Add Hosts button.\n\n100\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.710\nAnd you can just add them\nmanually if you want.\n\n101\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.150\nIf you know the host IP address, you\ncan just type the thing right on in and\n\n102\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.290\nonce you got them all in there, just type\none in, next line, type one in, next line.\n\n103\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.770\nAnd it tells you right there,\none host per line, and\n\n104\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.490\nonce you've added them in you just\nhit add and they will populate.\n\n105\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.850\nSo, that's if you don't actually\nwanna go out and scan for them and\n\n106\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.020\nyou're not gonna input them.\n\n107\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.720\nYou can just say I know where they are,\nI don't need to look for that and\n\n108\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.880\nso just drop them right into this thing.\n\n109\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.640\n>> And there was a white box test and\nyou've already been given a list of IP\n\n110\n00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.290\naddresses and\nyou just need to pop them in there.\n\n111\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.279\n>> Yeah that would be a good example\nof that, that you already know that.\n\n112\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.110\nBut for a demo,\nthat's not really interesting.\n\n113\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.800\n>> Yeah that's not exciting, come on.\n\n114\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.950\n>> I'm not doing that.\n\n115\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.851\n>> I'm not telling you are IP address.\n\n116\n00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:32.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, now that's smart.\n\n117\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.080\nSo there's other ways to do this,\njust to be smarter about it.\n\n118\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.060\nOr, smarter, doing it a different way,\neasier, whatever, or different approaches,\n\n119\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.010\nwhatever you want to phrase it,\nlike I said you can import them.\n\n120\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.835\nYou can add them in manually,\nbut what if you don't have that,\n\n121\n00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:52.395\nand you want to see whats out there.\n\n122\n00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:54.095\nYou discovered you're subnet.\n\n123\n00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:58.405\nYou've got a subnet you want to sweep\nto discover what hosts are out there.\n\n124\n00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:00.225\nOkay, well you've got options.\n\n125\n00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:01.825\nWell take a look at what we got.\n\n126\n00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:03.095\nHey well look who's here.\n\n127\n00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.715\nLook who decided to show\nup to the party here.\n\n128\n00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:08.025\nWe got M Map.\n\n129\n00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:11.035\nI mean how much easier can\nthey make this for you.\n\n130\n00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:16.140\nI mean you can just go over here to Nmap,\nand it has that list just flow out.\n\n131\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.380\nAnd you can just click on it and\ntype in your range that you wanna scan,\n\n132\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.310\nand let it go off and do its thing.\n\n133\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.030\n>> Nice.\n>> And it will scan, and\n\n134\n00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.500\nyou can tell it how much of\na scan you want it to do.\n\n135\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.630\nIf you want it to do a port scan,\nand all those things on it, or\n\n136\n00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.040\njust sweep the whole range,\nyou can do that.\n\n137\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.820\nIt's really up to you.\n\n138\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.670\nI mean I think probably the biggest\ndanger with something like this,\n\n139\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.690\nand you'll hear me say this again and\nagain, is that the tools are so\n\n140\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.400\naccessible you kind of got to show some,\nyou got to really show restraint because\n\n141\n00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.640\nyou may want to get in and go click,\nclick, click, click, click, click, click.\n\n142\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.477\nRemember, this stuff can\nget incredibly noisy if\n\n143\n00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:55.511\nyou start doing this the wrong way.\n\n144\n00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:58.971\nYou can really become that bull\nin a china shop really quickly,\n\n145\n00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.351\nif you're not careful.\n\n146\n00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:04.310\nSo, remember all the stuff\nwe've taught you so far.\n\n147\n00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.300\nAbout being stealthy and\nmaintaining a low profile.\n\n148\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.450\nSo we've got that.\n\n149\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.280\nThe other way we can add hosts, just to\ngo through it, we can go through DNS.\n\n150\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.750\nIt has the ability if you\npop in DNS information.\n\n151\n00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.480\nYou go through and\nyou tell it what you wanna look at.\n\n152\n00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.080\nNotice you can tell it the domain,\nsub-domain, whatever in there, and\n\n153\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.240\nset the variables in here that you\nwant to have it take a look at.\n\n154\n00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.600\nAnd then hit launch, and\nit will go sweep a DNS server and\n\n155\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.330\nsee what hosts it can find.\n\n156\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.500\nSo we've seen that too, right?\n\n157\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.310\n>> Mm hm.\n>> We've seen how to dig into DNS to\n\n158\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.650\nretrieve information.\n\n159\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.620\nThis is just gonna go out and\ndo it for you, same thing.\n\n160\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.020\nIt's not even really gonna\nworry you about the command.\n\n161\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.610\nYou'll see it, but\nyou don't even have to touch that.\n\n162\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.520\nAnd then it's even got a whole bunch of\nlittle things in here if you click on.\n\n163\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.618\nBut most of these things do\nhave these advanced options,\n\n164\n00:08:56.618 --> 00:09:00.619\njust to kind of point that out,\nis the advanced options will populate with\n\n165\n00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:03.640\na whole bunch Of other things to look for\ntoo.\n\n166\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.130\nSo you can tell it ways\nto adjust the scanning,\n\n167\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.880\naggressiveness in levels in some cases,\nwIth this one you can.\n\n168\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.490\nSo you can account for\nthings like maybe slow networks or\n\n169\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.970\nkeeping a little lower profile.\n\n170\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.480\nYou could adjust that.\n\n171\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.090\nSo, that's kind of cool right there.\n\n172\n00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.520\nBut, again, we've got even other\nstuff in there to help you out.\n\n173\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.680\nI mean, we've already shown a good\nnumber of way to get hosts in there, and\n\n174\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.070\nwe've already got two,\n\n175\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.220\nwe've already got a couple ways\nto automatically discover hosts.\n\n176\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.000\nBut there is another one out here too, and\n\n177\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.260\nthat is doing the stuff\nthrough Metasploit itself.\n\n178\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.830\nMetasploit itself you can run\na scan through there too.\n\n179\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.550\nJust by putting the range\nit will run its own built\n\n180\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.080\nin techniques to find those hosts for you.\n\n181\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.080\nSo, it's up to you which way\nyou're gonna get the things in.\n\n182\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.830\nYou just gotta decide what's\nthe best situation for you and\n\n183\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.990\nyour particular environment or\ntest you're trying to do.\n\n184\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:09.860\nAnd you'll notice when you put this\nstuff in, I will just go ahead and\n\n185\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:16.390\nI'll put in the 192.168.245 and I will do.\n\n186\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:22.010\nI'll just do that, what, I'll do dot zero,\nand I'll do the 24 on there.\n\n187\n00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.390\nBecause we've seen those\nIP addresses all week.\n\n188\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.000\nWe know there's stuff in there.\n\n189\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.690\nSo, it should only take too long,\n\n190\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.360\nso we can kind of see what's\ngoing to happen here.\n\n191\n00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.490\nSo I just stuck that in and\nI will hit OK and\n\n192\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:41.750\nyou can see that there's a whole bunch\nof stuff going on at the bottom.\n\n193\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.590\nAnd oh look, it's already found something.\n\n194\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.360\nSo it's just going to keep going.\n\n195\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.760\nIt's doing its business,\nit's just popping them in.\n\n196\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.840\nIt'll keep doing that as I'm sitting here.\n\n197\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.395\nI mean heck right now\ngo do something else.\n\n198\n00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:03.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go get a cup of coffee or\n\n199\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.380\nwhatever it is.\n\n200\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.510\nGo do your thing.\n\n201\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.460\nIt's gonna just keep sweeping that and\ntrying to discover hosts for me.\n\n202\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.640\nAnd so I mean it doesn't really get much\neasier then doing something like this.\n\n203\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.250\nSo it's out there, doing its job and\ntrying to find these things for me.\n\n204\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.790\nSo yeah, could, sometimes it takes\na little longer than others,\n\n205\n00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.050\ndo expect that, but.\n\n206\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.050\n>> Gives me time to get through my Doritos\nand Mountain Dew and I just sit back and\n\n207\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.350\nwatch it go.\n\n208\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.872\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:11:29.872 --> 00:11:30.890\n>> There you go.\n\n210\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:37.630\nSo you're seeing this in here, you're\nseeing just how much it automates or\n\n211\n00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:43.620\nkind of get an idea of how much\nof this it can automate for you.\n\n212\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.630\nAnd it found a couple hosts,\nit's still going,\n\n213\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.820\nit's says it's scanned 49 of 256 hosts,\nso it's 19% of the way through.\n\n214\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.680\nAnd so it's being somewhat aggressive.\n\n215\n00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.730\nThis scan is restricted to my machine, so\nit's not really going outside of that.\n\n216\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.660\nBut it still is taking a long time,\n\n217\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.610\nit's doing a lot of its\nown stuff to find things.\n\n218\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.980\nI still expect at least a couple\nmore hosts to show up there.\n\n219\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.670\nBecause I know there's a 138,\na 139 out there.\n\n220\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.960\nSo, there should at least be two more that\nshould show up in here at some point.\n\n221\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.670\nYou know along the way, but,\n\n222\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.680\nwhen you're doing this to make\nsure if you're using one of these\n\n223\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.910\nauto detection methods that you don't get\ntoo crazy and too aggressive in there.\n\n224\n00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:38.450\nAlso, when you're looking at this, it's\nactually kinda good when you look at it.\n\n225\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.710\nWhat's going on here, as it's doing its\ndetection, one of the things that might\n\n226\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:48.070\nactually freak you out the first time you\nsee this, or might make you impatient, is,\n\n227\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:53.690\ni'm not doing anything, I'm sitting here,\nand nothing's, well now stuff's happening,\n\n228\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.530\nbut you see the command prompt, and\nthere are some more hosts showing up.\n\n229\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.310\nSo-\n>> You know,\n\n230\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.890\nI found it odd that you were\nalready back to the prompt, yet\n\n231\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.970\nit was saying you were only 4% done.\n\n232\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.710\nI was like wait, did it quit, did it stop?\n\n233\n00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.310\nBut it's still going, and\nit's just giving you a prompt so\n\n234\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.550\nyou can do other things, while it's\ndoing that scan in the background, then.\n\n235\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.940\n>> Yeah.\nThere's some things,\n\n236\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.680\nyou can still go ahead and\ndo, but that's the thing,\n\n237\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.310\nis that you saw, is like,\nwhy is it sitting there?\n\n238\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.130\nThe first time you see it,\n\n239\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.840\nit's like yeah, why is it just sitting\non its butt not doing anything?\n\n240\n00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.150\nThat can't be it.\n\n241\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.500\n>> I'm a Windows guy,\nI need my spinning cheerio at this point.\n\n242\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you need something, right?\n\n243\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.100\nIf you get in there,\nyou're gonna see that hey,\n\n244\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.710\nit's not why isn't something popping up?\n\n245\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.580\nBut I like the fact that it's maybe not\ngiven you an update as much as you want.\n\n246\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.520\nIt's not giving you that spinning ball,\nor whatever.\n\n247\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.365\nIt's not giving you that.\n\n248\n00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:51.255\nBut at least it's giving you some\nsort of update, you just gotta wait.\n\n249\n00:13:51.255 --> 00:13:56.705\nSo don't freak out if you're using this\ntool that, no, it's not working, and it's\n\n250\n00:13:56.705 --> 00:14:01.680\nbroken and hit Ctrl+c or something because\nyou hit that, you'll kill the scan.\n\n251\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.540\nThese hosts will still stay there,\nbut it's gonna kill the scan.\n\n252\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.750\nSo don't be too impatient with it.\n\n253\n00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.190\nMake sure the thing is\nactually really dead before.\n\n254\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.050\nBefore you are not working\nbefore you kill it.\n\n255\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.370\n>> And it'll let you know when it's done.\n\n256\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.230\nIt'll pop up some message.\n\n257\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.950\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you can see it's still kinda\n\n258\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.710\ngoing through.\n\n259\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:30.020\nAnd notice by the way, I can look through\nthe results that it's already given me.\n\n260\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.670\nIf you look through these,\nyou can see that the host that it finds,\n\n261\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.560\nit's already giving me,\nit's doing a port scan too.\n\n262\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.530\nThat's part of the reason why\nit's taking this time too.\n\n263\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.220\nIt's not just going ping ping ping\nping ping ping ping to see what's\n\n264\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.060\nresponding back.\n\n265\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.680\nI could have done that right through NMap.\n\n266\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.960\nNMap has that option right on the menu\nin here you just click it and say,\n\n267\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.770\nhey run a pink scan, put the range in and\n\n268\n00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.660\nit'll just go brrrpt right across there\nand tell you which ones are live.\n\n269\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:05.680\nThis one's even telling me,\nit's chosing to do what ports are open.\n\n270\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.640\nSo that is just a really cool thing\nbecause you're going to need that.\n\n271\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.700\nYou may not do it immediately like I did.\n\n272\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.160\nBut, you know, here, we're,\nwe're just doing a demo.\n\n273\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.780\nWe're playing around, showing the features\nin here, so, not as big of a problem here.\n\n274\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.850\nIt's, it, someone's not gonna come and,\nyou know,\n\n275\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.369\nstart beating on the door\ngoing what are you doing.\n\n276\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.860\nBut really think about which scan is\ngonna be the most appropriate for\n\n277\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.870\nyou, and how noisy it is here.\n\n278\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.720\nThat will be a little more noisy\nthat just doing a regular scan, but\n\n279\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.520\nit's fine for here.\n\n280\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.380\nAll right.\n\n281\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.550\nSo it completed, and\nit's kicked out of it and\n\n282\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.460\ngone back to a command prompt,\nso a hundred percent complete.\n\n283\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.395\nIt found some hosts on there so we have\n\n284\n00:15:53.395 --> 00:15:58.365\nthe .2.1.132.138, and\nthat looks like 139 at the end.\n\n285\n00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:02.987\nSo, hey we've come a long way\nwithout really doing much.\n\n286\n00:16:02.987 --> 00:16:06.168\nI haven't even typed in a command yet.\n\n287\n00:16:06.168 --> 00:16:09.245\nI just type in an IP range and\nthat was Was it.\n\n288\n00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:13.920\nAnd, you can, by the way,\ntype in that range in different ways.\n\n289\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.020\nYou can actually type in the 192.168.1-,\nand then do 30,\n\n290\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.510\nso it'll only scan maybe those first\n30 hosts, if that's all you want to do.\n\n291\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.880\nI chose not to do that,\nI chose just to go ahead and chop it and\n\n292\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.880\nsay /24 and let it do it that way.\n\n293\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.640\nYou do have different ways\nof putting that range in.\n\n294\n00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.810\nSo, anyway, so\nwe got host populated in here, so\n\n295\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:47.250\nwe're doing pretty good and\nyou can see that so the results are done.\n\n296\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.480\nSo, but,\nwe're still not all the way there.\n\n297\n00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.400\nPlenty of more things we can do for\nall sorts of mischief and mayhem on these.\n\n298\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.750\nWe haven't even got to that.\n\n299\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.519\nSo I look at these systems,\nand okay, it's a good start.\n\n300\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.030\nNext, I figure out how to\nidentify the systems, and\n\n301\n00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.710\nthen how to exploit the systems,\nand what I can do with each one.\n\n302\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.420\nThere's a lot of other things we\ncan do but this is where it starts.\n\n303\n00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.760\nWe've got them in there,\nwe've got targets.\n\n304\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.620\nAnd so it's a question of where\nare we gonna progress from here?\n\n305\n00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.409\nWe gotta choose one, and\nthen we gotta do other stuff.\n\n306\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.180\nSomething else you can do,\ncuz this can get kind of crazy.\n\n307\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.073\nI only have five hosts showing up in here,\nbut\n\n308\n00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:37.230\nthis can literally get really populated.\n\n309\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.765\nWith a virtual machine like I have here\nthere's not a ton of virtual machines\n\n310\n00:17:40.765 --> 00:17:41.585\nrunning on this.\n\n311\n00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:43.145\nI just don't have the memory or-\n>> [CROSSTALK] typical class c though.\n\n312\n00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.043\nYou might run into a couple hundred hosts.\n\n313\n00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:47.262\nThey're not gonna fit all that neatly\nin that little window are they?\n\n314\n00:17:47.262 --> 00:17:47.995\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n315\n00:17:47.995 --> 00:17:49.865\nthey're not all gonna fit in there, and\n\n316\n00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:54.550\nthat's a good point cuz you can actually\ngo through and adjust this a bit.\n\n317\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.980\nIf you want you can do different things.\n\n318\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.700\nSome of these we'll show you have\ndifferent ways of arranging it and\n\n319\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.686\nthings like that if you wanna do that.\n\n320\n00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:08.505\nSo, that's kind of helpful\nto help you view it.\n\n321\n00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:12.790\nSo, that's a very good point, but\n\n322\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.068\nsomething else you can do to organize\nyour stuff is through these workspaces.\n\n323\n00:18:17.068 --> 00:18:23.790\nThese workspaces,\nyou can actually create a workspace,\n\n324\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.990\nand name a workspace and\nput hosts in it and all that stuff, and\n\n325\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.660\nthen activate it and use that where you're\norganizing your stuff as you go through.\n\n326\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.040\nAnd you'll just see another tab show\nup down at the bottom for that.\n\n327\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.370\nYou can see the tab right there\nshowing up as being active.\n\n328\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.130\nI'm not really worried\nabout that too much for\n\n329\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.110\nthis because it's not a lot\nof nastiness going on here.\n\n330\n00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:53.380\nBut I could put in something like\na test and name it test, and\n\n331\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:58.570\nthen put the host,\n\n332\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.050\nI'll do 192.168.245 and\nI'll just do something like that.\n\n333\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.800\nThe ports they wanna put in,\nI can do all that and just click add and\n\n334\n00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.590\nit will start adding to my hosts\nright over there, if I want it.\n\n335\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.890\nSo that's another way of\norganizing stuff if you want.\n\n336\n00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:18.210\nYou can have multiple\nhosts put in there and\n\n337\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.140\nhave multiple even workspaces if you want.\n\n338\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.900\nSo.\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n339\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.940\n>> That's a nice way of organizing stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.290\nI'll just go ahead and close that\nworkspace, cuz I don't really need it for\n\n341\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.650\nwhat I'm doing here.\n\n342\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.350\nBut if I was doing an actual pen test,\nI might seriously consider that.\n\n343\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.730\nIt might actually be a good idea\nto create workspaces, maybe for\n\n344\n00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.050\ndifferent subnets maybe or\ndifferent purposes.\n\n345\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.370\nYou gotta think of ways that might be more\nideal for you to organize it than just\n\n346\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.610\nthrow them all in the same thing and go,\noh, how am I gonna sort through this?\n\n347\n00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.607\n>> And those will remember your host and\nthings like that, so\n\n348\n00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:51.010\nyou don't have to discover them again.\n\n349\n00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.070\nSo if you have more than one project\nyou're working on or something like that.\n\n350\n00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:58.550\n>> Yeah and\nthat's another good thing to bring up.\n\n351\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.406\nIs when you do these discoveries and\nyou find the hosts and all that and\n\n352\n00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:06.131\nstart doing all your work,\nI've got five hosts in here right now,\n\n353\n00:20:06.131 --> 00:20:10.345\nwhat happens if I decide, oh well I've\ngot something else I've got to do.\n\n354\n00:20:10.345 --> 00:20:13.090\nI've got to take off and do whatever.\n\n355\n00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:22.070\nIf you need to stop right here, you can\nclose Armitage and shut this all down.\n\n356\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.430\nWhen you come back and open up Armitage,\nit will pick up where you left off.\n\n357\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.960\n>> Oh nice.\n\n358\n00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.280\n>> So, you don't have to really\nworry too much about that.\n\n359\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.540\nThat's a good thing.\n\n360\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.580\nThat's really a good thing for you.\n\n361\n00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.140\nSo like I said you can see just how\n\n362\n00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.610\nquickly you can start\ndoing stuff with this.\n\n363\n00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.960\nNow as far as stuff\nwhere we're going next,\n\n364\n00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.720\nlet's say you just did a quick\nPing Sweep and discovered these hosts.\n\n365\n00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.650\nWell, Ping Sweep, as we know, is just\ngonna tell you there's something there and\n\n366\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.280\nit's breathing.\n\n367\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.460\nIt's not gonna tell you\nanything beyond that.\n\n368\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.940\nYou've got a sign of life, you just\ndon't know what the full story is.\n\n369\n00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.980\nWell, the next step on this and\nwhere we're\n\n370\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.420\nheading towards in our next segments and\n\n371\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.990\nall that, is we're gonna start\nincreasing our knowledge of these hosts.\n\n372\n00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.077\nAnd we're gonna increase our\nknowledge of the hosts, and\n\n373\n00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:20.857\nfind out what they are, and then we're\nalso gonna start finding out and\n\n374\n00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:24.790\nsingling out which one might be\na good candidate for targeting.\n\n375\n00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.430\nSo, you can see that in here,\nbut if you just did, for example,\n\n376\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:34.450\na Ping Sweep right on down the line, you\nhave the ability to scan right here and\n\n377\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.940\nit will take a look at that\nspecific host for you.\n\n378\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.080\nAnd those shortcut menus, that was the one\nI was talking about in our first segment.\n\n379\n00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:50.400\nThe shortcut menus will actually\nstart to customize as you go through,\n\n380\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.550\nyou'll see more stuff pop in,\nI don't really have much stuff now,\n\n381\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:58.207\nI haven't done much, so far, but\nas you progress through you'll\n\n382\n00:21:58.207 --> 00:22:02.110\nsee more stuff pop in there as it\ngains more knowledge of a host.\n\n383\n00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:08.250\nAnd remember, the reason why it's able to\ndo that and start being able to customize\n\n384\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.050\nthings and know things and remember that,\nyou're connected to a database.\n\n385\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.780\nThis is all going into\na database on the back end so\n\n386\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.950\nit can recall that information for\nyou too.\n\n387\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:24.600\nYou'll see in these actual menus that\nyou can view stuff right through here.\n\n388\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.040\nThey've got the same view loop,\n\n389\n00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.610\nwhich we hadn't actually talked about\nwhen we did Metasploit by itself.\n\n390\n00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.129\nBut if you do this view loop,\nas you start collecting information,\n\n391\n00:22:34.129 --> 00:22:39.125\nthere's really not much in here right now,\nbut if you start gathering a lot\n\n392\n00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:42.399\nof information it will\nstart showing up in here.\n\n393\n00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:45.740\nIt will pull recall out of the database\nand show you, hey, this is what I've got.\n\n394\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.250\n>> Nice.\nNice.\n\n395\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.520\n>> So that's why it's able to\ncustomize this experience so\n\n396\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.070\nmuch, remember these things,\nit's got that ability.\n\n397\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.655\nSo some pretty neat stuff there and\nwe're gonna be populating that and\n\n398\n00:22:56.655 --> 00:23:01.655\nputting more stuff in there automatically\nas we go through our next few segments.\n\n399\n00:23:01.655 --> 00:23:05.435\nWe're gonna be doing more and more and\nmore, so that's where we're headed.\n\n400\n00:23:05.435 --> 00:23:10.045\nJust kind of to get you ready for\nthat, but this is the first step.\n\n401\n00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:11.775\nWe set it up and we discovered host.\n\n402\n00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:14.695\nIf you wanna set up a workspace,\nyou go ahead and set up a workspace.\n\n403\n00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:17.680\nI'm choosing not to but\nyou can choose to do that.\n\n404\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.290\nIf it makes more sense to you,\ngo for it, but\n\n405\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.080\nthe option's there for\nyou to do what you want with it.\n\n406\n00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.730\n>> The workspace really doesn't give\nme anything functionally as far as\n\n407\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.275\nlimiting the tool or adding the tool,\njust a way to organize my look and\n\n408\n00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:34.685\nthe way I've got things\norganized within the console.\n\n409\n00:23:34.685 --> 00:23:37.745\n>> There are some things that you gain,\nand\n\n410\n00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:41.750\nwe'll get to those a little\nfurther down the road.\n\n411\n00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.090\nYou gain by getting a work space but for\n\n412\n00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.430\nthe most part it's really gonna to be for\norganizing.\n\n413\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.984\nIt's the way I tend to look at, is just\nmostly as a organizational tool and\n\n414\n00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:56.225\nto make things easier for\nme to look at and discover.\n\n415\n00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:59.058\nBut there are some things\nthat come with it and we'll,\n\n416\n00:23:59.058 --> 00:24:01.130\nlet's recover those features-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.960\n>> Then we'll talk about that's where they\n\n418\n00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.640\nfit in as far as the workspace goes.\n\n419\n00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.280\n>> Okay.\nThere I go putting the cart\n\n420\n00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.641\nbefore the horse.\n\n421\n00:24:07.641 --> 00:24:09.698\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's easy to get excited about\n\n422\n00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:11.648\nthis, it's a nerdy thing, I know.\n\n423\n00:24:11.648 --> 00:24:16.593\nBut it's really easy to get excited\nabout this after seeing what we're able\n\n424\n00:24:16.593 --> 00:24:20.470\nto do with the tools previously,\nespecially Metasploit.\n\n425\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.340\nMetasploit, when people\nsee it the first time,\n\n426\n00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.910\nthey see it as,\nlook at all the stuff I gotta type.\n\n427\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.810\nI think that's probably a huge\nbarrier to people getting in is\n\n428\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.260\nthat they want something\nthat just push button.\n\n429\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.140\nNow the people that are more advanced and\nhave more realistic expectations realize\n\n430\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.980\nyou get into this field that you're\ngonna have to know command lines.\n\n431\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.020\nYou're in IT, you're gonna have\nto know command line period.\n\n432\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.710\nYou're just not getting away from it.\n\n433\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.750\nBut when you look at level of stuff you\ngotta do with something like Metasploit,\n\n434\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:52.240\nand we didn't use really any shortcuts for\ndoing Metasploit.\n\n435\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640\nThere are shortcuts, but\n\n436\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.330\nthere's still a lot of stuff you\nhave to do at the command line.\n\n437\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.380\nThat's what it is.\n\n438\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.770\nSo that's a huge barrier, but we did it.\n\n439\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:03.440\nWe got through it.\n\n440\n00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.150\nEveryone should give themselves\na pat on the back for\n\n441\n00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.640\ngetting through all that\ncommand line stuff.\n\n442\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.262\nNow what we're doing is, we're saying\nlet's use all that power we've\n\n443\n00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:15.914\naccumulated, let's use it in\na more easy to access way.\n\n444\n00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:17.720\nAnd when you see that it\ngets really exciting.\n\n445\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.200\nThe first time I started going over\nthis I'm like, wow, this is just so\n\n446\n00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.800\nmuch easier.\n\n447\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.700\nYou feel like you kind of have this\ngod like power over things now.\n\n448\n00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.800\nYou will get that way, so.\n\n449\n00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.410\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n450\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.110\nAll right, well, looking forward to\nthe next few episodes as we continue our\n\n451\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.605\njourney through Armitage\nwithin Metasploit.\n\n452\n00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:37.582\nFor now though signing off for ITProTV\nI'm Mike Rodrick and I'm Sean Oriyano and\n\n453\n00:25:37.582 --> 00:25:38.882\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n454\n00:25:38.882 --> 00:25:44.820\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.298\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:17.099\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.120\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.712\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:20.050\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.660\nExcited we got another episode coming\nyour way in our Metasploit series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.290\nContinuing on with our armitage,\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n10\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.400\nWe've got it kinda set up.\n\n11\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130\nWe took a look at the interface.\n\n12\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540\nWe've got our first initial scan done,\nfound some hosts but\n\n13\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.140\nwe kinda stopped there, so now we're gonna\ncontinue on, and see what else we can do,\n\n14\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.240\nwith this, basically a gooey front end for\nmetasploit.\n\n15\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.420\n>> Yeah, that's indeed what it is, it's\ngiven us another way to access the power\n\n16\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.360\nof metasploit, plus some other tools,\nof course, but it's giving us\n\n17\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.890\nquicker access to do what we want to,\nor what we may not have thought of,\n\n18\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.870\nI guess, is another way to put it,\ninside of the metasploit product.\n\n19\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.710\nAnd I think that's actually something\nthat we can point out in here,\n\n20\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.930\nthat I've noticed with it, and I've kinda\nseen by doing my exploration of it,\n\n21\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.450\ngoing online and seeing what other people\nhave written about it, is because it's so\n\n22\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.500\neasy to run a task, it gives you a chance\nto maybe experiment with other things\n\n23\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.190\nthat you may not have because of time\nconstraints been able to do before easily.\n\n24\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.850\nSo, that's another great thing\nwith this product, that you can\n\n25\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.630\ndo some experimentation and try different\napproaches and see what that gets you.\n\n26\n00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.090\nBut yeah, we've been through, so far, we\nwent through kind of what it looks like.\n\n27\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320\nWe added some hosts to the interface and\n\n28\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.280\nwe're actually able to detect five hosts,\nwe didn't identify them, but\n\n29\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.485\nwe were able to find these hosts out there\nso we made that important first step.\n\n30\n00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:08.595\nSo we have to continue on with doing more,\nand that's\n\n31\n00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:14.285\nbasically getting ready to go in and\nstart doing attacks against this thing.\n\n32\n00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:19.060\nSo that's where we kind of stand,\nis getting ready to do that.\n\n33\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.568\nSo how do we do that?\n\n34\n00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:27.350\nWell it's kinda review what Metasploit\nhave, Metasploit itself had all\n\n35\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.060\nthese scanning tools built in, and it\nhad some ways of helping us find things.\n\n36\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.030\nAnd then once we found a particular\nvulnerability on a system that might be of\n\n37\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.900\ninterest or might be something that gives\nus a way to get further with that system,\n\n38\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.870\nwe would use an exploit to get in there,\nand\n\n39\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.740\nthen the exploit would be used to drop off\na payload that would do something for us.\n\n40\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.080\nSo, that's kinda where we're at,\n\n41\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080\nis that we're at that point where\nwe're starting to get exploits.\n\n42\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.260\nBring those into play.\n\n43\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.900\nSo, question is, how do we do that?\n\n44\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.330\nHow do we bring those exploits into play?\n\n45\n00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.885\nSo with that being said,\nI guess that's where we just go ahead.\n\n46\n00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:13.631\nThat's our cue to go into Armitage and\ntake a look at how we deploy these\n\n47\n00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.506\nexploits and\nstart using them within that environment.\n\n48\n00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:18.510\n>> Nice.\n\n49\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.600\n>> So, let's see what we've got.\n\n50\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.470\nSo I've got, here the Armitage again and\n\n51\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.500\nwhat I'm gonna do is,\nI have my five hosts.\n\n52\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.890\nKind of across the board here.\n\n53\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.070\nAnd so,\ndon't know what they are like you said.\n\n54\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.839\nWe just know that, that's what it found.\n\n55\n00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:42.251\nAs we saw, we can check these things\nout and see what is on them and\n\n56\n00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.877\nwhat's available, but\nreally not much else in that.\n\n57\n00:03:46.877 --> 00:03:51.581\nI mean, if I went through,\nI can maybe start probing it a bit more,\n\n58\n00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:56.537\nI can start seeing what this guy is,\nbut I've got the ability to really\n\n59\n00:03:56.537 --> 00:04:01.600\ntake a look and do stuff against that,\nagainst these various systems.\n\n60\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.910\nWhat I wanna do, I want to if I right\nclick on some of these I mean I right\n\n61\n00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.810\nclick to look at the services for\nthis guy, so\n\n62\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.390\nI can see the different ports laid\nout here that are available on it.\n\n63\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.545\nI mean hey look at this one scanned it,\nwhat did it do?\n\n64\n00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:19.605\nI was running a scan over there\nwhere I was probing this one.\n\n65\n00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:20.735\nWell look what it did.\n\n66\n00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:24.675\nAnd here's a scan again so\nit was doing the scan\n\n67\n00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:29.082\non that specific system which it's still\ndoing, you can see that, it's still going.\n\n68\n00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:35.112\nNow you may know from what\nwe've been doing from\n\n69\n00:04:35.112 --> 00:04:39.292\nall these past sessions, you may already\nknow what's behind those IP addresses.\n\n70\n00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:45.342\nSo maybe no big secret to you, but\nI didn't, during this process, flip\n\n71\n00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:50.332\nover to any of those things at any point\nso far and say, well that's what it is.\n\n72\n00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:54.090\nSo this would be kind of like\ndoing a black box test, really.\n\n73\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.480\nI just went through and swept that subnet.\n\n74\n00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.740\nI found these hosts and I didn't know\nwhat they were, so I targeted one,\n\n75\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.910\ndid a scan, all of a sudden it says\nI know enough, that's a Linux system.\n\n76\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.030\nSo that's one thing done.\n\n77\n00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.910\nAnd then I can see what was discovered,\nI can take a look at that.\n\n78\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.470\nMatter of fact, if I right-click on\nthis one and do services, well hey,\n\n79\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.060\nlook at that.\n\n80\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.850\nIt's got quite a bit being revealed.\n\n81\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.470\nNow, if you have been with us on this\njourney so far you look at this and\n\n82\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.430\nyou can see well look at all\nthe services running, look at all, so\n\n83\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.520\nwe have got all these ports open,\nits identified some of the ports, and\n\n84\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.040\nthen we have the info where it was doing\nbanner grabs, and that type of deal.\n\n85\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.180\nWell, we go through it,\nwe're looking at it, hey, guess what,\n\n86\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.420\nit looks like this is\nthe metasploitable system.\n\n87\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.680\nIt says it right there, I mean,\nthat's the domain name, of course,\n\n88\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.550\nthat they set for it, but\nit looks like that's indeed what it is.\n\n89\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.423\nWe happen to know from looking at\nit during the week that that is\n\n90\n00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:01.743\nthe metasploitable system,\neverybody's got all the earmarks of it,\n\n91\n00:06:01.743 --> 00:06:05.557\njust by looking at it this way, and that\nIP address you've been using all week, so\n\n92\n00:06:05.557 --> 00:06:07.311\nprobably can look at it that way too.\n\n93\n00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.971\nAnd say, yeah, I've memorized that by now.\n\n94\n00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:13.540\nIt haunts my dreams.\n\n95\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.450\nSo, we've got information on that.\n\n96\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.770\nSo we've got this other\nguy sitting out there.\n\n97\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.990\nI could do a further scan on that and\nsee is it gonna be able to identify\n\n98\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.620\nanything on that system to\ntell me what that system is.\n\n99\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.220\nSo it's scanning that system over there.\n\n100\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.450\nIt doesn't look like it's giving\nme anything so far so okay.\n\n101\n00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.170\nAnd then I've got this\none more system out here.\n\n102\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.230\nI can scan, and\nI can pick services off if I want, and\n\n103\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.290\nright now there's no services on there.\n\n104\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.020\nThey haven't shown up yet\nbecause it hasn't completed the scan yet.\n\n105\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.841\nAnd by the way, when you're doing this,\n\n106\n00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:57.420\nYou notice how it keeps opening\nup tabs as we go through?\n\n107\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.978\nEvery time I run something\nanother tab pops up.\n\n108\n00:06:59.978 --> 00:07:01.580\nYou can feel free to close those tabs.\n\n109\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.560\nYou don't have to keep them open.\n\n110\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.030\nWhen it's just sitting there idle\nthere's no reason really to keep that\n\n111\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.580\nwhole thing open there.\n\n112\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.530\nBut any case,\nI've got these systems sitting out there,\n\n113\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.360\nso we're in pretty good shape.\n\n114\n00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.150\nThe question is,\n\n115\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.640\nwhat do you do now that you kind of\nknow what the operating system is.\n\n116\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.600\nSo, this is a Linux system.\n\n117\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.820\nI can go over here and you can see that,\nhey, something new has popped up here.\n\n118\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.390\nThat wasn't there just a bit ago.\n\n119\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:38.920\nSo I have this login deal showing on here.\n\n120\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.270\nI can go through this list and\nI can see, okay, if I click on\n\n121\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.860\nthe FTP one it's saying, hey,\ndo you wanna attempt to login?\n\n122\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.232\nIf I have maybe got an idea what\nI think the password is, or\n\n123\n00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:56.258\nI can use some password cracking tools,\nwhich we're gonna get to.\n\n124\n00:07:56.258 --> 00:08:01.095\nThere are password cracking tools in\nthis product that you can use to really\n\n125\n00:08:01.095 --> 00:08:04.187\nkind of extract more\ninformation than we have.\n\n126\n00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:06.210\nSo far, but, yeah we're gonna get to that.\n\n127\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.741\nAnd we're honestly gonna get to that.\n\n128\n00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.994\nSo as we're getting some stuff here, but\nyou'll notice it's giving you the ability\n\n129\n00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.920\nto log in to some of these services,\nif you have it.\n\n130\n00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.270\nSo that's pretty good.\n\n131\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.410\nThe other thing, the host, since it's got\nthe host in there, it says the host is\n\n132\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:29.800\nLinux, well we can grab stuff specific\nto that system on there as well.\n\n133\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.610\nWe have exploits over here on\nthe right-hand side to do with Linux.\n\n134\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.260\nSo you could try, perhaps,\nif you think there's a specific\n\n135\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.410\nservice out there that might be something\nthat you can exploit, you can do that.\n\n136\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:47.553\nWe know from going through the stuff\nwe had earlier on in the week,\n\n137\n00:08:47.553 --> 00:08:50.079\ndoing all those explorations,\n\n138\n00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:54.866\nwe know already that some of\nthese things on Linux will work.\n\n139\n00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:59.410\nWe saw stuff like what, VNC we saw worked.\n\n140\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.660\n>> Disk CC.\n\n141\n00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.630\n>> Yeah, Disk CC we saw work.\n\n142\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.320\nWe saw a number of\n\n143\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.130\nthose exploits work without really\nmuch of a problem whatsoever.\n\n144\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.020\nSo we can run those things\nwithout too much effort, so\n\n145\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.450\nthat's pretty cool to have.\n\n146\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.450\nSo are there other ways to actually figure\nthings out on how to go after a system?\n\n147\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.470\nYeah, there are some other ways.\n\n148\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.890\nIf you wanna go to some of these\nother ones and run find attacks,\n\n149\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.800\nhere I am I'm querying\nthe system saying find attacks.\n\n150\n00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.370\nAnd so, I went off the Attack menu,\nand did Find Attacks.\n\n151\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.130\nAnd it's sweeping the system to see,\nwell, can it find anything that will work?\n\n152\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.514\nOkay.\n\n153\n00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:46.330\nWell, I ran attacks that find attacks.\n\n154\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.070\nIt went through, and\nI like how it does this.\n\n155\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.765\nHappy hunting!\n\n156\n00:09:48.765 --> 00:09:49.760\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n157\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.900\n>> See you later!\n\n158\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.770\nSo let's see if it found anything\nthat is of interest to us.\n\n159\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.110\nOh, hey, look at that.\n\n160\n00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.670\nIt went through and\nit said hey attack Samba and\n\n161\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.380\nit looks like it found some stuff.\n\n162\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.600\nAnd then it's even got some\nCheck exploits on here.\n\n163\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.960\nYou can tell it to go through, and\n\n164\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.930\ndoes it have any exploit that it\nmight be able to use against this?\n\n165\n00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.850\nLet's go over to this guy,\nit's got attach on there, too.\n\n166\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.390\nHey, check that out.\n\n167\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.790\n>> That was the Metasploit machine,\n\n168\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.530\nthat's got a lot of vulnerabilities,\nbuilt into it?\n\n169\n00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.620\n>> Yeah.\nYeah I'm surprised it didn't\n\n170\n00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.625\njust go, bang.\n\n171\n00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n172\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.000\nit's very quickly started\nfinding stuff for\n\n173\n00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.810\nus to actually run specific\nexploits against this system.\n\n174\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.710\nWe know, for example,\nfrom our explorations and\n\n175\n00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:50.020\nstuff like that, we know that if we go,\nthis Disk CC for example, will work.\n\n176\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.520\nIf I clicedk on the diskcc_exec,\nwhat does it do?\n\n177\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.050\nBrings up this box, this is actually\nkinda nice really, because,\n\n178\n00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.150\nremember all those things\nwe did at the command line?\n\n179\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.500\nWe were typing stuff, saying set L host,\nall these things, well hell,\n\n180\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.320\nwe've got it right here.\n\n181\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.370\nWe've got everything sitting right there\nfor us easy to go ahead and work with.\n\n182\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.110\nThere's our lhost variable.\n\n183\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.280\nThere's our lport, rhost, rport.\n\n184\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.060\nWe've got a lot of stuff already there.\n\n185\n00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.920\nAnd you've even got other\noptions that may not be\n\n186\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.000\nreadily available that we didn't see\nin the command line but were there.\n\n187\n00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.930\nYou can see when I click on\nShow Advanced Options, what did it do?\n\n188\n00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.470\nIt's got those in there too.\n\n189\n00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.110\nIt's got a whole bunch of\nadditional ones that we can do.\n\n190\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.060\nAnd there's even the targeting.\n\n191\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.250\nIf it doesn't know the target, it does\nknow the target already in this one, but\n\n192\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.840\nif it doesn't know the target we could\nhave actually just chose it off a list and\n\n193\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.710\nsaid, hey, rock and roll, go for it.\n\n194\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.530\nSo, I'm gonna look at this right now and\n\n195\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.600\nassume since it's got this\nstuff populated in here for me.\n\n196\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.920\nLet me turn off either\nthe advanced options.\n\n197\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.130\nI can see the lhost and I can see\nthe rhost in there, populated both for me.\n\n198\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.980\nSo what I am gonna do is I'm gonna say,\nokay,\n\n199\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.170\nwell, let's launch the attack and\nsee what happens with it.\n\n200\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:20.070\nSo, it's going through and\nit's seeing if it found anything.\n\n201\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:25.580\nAnd you can see at kind of in the bottom,\nit was trying to run the exploit.\n\n202\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.070\nSo, it went ahead and it ran the exploit.\n\n203\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:34.410\nWe should be able to, once we look at\nthat, and take a look, by the way.\n\n204\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.520\nI like how the graphic changed.\n\n205\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.720\nThe graphic's got that little lightning\nbolt streaky stuff around it.\n\n206\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.925\nIt's like, you're mine now.\n\n207\n00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:44.671\n[LAUGH] Or it's,\nfear the power of the dark side!\n\n208\n00:12:44.671 --> 00:12:46.331\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n209\n00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:51.302\n>> So, it's latched into it, but\nyou look at the bottom of the screen,\n\n210\n00:12:51.302 --> 00:12:56.958\nit ran the exploit, and remember when we\nran the disk cc one, it gave us a little\n\n211\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:02.920\nmore than that, I mean it gave us that\nlittle prompt, and all that to do stuff.\n\n212\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.780\nWell, okay, well,\nwe still gotta get to that point, right?\n\n213\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.000\nI mean, we've got an exploit but\nwe don't really have that last little bit.\n\n214\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.180\nOkay so that's where you get over here.\n\n215\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.380\nYou've got the shell menu.\n\n216\n00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:21.310\nThere's our interact one and so it's\ngot it right down there at the bottom.\n\n217\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.940\nI can start doing whatever\nI want down there.\n\n218\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.112\n>> Wow.\n>> So I've gotten pretty far with just\n\n219\n00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:33.570\na little bit of effort.\n\n220\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.280\n>> Absolutely,\nthat's pretty impressive and a lot easier.\n\n221\n00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.310\nGranted, we could do\nthis through Metasploit.\n\n222\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.690\nTruth is those right-click\nmenus are fantastic.\n\n223\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.400\nI can find all the exploits and\n\n224\n00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.170\nthen filter my context menu\nto include just those.\n\n225\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.630\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's pretty darn sweet.\n\n226\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.330\n>> Yeah,\nthat's what I really like about this.\n\n227\n00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.430\nIt makes it just so\nquick and easy to do things.\n\n228\n00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.450\nThat it could be just doing\nit in Metasploit alone.\n\n229\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.330\nNow, if you're someone that's\na Metasploit ninja and you're gonna be\n\n230\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.590\njust typing away, some people find it\na lot easier to do things that way.\n\n231\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.640\nAnd I'm not gonna say, oh, well that's\nbad or anything else like that.\n\n232\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.900\nI'm just gonna say that if you\ncan do it that way, great.\n\n233\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.510\n[LAUGH] I could do a lot of stuff\nin Metasploit the command line,\n\n234\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.995\nbut I can also do it here.\n\n235\n00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:23.735\nAnd as long as they know how to do it,\n\n236\n00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:26.505\nthe command line, kind of remember\nthe mechanics, I might just go ahead and\n\n237\n00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:29.535\nchoose something like this to\nmake it just a lot easier.\n\n238\n00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.705\nI don't have to worry about\nsetting a whole bunch of stuff and\n\n239\n00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:33.645\ndoing a bunch of things.\n\n240\n00:14:33.645 --> 00:14:39.270\nYou saw right here what I was doing\nwhen I was launching that exploit,\n\n241\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.510\nwhen I brought it up in that dialog box\nit had variables already populated.\n\n242\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.000\nI could change those, but\nit already had them ready to go for me.\n\n243\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.390\nSo I could leave them the way they were,\nwhich I did.\n\n244\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.360\nAnd just take it from there.\n\n245\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.640\nSo that's kind of a really neat thing.\n\n246\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.580\nYou can see there are other attacks\npresent if you want to really go ahead and\n\n247\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.720\ndo that,\nyou can do other attacks off of here.\n\n248\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.260\nAnd here it's gonna say, okay, what\ntypes of exploits do you have for Samba?\n\n249\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:16.530\nBecause we looked at the Samba\nside of things, and we saw that we\n\n250\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:22.197\ncould browse out of the file share and\ninto the actual system itself.\n\n251\n00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:24.890\nSo, we could just go through and\nrun these things,\n\n252\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.580\nlike do this user map to script one and\nsay, okay, what do you want to do?\n\n253\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.680\nI could say go ahead and\nthat's fine, and launch it.\n\n254\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.270\nSame deal.\n\n255\n00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.610\nWe'll try to launch that actual attack and\nit goes through and\n\n256\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.750\ndoes its little magic there.\n\n257\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.200\nAnd now we go over to it, it says okay,\nhere's another shell option.\n\n258\n00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.330\nOpen up a shell in there so\nI can go interact with that.\n\n259\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.630\nIt opens it up and\nthere's the shell for that one.\n\n260\n00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.971\n>> Right.\n>> So, yeah, I mean,\n\n261\n00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:57.239\nlook at how quick that is.\n\n262\n00:15:57.239 --> 00:16:02.193\nThe system has been breached, and it has\nbeen breached pretty badly at this point.\n\n263\n00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:04.711\nI mean, obviously metasploitable.\n\n264\n00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:09.248\nLends itself to that pretty easily,\ncuz it was designed for\n\n265\n00:16:09.248 --> 00:16:13.070\nthat, but\nthis just takes it to a whole new level.\n\n266\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:19.970\nI mean, we were still typing a lot doing\nstuff, but here they didn't type anything.\n\n267\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.915\nI would just go and right on through.\n\n268\n00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:25.260\n>> [LAUGH] I tell you what,\nthat does make it pretty nice.\n\n269\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.120\nAnd the fact that it's\ngonna remember all of that.\n\n270\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.180\nYou can create those work\nspaces to organize everything.\n\n271\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.362\nAnd that adds a lot, cuz if you're\njust doing this straight through\n\n272\n00:16:34.362 --> 00:16:38.470\nyou gotta go back in and\nopen up that MSF framework every time.\n\n273\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:44.696\n>> Yeah, it can be kinda tedious to\ngo through and do it right through.\n\n274\n00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:47.040\nYou know,\nMeta they're using the command line.\n\n275\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.120\nYou know, one of the things that,\nyou know, was a little bit of a cheat.\n\n276\n00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.330\nI mean,\nsome people might consider it a cheat.\n\n277\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.050\nYou know, I don't but,\nit was keeping all those,\n\n278\n00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.040\nwe're keeping different windows open with\nthe framework loaded in all of them.\n\n279\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.670\nSo, I would just run something over here,\nswitch over here, and\n\n280\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.750\nI was keeping histories of everything just\nso I didn't have to type everything in,\n\n281\n00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.510\nand I could get to doing\nstuff a lot quicker.\n\n282\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.375\nThis is just a way of making that\nsame type of thing happen without\n\n283\n00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:22.445\nhaving to do those little tricks and\nworkaround and stuff like that.\n\n284\n00:17:22.445 --> 00:17:24.415\n>> Nice.\n>> Using an exploit like that and\n\n285\n00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:29.175\ngetting in and doing your hands on a lot\nand messing with the system, just so\n\n286\n00:17:29.175 --> 00:17:31.595\nmuch easier doing it this way.\n\n287\n00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:38.685\nI like the fact that you can\njust go to a system in here, and\n\n288\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:45.280\nscan it, and do your whole thing\nwith it and find out what's going\n\n289\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.180\non on that system and be ready to\ngo with your attack pretty quickly.\n\n290\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.960\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So\n\n291\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.900\ni've identified these systems that you\nsaw without much effort whatsoever.\n\n292\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.990\nI just went over to,\nI Identify this 139 system.\n\n293\n00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.970\nI said, okay, fine, find attacks on it.\n\n294\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.700\nAnd it's went through and said okay,\nwell yeah, I found some stuff on it and\n\n295\n00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.900\nit brings up the attack menu.\n\n296\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.680\nWell, this one didn't because\nthat's my local system, but\n\n297\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.110\nit will go and\npull those things out pretty quickly.\n\n298\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.662\nSay it's almost cheating.\n\n299\n00:18:17.662 --> 00:18:19.519\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The way it's-\n\n300\n00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:22.165\n>> The way it's working smarter,\n\n301\n00:18:22.165 --> 00:18:24.420\nnot working harder right?\n\n302\n00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.280\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n303\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.160\nThat's what this tool is about.\n\n304\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:33.110\nThis tool is about just making you be\nable to work more efficiently, and\n\n305\n00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:39.000\nquicker and be able to visualize things\na lot easier too, I would add that.\n\n306\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.070\nYou really have not seen a lot\nof the visualization stuff yet.\n\n307\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.970\nI mean, you're seeing it of course, but\n\n308\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.100\nyou're not seeing\nthe full power of it yet.\n\n309\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.280\nAnd we're gonna get there, but we haven't\ngot there yet, but we are gonna get there.\n\n310\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.790\nSo we can see that we have,\nbe able to see what systems are which, and\n\n311\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.980\nstuff like that.\n\n312\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.770\nBut But\nthere's even more stuff on top of that.\n\n313\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.030\nBut so far,\nwhat else could you really ask for?\n\n314\n00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.910\nWe do have more stuff with exploits,\ntoo, I mean, that's where we're going.\n\n315\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.790\nRight now, when we wanna attack a system,\nlike I said,\n\n316\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.380\nwe just went through and\ndid a couple things, and\n\n317\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.120\nall of a sudden it found what the specific\nexploits were for it and what it could do.\n\n318\n00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.730\nBut we can go even further than that to\nhelp it find other stuff with exploits and\n\n319\n00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.430\nwhat to do with them.\n\n320\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.410\nIt's actually really, really,\nreally cool when you get to that part.\n\n321\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.510\nBut there's some downsides to\nthe other ways I'm gonna show you too.\n\n322\n00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:42.470\nYou gotta pay for everything somehow and\nwe've still gotta show that.\n\n323\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:43.620\nSo, there you go.\n\n324\n00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.220\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n325\n00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.240\nAll right, well very good look at really\nstarting to see what we can do with\n\n326\n00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.720\nArmitage, how it's leveraging\nMetasploit underneath, and the ability\n\n327\n00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.200\nto do those scans and filter those context\nmenus to give us exactly what we need.\n\n328\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.730\nWe don't have to thumb through\na whole big list of exploits or\n\n329\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.450\npayloads, it knows exactly\nwhich ones are gonna work.\n\n330\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.750\nIt's gonna put them right\nthere on the menu for you.\n\n331\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.180\nWhich is pretty darn sweet.\n\n332\n00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.500\nSo, Sean, I know we got more to do but\non this episode we're about out of time so\n\n333\n00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.560\nanything else you want\nto throw in on this one.\n\n334\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.520\n>> Not really.\n\n335\n00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.515\nI think I'll leave those to our next one.\n\n336\n00:20:19.515 --> 00:20:21.950\n>> [LAUGH] Get everybody up\non the edge of the couch.\n\n337\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.510\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.530\n>> Dying to see what the next episode is.\n\n339\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.840\nAll right, well I am too so\nwe'll go ahead and close this one out.\n\n340\n00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.710\nMake sure you tune in for\nthe next one, though.\n\n341\n00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.830\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n342\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.890\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n343\n00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.343\n>> And

00:00:16.600\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.370\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.600\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.100\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.400\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000\nExcited we got another\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.090\nAnd in this episode, we are going\nto continue our look at Armitage,\n\n10\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.030\nand Sean, we've already done\nsome pretty cool things with it.\n\n11\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.050\nAnd you're telling me\nwe've got more to do.\n\n12\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.720\n>> Yeah,\nwe definitely have more to do with it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.410\nWe've only gone a short distance\ndown the road with this,\n\n14\n00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.240\nso we kinda gotta move\ninto our next things.\n\n15\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.130\nSo what that's gonna be is,\n\n16\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.060\nthat's gonna be taking a look at doing\nother types of exploits on the system.\n\n17\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.455\nAs well as, where do you go if\nsome of these exploits don't work?\n\n18\n00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.075\nAt least the ones we've been seeing.\n\n19\n00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:05.075\nSo, what I've got up here on my screen is\nwe're doing our next little step here.\n\n20\n00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.775\nAnd what I've done between\nour last segment and\n\n21\n00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:11.880\nnow just to kind of push things\nthrough to the next bit.\n\n22\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640\nAs I've identified my other three\nsystems and they are all XP systems.\n\n23\n00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.440\nYou can see the one on the end has\nthe lightning bolts, everything around it,\n\n24\n00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.710\ntoo, that it says I've taken control\nof that system or at least have done\n\n25\n00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.400\nsomething with the system to indicate\nthat it's It's not protected anymore.\n\n26\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.080\nI've got a higher interaction with it.\n\n27\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.680\nWell, let's see what I've done.\n\n28\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.510\nWhat I can do is I can do my same\nattack menu like I did before.\n\n29\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.350\nAnd when I go through my attack menu,\n\n30\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.290\nyou can see that I have all\nmy little options on there.\n\n31\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.610\nI had this SMB menu on here, and\n\n32\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.550\nthis is that SMB tack\nthat we had run ourselves\n\n33\n00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.950\nearlier on in our other episodes,\nother segments.\n\n34\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.810\nSo this is just looking at\nit from a different angle.\n\n35\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.400\nSo I can go through this list and\ntake a look and\n\n36\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.310\nsee okay everything's already set, there's\nnothing I need to do at this point.\n\n37\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.300\nThis one does have the option of changing,\nyou can leave it as\n\n38\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.930\nautomatic targeting your you can change\nthe operating system if you want.\n\n39\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.180\nI'm gonna let it do its thing, and\n\n40\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.750\nI'll say it doesn't need to open reverse\nconnection or anything like that.\n\n41\n00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.800\nI'll say go ahead and\nopen up a reverse connection to me.\n\n42\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.110\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit launch.\n\n43\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.970\nAnd it goes through and\ndoes it's thing and boom.\n\n44\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.580\nThat's what we went through and\nwe saw earlier on in our explorations.\n\n45\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.040\nOkay, it's got that,\nwell what's the next thing to do?\n\n46\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.810\nWell, you guys probably\nknow what's coming on this.\n\n47\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.220\nSo, we just just go through and\nI've got my Meterpreter session.\n\n48\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.470\nAnd I've got my Meterpreter session,\n\n49\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.260\nI can just open up my Meterpreter\nshell and there you go.\n\n50\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640\nSo I should be able to go through and\ndo things like my LS, which I can.\n\n51\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.440\nI can do my shell command and\ndrop right out to the Windows prompt and\n\n52\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.340\ndo a directory in there.\n\n53\n00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.050\nSo I'm already going through and\nmoving through the system\n\n54\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.880\nand doing my thing to get\nit to do whatever I want.\n\n55\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.030\nSo that's very significant that\nI was able to get that far.\n\n56\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.890\nNow you can do definitely\nother things at this point.\n\n57\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.560\nIt's up to you if you\nwanna do other stuff.\n\n58\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.490\nSo let me kinda go over here.\n\n59\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.120\nSo there's my Meterpreter menu again.\n\n60\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.790\nI can type in all my Meterpreter\ncommands like I had previously.\n\n61\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.560\nI can do other stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.690\nYou'll see on some of these\nmenus from the Meterpreter\n\n63\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.140\nyou'll see it even has the stuff already\non our right click menu for there.\n\n64\n00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.320\nYou can see it even has\nthe stuff broken out for me.\n\n65\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.880\n>> Like it did with the steel token and\nthat kind of thing the other day.\n\n66\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.830\n>> Yeah and it even has additional things\nunderneath it that you may not even\n\n67\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.140\nthink of right away.\n\n68\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.940\nOne of the things you could do,\nlike this interact deal, I could say well,\n\n69\n00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.440\nI can see if I can push a VNC session onto\nit, and it will go ahead and try that.\n\n70\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.860\nSee if it can get a VNC session in here.\n\n71\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.480\nSo it's trying to do that.\n\n72\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.580\nAnd seeing if it can indeed do that sort\nof thing and it looks like, yeah, well it\n\n73\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.650\nis able to do something, so it's\n>> Impressive.\n\n74\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.630\n>> Yeah, you can do so much through this.\n\n75\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.273\nHere you can see you can browse file,\n\n76\n00:04:43.273 --> 00:04:45.830\nyou can go ahead start\nbrowsing files on there.\n\n77\n00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.230\nI can start listing processes on here.\n\n78\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.000\nJust so many things that you can do and\nvery quickly access through this menu.\n\n79\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.280\nYou can even do stuff,\nlike they have this past session on here.\n\n80\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.670\nYou can give the session or\ncontrol over to somebody else if you want.\n\n81\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.920\nSo if you are in that team\nenvironment say, hey, here you go.\n\n82\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.130\nIt's your turn.\n\n83\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.401\nAnd so\nthey got it set up to that did go to that\n\n84\n00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:15.100\nparticular level of access on here.\n\n85\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.410\nSo I mean, you choose what\nyou wanna do at this point.\n\n86\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.170\nI had the access,\n\n87\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.530\nwe saw the other, in one of our\nprevious sessions, just what we can do.\n\n88\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.510\nAll that stuff is accessible right here.\n\n89\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.880\nIs there anything else we can do?\n\n90\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.010\nWell, yeah, there's a bunch of things\nyou can do with Meterpreter and\n\n91\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.510\nstuff that we didn't even\nget a chance to show.\n\n92\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.600\nWe didn't show stuff like how\nto take over another process or\n\n93\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.980\nstart a process using\nsomeone else's token.\n\n94\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.130\nYou can do that,\nyou can do it really easy through here.\n\n95\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.680\nYou could raise your privileges.\n\n96\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.340\nYou can see it has Escalate Privileges\noption right there.\n\n97\n00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.180\nI could click on that, and\nbump it up to another level.\n\n98\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.980\nI got the stuff for\ncracking passwords in here.\n\n99\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.600\nI mean, if I go through that option,\n\n100\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.030\nyou have the ability to\nactually grab these types of,\n\n101\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.190\nto dump stuff right directly out\nof the registry or whatever.\n\n102\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.150\nI mean, so it's It's just,\nlike I said, it's too easy.\n\n103\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.168\nIt's really too easy.\n\n104\n00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:16.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n105\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.830\nwhen you really get down to it,\nI've really kinda got in there.\n\n106\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.010\nBut the question is when you do something\nlike that I've gotten that far,\n\n107\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.390\nand I'm able to get into a system and\ndo all this nastiness.\n\n108\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.420\nIt's like what happens\nif that didn't work.\n\n109\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.110\nThere are gonna be times when\nthis stuff isn't gonna work.\n\n110\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.000\nThis just happens to be in\nthe situation we have here set up for\n\n111\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.180\nus to work this way.\n\n112\n00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.560\nThis is an exploitable system.\n\n113\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.240\nBut what happens if you're poking around\nand doing this live in a real environment\n\n114\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.060\nand the exploit you chose,\nthis is a remote exploit.\n\n115\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.700\nWhat if that one doesn't work,\nyou wanna do something else?\n\n116\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.400\nWell, you are going to have to start going\nfrom targeting the operating system to\n\n117\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.460\ngoing after applications.\n\n118\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.670\nAnd that's where we start\ngoing after applications,\n\n119\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.930\nwe are starting to get pushed to\nwhat we call a client side attack.\n\n120\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.310\nNow a client side attack, to do that,\nwe have, under our Exploit menu,\n\n121\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.590\nyou can see it's got a lot of\nstuff under the Exploit menu.\n\n122\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.010\nI previously had opened\nup some more of this.\n\n123\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.910\nI'm gonna slide this over for\nus a bit here.\n\n124\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.750\nYou can see that I opened\nup the Windows menu.\n\n125\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.170\nAnd you can see the stuff\nit has listed out there.\n\n126\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.400\nIt has stuff like, and let me close\nthis browser one for right now.\n\n127\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.680\nYou can see as I scroll this down,\n\n128\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.610\nlook at the things it has available\nI can exploit on the client side.\n\n129\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.800\nIt's got back doors in some stuff,\nit's got anti-viruses.\n\n130\n00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.060\nI mean, which is kind of funny.\n\n131\n00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.802\nI mean that's, this thing's\nare supposed to defend you and\n\n132\n00:07:55.802 --> 00:07:57.320\nyou don't want to trigger them.\n\n133\n00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.817\nWe'll just go after them directly and\nknock them out from the get go and\n\n134\n00:08:00.817 --> 00:08:01.892\nthen do what we want.\n\n135\n00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:07.050\nThose things are already written for\nus and then we can see other things.\n\n136\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.030\nHere is some file format issues or\n\n137\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.820\nvulnerability in Adobe Flash and\nso on and so forth.\n\n138\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.970\nI mean, so a lot of different things in\nhere you can poke through all this, and\n\n139\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.030\nfind one that may be suited to\nwhat you are trying to accomplish.\n\n140\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.200\nSo that itself,\n\n141\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.740\nI think is, again, another thing that's\nimpressive when you go through it.\n\n142\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.940\nWe have just so\nmany there that we can hit.\n\n143\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.850\nThe one that I kind of point\nout when going through is,\n\n144\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.480\nis that you look at the browser based\nones, the one I had opened up, and\n\n145\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.360\nlook at all the stuff that is running\nin browsers that can be targeted.\n\n146\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.600\nWe have got a lot of Adobe Flash ones.\n\n147\n00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.290\n>> Of course.\n\n148\n00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.480\n>> Keep it to yourself.\n\n149\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.610\nI know what you guys are thinking.\n\n150\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.540\nWe have got a bunch of Adobe Flash ones.\n\n151\n00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.510\nWe've got some other ones in there,\nthere are some Apple ones in there.\n\n152\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.120\nThere's one for Autodesk,\nnot one you see all that often.\n\n153\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.750\nBut we got one in there for\none of their plugins.\n\n154\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.100\nAnd there's some Cisco.\n\n155\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.520\nI mean, just keep going through the list.\n\n156\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.330\nBut, as we go through,\nwhat starts popping up on here,\n\n157\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.080\nthere's some IE, well you know ones.\n\n158\n00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.452\nI should have had you guys sit down for\nthat.\n\n159\n00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:21.345\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n160\n00:09:21.345 --> 00:09:22.790\n>> Sorry.\n>> I can't believe it.\n\n161\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So you can go through and\n\n162\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.460\npick an exploit off the menu and\nsee if that is something that's\n\n163\n00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.550\ngoing to work on that particular system.\n\n164\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:43.000\nIn this case I chose this IECrate object,\nand I can do a launch and\n\n165\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.360\nsee if that's actually gonna work, and\nyou can see it's running doing it's thing.\n\n166\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.320\nAnd doesn't look like we\ngot much out of that,\n\n167\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.960\nlet's see if anything new popped up here.\n\n168\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.150\nDoesn't look like anything new\nreally popped up to do with that.\n\n169\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.170\nBut, we can try different,\nyou know, things in here,\n\n170\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.470\nto see if we get any mileage.\n\n171\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.770\nSome of these exploits, like that,\n\n172\n00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.420\nwant to create object,\nisn't one that I've really used.\n\n173\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.700\nSo I'm maybe missing an option here, but\n\n174\n00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.490\nthe point is that you can go through and\nsee if you scanned the system, or\n\n175\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.220\nif you know about the environment,\nor things that might be there.\n\n176\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.220\nYou can try some of these different\nexploits to see if you think that they\n\n177\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.040\nwill get you somewhere.\n\n178\n00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.830\nAnd if you really kinda think about it and\ntry things\n\n179\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.300\nout you might get mileage there where you\nwouldn't normally get it another way.\n\n180\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.780\nAll the stuff that we've really been\ndoing so far have been services and\n\n181\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.550\nthings that have been installed\nat the operating system.\n\n182\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.260\nWell things are changing that landscape.\n\n183\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.500\nWe can sit here and\nmake jokes about Microsoft and\n\n184\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.040\nwe have, but it's all in good fun and\nall that, but\n\n185\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.940\nthe reality is that and doing things\nlike some of these remote code exploits.\n\n186\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:07.070\nMicrosoft has cleaned house and put things\nin order, and while they do still have\n\n187\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.250\nsome places where remote code exploits\nhappen they've kind of been Reduce.\n\n188\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.580\nThey've kind of learned some\nlessons there, so they're not as\n\n189\n00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.770\neasy to do those as we used to, so you\nmight have to go to a client-side exploit.\n\n190\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.910\nBut again,\n\n191\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.420\nyou could have a client that's got\na bunch of XP systems sitting out there,\n\n192\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.110\nand then that's an older system, it might\nbe vulnerable to some of these things.\n\n193\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.990\nSo, you've got to be aware of some of the\ndifferent options that might be available.\n\n194\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.900\n>> Yeah, we laugh sometimes\nwhen we talk about well,\n\n195\n00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.350\nwho's really running XP anymore?\n\n196\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.510\nAnd I was just talking to somebody\nthe other day about their network.\n\n197\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.450\nAnd they've got some old scanners that\nthey love, that do a great job, and\n\n198\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.260\nthey don't wanna get rid of them.\n\n199\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.890\nAnd the only thing they can\nrun them off is an XP box.\n\n200\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.690\nSo on their network there's at\nleast five XP boxes sitting there\n\n201\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.050\njust to support these old\nscanners that they still have.\n\n202\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.580\nSo we laugh and we tease but\nthey are still out there.\n\n203\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.030\n>> Yeah.\nYou can't underestimate\n\n204\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.420\nthe number of people that have these\nthings in the office, these older systems.\n\n205\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.740\nJust because they're end-of-life\n\n206\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.460\ndoesn't mean that something\nis gonna get rid off them.\n\n207\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.090\n>> Right.\n>> They could very well still be\n\n208\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.580\nout there and still just burn along.\n\n209\n00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.795\nIn fact, one of the industries\nthat does have a lot of them.\n\n210\n00:12:19.795 --> 00:12:22.595\nAnd I don't know if we have\nanybody in that industry.\n\n211\n00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.665\nBut the banking industry\nstill runs a lot of XP,\n\n212\n00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:28.725\nbecause XP is ran at the back\nend of a lot of ATMs.\n\n213\n00:12:28.725 --> 00:12:32.772\nAnd so, you've got those\nsystems Supporting XP now.\n\n214\n00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:34.932\nGranted those are embedded systems,\n\n215\n00:12:34.932 --> 00:12:39.272\nthose embedded systems still\nare being supported by Microsoft.\n\n216\n00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:42.292\nAnd Microsoft has still does updates and\n\n217\n00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:46.910\nstuff like that for those imbedded\nXP systems that are still out there.\n\n218\n00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.190\nBut those are different\nthan the ones that you or\n\n219\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.460\nI would have on something like\na notebook or anything like that.\n\n220\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.500\nThose systems still do exist.\n\n221\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.470\nYou never know where you're\ngoing to run into those things.\n\n222\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.630\nI mean heck, if you really get down to it,\nI was talking to a friend not too long ago\n\n223\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.810\nand OS2 is still out there and\nin a few places.\n\n224\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.055\nAnd you will see that\nrunning in a few utilities,\n\n225\n00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:17.555\na few different public utilities\naround the world use it.\n\n226\n00:13:17.555 --> 00:13:20.225\nAnd there's some countries that their ATM\n\n227\n00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:24.375\nsystems within that country\nare running OS2 and OS2 Warp.\n\n228\n00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.185\nSo they still have those out there.\n\n229\n00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:33.055\nSo just FYI, you never know what\nliterally could be out there or\n\n230\n00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.915\neven what someone's\nrunning on top of that.\n\n231\n00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:36.760\nYou just don't know.\n\n232\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.480\nAnd then all it takes is one, right?\n\n233\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.020\nI mean, if we can find that one\nsystem that becomes our entry way\n\n234\n00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.650\ninto the network.\n\n235\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.540\nAnd then from there,\nwe can always branch out.\n\n236\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.770\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n237\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.930\nAnd that really is it.\n\n238\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:52.280\nThat's some place where we are heading is,\nI don't need to.\n\n239\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.470\nIf you have a bunch of computers on your\nnetwork, I don't need to breach them all.\n\n240\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.270\nI only need one to get in.\n\n241\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:05.380\nOnce I've got that opportunity to make\nit in, and gotten over the wall and\n\n242\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.500\ninside, now the game changes, and so,\nI can do other things at that point.\n\n243\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.560\nSo, if you get stuck with one system,\nif you've been quiet enough and\n\n244\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.440\ncareful enough, then you can move over to\nother ones, and see what you can push out\n\n245\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.050\nthere and poke around to get to where\nyou want, to where you want to be.\n\n246\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.760\nSo if remote exploit doesnt work,\nyou could move to a client side,\n\n247\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.910\nif client side doesn't work you\ncould try other things maybe.\n\n248\n00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.990\nThat social engineering stuff we looked at\nin a previous segment or it's maybe just\n\n249\n00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.410\nmoving over to another system entirely,\nand seeing what you can get there.\n\n250\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.810\nSo you have all these different options.\n\n251\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:48.770\nAnd heck, just to point it out, when we\nlooked at the social engineering toolkit,\n\n252\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.720\nthose things in there, you saw a lot of\nclient side exploits sitting in there,\n\n253\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.560\nbecause we are designing email after all.\n\n254\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.670\nWe're cracking it.\n\n255\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.360\nWhose getting at the client.\n\n256\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.100\nSo the client's gonna click on\nsomething and it's gonna try\n\n257\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.510\nto exploit something on their system to\nsee if it can get any traction there.\n\n258\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.630\nSo that just to get you\nto remember those things.\n\n259\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.670\nThat they're plenty of ways that you can.\n\n260\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:18.130\nGet into a system, and\nget someplace from there.\n\n261\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.400\nSo it's actually quite fascinating,\nespecially when you start going through\n\n262\n00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.130\nthe things that,\nMetasploit makes available to you.\n\n263\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.830\nEspecially on the client side,\nwhen you start poking through,\n\n264\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.620\nyou can see all the different\napplications that you can hit.\n\n265\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.810\nAnd we should also point out when we're\ndoing this that when you say client side\n\n266\n00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:38.430\nit doesn't necessarily have to be\nclient in the traditional sense like\n\n267\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.780\na desktop user.\n\n268\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:46.600\nWe actually can target stuff like database\nlike SQL, and Oracle, and stuff like that.\n\n269\n00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.770\nAnd those probably aren't going\nto running on the desktop.\n\n270\n00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.130\nAnd you can do it for development process\nand some people do when they're developing\n\n271\n00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.180\nand there are some applications\nthat run that for whatever reason.\n\n272\n00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.580\nBut more than likely, the big boy is going\nto be sitting on a server some place and\n\n273\n00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.270\nwe can hit that application running\non a server And use that to get in.\n\n274\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:12.450\nSo there are other possibilities\nout there to get in.\n\n275\n00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.290\nThat's what we are really\ntrying to emphasize.\n\n276\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.040\nBut if run exploit doesn't work\nthen switch to a client side.\n\n277\n00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.710\nJust remember that and you go from there.\n\n278\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.250\n>> Right.\nSo\n\n279\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.080\na client side doesn't mean\nclient operating system.\n\n280\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.810\nIt just means the other side,\nthe one we are trying to compromise.\n\n281\n00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.750\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n282\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.370\nJust as you're moving from\none side to the other.\n\n283\n00:16:35.002 --> 00:16:41.260\nSo we've got that going, so\nwe looked at how quick and\n\n284\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.590\neasy it was to run an exploit against\nthat same Windows system that we did our\n\n285\n00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.200\nMeterpreter exercise\nin our previous shows.\n\n286\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.850\nWell now, what else can we do?\n\n287\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.280\nYou know, we found out how easy it was\nto do that, is there any way that I can\n\n288\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.250\nfind out, find all the various\nways I can attack a system?\n\n289\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.830\nAnd just make it maybe, easier on myself,\nbe a little lazy about it.\n\n290\n00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.380\nWell of course they got that covered too.\n\n291\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:17.910\nSo the question is,\nhow do we accomplish that particular task?\n\n292\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.500\nWell, let's see how we do that.\n\n293\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.180\nLet's take a look at another way we\ncan find ways to exploit a system.\n\n294\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.950\nNow, if you go to the attacks menu,\n\n295\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:32.300\nyou notice right there it's\ngot the Hail Mary option, so.\n\n296\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.280\nI had to look that up.\n\n297\n00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.510\nI seriously had to look that up.\n\n298\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.260\nIt's a football reference, ain't it?\n\n299\n00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.510\nI don't know.\n>> Maybe, I don't know exactly.\n\n300\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.525\n>> Someone my size does not play football.\n\n301\n00:17:42.525 --> 00:17:45.105\n>> [LAUGH] You run everybody-\n>> We're called a speed bump.\n\n302\n00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> For American football,\n\n303\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.990\nwhen you run everybody down to\nthe other end of the field.\n\n304\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.540\nAnd you just throw the ball up there and\n\n305\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.450\nhope somebody catches it\nwith a few seconds left.\n\n306\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.915\nSo that's your last-ditch effort,\nyour Hail Mary.\n\n307\n00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:58.535\n[LAUGH] You're just praying\nsomething good happens.\n\n308\n00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:05.090\n>> [LAUGH] I was like, what is that now?\n\n309\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:11.350\nSo we know what that is, so how do we\ngo through and take advantage of that,\n\n310\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.700\nour hail Marys, we're throwing\neverything at it to see what sticks?\n\n311\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.790\nWell I've got this system out here,\nI've got this 131 system sitting out here.\n\n312\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.730\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndo under tax and Hail Mary.\n\n313\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.270\nAnd it's gonna try everything.\n\n314\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.570\nAnd it's kinda funny if you\nreally read this dialog.\n\n315\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:34.430\nI don't know if everyone can see it, but\nI'll read it really quickly for you.\n\n316\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.520\nIt says, once started,\nthe Hail Mary will launch a flood of\n\n317\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.170\nexploits at hosts in\nthe current workspace.\n\n318\n00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.800\nThere is nothing stealthy\nabout this action.\n\n319\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.350\nIf clumsily launching hundreds of exploits\nis what you'd like to do, press yes.\n\n320\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.230\nSo it's telling you hey,\nhere's what's going to happen and\n\n321\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.880\nif you threw Wireshark or something else\non there it does indeed just go nuts.\n\n322\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.420\nYou are doing everything\nyou can to get in, so\n\n323\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.990\nunless someone's really asleep, or\nat the wheel, they're gonna see this.\n\n324\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.695\nI even like the way it puts at the top,\nReally???\n\n325\n00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:12.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in any case, if you hit yes,\n\n326\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.380\nit literally just does whatever you want.\n\n327\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.300\nI'm sitting here and\n\n328\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.080\nit's gonna go ahead and do stuff, and\nheck if you look at the back tab in there,\n\n329\n00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.860\nI don't know if you guys can read that,\nmaybe we can zoom that up.\n\n330\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.000\nIt just shows you.\n\n331\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000\nI like the developer's\nsense of humor on there.\n\n332\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.920\nIt says Hail Mary.\n\n333\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.695\nIt says, finding exploits via local magic.\n\n334\n00:19:30.695 --> 00:19:32.136\n>> [LAUGH] Local magic, nice.\n\n335\n00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:34.640\n>> [LAUGH] So, that's scrolled off.\n\n336\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.630\nI mean, look at what it's doing.\n\n337\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.530\nLook at just, you can see it right there.\n\n338\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.570\nIt's throwing I'm gonna say everything and\n\n339\n00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.350\nthe kitchen sink added,\ncuz it's just gonna go.\n\n340\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:52.250\nThis is a horrible amount of noise going\non on that specific network right now.\n\n341\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.290\nIt's just going right across the board.\n\n342\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:20:02.680\nIn fact, if you look at the IP address\non there, it's just hitting everything.\n\n343\n00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.470\nAll the hosts on there to see what attacks\nare available against all the hosts.\n\n344\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.590\nSo you can see it's going down\nthe different ports in sequence, and\n\n345\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.270\nis going through the IP\naddresses in sequence.\n\n346\n00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:20.530\nSo it's going pretty quickly through it,\nwhen you consider all that.\n\n347\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.930\nBut someone here, if they think\nthey're under assault, they're putting\n\n348\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.995\ntheir helmets on and their Kevlar vests,\neverything on, going what's happening?\n\n349\n00:20:30.995 --> 00:20:34.760\n>> A couple people just walked\nin the front door with masks and\n\n350\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.625\nAK-47s strapped to them, and\ngrenade belts and extra clips, and\n\n351\n00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:41.380\nyou know what's going on at this point,\nright?\n\n352\n00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.160\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I would hope you would\npick that up and you're not just like,\n\n353\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.565\noh okay, what just happened?\n\n354\n00:20:46.565 --> 00:20:47.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n355\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.990\nit's just ran a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n356\n00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.570\nAnd it's gonna say, well okay,\nthese are the attacks that it found.\n\n357\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.490\nSo realistically now,\nif you go through these hosts,\n\n358\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.210\nit should be able to start\nshowing you various attacks, and\n\n359\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.030\nstuff like that, that you can do\nagainst these various systems.\n\n360\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.010\nAnd you can see there's still\na little more stuff going\n\n361\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.140\non down there at the bottom.\n\n362\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.200\nIt's still doing some things, but yeah.\n\n363\n00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.630\nI mean, it's very clumsy,\n\n364\n00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.515\nit's very loud and\nit's a type of attack and\n\n365\n00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:25.385\nit's not something you'd wanna\ndo as a regular practice.\n\n366\n00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:29.601\nDoing this as a regular practice would\nbe just really bad form and really lazy.\n\n367\n00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:34.395\nI mean it's pretty\n\n368\n00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:38.915\nmuch something you would do on\na test network like this, as a goof.\n\n369\n00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:42.185\nYou're just kind of like,\nwatch this, you're doing that.\n\n370\n00:21:42.185 --> 00:21:44.590\n>> Maybe you're testing your\nintrusion detection, or\n\n371\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.050\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n372\n00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.630\nI don't know.\nIt reminds me of like a smash and\n\n373\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.390\ngrab maybe.\n\n374\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.760\nI know we're supposed to\ndo things with permission,\n\n375\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.050\nso probably not the most\nappropriate choice for us.\n\n376\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:55.648\n>> Yeah, whatever.\n\n377\n00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:59.046\n>> [LAUGH] But in a test environment\nyou might as well see what happens.\n\n378\n00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:03.900\n>> Yeah, it does the trick, but yeah.\n\n379\n00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.040\nThere's just so\nmany things going on at that point that\n\n380\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.050\nany hope of being stealthy has\npretty much gone out the window.\n\n381\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:16.630\nThere's still a small chance\nthat you haven't been caught,\n\n382\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.540\nbut it's gone from being a very reasonable\nchance of not being caught if you've\n\n383\n00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.290\nbeen careful, to just diminishing\nalmost to nothing, to nil.\n\n384\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:30.910\nSo not a smart move to do this\nas you're opening a move.\n\n385\n00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.710\nYou might get away with\nthis on a white box test,\n\n386\n00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.710\nwhen you're doing this just\nthen know you're there.\n\n387\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.740\nAnd you do it after hours or\nsomething, maybe.\n\n388\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.480\nBut I would not do this as a normal\n\n389\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:51.570\npractice because it's just way too\nnoisy like a black box environment.\n\n390\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.390\nAlso keep in mind doing this that there is\na chance some of the stuff I had while I\n\n391\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:01.667\nwas looking around on\nthis Hail Mary function,\n\n392\n00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:05.600\nseemed like some people indicated\nthat when sending this many\n\n393\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.960\nprobes out to systems and poking around,\nsome systems that may have been a little\n\n394\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.630\nunstable I guess maybe they\nfell over just by doing this.\n\n395\n00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.770\nYou bumped them off just by probing\nthem enough in rapid succession doing\n\n396\n00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.500\nall of this and they actually\ncouldn't handle this and fell over.\n\n397\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.380\nSo there is that.\n\n398\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.840\nAnd we do know that.\n\n399\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.710\nWe mentioned that in our CEH course.\n\n400\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.960\nWe were mentioning the fact that\npen testing, by its very nature,\n\n401\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.560\nruns the risk of bumping something off,\nof causing harm.\n\n402\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.780\nSo your client has to be the person\nyou have this contract with,\n\n403\n00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.990\nneeds to be aware of that.\n\n404\n00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.010\nThis isn't something\nthat's completely safe and\n\n405\n00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.900\nthere's not going to be any danger from\nit just because you're a good guy.\n\n406\n00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.113\nNo there very well could be damage and\nthis is something that could also do that.\n\n407\n00:23:59.113 --> 00:24:00.883\nYou could very well using this tool.\n\n408\n00:24:00.883 --> 00:24:06.550\nCause some sort of damage or problem and\nthen you've got to go and fix that.\n\n409\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.850\nYou may not have even run\nan exploit at that point.\n\n410\n00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.580\nYou just found what exploits will work,\nand all of a sudden just boom.\n\n411\n00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.350\nIt's, something fell over,\n\n412\n00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.920\ngot destroyed and now they're\nlooking at you going, what'd you do?\n\n413\n00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.960\nSo, just be aware of that little\ndetail on there, as well.\n\n414\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.170\nBut, yeah, we ran it,\nwe swept all five of our hosts on here.\n\n415\n00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.035\nYou saw the stuff just go shooting by and\n\n416\n00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:34.775\ntell us that hey,\nI found some stuff that works and so\n\n417\n00:24:34.775 --> 00:24:38.675\nwe could actually go through and try some\nof those now if we really wanted to.\n\n418\n00:24:38.675 --> 00:24:39.725\n>> Fantastic, all right.\n\n419\n00:24:39.725 --> 00:24:44.275\nWell another great look at Armitage and\nwhat we can do with that.\n\n420\n00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:47.845\nThis time, a little more focused\non the client side exploits and\n\n421\n00:24:47.845 --> 00:24:49.285\nsome of the payloads we can deliver there.\n\n422\n00:24:49.285 --> 00:24:51.215\nAnd then of course everybody's favorite,\nor\n\n423\n00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:52.950\nat least my favorite so\nfar, The Hail Mary.\n\n424\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.220\nJust take everything you've got and\nthrow it out.\n\n425\n00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.990\n[LAUGH] Something's gotta stick, right?\n\n426\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.320\nWho cares about alarms?\n\n427\n00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.630\nWe're not worried about that.\n\n428\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n429\n00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.590\n>> All right, well,\nSean, lot of good info.\n\n430\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.750\nAnything else we want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n431\n00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.380\n>> Let me just emphasize the point to\nkinda boil a lot of this stuff away.\n\n432\n00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.580\nYou know, since we were just talking\nabout the Hail Mary stuff, but.\n\n433\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.630\nMake sure you're aware of the fact that,\njust because you can't get\n\n434\n00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.500\na remote exploit going on a system, it\ndoesn't mean that's the end of the road.\n\n435\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:30.570\nYou still have those client side attacks\nto try, and see where that gets you.\n\n436\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:36.640\nCuz that may get you some movement,\nwhere the other ones will not.\n\n437\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.540\nSo just be aware that\npeople have gotten smarter.\n\n438\n00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.780\nSystem admins have gotten smarter.\n\n439\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.250\nIT people have gotten smarter, and we have\na lot more tools that help us do patch\n\n440\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.250\nmanagement and all that type of stuff.\n\n441\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:54.220\nThat have raised the bar on things and\nmade it a little bit more difficult for\n\n442\n00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.860\nsome of this stuff to work, the normal\nexploits that we've seen to work.\n\n443\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.860\nSo you might need to\nresort to something else.\n\n444\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.690\nBut that's actually good that we\nhave the ability to switch over,\n\n445\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.080\neven in regular Metasploit.\n\n446\n00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.340\nYou could have done\nthe clients at exploits,\n\n447\n00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.040\nyou could do those in regular Metasploit.\n\n448\n00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.270\nWe just didn't do them over there,\nbecause it's just more going use and\n\n449\n00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.190\nall those things for\nshowing that we did for remote code stuff.\n\n450\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.730\nIt's the same type of thing.\n\n451\n00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.300\nThey're configured just a little\nslightly differently because it is on\n\n452\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.470\nthe client side.\n\n453\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.390\nBut it's just more kind of\nthe same type of thing.\n\n454\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.100\nBut this was just kinda just to tell you,\nI saved them to this point just to kinda\n\n455\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.830\ntell you hey, not only can\nArmitage do something like that,\n\n456\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.900\nMetasploit itself because Armitage\nis running Metasploit for you.\n\n457\n00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:41.020\nYou can do that right through Metasploit\nand it's another avenue of attack.\n\n458\n00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.770\nSo you, do have these options.\n\n459\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.810\nIf one doesn't work,\nyou can switch over to another one.\n\n460\n00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.490\nIt gives you flexibility.\n\n461\n00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.240\nVery good.\n\n462\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.630\nAll right and I know what I've done\nSean and we've got more to do.\n\n463\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.500\nWe want to take a look at, and\nonce we've done those exploits,\n\n464\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.140\nmaybe the next step or\nwhat we can do once we've.\n\n465\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.250\nI can't think of a good way to say it,\n\n466\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.390\nonce we've done one of these\nexploits on those machines.\n\n467\n00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.640\nSo, but\nthat's going to come up in later episode.\n\n468\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.693\nSo for now signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n469\n00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.814\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n470\n00:27:09.814 --> 00:27:11.201\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n471\n00:27:11.201 --> 00:27:17.080\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.020\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.160\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.520\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.760\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.010\nExcited, because we've got another episode\nin our Metasploit series coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.940\nAnd Sean,\nwe've been playing with Armitage.\n\n9\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.730\nAnd we've seen how we could get\nit all set up, get it connected.\n\n10\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580\nWe've actually found some hosts.\n\n11\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.820\nWe even launched some exploits.\n\n12\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.000\n[LAUGH] I think at the end of that\nlast one, we threw our hail Mary, and\n\n13\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080\nwe launched everything and the kitchen\nsink, as you said, at that machine,\n\n14\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.400\nand not worried about setting off\nany alarms or anything like that.\n\n15\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.903\nSo a lot of fun,\na really powerful tool, I mean,\n\n16\n00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:49.640\nit's Metasploit with a nice GUI front end.\n\n17\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.090\nSo right-click,\ncontact sensitive right-click menus.\n\n18\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.110\nFantastic stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.220\nBut as you say,\nwe're not done with it yet.\n\n20\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.570\nWe've got more that we\ncan do with this thing.\n\n21\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.510\n>> Yeah, there's plenty more.\n\n22\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.935\nWe keep saying that, or along the way,\nsaying yeah, there's more,\n\n23\n00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:06.960\nthere's more and there just really is.\n\n24\n00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.624\nIt's like the gift that keeps on giving,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:14.910\n[LAUGH] There's so much here and\nsome of the stuff we're doing,\n\n26\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.180\na lot of stuff we've done with a new\nnotable exceptions has been stuff that\n\n27\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.020\nwe've seen just by doing it manually but\nwe are doing of course with the GUI and\n\n28\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.070\nautomating it and making it much simpler\nthan it would have been otherwise.\n\n29\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.840\nSo we've got that, but\nthat we've got new stuff, but\n\n30\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.880\nwe're using some of the old stuff,\nbut looking at it a different way.\n\n31\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.860\nSo that's kind of what we're going\nto be doing here is after we've\n\n32\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.745\nexploited the system had gained access,\nwhat can you do at that point?\n\n33\n00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:48.905\nSo that's really the big question\nis what can you do at that point?\n\n34\n00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:53.875\nI think we kind of gotta handle on what we\ncan do from our previous explorations, but\n\n35\n00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:59.915\nwe just kinda want to revisit that and\nput an armitage spin on it and\n\n36\n00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:03.150\nsee what that means and\nsee just how easy it is.\n\n37\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.890\nAnd so that's what we're getting into.\n\n38\n00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.570\n>> Nice.\n\n39\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.800\nAll right so where do we go next?\n\n40\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.740\nWe've already seen some pretty cool\nexploits, what's on the table for\n\n41\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.740\nour next step?\n\n42\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.465\n>> Well what we're gonna do here is we are\ngoing to explore using the Meterpreter,\n\n43\n00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:25.505\nwe're gonna revisit that.\n\n44\n00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:28.415\nI showed you when we did\nit on our previous segment,\n\n45\n00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.765\nshowed you that the Meterpreter\nis pretty easy to access.\n\n46\n00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:36.065\nIt's just a matter of just telling it\nhey I wanna shell grab Meterpreter and\n\n47\n00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:40.470\nall the sudden boom, it's right there and\nit's awaiting your command.\n\n48\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.360\nWell, now we're going to see what\nwe can really do at this point, and\n\n49\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.060\nhow easy is it,\nwhat are the things that can't be done.\n\n50\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.320\nSo we're going to see that, we're going\nto use some of these functions, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.930\nwe'll really, hopefully,\nget us a better handle on these things.\n\n52\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.090\nAnd so, let's see what we got.\n\n53\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.270\nWithout further ado,\nlet's see what's going on.\n\n54\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.970\n>> Let's do it.\n\n55\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.232\n>> What we have here on-screen is,\nwe have back in Armitage,\n\n56\n00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:13.920\nwe are looking at our systems up top and\nall that good stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.130\nAnd what I've done for us is, I've\nalready launched the Meterpreter for us.\n\n58\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.560\nSo, you can see that down at\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n59\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.680\nYou can see that the Meterpreter is open.\n\n60\n00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.040\nI did a quick listing of\nwhat's there just to confirm\n\n61\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250\nthat we do have that connection, and\nthere's other ways to confirm it.\n\n62\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.350\nThat's just my initial thing to do and\nin a lot of cases I'll\n\n63\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.130\njust do a quick directory listing but\nyou don't always have to do that.\n\n64\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.710\nSo I can see that I've got that\nconnection, I can just go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.300\nI'll make sure it's still alive\nhere by doing the same deal.\n\n66\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.630\nAnd, yep, its still alive.\n\n67\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.180\nAnd those connections will idle\nloud after a while, by the way.\n\n68\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.180\nIf you are playing around with one,\n\n69\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.020\nyou kind of flip between these systems\nthat are doing things, or you get\n\n70\n00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.790\ncalled away or something, it could very\nwell idle out and you have to relaunch it.\n\n71\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.370\nYou know, so just FYI.\n\n72\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.430\nAlright.\nSo we've got the Meterpreter session open,\n\n73\n00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.670\nso that's really good for us.\n\n74\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.370\nWell, now we wanna see\nwhat we can start doing.\n\n75\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.280\nAnd like I said,\nsome of this stuff we've already seen but\n\n76\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.310\nwe are gonna just see how easy it is\nto do this right through Armitage.\n\n77\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.635\nSo, what I showed you before was I\nwent up to my top pane on there and\n\n78\n00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:40.000\nI right-clicked on my window,\n\n79\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.949\nor on my object and\nit brought out this little menu here.\n\n80\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.560\nNow, I can do it that way for sure, but\nI can also go down to the bottom here and\n\n81\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.710\nright click and\nit brings up the menu there too.\n\n82\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.740\nSo, you don't have to right click on that,\njust FYI.\n\n83\n00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.190\nSo, if you want to make it easy\non yourself, it's got that too.\n\n84\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.100\n>> That's convenient.\n\n85\n00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.350\n>> Yeah, it really is.\n\n86\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.450\nAgain, it's a really good, it's a nice\nfeature, nice way they organized it.\n\n87\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.290\nAnd so that really just, kinda helps\nyou out, speed up this process.\n\n88\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.900\nYou know, so I've got, you know,\nmy stuff sitting out here.\n\n89\n00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.130\nI am looking at, you know,\nmy various options.\n\n90\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.160\nYou know, so,\nwe're gonna start looking at, well,\n\n91\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.210\nwhat would we want to do at this point,\nonce we've gained access.\n\n92\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.880\nWell, when we looked at it yesterday,\n\n93\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.640\nwe were just running\nsome different functions.\n\n94\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.220\nThat was really, kinda the purpose of it.\n\n95\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.170\nOnce we got an Meterpreter, I was kind of\njust showing you different things that you\n\n96\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.130\ncould possibly do to, you know, once\nyou have that pipeline into the system.\n\n97\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.420\nBut, let's kind of explore this now\nthat we've got an easier way to do it,\n\n98\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.150\ninstead of just focusing on typing the\ncommands in and playing around with it.\n\n99\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.940\nLet's just kinda take a closer look at\nsome of these things and re-visit them,\n\n100\n00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.650\nas the case may be.\n\n101\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.850\nWell, one of the things we did\nyesterday was we got in and\n\n102\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.450\nwe tried to, for example,\nget password information.\n\n103\n00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.850\nWell, password information,\n\n104\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.540\nyou can do that just by going\nover here to Dump Hashes and\n\n105\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.810\nyou can dump the actual\nSAN database right here.\n\n106\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.740\nIf you see, I did it in one quick shot.\n\n107\n00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.980\nIt opened up another tab.\n\n108\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.240\nAnd I can see right here it even went to\nthe step of formatting the stuff for me,\n\n109\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.290\nand lining it up kind of nicely.\n\n110\n00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.650\nWell, it's not really aggressive\nformatting, where it went through and\n\n111\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.960\ndid all this nice,\npretty it up type stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.010\nBut you can see it's\npulled it right there.\n\n113\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.520\nThere's my hashes,\nonce again, my accounts.\n\n114\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.320\nSo I can go through and look at\nthat pretty quickly and easily, and\n\n115\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.420\nsee what I want to do here.\n\n116\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.730\nDo I wanna copy some of these hashes out?\n\n117\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.260\nMaybe take them some\nplace else to be broken?\n\n118\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.830\nYou could do that sort of thing, so\nthat's a kind of cool thing, but\n\n119\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.790\nwe went ahead and did that.\n\n120\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.800\nAlso notice, and\n\n121\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.890\nI'm gonna close those hashes for right\nnow cuz we don't really need that open.\n\n122\n00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.160\nAlso notice, when you are doing this,\n\n123\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.560\nthat when you dump hashes you\nhave other ways of doing it.\n\n124\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.050\nYou have stuff where you can just\ndump it out of the registry.\n\n125\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.510\nHere you can see it's actually going\nthrough the registry itself and\n\n126\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.540\nseeing what it can find.\n\n127\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.900\nAnd take a look at that really.\n\n128\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.940\nIt went into the registry and went to\nsee if it can retrieve that information.\n\n129\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.160\nAnd indeed it did.\n\n130\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.230\nIt's got that account\ninformation right there.\n\n131\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.230\nSo, we got that way, too.\n\n132\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.584\nSo and\nthen let's take a look at the other way,\n\n133\n00:07:41.584 --> 00:07:45.460\njust quickly,\nthat we can use to get hashes out of it.\n\n134\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.050\nWe have this other way, that we can do,\nby launch this, as we'll try it out,\n\n135\n00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.522\nalso, grab additional information for\nus, and you can see,\n\n136\n00:07:55.522 --> 00:08:00.682\nthis one's probably the clearest one\nof all of it, What this one does,\n\n137\n00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:05.498\nyou can see it pulled out,\nit didn't actually give us the full-on\n\n138\n00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:10.550\ntreatment like the other one did\nwith the hashes and everything.\n\n139\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:16.002\nBut this one did actually [LAUGH] really\nquickly put out the password right there.\n\n140\n00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:18.823\nI mean, you can't get any\nclearer than that, really.\n\n141\n00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:21.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like, hey, what's the password?\n\n142\n00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:23.885\nOh, well, look, it's right there, I didn't\neven have to take that any place else,\n\n143\n00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:26.255\nit just went through and\nretrieved it and said here you go.\n\n144\n00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:30.915\nSo, that's pretty darn cool,\nI would think.\n\n145\n00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:35.827\nSo, you're doing a lot of stuff at\nthis point, and it is possible to,\n\n146\n00:08:35.827 --> 00:08:40.009\nand this is something that we'll\nlook at a little later on.\n\n147\n00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:42.067\nIt actually is possible to\nget some of the stuff and\n\n148\n00:08:42.067 --> 00:08:44.328\ntake it over to other password\ncracking programs too.\n\n149\n00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:48.391\nSo if you need to do that,\nyou definitely can do that.\n\n150\n00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:55.540\nBut that's just one thing we would do,\nis we would try to obtain passwords.\n\n151\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.710\nIf we hadn't already gotten those,\nwe would try to get those.\n\n152\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.290\nBut you don't have to do that,\nthat's just one possibility.\n\n153\n00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.770\nYou could also do things like we\ntalked about escalating privileges.\n\n154\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.397\nWell, yesterday we went ahead and\nwe had a command for\n\n155\n00:09:10.397 --> 00:09:12.664\nthat where you typed get system.\n\n156\n00:09:12.664 --> 00:09:18.087\nThis one, you can pretty much do\nthe same type of thing just by saying\n\n157\n00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:24.440\nescalate privileges off of it,\nit will bump up your level, if it can.\n\n158\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.180\nI happen to already have that so\n\n159\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.510\nthere's really [LAUGH] no place for\nme to go up further on that.\n\n160\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.150\nAnd you can tell by the way up top,\n\n161\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.430\nif you look at the system that's been\ncompromised, you can see what it says.\n\n162\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.060\nIt says NT authority and it says /system.\n\n163\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.470\nIt's already got that,\nin fact I should be able to,\n\n164\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.220\nif I typed get uid at the command line.\n\n165\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:53.126\nIt's telling me that yeah, you've\nalready got some level of access there.\n\n166\n00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:58.133\nBut anyway, so we've got that going on so\n\n167\n00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:02.146\nyou could escalate privileges.\n\n168\n00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:06.127\nBut there are other deals that you can do.\n\n169\n00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:12.280\nThis is one that you can use to,\nthey call this the Pass Session.\n\n170\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.739\nWhat you can do is you can,\ntake the session and\n\n171\n00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:18.252\nmove it over to another process.\n\n172\n00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:21.940\nIn fact, the description up top,\nif you take a look at it, it says what\n\n173\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.975\nit's what gonna do, it says inject\na payload in the memory of a process.\n\n174\n00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:31.750\nAnd what it's gonna do, is it's gonna\nopen up another Meterpreter thing,\n\n175\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.790\nbut it's gonna move it\nover to notepad.exe.\n\n176\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.792\nIt'll just open up that by default\nunless you specify another one.\n\n177\n00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:41.413\nSo what should happen\nhere if I hit Launch,\n\n178\n00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:44.640\nit should go through and open that up.\n\n179\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.633\nAnd if you take a look at the bottom,\nwhat does it do?\n\n180\n00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:52.040\nRan the module against the WinXP,\nlaunch notepad.exe.\n\n181\n00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.290\nAnd it says yeah,\nthere's the process ID looks like for\n\n182\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.090\nNotepad, 932 and it says it\nopened up a Meterpreter session.\n\n183\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.670\nSo I should be able to, there you go.\n\n184\n00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.640\nIt just went through and\ntook it from the process that was in, and\n\n185\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.410\nshot it over to another one.\n\n186\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.260\nSo that would be kind of a quick\nway of hopping onto a system,\n\n187\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.715\ngaining that access, and then quickly\nhopping over to another process.\n\n188\n00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:22.880\nSo when you sidestep over like that,\n\n189\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.640\nit might be a good way of\nevading detection, possibly.\n\n190\n00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.990\nOr it could be a way of just giving\nyou another level of access there too,\n\n191\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.730\nyou could do that.\n\n192\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.600\nSo, we've got that out of the way,\nif you wanted to do that to pass it over.\n\n193\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.770\nAnd right now, if I wanted to, I could go\nover here to this Meterpreter session and\n\n194\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:54.070\nbump over here and say, in this Interact\npart in here and say, Meterpreter shell.\n\n195\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.960\nAnd there's my one Meterpreter session,\nthe 13 one,\n\n196\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.810\nwhich is the one it just opened.\n\n197\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.660\nAnd there's my Meterpreter 4,\nthe one I was just using.\n\n198\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.750\nSo I passed it from my 4 session\nover to another session.\n\n199\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.176\nI should be able to, if you look at this,\nso here's my XP box over here.\n\n200\n00:12:12.176 --> 00:12:15.830\nIf I got to my XP box,\non my list of processes,\n\n201\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.850\nwell first of all,\n[LAUGH] nothing's running over there.\n\n202\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.772\nBut take a look, what is running on there?\n\n203\n00:12:24.772 --> 00:12:28.710\nThere's notepad.exe right there.\n\n204\n00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.000\nI just highlighted it for you,\nit's sitting right there.\n\n205\n00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.160\nSo that's the one that we\njust presumably started.\n\n206\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.900\nIt should be the one we\njust started up remotely.\n\n207\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.240\nSo there you go, right there,\nkinda quick and easy,\n\n208\n00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:50.070\nwe went through and punched right into\nthat system and started up that process.\n\n209\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.380\nNothing showing up on screen,\nbut it is there.\n\n210\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.130\nIf you wanted to make it a little less\nobvious, you would use one of the existing\n\n211\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.620\nprocesses on there and see if you\ncould actually inject it into there.\n\n212\n00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.770\nBut for purposes of demoing it,\nthat's pretty obvious.\n\n213\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.550\nBut there's nothing saying\nthat we couldn't use, for\n\n214\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.500\nexample, if I go over to my\nMeterpreter 4 session again, and\n\n215\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.560\ndo that ps list that we did, there's\nour list of processes on that system.\n\n216\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.670\nAnd so, we see everything just kinda\ngoing across being listed out.\n\n217\n00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.050\nWell, what if we wanted to, and\nI'll close my 13 session, and\n\n218\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.307\nI'll close this Pass Session\njust to make it so it's obvious,\n\n219\n00:13:33.307 --> 00:13:35.468\nand I'll get the Hail Mary out of the way.\n\n220\n00:13:35.468 --> 00:13:41.530\n[LAUGH] So we've got that Meterpreter\nsession was passed to Notepad.\n\n221\n00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.799\nWell, if I go through this list, so\nit says PID, PPID, you got all that stuff.\n\n222\n00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:53.638\nSo we know PID is that first column there.\n\n223\n00:13:53.638 --> 00:13:58.445\nLet's see what happens if we\ntry to pass the session to,\n\n224\n00:13:58.445 --> 00:14:04.002\nlet's, just for kicks,\nsee if we can pass it over to Explorer.\n\n225\n00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:08.310\nSo, we'll say,\n\n226\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.850\nwhere we gonna do it,\nwe'll do a process ID right here.\n\n227\n00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.824\nSo, if I grab that one, let's see,\n\n228\n00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:22.150\nif I do 1624, and, Got that popped in.\n\n229\n00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.898\nAnd say Launch,\nlet's see if it'll do anything for us.\n\n230\n00:14:26.898 --> 00:14:29.997\nSo did it work?\n\n231\n00:14:29.997 --> 00:14:33.214\nGive it a little moment there.\n\n232\n00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:33.863\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:36.301\n>> Let's see if we got it.\n\n234\n00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:37.730\nLook like it did.\n\n235\n00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.933\n>> Wow.\n>> In fact, it went right in, so\n\n236\n00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:43.100\nI should be able to just open\nup that Meterpreter cell.\n\n237\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.761\nThere's 14, and if I go over to this guy,\n\n238\n00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:52.283\nthere's the Notepad one.\n\n239\n00:14:52.283 --> 00:14:53.247\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n240\n00:14:53.247 --> 00:15:00.390\n>> But it's actually, if I kill that\nNotepad process, I'll just get rid of it.\n\n241\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.060\nSo that would presumably\nmean that that 13 session,\n\n242\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.480\nI can't use right now cuz\nsomeone killed that process.\n\n243\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.920\nWell, I killed that process, but\n\n244\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.090\nlet's just say it was in the context of\na real penetration, someone had done that.\n\n245\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.697\nI've gone through, and\nI have that session gone.\n\n246\n00:15:17.697 --> 00:15:19.697\nI should be able to,\nif I look at it, well look,\n\n247\n00:15:19.697 --> 00:15:21.980\nit doesn't even offer me\nthe 13 option anymore.\n\n248\n00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.860\n>> Right.\n>> It's dead.\n\n249\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.485\nSo, what I can do in here, is,\noops, directory doesn't work there.\n\n250\n00:15:29.485 --> 00:15:34.020\nThere you go, I just went through and\ndid ls through that 14 session.\n\n251\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:41.410\nAnd if I go over to my XP2 one,\nwhere is it?\n\n252\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.660\nYeah, someone else seeing\nthat's gonna look at it and\n\n253\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.600\nthey're not seeing anything.\n\n254\n00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.268\nI've just injected into that process and\nthat's it.\n\n255\n00:15:49.268 --> 00:15:50.046\n>> Wow.\n\n256\n00:15:50.046 --> 00:15:53.363\n>> So yeah,\npretty powerful stuff right there.\n\n257\n00:15:53.363 --> 00:15:58.251\nJust done a really, really,\nit's kinda scary but [LAUGH] it's also\n\n258\n00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:03.336\nreally powerful from the standpoint\nof A pen test of what we've done.\n\n259\n00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:06.210\nJust stuck it in there and it's gone.\n\n260\n00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.360\nDisappeared off the radar.\n\n261\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.570\nI mean yeah, there are ways to pick it up.\n\n262\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.730\nSome of the malware, the scanners,\n\n263\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.660\nthings we have will pick some\nof the stuff up nowadays.\n\n264\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.680\nThat's what they're designed to do But\nit does make it raise the bar, but\n\n265\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.110\nmake it a little tougher.\n\n266\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.040\nSo, [LAUGH] what can you\nreally say about that?\n\n267\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.780\nI mean expect say it's awesome, of course.\n\n268\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.274\n>> Right, that is impressive.\n\n269\n00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:28.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.890\n>> Yeah, it just\n\n271\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.410\n>> It just basically disappeared\n\n272\n00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.990\ncompletely off the radar.\n\n273\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:40.100\nBut other stuff we so here are,\nhere's my screen shot option.\n\n274\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.310\nRemember yesterday we did\nthe screen shot option.\n\n275\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.990\nTook a screen shot of the whole thing,\nyou know, so we can do that really\n\n276\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.790\neasily through here in case you want to\ntake a glance to see how things are doing.\n\n277\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.380\nWe kind of cheated by going over and\ntabbing over to it, but\n\n278\n00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:03.160\ndon't have to quite clearly don't have to,\nyou know, other things you can do.\n\n279\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.420\nObviously, browse files in there if you\ndon't want to do it through the old\n\n280\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.070\ntext menu.\n\n281\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.570\nOr command line rather,\n\n282\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.100\nyou can do it right through here I mean\nyou like your GUI's and file browser.\n\n283\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.920\n>> Doesn't get much\neasier than that does it.\n\n284\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.160\n>> Yeah I mean you can just go ahead and\nbrowse right through this whole stuff,\n\n285\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.990\nand then you can see it even has\nthe upload options on here so\n\n286\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.720\nyou can just go ahead and\nmove around that.\n\n287\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.395\nAnd just start browsing\naround the file system.\n\n288\n00:17:26.395 --> 00:17:31.330\n>> [LAUGH] Make directory,\nlist drives, whatever you wanna do.\n\n289\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.100\n>> Yeah, there's not a whole\nlot of really thought here.\n\n290\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:42.410\nYou just think about what you wanna do,\nbut you don't need to tap things out.\n\n291\n00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.020\nIt's like, I've got it ready to go.\n\n292\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.100\nWe're just going right through, and\nthere's my other stuff I have in here.\n\n293\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.200\nYou know, there's my show of processes.\n\n294\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.700\nI type PS at the command\nline just to make it easy,\n\n295\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.470\nbut you can do short\nprocesses through here.\n\n296\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.670\nJust go right on through and grab all\nsorts of stuff and all sorts of things.\n\n297\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.380\nHere's even, if I want to do this stuff,\nsteal a token,\n\n298\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.310\nyou know we did this one the other day.\n\n299\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:17.450\nThey got token, you know, I can just go\nahead and grab it, you know, off somebody.\n\n300\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:23.220\nAnd so, It's telling me, by the way,\nyou know, you're grabbing this thing.\n\n301\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.800\nIt's telling me I'm not\nrunning a system right now.\n\n302\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.850\nAnd it went through and\n\n303\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.500\ngrabbed it right now it says I'm\nrunning it as XP administrator.\n\n304\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.060\nSo let's see if that's actually true.\n\n305\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.750\nIt should show up.\n\n306\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.220\nYep.\nThere you go.\n\n307\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.050\n>> Nice.\n\n308\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.690\nNow you've switched to another user\naccount's contacts, basically.\n\n309\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:50.230\n>> Yeah, so I could go through and\nstart doing stuff at that point,\n\n310\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:56.550\nunder that person's user account, or under\ntheir context at least, because I'm using\n\n311\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.610\nthat specific token we have on here\nas the one I'm gonna run it under.\n\n312\n00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.190\nIt was like that thing we talked\nabout yesterday, if I want to\n\n313\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.140\nclear an event log,\nI clear an event log as me as system.\n\n314\n00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.250\nOr if it was your system, I just\nimpersonate your account, grab your token,\n\n315\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.340\nclear it and then get rid of it.\n\n316\n00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.340\nIf I wanna get rid of that specific token,\n\n317\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.310\nI just hit this button down here at\nthe bottom called revert to self.\n\n318\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.790\nAnd it will go through and\nget rid of that.\n\n319\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.150\nYou know, so it will send me back to\nwhoever, you know, I was previously.\n\n320\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.811\nSo a few quick button clicks and\nyou could have done some serious damage.\n\n321\n00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:43.845\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n322\n00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:48.245\n>> And we're not even done\nwith this sort of stuff.\n\n323\n00:19:48.245 --> 00:19:51.445\nWe're not even done with the number\nof options we've got here.\n\n324\n00:19:51.445 --> 00:19:56.289\nYou're seeing some other stuff that\nwe didn't even get to the other day.\n\n325\n00:19:56.289 --> 00:19:59.225\nThe other day we went through and\nwe were talking about,\n\n326\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.660\nwe were talking about how could you\nmap out a network, and other things.\n\n327\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:13.300\nThose things are still something\nthat lies ahead for us to explore.\n\n328\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.950\nWe're just doing simple commands,\nright now, at this point.\n\n329\n00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.700\nWe haven't even gotten that\nfar down the road yet.\n\n330\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.260\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n331\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.020\nWell Sean, I tell you what,\nthere's a lot of, again, it's amazing.\n\n332\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.666\nIt just keeps going and going and\ngoing with this what we can do with it.\n\n333\n00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:32.726\nAnd again it's all about the power\nup against underneath that.\n\n334\n00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:36.760\nBut sure does make it easy for us.\n\n335\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.470\nAll right, well, good episode there.\n\n336\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.120\nAnything else you wanna throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n337\n00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.910\nI know we've got more coming.\n\n338\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.700\n>> Oh, yeah, there's more coming so\n>> We've got more cool things to do so\n\n339\n00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.822\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll make them wait.\n\n340\n00:20:47.822 --> 00:20:49.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well, you heard it.\n\n341\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.270\nSean's gonna keep you on\nthe edge of your seat.\n\n342\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.620\nMake you come back for that next episode.\n\n343\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.270\nFor now signing off for ITProTV.\n\n344\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.780\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n345\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.570\n>> And I'm Sean

00:00:16.140\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.190\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.930\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.610\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.550\n>> I'm fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.810\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n9\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.720\ncontinuing on with our Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.160\nAnd Sean,\nI know the viewers probably think, wait,\n\n11\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.370\nam I watching the same episode?\n\n12\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.550\nBecause I keep saying,\nwe've got more to do with Armitage, but\n\n13\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.996\nit keeps on going, right?\n\n14\n00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:34.632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like the Energizer Bunny.\n\n15\n00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:36.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, there's just more, and more,\n\n16\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.065\nand more stuff that we can do with this.\n\n17\n00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:43.260\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthere are definitely is so much stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.400\nAnd so, we're, like I said, one of\nthe earlier segments on Armitage, we\n\n19\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.020\nwere saying that we're revisiting some of\nthe stuff that we did at the command line.\n\n20\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.310\nBut we are also trying to\nintroduce some new stuff, and\n\n21\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.715\nlook at things in different ways.\n\n22\n00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:02.690\nSo we're just gonna kinda continue with\nthat and look at some of the old and\n\n23\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.500\nsome of the new in this\nparticular section.\n\n24\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.790\nSo I think you guys will be kind of\npleasantly surprised with some of\n\n25\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.510\nthe stuff that we're gonna see here and\njust kind of how it works.\n\n26\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.480\n>> Nice.\n\n27\n00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.030\n>> There you go.\n\n28\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.200\n>> Well, let's take a look at it and\n\n29\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.130\nsee what kind of fun we can continue\nto have with Armitage, or Armitage.\n\n30\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.360\nWell, all right.\n\n31\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.570\nYeah, whatever you want to call\nit in your region, whatever.\n\n32\n00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.090\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat my virtual machine again.\n\n33\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.050\nSo we're sitting here,\nI've got my two Meterpreter sessions open.\n\n34\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.565\nYou can see there both,\n\n35\n00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:42.670\nwell I only need one, but\nI've got my Meterpreter 14 session open.\n\n36\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.793\nSo if remember from our previous segment,\nif you watched it,\n\n37\n00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:52.670\nwe created my original Meterpreter over\nhere as four, that's what it popped in as.\n\n38\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.160\nAnd then I actually created a duplicate\nsession is what we really did.\n\n39\n00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.730\nI didn't just say, get rid of this one and\nmove it over there.\n\n40\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.610\nWhat's actually happening is,\nthese are both live sessions, so\n\n41\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.480\nI duplicated the session\nin another process.\n\n42\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.270\nSo I have two connections to this.\n\n43\n00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.010\nAnd, just to make sure\neveryone's also kind of grasping\n\n44\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.100\nwhat's happening here,\none of the things I had also mentioned\n\n45\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.630\nis that you can pass the session\nover to a colleague if you want to.\n\n46\n00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.430\nJust if you want to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.010\nYou can see where I\nhave that past session,\n\n48\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.940\nwhere I originally created\nthe duplicate session?\n\n49\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.540\nYou can go through and do that, and we\noriginally created a Notepad session, but\n\n50\n00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.200\nif I wanna move it someplace else, what\nyou can do is, when you go through this,\n\n51\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.390\nyou can see how it has, and\nI'll do show the advanced options in here.\n\n52\n00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.920\nAs you go through all these options,\nI mean, yeah, there's plenty of options,\n\n53\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.050\nbut as you go through this list, you can\nactually change some of these things\n\n54\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.500\nin there to say, okay,\nwhat address do you want to send it to?\n\n55\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.420\nAnd you can send it to another address.\n\n56\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.570\n>> So it'll just pop up over there so\n\n57\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.410\nyou can see this is the system\nI'm compromising, 138.\n\n58\n00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.590\nIt's saying the local host is 139.\n\n59\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.486\nI could just say put it over there and\nit will go over to that one.\n\n60\n00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:15.244\n>> So if you had a colleague's computer,\nIP address,\n\n61\n00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:18.620\nyou could type that IP address in there,\nand it would show up on their Armitage.\n\n62\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.770\n>> Yeah, exactly, it's something\nthat they can take control of, and\n\n63\n00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.970\nstart doing stuff over there.\n\n64\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.915\nSo, that's kind of a unique capability\nto have, when you look at it.\n\n65\n00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:30.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Tag team hacking,\n\n66\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.110\nit doesn't get any better than that.\n\n67\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.735\nAll right, I'm tagging out, you go.\n\n68\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:36.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's time for me to clock out,\n\n69\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.040\nyou're on.\n\n70\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.720\nYeah, so,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n71\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.340\n>> it gives you another level of\n\n72\n00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.310\ncapabilities, so\nyou could pass it over to another\n\n73\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.150\ncolleague if they wanna go ahead and\nuse this.\n\n74\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.910\nSo-\n>> You gotta use that term,\n\n75\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.855\ncolleague, a little bit loosely.\n\n76\n00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.463\n>> Yeah.\n>> No, I mean, we're penetration testers,\n\n77\n00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:00.208\nwe have colleagues.\n\n78\n00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:00.821\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n79\n00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:04.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As far as you guys know.\n\n80\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.840\nSo that's something I\ndid want to point out,\n\n81\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.530\nas far as passing the session over,\nthat is is duplicating it.\n\n82\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.940\nBut it's also a case of, that you can\nhand a session over to a colleague,\n\n83\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.960\ntoo, if you really wanna do that.\n\n84\n00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.380\nSo, okay, so we've got that covered.\n\n85\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.330\nLet's take a look at the other\noptions that we want to visit.\n\n86\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.100\nNow, one of the things that we\ndid in our other segment was,\n\n87\n00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.427\nwe did this dump hashes deal.\n\n88\n00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:41.058\nWell, what we want to do is,\ndumping hashes, if you recall when we\n\n89\n00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:45.362\ndid our segment on doing Meterpreter\nfrom the command line and\n\n90\n00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:49.913\njust running through Metasploit that way,\nwe did all our stuff in\n\n91\n00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:54.410\nthere to get into the system and\nall that, then dump the hashes.\n\n92\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.260\nAnd one of things I did was I just copied\none of the hashes that I knew was the LM\n\n93\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.700\nhash, and went to that crackstation.net\nand dropped it in there, and\n\n94\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.246\nhad it crack it, and\nit gave me the password.\n\n95\n00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:07.210\nIt worked, I mean it got the job done,\n\n96\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.240\nwhich is ultimately what\nwe're trying to do.\n\n97\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.090\nBut do you have another way of doing it?\n\n98\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.995\nAnd we do know that there is\nplenty of ways to crack passwords.\n\n99\n00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:20.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And here, this is really no option, is\n\n100\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.845\nthat you can take dump hashes,\nand dump the stuff out of the-\n\n101\n00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:31.000\n>> the SAM.\n\n102\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.090\n>> the SAM, again.\n\n103\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.510\nSo, we've got that.\n\n104\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.800\nBut maybe you wanna look at\nthis stuff a little better.\n\n105\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.640\nSo what I can do is I can say\nView credentials, right here.\n\n106\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.976\nAnd there I go.\n\n107\n00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:47.220\nAnd I already ran this really quickly so\n\n108\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.550\nwe didn't have to kind of sit there during\nthe whole thing, but what the heck?\n\n109\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:57.248\nI'll show you what I did here,\njust so you can see what happened.\n\n110\n00:05:57.248 --> 00:06:01.760\nI have my account, so\nit went through really quickly.\n\n111\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.870\nIt formatted everything out.\n\n112\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.330\nI can see here it's already cracked\nthat password and told me who it's for,\n\n113\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.580\nwhich is 138, which makes complete sense,\nthe system we busted into.\n\n114\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.820\nAnd then I see my other hashes which\nit hasn't done anything with, and\n\n115\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.750\nwe'll talk about why\nthat is in just a moment.\n\n116\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.740\nBut, if I click.\n\n117\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.365\nI mean, look at how easy this is,\nthey've got a button for it.\n\n118\n00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:26.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I click Crack passwords, and ask okay,\n\n119\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.280\nwhat do you wannna do?\n\n120\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.670\nBlah bitty blah.\n\n121\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.670\nNotice what it's using right up here,\nit's using John the Ripper.\n\n122\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.280\nJohn the Ripper is a well-known password\ncracker, and it's right there in Kali.\n\n123\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.730\nSo all we got to do, is just hit Launch,\nand you see it opens up a tab for it.\n\n124\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.830\nAnd it's going through and saying,\nokay, let me try this one out.\n\n125\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.870\nAnd if you look at it, you can see that\nit's trying the hashes against these\n\n126\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.880\ndifferent algorithms, and\nit's doing its job in there.\n\n127\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.890\nThere, it's found the accounts.\n\n128\n00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.520\nIt's looking at the different accounts and\nsaying, okay, I'm gonna try these things.\n\n129\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.148\nAnd so it's just gonna keep that\nprocess going until it's kind\n\n130\n00:07:04.148 --> 00:07:06.076\nof moved through the whole deal.\n\n131\n00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:10.424\nYou can see it went from having so\nmany hashes left and it keeps incrementing\n\n132\n00:07:10.424 --> 00:07:14.440\ndown, it just keeps bumping through and\nworking its way through it.\n\n133\n00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.760\nSo it looks like right there,\n\n134\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.580\nit says administrator,\nput the password right next to it.\n\n135\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.810\nSo it recovered one, that's what it did\nbefore when I ran it a few moments ago.\n\n136\n00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.390\nSo, like I said, it'll just keep kinda\ndoing that thing until it has them all.\n\n137\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.390\nObviously if you have a system\nthat has more accounts,\n\n138\n00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.975\nthen this is gonna take longer,\nbut it's still not bad.\n\n139\n00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:39.920\n[LAUGH] I'm not complaining.\n\n140\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.410\nSo, we've got this kind of happening.\n\n141\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.553\nAnd if we look over at our credentials,\nand here, that's how I got to this point,\n\n142\n00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:52.245\nwhen I did View credentials,\nthat it didn't have a hash there.\n\n143\n00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:56.601\nIt actually had just\na password sitting there.\n\n144\n00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:01.369\nNow, you might wonder why it hasn't\nreturned some of the other ones when\n\n145\n00:08:01.369 --> 00:08:03.806\nit's doing this process over here.\n\n146\n00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:08.751\nIt's going, okay, why don't I have,\nall those hashes disappeared and\n\n147\n00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:11.490\nit has a password filled in there?\n\n148\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.150\nWell, it's not gonna give me\nsome of these blank ones.\n\n149\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.340\nJust, there's nothing there.\n\n150\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.150\nSo it's not gonna return those,\nand I think one of those accounts\n\n151\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.260\nis actually disabled, and, and\nthat might be impacting it.\n\n152\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.120\n>> I think, Sean,\nif we look closely at those hash.\n\n153\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.080\nWe can zoom maybe just for\na second there Jason.\n\n154\n00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.160\nThree of them are exactly the same, right?\n\n155\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.700\n>> Yeah, that's a very, very good catch.\n\n156\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.440\n>> But\n\n157\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.309\nthe filler that it puts in there when\nyou don't have a password [INAUDIBLE].\n\n158\n00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.950\n>> Actually in that case,\nit's a very good catch.\n\n159\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.170\nLet's take a look,\nif we can zoom in there again, and\n\n160\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.690\ntake a look at what Mike's\ntalking about here.\n\n161\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.300\nNotice the Guest account,\nthe Mike account, and the support account.\n\n162\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.640\nNotice that we got everything up to\nthat first colon, they're all the same.\n\n163\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.150\nRemember what that is.\n\n164\n00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.850\nThat is the LM hash.\n\n165\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:10.820\nOkay, and we know the LM hash has some\nserious issues as far as its security.\n\n166\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.280\nBut when we look at this\nall three are the same.\n\n167\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.180\nIt's telling us right away first of all,\nthat password is probably the same.\n\n168\n00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:25.390\nAnd I'm gonna say since it didn't\nbreak it, that it's probably blank.\n\n169\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.450\nI mean, that might be kinda\ngetting out on a limb there.\n\n170\n00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.450\nBut to say it's blank just\nby what I'm seeing here.\n\n171\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.450\nBut I think might be a reasonably\nfair kind of assessment on that.\n\n172\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.200\nTo say that it is blank, considering\nthat we have a guest account which\n\n173\n00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.310\ntraditionally is just disabled, and\nthey don't put anything in there.\n\n174\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.550\n>> Passwords never been set on that.\n\n175\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.720\nI know that Mike account,\nI never set the password on that.\n\n176\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.180\nAnd probably that support one.\n\n177\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.860\n>> Yeah.\n\n178\n00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.410\n>> Same thing.\n\n179\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.010\nNever been used, never been set.\n\n180\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.980\n>> Yeah, it kinda.\n\n181\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.020\nAnd that's what indicate to me is\nall those things that, they just,\n\n182\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.550\nthey're the same and\nI'm guessing it's probably blank.\n\n183\n00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.610\nAnd then, of course,\n\n184\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.260\nyou had already told me prior that\nyou had a blank password in there.\n\n185\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.500\nSo, I already knew that going in.\n\n186\n00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.480\nBut if I put that aside for a second, that\nwould be my kind of assessment on that.\n\n187\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.980\nBut that's another good thing to\nnotice when you're looking at this,\n\n188\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:24.690\nis that we've got\na password that's the same.\n\n189\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.770\nIn any case, we've got credentials.\n\n190\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.680\nNotice you can export this out, so\n\n191\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.110\nif you wanna take it to someplace\nelse to be broken, you can.\n\n192\n00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.920\nIt will go ahead and take care of that for\nyou, which is really cool.\n\n193\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.580\nSo, that's just the password\ncracking capability.\n\n194\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.620\nThis is just simple push button.\n\n195\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.430\nJust go for it.\n\n196\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.130\nSo, we've got that.\n\n197\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.150\nSo, there's our Merterpreter stuff and\nI dumped the hashes out,\n\n198\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.830\nwe just said pfft review the credentials,\ncrack it, and tell me what you got.\n\n199\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.180\nSo quite simple to do,\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n200\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.700\nSo gotta like that.\n\n201\n00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.770\n>> Absolutely.\n\n202\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.790\n>> It doesn't get too much easier\nthan that, but we said, there's other\n\n203\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.050\nkind of additional things thing you can\ndo that we kind want to point out here.\n\n204\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.620\nThere's, shouldn't say implying.\n\n205\n00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.020\nI mean, there's tons of extra stuff,\nreally, in here.\n\n206\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:24.370\nOne of the things that we had\nkind of mentioned earlier, a bit.\n\n207\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.030\nI kind of ran it just kind of\nquickly to show you that we could\n\n208\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.630\ndo the actual process.\n\n209\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.470\nBut notice here, this interact menu,\nyou can actually do this VNC deal.\n\n210\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:44.020\nAnd we know what VNC is from talking\nabout it in our previous segments.\n\n211\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.030\nJust think, if you haven't seen VNC\nbefore, just think remote desktop and\n\n212\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.370\nyou got it.\n\n213\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.700\nThat's good enough for\nwhat we want to talk about right now.\n\n214\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.100\nSo I have my, what I did is my hit and\nset up a VNC.\n\n215\n00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:04.940\nWhat it's doing is, it's gonna try\nto push VNC up to that system and\n\n216\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:11.030\nsee if it can get it loaded in there and\nthen If I can see if I can use it.\n\n217\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.570\nWell what's happened is, it's telling\nme this is what it's gonna do,\n\n218\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.890\nand it's gonna tell me this is\nwhat it's setting it up to.\n\n219\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.790\nI mean look, it's saying host process,\nnotepad, has a process ID of 180.\n\n220\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.820\nSo okay, well it's got that going,\nso I will hit okay and\n\n221\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.460\nlet it see, and\nlet it do its whole magic in there.\n\n222\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.560\nLet's see, we said it was 180.\n\n223\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.650\nI don't know,\nlet's see if anything happened.\n\n224\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.680\nOh, well there you go.\n\n225\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.260\nIt's right there.\n\n226\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.399\nI just viewed the process.\n\n227\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.799\nNice.\n>> It's right there, so\n\n228\n00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:46.940\nI definitely know it's running.\n\n229\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.706\nIf I do issue my screen shot command\nright here, I get screen saver.\n\n230\n00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:56.284\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n231\n00:12:56.284 --> 00:13:00.580\nso there's ways I could actually\nget that out of the way.\n\n232\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.240\nBut I'm not even gonna\nworry about that right now.\n\n233\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.510\nSo yeah.\n\n234\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.110\nThere is note pad right there.\n\n235\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.990\nI have got another note pad running here.\n\n236\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.200\nIt's from the stuff I have\nalready done previously.\n\n237\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.760\nSo there you go.\n\n238\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.780\nAll I would have to do right\nnow is go out to my system and\n\n239\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.110\njust see if I could open\nup a connection with VNC.\n\n240\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.600\nI can do that from my Kali\nsystem underneath if I wanted.\n\n241\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.000\nI could just type in the IP address and\nsee if it will go in and connect to it.\n\n242\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.430\nAt this point, you probably are,\nyou probably are gonna connect to it.\n\n243\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.280\nThe only things that are gonna stop you,\n\n244\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.520\nis maybe the way they have the firewall\nconfigured or something like that.\n\n245\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.520\nBut That's probably pretty low\npossibility at this point,\n\n246\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.760\nyou have gotten this far and\nnothing stopped you.\n\n247\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.390\nIt's probably going to work,\nbut you don't know for\n\n248\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.280\nsure until you actually try it out.\n\n249\n00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.830\nSo that's a lot of progress you've made.\n\n250\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:07.800\nYou've cracked passwords pretty quickly,\nnow you've gotten a VNC session on there.\n\n251\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.150\nSo we have done some other stuff,\n\n252\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.342\nbut some other things you can do, there's\nplenty of other things you can do here.\n\n253\n00:14:16.342 --> 00:14:19.940\nWe have, we talked about browsing\nfiles and showing processes,\n\n254\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.400\nI just type ps from the command line but\nyou can do it this way.\n\n255\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.080\nThere is our, we see our screenshot stuff,\nbut also notice,\n\n256\n00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.220\nthere's our keystroke logger,\nwe could say log keystrokes, and\n\n257\n00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.910\nwe can configure that whole deal out,\nand launch it.\n\n258\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.790\nAnd it's gonna go ahead and\nstart running this whole thing for us, and\n\n259\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.810\nyou can see, It's actually saving\nthe stuff out to us to a text file.\n\n260\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.796\n>> Nice.\n>> So it's taking care of that.\n\n261\n00:14:50.796 --> 00:14:57.177\nSo it's offering us quite a bit with that.\n\n262\n00:14:57.177 --> 00:15:00.305\nYou can go ahead and close this.\n\n263\n00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:07.435\nSo I have got that one, and\nthen there's your webcam stuff.\n\n264\n00:15:07.435 --> 00:15:11.225\nAnd then they have other\ndifferent types of modules and\n\n265\n00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:15.460\ntoys that can be loaded in here\nthat you can do stuff with as well.\n\n266\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.740\nSo if you look at it,\njust in what we had here,\n\n267\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.980\nwhat do we have after the attack,\nafter we've punched in?\n\n268\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.650\nWe looked at, we can dump the hashes,\nwe cracked the passwords,\n\n269\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.040\nwe've used it as a spying device,\nwhich was something that we did or\n\n270\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.100\nat least discussed in our previous\nsegments with Meterpreter.\n\n271\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:44.080\nSo we're grabbing those things and\nyou can just keep expanding out from here.\n\n272\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.700\nAnd just FYI, something i'll point out,\nand this is a Metasploit thing in general.\n\n273\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.418\nIf you are doing your\nreconnaissance on the system and\n\n274\n00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:56.895\npoking around like this,\nI don't have one here.\n\n275\n00:15:56.895 --> 00:16:02.859\nBut if you had a MacOS system, one of the\nthings that I saw mentioned, didn't even\n\n276\n00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:08.148\nthink about it until I saw something\nonline mention this little detail.\n\n277\n00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:12.590\nThat a lot of your mac\nsystems like your notebooks.\n\n278\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.270\nThey've got webcams built in.\n\n279\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.350\nThey definitely all have them built in.\n\n280\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.050\nAnd most systems have then\nbuilt in now-a-days period.\n\n281\n00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.925\nBut those ones definitely\nhave Mall built into it.\n\n282\n00:16:22.925 --> 00:16:27.725\nSo one of the things that was\nmentioned was like, always try that,\n\n283\n00:16:27.725 --> 00:16:30.025\nespecially if you see that\nit's a Mac OS system.\n\n284\n00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:33.465\nYou might be worth it to see a list of\nwebcams or just try a webcam shot and\n\n285\n00:16:33.465 --> 00:16:34.815\nsee what it picks up.\n\n286\n00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:36.680\n>> Wow.\n>> Cuz you might very well get something\n\n287\n00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.580\n[LAUGH] all for that, and it's\n>> It's kinda funny when you get\n\n288\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.110\ndown to it that far.\n\n289\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.238\nYou're like oh, wait a minute.\n\n290\n00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:49.420\nSo, [LAUGH]\nand believe it or\n\n291\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.080\nnot, we still have a lot\nmore other stuff we can do.\n\n292\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.950\nWe just haven't even\ngot to that point yet.\n\n293\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.180\nBut the last part of that, something else\nI want to emphasize there is Up to this\n\n294\n00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:10.270\npoint, we've been using command line stuff\nright in here and using Armitage as GUI.\n\n295\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.920\nWell, the one thing we haven't seen\naside from me flipping over to it\n\n296\n00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.730\nis the actual desktop.\n\n297\n00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:22.790\nYou should be able to,\nwith just a little bit of effort,\n\n298\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:28.190\nbe able to just open up VNC, and\nbe able to look right into that desktop.\n\n299\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.150\nAnd so if you needed that, if you're\nnot seeing everything you want to,\n\n300\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:38.005\nI have that VNC session over there and\ncould just pop in the IP address and\n\n301\n00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:41.905\nport number if I needed to, and just\ntype in the credentials it gave me, and\n\n302\n00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:47.715\nI got that GUI showing up on that system,\nand now I'm doing that type of stuff.\n\n303\n00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:53.845\nSo, it shows you something else there\nthat you can do on top of that.\n\n304\n00:17:53.845 --> 00:17:55.805\n>> Impressive, impressive.\n\n305\n00:17:55.805 --> 00:17:58.145\nIt really does make it pretty simple.\n\n306\n00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:03.480\nIt wasn't like Metasploit,\nyeah, it wasn't that complex.\n\n307\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.720\nThere was learning some commands, learning\nhow to browse through the exploits, and\n\n308\n00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.420\nbrowse through the payloads.\n\n309\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.900\nSure, there's a little bit of work there,\n\n310\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.730\nbut this has even taken\nthat part away from us.\n\n311\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.428\nAnd now it's just like, well,\nwe'll just right-click on this system\n\n312\n00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:19.840\nRight-click Scan, right-click on\nyour System, pick your exploit.\n\n313\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.170\nIt already knows which ones you\ncan launch, which ones you can't.\n\n314\n00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.110\nIt's pretty darned impressive.\n\n315\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.350\n>> Yeah, it's really just go and\njust plowing right through it and saying,\n\n316\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.610\nokay yeah, we can do all of these\nthings for you in just a few clicks.\n\n317\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:39.620\nSo, what do you wanna do to make this\nthing a reality, make it happen?\n\n318\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.568\n>> We talked about how learning\nthe backend, learning how an interpreter\n\n319\n00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:48.470\nworked and that.\n\n320\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.470\nIt was necessary really, not necessarily\nbut made it easier to work with Armitage\n\n321\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.780\nbecause we kind of knew what\nwas going on in the background.\n\n322\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.630\nBut I think maybe\nthe reverse is true as well.\n\n323\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.250\nAfter playing with Armitage for a while,\n\n324\n00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.880\ndoesn't it wouldn't make it easier to work\nif you had to work form the command line,\n\n325\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.990\nbecause you've seen what it can do and\nwhat my options are.\n\n326\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.560\n>> Yeah.\nI think I would agree with that.\n\n327\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.890\nYou just have to make sure that.\n\n328\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.670\nThe thing I guess a better way to put\nit is the thing people have to be\n\n329\n00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.870\ncareful with is, you'll look at\nsomething like Armitage, and\n\n330\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.980\nit makes it look really easy and\nyou might wonder, why ever do it,\n\n331\n00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.780\nif it as your first foray into\never playing around with it.\n\n332\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.780\nYou might say,\nI don't need to go into metasploit.\n\n333\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.150\nI mean everything's\nhere that I need to do.\n\n334\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.700\nAnd that's your choice if you decide\nthat that's the way you wanna leave it.\n\n335\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.870\nBut I would tell you yeah, you can start\nhere and give you an understanding\n\n336\n00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.220\nof the capabilities that are there, and\nthen you can drill under the surface and\n\n337\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.450\nsee what Metasploit can at the command\nline add to you in form of just raw power.\n\n338\n00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.500\nBecause there is definitely stuff\nthat we're not going to be able\n\n339\n00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.380\nto do through here.\n\n340\n00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.330\nI mean, we can access a lot of power here,\nnut not all of it.\n\n341\n00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:09.340\nSo you'd have to be kinda disciplined and\nvery curious about,\n\n342\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.150\nsay you know well if I peel this away\nwhat could I do at the command line to\n\n343\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.875\nbump it up a few notches,\nso, but you know.\n\n344\n00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:18.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a good point.\n\n345\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.490\nYou can go either way on it.\n\n346\n00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.040\n>> Yeah.\n\n347\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.690\nYou start getting used to maybe\nthe filtered list, is like, oh,\n\n348\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.100\nI know which ones are gonna work on this,\n\n349\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.280\nbecause every time I do an Armitage this\nis what it filters it down to, right?\n\n350\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.450\nSo those kind of things maybe speed\nyou up a little bit when you're\n\n351\n00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.620\nworking with Metasploit directly.\n\n352\n00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.150\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n353\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.470\nWell, Sean, again, a lot of incredible\ninformation about Armitage.\n\n354\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.310\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow into this episode?\n\n355\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.120\nNo, I don't know if we really have\nanything else that's really kind of\n\n356\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.100\nfits in this episode.\n\n357\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.720\nI mean, there's still some stuff ahead.\n\n358\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.225\nI know we've probably said that so\nmany times now, at this point.\n\n359\n00:20:55.225 --> 00:20:56.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n360\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.170\nI think you kind of get\nthe idea that when we say that,\n\n361\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.830\nthere really is some\n>> Other stuff around the corner\n\n362\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.170\nthat you're gonna see that's just as neat,\nso that's what we've got to do.\n\n363\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.920\nWe still got a little more\nof that to do with armitage.\n\n364\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.310\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well stay tuned for\n\n365\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.610\nthose episodes coming up soon.\n\n366\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.610\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n367\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.570\n>> And I'm Sean Oriano.\n\n368\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.589\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n369\n00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:22.670\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.360\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.240\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.940\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.412\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:28.171\nContinuing on with our Metasploit series,\nand in this one we're gonna talk about,\n\n9\n00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.208\nwe've been using Armitage or Armitage,\nwhichever way you wanna say-\n\n10\n00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:32.755\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n11\n00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:34.371\n>> That we haven't been corrected yet,\n\n12\n00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:37.409\nand we wanna take a look, we're just\ngoing to take it to the next level.\n\n13\n00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.140\nWe've actually done really\ncool things with it so far.\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.010\nIf you've missed any of those episodes,\nmake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n15\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.395\nSean, what's next with this program?\n\n16\n00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:48.292\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n17\n00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.742\n[LAUGH] that's the million dollar\nquestion, what's next, I mean yeah,\n\n18\n00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:56.930\ncuz we've done so many different\nthings on the system at this point.\n\n19\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.250\nWhat else can we do?\n\n20\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.070\nWell, there's a handful of other\nthings that we can do, and\n\n21\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.670\nwhat we're gonna talk about is kinda\nnarrow it down to the simplest thing.\n\n22\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.586\nHere, or\nkind of narrow it down to kind of,\n\n23\n00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:15.216\nas closely as we can because you can\nreally open things up from here.\n\n24\n00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:20.383\nAnd what we mean by that is when you\ngain access to a network, so let's say\n\n25\n00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:26.620\nyou're doing this remotely or you're just\ntrying to get further into a network.\n\n26\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.070\nSo you get hit with a subnet, and\n\n27\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.830\nyou sweep the subnet like we did and\nwe find all these hosts.\n\n28\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.143\nWell, you find these hosts and you start\npoking around and you, after you find all\n\n29\n00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:43.533\nthese live ones and you get into one, well\nthe next step is well, we penetrate one,\n\n30\n00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:48.617\nwhich we were lucky enough on ours to hit\ntwo of them and get into those systems.\n\n31\n00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:52.050\nSo that got us some mileage.\n\n32\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.170\nWell, you're not really gonna stop there.\n\n33\n00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.750\nYou just don't stop at that point.\n\n34\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.740\nYou've got other things that you can do.\n\n35\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.308\nAnd what we're typically gonna\ndo is once we get that foothold,\n\n36\n00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:10.567\nwe're gonna want to start moving\ndeeper into the actual network itself.\n\n37\n00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:15.771\nNow, the way we do that is Armitage\nactually helps us out with that.\n\n38\n00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:20.121\nAnd you can do this right through\nMetasploit again if you want to run all\n\n39\n00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.540\nthe commands.\n\n40\n00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.940\nBut, Armitage makes it a lot easier as\nyou would expect I think at this point.\n\n41\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.770\nSo what I have here on my system\n\n42\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.640\nhere is I've got my Armitage\nwindow up once again.\n\n43\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.340\nYou can see that I have the two\nsystems actually compromised.\n\n44\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.090\nI can see that.\n\n45\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.370\nSo I've got the little lightning bolts and\neverything around it.\n\n46\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.110\nAnd notice it's confirming\nwhat access I have.\n\n47\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.610\nAnd both have root on\nMetasploitable system,\n\n48\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.320\nmove all the way over on the right.\n\n49\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.810\nAnd then, have the system on\nthe Win XP system on the other one.\n\n50\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.740\nSo I've got access, I'm in.\n\n51\n00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.640\nWe know that, I can see the shells open\nat the bottom, so I'm kinda rocking and\n\n52\n00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.310\nrolling here.\n\n53\n00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:11.925\nSo what you can do is when you\nget into a system at that level,\n\n54\n00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:17.285\nthere's additional steps would be get it\nin and seeing what that system can see.\n\n55\n00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:20.960\nIs there any way I can jump off\nthat system and go someplace else?\n\n56\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.930\nSo one of the things that helps\nyou do with that is there's\n\n57\n00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.895\nsomething called pivoting which is\nwhat we mean in this whole section,\n\n58\n00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:32.644\nthe starting of it is pivoting rather.\n\n59\n00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:37.570\nAnd what pivoting is means that you're\ngonna be trying to hit another subnet.\n\n60\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.495\nYou discover another subnet or\nanother system.\n\n61\n00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:45.474\nAnd you're gonna start, keep moving\nthrough, doing that whole thing.\n\n62\n00:03:45.474 --> 00:03:51.010\nSo what I have here on, for\nexample, my Win XP system.\n\n63\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.890\nThat's been compromised.\n\n64\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.180\nWhat I can do is, I can go right on\ndown here to my pivoting option, and\n\n65\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.410\nyou can see it has a set up\noption in here, and it's saying,\n\n66\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.885\nI recognize this as a subnet\nthat this thing's attached to.\n\n67\n00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.850\nI can go through and do add pivot, and you\ncan see it when I click on it, it gonna\n\n68\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.944\nsay added to route, and you can see right\nacross the top, it added a green line.\n\n69\n00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:24.170\nNow, the way it is right now, I'm not\naccessing another subnet off this system,\n\n70\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.095\neverything is on this system so it's\njust gonna be doing between these guys,\n\n71\n00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:33.563\nbut if it had other targets,\nother subnets, I would just choose it and\n\n72\n00:04:33.563 --> 00:04:38.300\nit would start showing me\nthe connections that are being done.\n\n73\n00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.100\nAnd that connection,\nthe really cool thing about it is,\n\n74\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.810\nis that as it becomes active and\nyou start doing stuff across it,\n\n75\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.630\nyou'll see it get highlighted, telling you\nthat there's activity going across it.\n\n76\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.573\nAnd so, you're seeing\nthe relationships right here,\n\n77\n00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:55.089\nquite quickly telling you that,\nhey, there's something here.\n\n78\n00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.474\nIn fact, if you look at it, you can\nsee up close and personal right there.\n\n79\n00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:03.410\nYou can see a dark,\nkinda faded out green arrow.\n\n80\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.260\nThere's nothing happening\nwith that connection.\n\n81\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.950\nIt's saying, yeah, I recognize it,\nand you can even see behind this\n\n82\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.590\nbright green arrow, you can see that there\nactually is some other little dark green\n\n83\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.190\nstuff showing out that's saying there's\nnothing really going on between those.\n\n84\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.687\nIt's not an active connection.\n\n85\n00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:29.070\nSo I've got a pivot added in there.\n\n86\n00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.610\nNow, if you were to go into one of\nthese systems, let's say I go to my\n\n87\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.780\nXP system here, I could go and look at it\nand do things like ipconfig, for example.\n\n88\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.970\nAnd have it spit out and\nsay what networks it's attached to.\n\n89\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.980\nHere, I only see it's attached\nto one network specifically.\n\n90\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.929\nBut if this thing was attached to multiple\nnetworks or multiple network adapters,\n\n91\n00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:59.916\nmaybe I'd find another subnet.\n\n92\n00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:03.054\nAnd I could see if I can\npush through that, perhaps.\n\n93\n00:06:03.054 --> 00:06:07.258\nAs it is, right here,\nI see a gateway in place in there.\n\n94\n00:06:07.258 --> 00:06:09.370\nLet's see if the gateway is alive.\n\n95\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.430\nI could do, just regular commands that\nI would do, as if I was sitting there.\n\n96\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.228\nSo I'm pinging it to see if\nI'm getting any life from it.\n\n97\n00:06:20.228 --> 00:06:21.308\nMaybe that system isn't on.\n\n98\n00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:25.320\nIt doesn't look like it's kinda\nsitting there, not doing anything.\n\n99\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.260\nSo maybe that system isn't online or\nthinks it's there, or for\n\n100\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.620\nsome reason we're not getting a response.\n\n101\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.536\nBut I do actually see it\nset as the gateway, so\n\n102\n00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:40.667\nmaybe I move on to something\nelse at this point.\n\n103\n00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:44.620\nAnd I have a little\neye-roll kinda killed that.\n\n104\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.222\nWhile its still trying it.\n\n105\n00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:48.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n106\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.890\nIt didn't get anywhere else.\n\n107\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.034\nLet's see if we can, perhaps,\n\n108\n00:06:53.034 --> 00:06:59.095\nping that system on the other side of it,\nthat 139 system.\n\n109\n00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:04.526\nSo I will try doing that, and\nthis would be just kinda the process\n\n110\n00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:10.880\nthat you would do to see if you can find\nother hosts out there on the network.\n\n111\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.155\nAnd notice these aren't any special\ncommands, these are ones that are right\n\n112\n00:07:16.155 --> 00:07:19.623\ninside of Windows or\nwhatever operating system you have anyway.\n\n113\n00:07:19.623 --> 00:07:22.497\nI've got that other\nLinux system out there,\n\n114\n00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:26.090\nthe Metasploit system\nthat's been compromised.\n\n115\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.750\nI could conceivably switch\nover to that one, and\n\n116\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.660\nstart doing stuff from over on that side,\nand see what I could hit.\n\n117\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.650\n>> So pivoting basically\nmeans you've looked in, or\n\n118\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.930\nyou've compromised one machine,\n>> And now,\n\n119\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.860\nyou gotta try to take a look at it\nfrom that machine's perspective.\n\n120\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.340\nSo you're pivoting your\npoint of view basically.\n\n121\n00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.830\n>> Yeah, that would be fair to say that.\n\n122\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.350\nYeah, that you're seeing what that system\ncan see and just moving on from there.\n\n123\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.140\nBecause that's probably the way it's\ngonna work is that you're gonna get into\n\n124\n00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.250\na network by establishing that beach head,\nand then just move in from there.\n\n125\n00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.340\nI mean,\nyou might find another way to do it,\n\n126\n00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.400\nbut this makes sense that you\nmight be doing it this way.\n\n127\n00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.030\nIt's actually a likely way\nyou might be doing it.\n\n128\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.690\nAnd who knows?\n\n129\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.120\nOnce you find one of those\nsystems that you can compromise,\n\n130\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.370\nyou might decide to drop\nsomething off on there.\n\n131\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.490\nMaybe when you get to it, you find out\nthat one of these exploits that we have\n\n132\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.590\nwill work on that, and you compromise it\nand push something out onto that system.\n\n133\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.670\nYou could have even gathered\ndomain credentials, at this point.\n\n134\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.500\nIt's entirely possible you could\nhave done that because there,\n\n135\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.430\nactually, is functions in there that would\nallow you to make that a lot easier.\n\n136\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.970\nAnd that's assuming you haven't used\nsomething like, KeyScan or a Keylogger,\n\n137\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.340\nitself to gather that.\n\n138\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.800\nYou could use those to, maybe,\nget quicker access across things too.\n\n139\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.770\n>> Nice.\n\n140\n00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.090\nYeah, it really does open up the doors.\n\n141\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.260\nCuz, probably we've made it into that,\nsay Windows XP box or what have you, and\n\n142\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.630\nmaybe their client subnet.\n\n143\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.500\nBut that client accesses file servers and\nthings like that,\n\n144\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.650\nthat are on their server backbone,\nor their server subnet.\n\n145\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.160\nSo maybe we can start\nworking our way towards that.\n\n146\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.290\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n147\n00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.610\nThat's what you have.\n\n148\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.200\nOnce you get that foothold, it's just\na question of you, and you should be\n\n149\n00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.320\nfamiliar with basic networking concepts,\nis just finding other targets out there.\n\n150\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.490\nAnd finding other pieces of the network,\ntrying to map it out and\n\n151\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.620\nget further in and further in.\n\n152\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.010\nAnd seeing what you can do.\n\n153\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.580\nAnd so, you're really taking\nthings [LAUGH] to a whole nother\n\n154\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.820\nlevel at that point.\n\n155\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.060\nSo there's other networking tools\nyou have in here that help you out.\n\n156\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.720\nI just went through and\nran really quickly, I ran an arp-scan.\n\n157\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.890\nYou'll recognize that, ARP,\nresolving IPs to Mac addresses.\n\n158\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.820\nSo I ran a quick one and\n\n159\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.590\nI can see some Mac addresses and\nIP addresses sitting out there, so\n\n160\n00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:05.590\nI'm seeing a little bit of stuff\nthat this thing has talked to.\n\n161\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.290\nSo a little more information.\n\n162\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.318\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it just keeps going-\n\n163\n00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:10.531\n>> [LAUGH] I was gonna say.\n\n164\n00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.223\n>> On and, on and, on and,\n\n165\n00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:16.914\non just where do you wanna stop and\nwhen have you gotten what you need.\n\n166\n00:10:16.914 --> 00:10:17.798\n>> All right.\n\n167\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:18.459\nYeah, it really does.\n\n168\n00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:21.211\nIt is amazing how much information\nwe're able to retrieve with this stuff.\n\n169\n00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:24.090\n>> Yeah, it really, really is.\n\n170\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.890\nWe've gone just so far,\nwe've gone over several sessions.\n\n171\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.030\nWe've probed around on our network and\n\n172\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.280\nseen what we can gather and\nwe've gathered quite a bit.\n\n173\n00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.100\nAnd just to kind of point\nout some other stuff.\n\n174\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.200\nI haven't really pointed this out yet.\n\n175\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.140\nJust to kind of, give you an idea,\nis we do have some other things\n\n176\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.814\nthat are showing up on the menu\nif you want to go to this point.\n\n177\n00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:56.980\nWe've seen a good number\nof these things already.\n\n178\n00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.910\nBut you see stuff on\nhere like the View menu.\n\n179\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.860\nYou have this loop one.\n\n180\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.630\nSo I have under this Loop\nmenu I have stuff that,\n\n181\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.179\ninformation that I have gathered already.\n\n182\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.690\nSo that's being actively tracked.\n\n183\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.460\nThere's my stuff, the keystrokes.\n\n184\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.170\nRemember yesterday,\nI was talking about you could run KeyScan.\n\n185\n00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.090\nYou could start up KeyScan, and\nthen there was a KeyScan dump.\n\n186\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.920\nAnd I said you could dump it to a file,\nthis is it right here,\n\n187\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.180\nthis is the way you\nwould actually do that.\n\n188\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.720\nI dumped it directly to a file or it's\nrather been stored in the database, and\n\n189\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720\nso we've got that.\n\n190\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.970\nAnd we can refer back to it.\n\n191\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.450\nThere's nothing being saved, cuz I\ndidn't do anything on that system, but-\n\n192\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.748\n>> No case structure being generated\n\n193\n00:11:45.748 --> 00:11:48.578\nover there, but the fact that we could\ndo that if we needed to is fantastic.\n\n194\n00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:53.083\nCuz then you can capture all kinds of\nstuff, the passwords that they type in,\n\n195\n00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:53.790\nwho knows.\n\n196\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.896\n>> Yeah, you definitely have that ability\nto capture that once we have that.\n\n197\n00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:03.158\nAnd if I had done any number of things\nthat would have shown up in that database,\n\n198\n00:12:03.158 --> 00:12:07.549\nthere's a lot of stuff that you collect\nthat will just start getting populated in\n\n199\n00:12:07.549 --> 00:12:09.400\nthere as you go through.\n\n200\n00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.500\nSo that's pretty cool down there.\n\n201\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.308\nSome other stuff, you can see\nwhat jobs are running currently.\n\n202\n00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:24.650\nOr have been run on this,\nso I'm seeing some of that.\n\n203\n00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:30.390\nThat's all well and good, but\nlet me show you this right down here,\n\n204\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.370\nsince you have a reporting deal.\n\n205\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:38.451\nSo if you're gonna take this out to\ngenerate your report for the client,\n\n206\n00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:45.446\nor whatever, you can actually grab that\ninformation and take it out of the system.\n\n207\n00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:48.560\nAnd you could do whatever with it.\n\n208\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.950\nYou can even go through here.\n\n209\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.632\nIt's even got specifically an export\noption that will take it right out and\n\n210\n00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:57.320\nyou can just start doing whatever with it.\n\n211\n00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.548\n>> Nice.\n\n212\n00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:04.990\n>> Yeah, so it;s got stuff to\nmake your life a little easier.\n\n213\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.530\nLife needs to get any\neasier at this point.\n\n214\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.475\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:08.266\n>> Gets any easier for you,\n\n216\n00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:08.986\nit would be cheating.\n\n217\n00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:09.612\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:14.444\n>> So, [LAUGH] but that's just kind of\na quick walk around some of these other\n\n219\n00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:18.425\nlittle things,\nthe biggest part would being, what next?\n\n220\n00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:21.250\nWe're gonna kind of leave\nit to you to do what next,\n\n221\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.534\nis that's what the pivoting came in,\nis, once you've got\n\n222\n00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:28.280\nto that point you can add other\nsubnets and other targets in there and\n\n223\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.450\nstart spreading out from there, and\nfiguring out where other things are.\n\n224\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.480\nAnd seeing if you can compromise\nother stuff and find services and\n\n225\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.820\nstuff like that.\n\n226\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.980\nYou could do that from here.\n\n227\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.060\n>> Almost like it's a rinse and\nrepeat process.\n\n228\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.886\nEverything that we did to get\naccess to that first machine,\n\n229\n00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:46.607\nwe're now gonna repeat from there and\nsee what we can go.\n\n230\n00:13:46.607 --> 00:13:48.380\nIt's just kinda spidering out.\n\n231\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.570\n>> Yeah,\nyou could definitely look at it that way.\n\n232\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.300\nIs that, you can just keep going out,\nand out.\n\n233\n00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.466\nTo compromise other systems,\n\n234\n00:13:55.466 --> 00:13:59.882\nmaybe to plant other stuff in\nother places, what have you could\n\n235\n00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:05.110\nbe a number of things that happen\nonce you get past that first barrier.\n\n236\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.820\nCompromising a system, it's like,\nwhat does that system have around it, and\n\n237\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.940\nwhat can it see.\n\n238\n00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.545\nAnd just keep moving on,\nand on, and on, and on.\n\n239\n00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:17.830\nUntil you've got to the point where\nyou've accomplished your objective or\n\n240\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.460\nyou just keep going.\n\n241\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.288\nSo that's kind of the big part of this,\nbut yeah, we do have these other things\n\n242\n00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:27.000\nthat you can also use along the way,\ncuz remember this isn't just for fun and\n\n243\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.975\ngames, even though it almost\nseems like that at this point.\n\n244\n00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:32.590\nWe're just toying with them now.\n\n245\n00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.050\nThe ultimate objective is, and\nsince it is a pen testing tool,\n\n246\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:42.130\nis to have information we can take into\na report and do all that good stuff with.\n\n247\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.730\nAnd we saw that we can\neven get those things,\n\n248\n00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.330\ncuz we have the database being built\nbehind the scenes and all that good stuff.\n\n249\n00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.880\n>> And it's leveraging\nMetasploit in the background.\n\n250\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.440\nSo if we went into Metasploit, would\nwe have that same info in our database?\n\n251\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.520\nJust using that one database.\n\n252\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.630\n>> Metasploit does have access to the same\ndatabase, so you could pull it out.\n\n253\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.320\nAnd if you really look at it,\nmost of the stuff that you have,\n\n254\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.195\nArmitage is actually plugging into, since\nit's plugging directly into a Metasploit.\n\n255\n00:15:11.195 --> 00:15:13.960\nMetasploit has the same functionality.\n\n256\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.530\nThere's just a question\nof how do you unlock it.\n\n257\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.502\nAnd you could just gonna take a lot of,\nsome typing to get it out of there.\n\n258\n00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:23.868\nSo there is that.\n\n259\n00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:28.807\nJust to point some stuff out,\nother things out here, sort of odds and\n\n260\n00:15:28.807 --> 00:15:32.870\nends, you can do scripts in this,\nif you want.\n\n261\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.380\nIt does have the ability to\nbring scripts into it, so\n\n262\n00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:43.000\nyou can load your scripts into this stuff,\nand have them ready to go.\n\n263\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.580\nIf you have custom modules that you've\ncreated in Metasploit, this should see it.\n\n264\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.730\nIt shouldn't have any problem\nwith seeing that at all.\n\n265\n00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.600\nBasically, when you go over\nto the stuff we have sitting\n\n266\n00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.950\nover here on our side menu.\n\n267\n00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.640\nAnything that would show up.\n\n268\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.185\nAnd Metasploit, you can load in\nyou develop along the lines within\n\n269\n00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:12.340\ncertain guidelines I guess for\nMetasploit is a way to put it.\n\n270\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.270\nIt is gonna show up in there.\n\n271\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.280\nSo in essence when you create\nsomething for Metasploit,\n\n272\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.240\nyou are creating something that\ncan be used in Armitage, as well.\n\n273\n00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.020\n>> Oh, nice.\n\n274\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.910\nNice.\n\n275\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.310\nReally, do just meld together almost.\n\n276\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:30.538\n>> Yeah, it's a pretty good kind of\nlinkage or synergy between the two.\n\n277\n00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:35.451\nAnd you can't really complain about\nhaving something with this much\n\n278\n00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:38.932\npower at your fingertips\nto do your pen testing.\n\n279\n00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:40.940\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n280\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.620\nWell, Sean, I tell you.\n\n281\n00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.680\nThat's, again, just a ton of good\ninformation, dealing with Armitage.\n\n282\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.740\nReally looking forward to diving in and\nplaying with that a little bit more,\n\n283\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.595\nonce all this is over.\n\n284\n00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:53.640\n[LAUGH] This just looks like so much fun.\n\n285\n00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.560\nBut anyway, anything else we\nwanna throw in under this one,\n\n286\n00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.500\nbefore we call it an episode?\n\n287\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.310\n>> No, I can't say we have\nanything else really to throw in.\n\n288\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.390\nI mean, that was, I think, Armitage.\n\n289\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.692\nWe've done what we can do, at this point.\n\n290\n00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:10.400\nIt's kinda up to you guys to see\nwhere you're gonna take it from here.\n\n291\n00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.725\nI mean, there's just almost endless\npossibilities in here as there is with\n\n292\n00:17:14.725 --> 00:17:19.805\nMetasploit, so you gotta get to choose\nyour own path [LAUGH] at this point.\n\n293\n00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:22.775\n>> Absolutely, if you guys missed it, make\nsure you go back, there's at least two or\n\n294\n00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.160\nthree more episodes that\nwe've already filmed.\n\n295\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.664\nDealing with Armitage,\ntook it from beginning to end, so\n\n296\n00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:32.032\nmake sure you check all those\nvideos out in our library.\n\n297\n00:17:32.032 --> 00:17:35.280\nWell, for now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n298\n00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.300\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n299\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.858\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n300\n00:17:37.858

00:00:16.931\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:18.170\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.961\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.531\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:20.930\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.570\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.300\nContinuing on in our Metasploit series.\n\n10\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930\nIn this episode, Sean, we're gonna\ntalk about some advanced techniques,\n\n11\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.520\nI guess, that we can do with Metasploit.\n\n12\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.110\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.900\nThis is kind of to tell\nyou after watching all\n\n14\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.564\nthese episodes of us poking\naround Metasploit and\n\n15\n00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:47.610\ntoward the end with Armitage and\nall that good stuff,\n\n16\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.840\nyou've seen all these nice things and\nprobably mind numbing things,\n\n17\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.640\nin some sense, that Metasploit can do.\n\n18\n00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.550\nThe question is, what do you do after\nthis, after building this foundation.\n\n19\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.760\nAnd I'm well aware that a lot of you\nare probably gonna have to go back and\n\n20\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.740\npractice it a bit to kinda get your\nhead around some of this stuff, and\n\n21\n00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.420\nit's totally normal to do that.\n\n22\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.740\n>> So like three years from now,\n\n23\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770\nonce I've figured all this out-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380\n>> There's even more that\nwe can do with Metasploit.\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.590\n>> Yeah, there's a lot more\nto do with this product.\n\n26\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.990\nAnd so the question is,\nwhat are those other things?\n\n27\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.130\nWell those other things\nare pretty diverse and\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.990\nit's a question of just what\ndo you really want to pursue?\n\n29\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.410\nAnd see what you can get to happen.\n\n30\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.760\nI think that's kinda what we want.\n\n31\n00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.450\nWe wanna make sure we\nreally kinda get down, and\n\n32\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.300\nkinda give you some guidance\nof what options are there for\n\n33\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.970\nyou to push and\nmaybe just explore as you see fit.\n\n34\n00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.050\n>> Right.\n\n35\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.820\nI guess I know one of the things you've\ntalked about is there's several modules,\n\n36\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.150\nobviously, that come in Metasploit.\n\n37\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.370\nAnd we've talked that there's third\nparties that have created modules that we\n\n38\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.110\ncan actually add and then just add\nto the functionality of Metasploit.\n\n39\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.990\nAnd then we can even write our own.\n\n40\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.630\n>> Yeah.\nYou can write your own modules and\n\n41\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.600\nexploits, that is completely\nwithin the range of possibilities.\n\n42\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.300\nThat you can, if you wanna take\nthe time to learn how to do it,\n\n43\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.930\nthat is documented on how to do it.\n\n44\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.310\nYou can go over to Rapid Seven, and\n\n45\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.730\nthey have the stuffed document\non how you accomplish that.\n\n46\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.960\nAnd then there's a pretty robust community\nout there for developing stuff, so\n\n47\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.130\nyou can always ask questions on it.\n\n48\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.580\nAnd you could develop your own modules,\nand exploits for\n\n49\n00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.900\nspecific situations that\nyou might encounter.\n\n50\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.360\nAnd that's kind of a neat thing to do.\n\n51\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.800\nAnd that's on top of the ones that\nyou may get from other sources, and\n\n52\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.970\nyou can just create things and\ndrop them in.\n\n53\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.780\nAnd extend out Metasploit to do additional\nthings that it couldn't do before.\n\n54\n00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.430\nAnd now,\nyou put these things in to do your stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.300\nThat in itself adds\na lot of worth to this.\n\n56\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.060\n>> Absolutely I can see over time maybe\nwanting to tweak something or make it do\n\n57\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.970\nsomething that maybe is only really\nnecessary in your particular scenario.\n\n58\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.450\nAnd you have that capability, you're not\nstuck with the off the shelf stuff or\n\n59\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.040\nthe pre-developed module.\n\n60\n00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.370\n>> Yeah I think that's\nwith a lot of products,\n\n61\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.520\nthat's one of the big selling points\nis that if you can customize them,\n\n62\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.770\nget them to mold it to\nwhat you want it to do.\n\n63\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.470\nIt may not be entirely easy in every case,\nit may not be as easy as right clicking\n\n64\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.030\nand add a button here or here, but the\nfact it you can do it in a lot of cases.\n\n65\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.230\nSo while you may find\na product that might be pretty\n\n66\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.890\ndecent or be easier to use,\nit may not be customizable.\n\n67\n00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.320\nThis one definitely is customizable\nto a pretty reasonable degree.\n\n68\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.000\nAnd so that's something that\nyou can go ahead and explore.\n\n69\n00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000\nYes, you're gonna need programming skills,\nyou're gonna need knowledge of the product\n\n70\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720\nand all that,\nto really kinda understand it.\n\n71\n00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.000\nBut you can do that,\nwhich is the bottom line.\n\n72\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.980\nSo that's good enough right there.\n\n73\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.780\nIf you wanna pursue it, you can pursue it.\n\n74\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.330\n>> All right, good.\n\n75\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.370\nAnd then modules,\nit doesn't stop there, right?\n\n76\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.710\nIf we wanna develop our own exploits,\n\n77\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.760\nwe found out about a vulnerability through\nsome bug track, or something like that,\n\n78\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.490\nand want to try to develop our own\nexploit, we can do that as well.\n\n79\n00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.310\n>> Yeah, exploits, and\nthen the payloads that go with them.\n\n80\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.520\nThat's what's in your grasp, to do that,\nif you find those things, you can do that.\n\n81\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.440\nThose are something that If\nyou have the ability, again,\n\n82\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.980\njust like you did with modules, you\nhave the ability to create a module and\n\n83\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.580\nyou have the ability to find these\nvulnerability stuff like that, you could,\n\n84\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.820\nconceivably, add in your own\nexploits to the product and\n\n85\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.660\nhave those show up right aside of it and\nyou can use them.\n\n86\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.470\nThat gives you another level of capability\nthat just wasn't there from the get go.\n\n87\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.370\n>> Nice.\n\n88\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.140\nAnd one of the other things I\nreally like that we can do,\n\n89\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.490\nwe took a big look at Armitage, and we saw\nthat GUI front end from Metasploit and\n\n90\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.300\ndefinitely made it\nalmost fun to work with.\n\n91\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.080\nThe pretty pictures,\nthe right clicking and\n\n92\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760\nthe context menus that were filtered down,\nbased on what we were doing.\n\n93\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.290\nFantastic.\n\n94\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.850\nBut one of the things I can't do with\nthat GUI is start to automate things.\n\n95\n00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.870\nBut we do have that capability\nwithin Metasploit, right?\n\n96\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.440\n>> Yeah, you can.\n\n97\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.480\nThere's, I mean, it's.\n\n98\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.080\n>> When I say automate.\n\n99\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.450\n>> There's automation.\n\n100\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.290\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's a minor amount, or\n\n101\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.740\nsome degree of automation\nthat Armitage does.\n\n102\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.990\nBut you're talking about\nthe more advanced stuff.\n\n103\n00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.920\nYou really want to be daisy\nchain a lot more stuff together.\n\n104\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.070\nAnd just run an exploit, and\n\n105\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.325\nopen up a shell in a quick rapid\nsuccession, things like that.\n\n106\n00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:52.110\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n107\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.710\nFind that machine, throw on that exploit,\ndeliver that payload.\n\n108\n00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.280\nHave Netcat send over a copy\nof a couple of the files over.\n\n109\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.390\nDo this, that, close it down, and done.\n\n110\n00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.580\nYeah you can do that.\n\n111\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.740\n>> Yeah, you can create your own\nscripts to do that, plus other stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.870\nThat's something that if you really\nwanna kind of push into that, you can.\n\n113\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.800\nYou have to know the correct programming\nlanguages and stuff like that to do it.\n\n114\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.710\nBut again, that's something out there that\nyou can do it, and I'm not a programmer.\n\n115\n00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.110\nI don't claim to be.\n\n116\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.935\nWell, heck you guys don't know,\nI'm a programmer.\n\n117\n00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:30.158\n>> [LAUGH] At least as far as you know.\n\n118\n00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:35.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I program the heck out of stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.870\nBut you have to know, you'll have\nto have a grasp of programming, and\n\n120\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.340\ntheir concepts, and\nthen know their scripting language.\n\n121\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.300\nIt may not be as nasty as creating\na whole module or exploit might be.\n\n122\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.530\nBut you do have the ability to do that\nif you want to create your own scripts.\n\n123\n00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.890\nAnd as you may have seen in Armitage,\nyou can just click a button and\n\n124\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.470\nload the scripts in there, and\nthen just go ahead and start running them.\n\n125\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.800\nIf you find that you are doing\ncertain tasks regularly,\n\n126\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.570\nyou can create script for it and\nsave yourself a lot of time.\n\n127\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.240\n>> Absolutley.\nI always like the ability to automate.\n\n128\n00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.940\nWhen I say automate, obviously not\nthe entire task, but as much as I can.\n\n129\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.940\nSo if there's a repeatable\ntasks that I have to do,\n\n130\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.580\nI always like to look into\nmy scripting options.\n\n131\n00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.694\nThose fantastic,\nthat I can one do those Metasploit and\n\n132\n00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.485\ntwo that I can bring that script\ninto Armitage and run it from there.\n\n133\n00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:30.204\nSo that's pretty darn cool.\n\n134\n00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:33.484\n>> They actually used to, in this product,\n\n135\n00:07:33.484 --> 00:07:38.934\nfrom everything I've seen,\nthey took it out for a specific reason.\n\n136\n00:07:38.934 --> 00:07:42.809\nBut they used to actually when you say you\ndon't wanna automate the whole attack,\n\n137\n00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:46.291\nthey actually used to have something,\nyou guys can look it up if you want,\n\n138\n00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.729\nif you can get a previous\nversion you can try it out.\n\n139\n00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:50.285\nIt's something called Autopwn.\n\n140\n00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.014\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n141\n00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:55.881\nyou can gather certain information\nthen just basically hit a button.\n\n142\n00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:59.526\nAnd it will run [LAUGH] any text for you.\n\n143\n00:07:59.526 --> 00:08:02.020\nSo you just,\nit'll just keep throwing stuff at it.\n\n144\n00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.576\nKinda like that Hail Mary\nwe saw in Armitage,\n\n145\n00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:08.830\nit will do something along those lines,\na little more advanced than that.\n\n146\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.760\nBut, it will do that for you.\n\n147\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.440\nThey said they took it out\nbecause they said it was,\n\n148\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.010\nit could cause damage in the systems and\ncrash them, and do other nastiness.\n\n149\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.212\nSo they took it out.\n\n150\n00:08:20.212 --> 00:08:23.250\nBut apparently,\n\n151\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.640\nfrom what I've seen from the other side,\npeople were asking about that.\n\n152\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.830\nApparently, someone decided\nto keep a fork active\n\n153\n00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.120\nthat still has that in\nit with the new version.\n\n154\n00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.630\nSo if you look around,\napparently you can get it.\n\n155\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.550\nI haven't looked for it myself, but it is,\napparently it is there in the new version.\n\n156\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.190\nBut, it's just kind of unsupported, so\n\n157\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.830\nif you wanna try something like that\nto really automate the whole attack.\n\n158\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.000\nIf you decide that you\njust totally wanna [LAUGH]\n\n159\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.160\ndo all in the dirt stuff,\nyeah, ust do it that way.\n\n160\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.150\n>> Boy, I tell you.\n\n161\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.058\nThe chances of disaster there, fat\nfinger one of the IP addresses in there,\n\n162\n00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:02.754\nand hit auto attack, and all of a sudden.\n\n163\n00:09:02.754 --> 00:09:05.526\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can do without that,\n\n164\n00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:08.354\nI like what they have so far, right now.\n\n165\n00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:10.884\n>> Yeah, and\nit almost gives you a sense at that point,\n\n166\n00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.600\nthat you're not even working for\nit really, anymore.\n\n167\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.971\nYou're just like, [SOUND] hit and then,\n\n168\n00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:20.270\njust do an Alt+Tab over your favorite\ngame, and then just wait [LAUGH].\n\n169\n00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.030\n>> You're taking all the fun\nout of it at that point, right?\n\n170\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.946\nI don't even feel like\nI'm a pen tester now.\n\n171\n00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:27.547\n>> Yeah,\nyou're basically a monkey running it.\n\n172\n00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:29.195\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n173\n00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:30.937\nSo, we can develop modules.\n\n174\n00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.630\nWe can develop exploits.\n\n175\n00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.556\nWe can start creating scripts\nto automate some of this stuff.\n\n176\n00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:40.503\nWhat else can we do with Metasploit\nonce we've really got a good grip on it?\n\n177\n00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:45.447\n>> Well, I'd kinda like to circle around\nto something that was mentioned in\n\n178\n00:09:45.447 --> 00:09:50.073\nthe first couple episodes that we\ndid of this whole series was talking\n\n179\n00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:54.080\nabout places where you might\nsee Metasploit being useful.\n\n180\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.152\nAnd outside of pen testing, and\n\n181\n00:09:56.152 --> 00:10:00.460\none of the places that it has proven\nuseful is in software testing.\n\n182\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.750\nThere are software developers\nthat have used this to give\n\n183\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.530\ntheir software packages kind\nof a kick in the pants and\n\n184\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.240\ntest them out before they leave the\nfactory or whatever you want to call it.\n\n185\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.250\nSo that's something else\nthat it's used for.\n\n186\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.470\nYou're still basically using it\nas a pen testing utility, but\n\n187\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.420\nyou're doing it right there before\nsomething even goes out into the wild.\n\n188\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.240\nAnd that's the audience\nthat I've run into,\n\n189\n00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.010\na reasonable amount of times I've run in\nto when talking about this type of stuff.\n\n190\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.090\nAnd those guys even develop their own\nspecific modules and exploits, and\n\n191\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.130\nall that to really poke at and\ncheck their own software.\n\n192\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.640\nSo that's where kind of\nthose two things meet.\n\n193\n00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.120\nIf you're doing software development\nalready on something else,\n\n194\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.410\nyou probably have\nthe skills to go ahead and\n\n195\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.020\ncreate something in Metaspoit just\nby doing a little bit of review.\n\n196\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.030\nYou could do that, and\n\n197\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.650\nthen you could bring those two things\ntogether to test your software\n\n198\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.740\nto see what type of issues it might have,\nor if there's any vulnerabilities into it.\n\n199\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.550\nWhich is just a great ability for\nyou to have and\n\n200\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.260\nanother tool in hour arsenal for\ndoing Q&A in that side of things.\n\n201\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.780\n>> Absolutely, and there's probably\nnot going to be a whole lot.\n\n202\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.740\nI mean, some of the modules might work\nagainst your application because if it's\n\n203\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.060\na general purpose type thing.\n\n204\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.630\nbut being able to develop a module that's\nspecific to your software that you're\n\n205\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.740\ndeveloping and really hammer it out,\nthat's fantastic.\n\n206\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.540\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n207\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.410\n>> Very good.\n\n208\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.160\nAnd they you got wireless listed on here.\n\n209\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.850\nWhat do we need to know about\nwireless in Metasploit?\n\n210\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.400\nThat was an area that I\nfelt we needed to mention.\n\n211\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.020\nWhen we kind of wrap things up here,\nsomething I felt we needed to mention\n\n212\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.510\nbecause it wasn't talked about\nanytime during this whole series.\n\n213\n00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.560\nAnd some of you may have wondered\nwhy it wasn't talked about or\n\n214\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.680\nwondering if they could even\ndo anything with wireless.\n\n215\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.060\nAnd the thing is that Metasploit does\nhave stuff that it can do with wireless.\n\n216\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.940\nThere's something actually\ncalled Karmetasploit,\n\n217\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.850\nthat you can find out there that\nallows you to do stuff with\n\n218\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.470\nwireless applications and environments.\n\n219\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.890\nIt's designed for that.\n\n220\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.130\nSo, you can actually find that out there\nand you can take your knowledge over\n\n221\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.660\nto that, and really go to town\nwith that aspect of it too.\n\n222\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.620\nSo, that's something else kind of\nawaiting you if you really wanna get\n\n223\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.680\ninto doing that side.\n\n224\n00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.230\n>> That's a plugin for Metasploit,\nor that's a separate application for\n\n225\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.070\nMetasploit?\n\n226\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.940\n>> It's something that you can,\nit's basically a separate plugin.\n\n227\n00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.440\n>> Okay.\n\n228\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.310\nVery nice, very nice.\n\n229\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.080\nAll right,\nwell the fun doesn't stop, right?\n\n230\n00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.960\nI mean, we got a bunch of great episodes.\n\n231\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.220\nWe go all kinds of things we\ncan do with Metasploit, and\n\n232\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.590\nnow we just learned that even once we\nmaster all of that, we're still not done.\n\n233\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.140\nWe can start writing our own modules,\nour own exploits, we can script.\n\n234\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.870\nWe can bring in wireless, just crazy.\n\n235\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.890\nSo Sean,\nif I wanna really start playing with this.\n\n236\n00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.710\nI don't know, we've kind of seen your\nenvironment that you've got set up on\n\n237\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.850\nyour machine.\n\n238\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.380\nGive us some suggestions on what we might\ndo to set up a good lab environment,\n\n239\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.170\nto be able to play and experiment with\nsome of these different options without\n\n240\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.105\ntearing up my own home network.\n\n241\n00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:18.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully,\n\n242\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.050\nwe're not doing this at work unless\nwe have permission, of course.\n\n243\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.440\nBut, I don't wanna destroy any\nnetworks just trying to learn it.\n\n244\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.925\nSo what's a good way to set all this up?\n\n245\n00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:30.370\n>> Well if you think about it, if you use\nthis at your work, you technically aren't\n\n246\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.815\nusing actual work because they're\ngonna fire you pretty soon.\n\n247\n00:13:32.815 --> 00:13:36.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's always a loophole to it,\n\n248\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.670\nif you look at the right way, folks.\n\n249\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.300\nThat's what I'm teaching.\n\n250\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.810\n>> Right.\n\n251\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.240\n>> But,\nas far as setting up a lab environment,\n\n252\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.140\nthere's a lot of ways\nyou can go about this.\n\n253\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.460\nIt's kind of you've got\na blank check to do this.\n\n254\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.860\nYou can do something along the lines\nof what I had on my system, or\n\n255\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.280\nI had that Metasploitable system.\n\n256\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.750\nAnd then, I had a Windows XP SP2 system.\n\n257\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.150\nThen, I had a couple ones that\nI downloaded from Microsoft cuz\n\n258\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:14.250\nMicrosoft has some virtual machines that\nyou can download that are time bombed.\n\n259\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.210\nAnd if you have access to the MSDN stuff,\n\n260\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.830\nyou could even download stuff\nfrom there and try it out.\n\n261\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.040\nAnd you can get combinations\nof the base operating system,\n\n262\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.090\nplus SQL Server on it, or Exchange,\nor something like it on it.\n\n263\n00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.240\nAnd test those out,\ncuz those are things that,\n\n264\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.340\nthere's tools in there\nto look at that too.\n\n265\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.250\nSo, you've got a lot of ways\nyou can set this thing up.\n\n266\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.460\nI would recommend, though,\nif you're starting from scratch.\n\n267\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.800\nBefore you get into doing\nsome of those more advanced\n\n268\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.590\nthings where you're testing against\ndatabases and stuff like that.\n\n269\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.540\nMaybe you do wanna go the route\nof getting Metasplotiable, and\n\n270\n00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.383\nmaybe have an XP system like an XPSP2\nsystem because a lot of the exploits that\n\n271\n00:14:57.383 --> 00:15:00.234\nare in there work quite\neasily against that.\n\n272\n00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:04.300\nAnd you can use Metasploitable for\nthe same reason.\n\n273\n00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.290\nThere's a lot of stuff that\nwill work against that.\n\n274\n00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:11.050\nSo you can try those things and\nuse those to get a feel for, and\n\n275\n00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.270\nget more higher comfort level\nwith Metasploit itself.\n\n276\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.060\nOnce you've got that, and got that comfort\nlevel and you've got an idea where things\n\n277\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:24.040\nare, and you're not just poking around and\ngoing around in the dark looking for it.\n\n278\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.440\nThen, you might move on to doing some\nof these other set ups like 2008,\n\n279\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.830\n2012 server with SQL Server on it,\n\n280\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.800\nor something with IES or\na Linux system with Apache running on it.\n\n281\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.490\nAnd you just go on and on and on and on.\n\n282\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.380\nYou can even put custom\nsoftware applications,\n\n283\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.914\ntest plug-ins and browsers for\nyour client side attacks.\n\n284\n00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:50.302\nYou can really start customizing your\nenvironment to a pretty high degree,\n\n285\n00:15:50.302 --> 00:15:54.343\nbut I would recommend you start\nwith some systems that you\n\n286\n00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:57.220\nknow there's vulnerabilities there.\n\n287\n00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.538\nAnd you can use those things\nto gain your confidence and\n\n288\n00:16:02.538 --> 00:16:09.020\nyour knowledge of the system before\nyou move on to the other stuff.\n\n289\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.880\nI mean, you can jump right in and start\nbeating your head against the wall and\n\n290\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.100\ndo it that way and\nsome people will do it that way.\n\n291\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.150\nAnd there is nothing wrong with that.\n\n292\n00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.490\nBut, I tend to think,\ninstead of just poking around and\n\n293\n00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.540\nnot being able to get anywhere, maybe\ngetting somewhere, you don't really know.\n\n294\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.020\nAnd so, if you get Net Exploitable and\nmaybe an XP system out there that you know\n\n295\n00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.280\nthat there's stuff written for\nthat, and they're also documented.\n\n296\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.320\nNet Exploitable is fully documented, or\n\n297\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.140\nreasonably documented,\ngo and look at it that way.\n\n298\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.100\nIt's documented, so you know what\nvulnerabilities are there and\n\n299\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.790\nhow they should show.\n\n300\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.670\nSo, you can try the same things and\nknow what you should be getting\n\n301\n00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.560\nback on the screen and\nknow what those results look like.\n\n302\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.440\nSo you can kind of see, okay,\nwell if I work these steps and\n\n303\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.850\nI'm getting this back I\nknow I am successful.\n\n304\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.560\nRather than go to some system that you\ndon't know what vulnerabilities are there\n\n305\n00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.580\nand you're poking around and\nyou get a result back.\n\n306\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.300\nIt's like, what does that mean?\n\n307\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.490\nIs that actually an error?\n\n308\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.750\nIs that a real vulnerability?\n\n309\n00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.450\nYou know, what is it?\n\n310\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.840\nSo that's kind of why I recommend\nstarting at those places and\n\n311\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.550\njust bumping it up from there.\n\n312\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.660\n>> That's a really good point.\n\n313\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.630\nIf I start out trying to do all this\nagainst a Server 2012 machine and I've\n\n314\n00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.280\nnever really seen it work before, I don't\nknow if I'm getting incorrect results,\n\n315\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.246\nif I'm even typing the commands\nincorrectly, am I doing this right?\n\n316\n00:17:29.246 --> 00:17:33.020\nSo good idea is to start out with the\nknown vulnerable systems, get a feel for\n\n317\n00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.640\nthe way the tools are supposed to work\nwhen the vulnerability is there and\n\n318\n00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.520\nwe're allowed to take advantage of it.\n\n319\n00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.630\nAnd then that's gonna help us interpret\nthe results when we're going against\n\n320\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.170\nunknown systems, systems that we don't\nknow whether they're vulnerable or not.\n\n321\n00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:45.830\nYeah.\nGreat idea.\n\n322\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.410\nI like that.\n\n323\n00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.090\nAll right Sean, again,\na lot of great information.\n\n324\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.490\nAnything else you wanna throw in this\nepisode before we wrap things up?\n\n325\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.510\n>> Well,\nnow it's really kinda up to you guys\n\n326\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.320\nto go through and try all your\ndifferent things that you've seen.\n\n327\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.920\nAnd try new stuff.\n\n328\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.420\nYou'll see that there's so\n\n329\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.180\nmany things that we unfortunately\nweren't able to get into.\n\n330\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.550\nWe could do a month's\nworth of episodes on this.\n\n331\n00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.680\nBut that's not practical.\n\n332\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.280\n>> You just wanna move to Florida?\n\n333\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.525\nThen we can do as many as you want, Sean.\n\n334\n00:18:22.525 --> 00:18:24.293\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I've got new levels and\n\n335\n00:18:24.293 --> 00:18:26.562\nstuff I've gotta reach with\nmy palette in that home.\n\n336\n00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:27.503\nI can't be doing this.\n\n337\n00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:28.722\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, yeah.\n\n338\n00:18:28.722 --> 00:18:32.226\n[LAUGH]\n>> We can't take you away from that,\n\n339\n00:18:32.226 --> 00:18:32.866\nit's true.\n\n340\n00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:35.200\n>> So I've already fully\nleveled up as the pen tester.\n\n341\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n342\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.170\nthere's so\nmany things you can do with this.\n\n343\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.220\nThere's so many routes you can go.\n\n344\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.730\nIt really is up to you.\n\n345\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.150\nSo, you can try the stuff that\nwe just recommended here.\n\n346\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.900\nYou could try other things.\n\n347\n00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.690\nYou might look to see what other\npeople are doing with this.\n\n348\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.590\nI mean, there's all sorts of guidances and\n\n349\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:06.570\nstuff that people have issued\nto do what have you with this.\n\n350\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.690\nYou might even try,\n\n351\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.740\nafter going through Metasploit a bit and\ngetting comfortable with it.\n\n352\n00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.380\nYou might try applying it back towards\nthe stuff that we talked about in\n\n353\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.210\nthe CEH to see if you could accomplish\nthose same tasks with Metasploit or\n\n354\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.240\nyou can enhance those same\ntasks with Metasploit.\n\n355\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.160\nAfter you do that, or if you don't want to\ndo that, you can go to the forensics side.\n\n356\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.200\nForensics side,\n\n357\n00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.180\nwe mentioned Metasploit in there,\nMetasploit can be used to do forensics.\n\n358\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.180\nEven anti forensics,\nit has that capability.\n\n359\n00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.480\nSo, you can see how it would\nhelp you in that line of work.\n\n360\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.490\nSo, you do have options here on where you\nwant to move next, but make sure you get\n\n361\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:54.300\nthat foundation first before you\nmove to that, because you really\n\n362\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.410\nneed to have a good comfort level with it\nbefore you start trying to tackle that.\n\n363\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.650\nBut, you've got to choose, and remember,\n\n364\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.880\nif you do get stuck some place, and\nyou're looking for any sort of help or\n\n365\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.780\nassistance, I will issue you\na word of caution on this,\n\n366\n00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.520\nis that there is a lot of\ndocumentation online about this.\n\n367\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.800\nThere's books out there on this.\n\n368\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.390\nBut you have to be careful.\n\n369\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.760\nA lot of those books may have\nbeen written for back track,\n\n370\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.120\nwith Metasploit on it, or it was written\nfor something around that time frame.\n\n371\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.410\nSome of them say, oh,\nit's Kali with Metasploit, but\n\n372\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.500\nit may have been a time when\nKali was an earlier version, and\n\n373\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:43.730\nhad an earlier version of Metasploit\non it than what we have here.\n\n374\n00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.860\nAnd so that can lead you down\nsome pretty crazy paths, or\n\n375\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.365\nsome really just bad outcomes\nwhere you get stuck.\n\n376\n00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:56.205\nWhen we talked way back in\nour first couple episodes,\n\n377\n00:20:56.205 --> 00:21:01.485\nI mentioned some of these command line\nutilities that had been deprecated,\n\n378\n00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:05.127\nand just yanked out or\nreplaced with something else.\n\n379\n00:21:05.127 --> 00:21:07.917\nThere's almost every book\nI've seen with Kali and\n\n380\n00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:10.627\nI went through several books on Amazon,\nfor\n\n381\n00:21:10.627 --> 00:21:16.330\nexample, that are available not for\nKali but for Metasploit, I looked at them.\n\n382\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.850\nAlmost every one of them I saw refers to,\nin fact every one of them.\n\n383\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.820\nI'm not gonna say almost every one.\n\n384\n00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.470\nI'm gonna say every one of them refers to\nstuff that either has been deprecated or\n\n385\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.200\njust doesn't exist in the product anymore.\n\n386\n00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.700\nIt's in there.\n\n387\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.914\nThere like basically little bombs\nsitting there for you to trip over.\n\n388\n00:21:32.914 --> 00:21:33.816\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n389\n00:21:33.816 --> 00:21:36.830\nit's something that you\nhave to be careful with.\n\n390\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.440\nNow fortunately, you look at,\nif you go to the right spot in line,\n\n391\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.920\nyou can find good documentation.\n\n392\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.360\nOne of the ones I found that was actually\npretty good is Offensive Security.\n\n393\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.940\nThey do have a pretty good\ndocumentation up there.\n\n394\n00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.760\nSo, if you're looking for\n\n395\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.510\ndocumentation on Metasploit,\nthat might be your first destination.\n\n396\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.290\nThere are other places\nthat have documentation.\n\n397\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.060\nI saw that there's somebody out there\nwriting a Wiki on it, but it doesn't look\n\n398\n00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.580\nlike it's really progressed all that far,\nso that's kind of questionable.\n\n399\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.690\nBut, do be careful when you're doing this.\n\n400\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.860\nIf it refers to back track anywhere in it,\nI'd be kind of wary.\n\n401\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.001\nI'm not saying don't use it,\nI'm saying be kind of wary of it.\n\n402\n00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:22.727\nIf it doesn't refer to that and you're\nhaving an issue where you're trying to\n\n403\n00:22:22.727 --> 00:22:25.945\nfind a command or something doesn't work,\nyou might wanna look and\n\n404\n00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:30.170\nsee if that command actually exists or\nanyone else is having a problem with it.\n\n405\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.700\nSo, just a little gotchas there.\n\n406\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.080\nI don't want you guys to get\nfrustrated with anything here.\n\n407\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.740\nSo be very, very, very careful.\n\n408\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.160\nAnd yeah, I see David here looking\nthrough the Kindle editions.\n\n409\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.390\nThe Kindle editions,\nthat's what I looked at.\n\n410\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.620\nEvery one of the Kindle\neditions I have had\n\n411\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:56.070\nreferences to stuff that was either gone,\ndeprecated, or something.\n\n412\n00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.060\nAnd it wasn't the whole book.\n\n413\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.360\nDoesn't mean the whole book was bad.\n\n414\n00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.910\nIt just means that there were spots in\nthere that, if you're progressing through\n\n415\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.190\nit and reading it, you'd be going\ndown the path and all of a sudden,\n\n416\n00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.820\njust boom, you'd hit your head\nagainst something basically, and\n\n417\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.860\nyou're stuck trying to\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n418\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.920\nAnd it's because that was gone.\n\n419\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:19.050\nSo, it's just something to be very,\nvery careful of, if you're doing this.\n\n420\n00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.000\nCuz, in my opinion, if you're someone\nwho picks up one of those books,\n\n421\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.610\nyou're probably relatively new to this.\n\n422\n00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.850\nAnd, you're going through it and\nyou don't necessarily know what works and\n\n423\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.480\nwhat doesn't.\n\n424\n00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.960\nThat's what you got the book for.\n\n425\n00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.140\nSo you're going through that book and all\nof a sudden, something doesn't work and\n\n426\n00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.840\nyou think you're the one that screwed up.\n\n427\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.349\nAnd so you go, this book can't be wrong,\nyou're trying everything,\n\n428\n00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:48.534\nyou get frustrated and all this stuff, and\nthen you find out from asking someone or\n\n429\n00:23:48.534 --> 00:23:51.639\nwhat have you,\nthat the book is actually wrong.\n\n430\n00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:52.591\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n431\n00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:56.410\n>> And so that's a bad situation to be in.\n\n432\n00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.600\nAnd so, be very careful with that,\n\n433\n00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.480\nand right now I don't have any of\nthe books that are out now on Metasploit.\n\n434\n00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.450\nI really to kinda address David's\nquestion in the chatroom,\n\n435\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.290\nI don't really have any that I\nwould recommend, to be honest.\n\n436\n00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.650\nIf you guys want to take a look at it.\n\n437\n00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.180\nYou know, any of the ones that\nare out there, go ahead, but\n\n438\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.700\nI don't have any ones that I would really\nbe comfortable recommending because I know\n\n439\n00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.730\nthere's problems with each and\nevery one of them.\n\n440\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.969\nIt does look like there's some coming\nout later this year and there's some\n\n441\n00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:32.760\ncoming out in January of next year which,\nwell obviously, it's kind of a ways off.\n\n442\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.152\nBut those ones look like\nthey're more up to date.\n\n443\n00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:38.710\nSo, there you go.\n\n444\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.130\nAnd by the way my book's\ncoming out in September so\n\n445\n00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.651\nyou got something to do\nbefore then anyways.\n\n446\n00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.459\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's good that those are coming out.\n\n447\n00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:45.853\nThey can't come out on my release date.\n\n448\n00:24:45.853 --> 00:24:48.114\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\n\n449\n00:24:48.114 --> 00:24:52.020\ngentleman we hope you\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n450\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.430\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n451\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.510\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n452\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:56.515\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n453\n00:24:56.515 -->
