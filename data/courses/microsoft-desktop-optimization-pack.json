          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:04.216\nWe're here\n\n2\n00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:07.860\nto present to you an overview of\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n3\n00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.260\nThis is gonna be a new tech\nskills show for us, so\n\n4\n00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.730\nthat we can actually help you understand\nwhat this product is really all about, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.410\nhere to help us out better\nis gonna be Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060\nWes, who is this particular show really\nfor, and what topics will we be covering?\n\n7\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is an interesting tech\nskill, because one of the things you might\n\n8\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.100\nfind out there is, there is plenty of, I\nwould say, textual information about MDOP.\n\n9\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.560\nBut one of the things it's lacking,\nis more video content, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.380\nit is something that,\nit does rear its head from time to time.\n\n11\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.190\nSo this going to be focused on anybody\nthat wants a little bit better of\n\n12\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.590\nan understanding of Microsoft's Enterprise\nsuite of technologies,\n\n13\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710\nknown as\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n14\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.370\nIt helps you to manage things\nlike the user experience.\n\n15\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.930\nFor instance, desktop applications, things\nlike virtualization, as well as managing\n\n16\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.820\na lot of the features that you'll find\ninside of your Windows environments.\n\n17\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790\nKeep in mind that the viewer\nis gonna be introduced to,\n\n18\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.220\nnot just a single technology.\n\n19\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.680\nI know we call this\nMicrosoft Desktop Optimization Pack,\n\n20\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.470\nbut keep in mind it could\nalso be renamed a toolkit,\n\n21\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.260\nbecause it has many different applications\nor products, all bundled into one.\n\n22\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.020\nFor instance, user experience\nvirtualization is gonna be one of those\n\n23\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.290\nthings that we'll be looking at,\nsometimes called UEV.\n\n24\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.640\nIt's a way that I can take settings,\nand I can virtualize them, and\n\n25\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.950\nhave those settings follow me\nwhen I go to different computers.\n\n26\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.330\nIt's a real handy tool.\n\n27\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.203\nThings like AppV.\n\n28\n00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:31.230\nMaybe you've heard of this.\n\n29\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.100\nThis is the Application Virtualization.\n\n30\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.510\nI need to virtualize an application,\nbut maybe I don't want to put it into\n\n31\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.200\na hypervisor, and, you know, virtualize\nthe whole entire operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.990\nSo this is a good way that you could take\napplications, and in a more modular sense,\n\n33\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.660\nyou can virtualise each\nindividual one if you need to.\n\n34\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.533\nSome of the other topics that\nwe'll be looking at, is MBAM.\n\n35\n00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.641\nThat is, the Microsoft BitLocker,\nan administration and\n\n36\n00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.141\nmonitoring kit you can use.\n\n37\n00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:59.467\nIt's, maybe you've heard of BitLocker\ninside of the Windows operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:03.975\nwell, BitLocker, unless you're in group\npolicy, is kind of a decentralized type of\n\n39\n00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:07.770\nmanagement system, and it's usually\non a computer to computer basis.\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.740\nBut what this does, the MBAM Software,\nis it allows you to scale up to\n\n41\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.170\nlarge enterprises, and\ncentrally manage BitLocker keys and\n\n42\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890\nBitLocker encryptions that are in\nyour Enterprise level environment.\n\n43\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.570\nWe'll look at another tool, that,\none of my personal favorites in the MDOP\n\n44\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.930\nplatform, is something known as\nthe Diagnostic and Recovery Toolkit.\n\n45\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.120\nAnd this is a great way that,\nlike it says,\n\n46\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.470\nyou can diagnose different problems that\nhappen inside of the Windows environment.\n\n47\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230\nSo, we've got more than just that,\nbut keep in mind\n\n48\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.240\nthat some of the topics that you can see\ninside of the MDOP series coming up.\n\n49\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, is there any particular\nexam that's associated with this?\n\n50\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.700\nOr are we just really talking\nabout learning the skills itself?\n\n51\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.920\n&gt;&gt; I would say the latter's probably gonna\nbe true, we're gonna be looking more at\n\n52\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040\nthe skills that you need, and\njust kind of looking at the technology,\n\n53\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.660\nnot really exam-centric on this one,\nbut I will throw a word of caution.\n\n54\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080\nOne of the things that I've seen, and\nif you've taken previous Windows client\n\n55\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.260\ncertifications, MDOP sometimes\ndoes rear it's head on the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.000\nSo, while this isn't specific to any\ncertification, keep in mind any time\n\n57\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.910\nyou're managing a Windows 10 client\noperating system, if you're studying for\n\n58\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.260\nthat very certification,\nthis can help to expand your knowledge.\n\n59\n00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.955\nSo, if that's something you wanna\nknow a little bit more about,\n\n60\n00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:20.405\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack,\nstick around,\n\n61\n00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.589\ncuz we got a lot more to come.\n\n",

comes into another\nexciting episode of IT PRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.595\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are beginning\n\n5\n00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:24.505\nour series on\nMicrosoft's Desk-top Optimization Package.\n\n6\n00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.205\nJoining me in the studio to help\nus with that very endeavor and\n\n7\n00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:29.990\nbe our guiding star Is our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.840\nWes, welcome to the show,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.720\n>> It's going great Dan.\n\n10\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.930\nAnd as always, it's good to be\nhere in the studios at IT PRO.TV.\n\n11\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.800\nAnd that's right, we have a bunch of\ndifferent technologies that are bundled\n\n12\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.050\nup in MDOP, like you heard Dan say,\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n13\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920\nAnd one of the first of those\ncomponents that we're gonna be diving\n\n14\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.420\ninto is one that, well,\nwhen it comes to MDOP in general,\n\n15\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.350\nwell, we'll just step back here before\nwe get into something known as MBAND.\n\n16\n00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.230\nMicrosoft desktop optimization pack, it's\ngot a lot of different utilities in it and\n\n17\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.510\nit's really only available to\na select demographic of people,\n\n18\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.130\ncustomers if you will, by Microsoft.\n\n19\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.290\nSo it can be a little bit challenging when\nit comes to learning the topics out there.\n\n20\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.400\nNow out on Tech Net they got all\nkinds of white papers you can\n\n21\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.718\nread about the different\ncomponents in here.\n\n22\n00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:22.430\nBut there again, as far as\nthe technology itself, you have to be\n\n23\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.710\na software assurance customer or a volume\nlicensed customer to get access to MDOT or\n\n24\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.690\nyou have to have an access to\nan MSDN subscription there, and\n\n25\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.150\nthen you can get access\nto the software itself.\n\n26\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.270\nSo what we wanna do is we kinda wanna\nwalk you through, in this series,\n\n27\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.160\nthrough all of the different components\nthat you'll find, or the technologies,\n\n28\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.570\nI should say, inside of MDOP.\n\n29\n00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.260\nAnd the first one that we're gonna be\nworking with today is something known as\n\n30\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.510\nMicrosoft's BitLocker,\nadministration and monitoring.\n\n31\n00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.690\nNow, you might have heard\nit abbreviated MBAM.\n\n32\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.250\nNow, don't get that confused with\nanother MBAM, and in fact, Dan and\n\n33\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.300\nI were talking about this.\n\n34\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.620\nWhen you do a Google search for MBAM,\nyou're going to find Malwarebytes.\n\n35\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.780\nMalwarebytes is what a lot of\ntimes we've known over the past,\n\n36\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.360\ngosh I wanna say decade or\nso has been the acronym.\n\n37\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.180\nBut MBAM for us is gonna be bitlocker\nadministration and monitoring.\n\n38\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.810\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna start out with.\n\n39\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.350\nThis is a great suite of Enterprise\nlevel technology, if you will,\n\n40\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.330\nthat allows you to centrally\nmanage BitLocker in general.\n\n41\n00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.320\nNow, if you aren't\nfamiliar with BitLocker,\n\n42\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.360\nwe'll just gonna brief you over on that.\n\n43\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.190\nDefinitely go back and take a look at some\nof our Windows Client episodes out there\n\n44\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300\ncuz we definitely cover BitLocker\nfrom the client side pretty in-depth.\n\n45\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.320\nBut remember, that is Microsoft's\ndrive encryption technology, and\n\n46\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.800\nwhen it comes to drive encryption,\nwe need certain\n\n47\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.080\npasswords to be able to access these\ndrives after they're encrypted.\n\n48\n00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.570\nAnd one of the things that can\npotentially happen is, it could become\n\n49\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.380\nnightmare the more and more of your\ndevices that you implement BitLocker on.\n\n50\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.520\nSo because of that fact we\nneed a place where it's not\n\n51\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.430\ndecentralized in any way and\nit's just centralized.\n\n52\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.640\nAnd if you have 10 devices,\nif you 100 devices, 500 devices,\n\n53\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.680\nyou want to be able to manage the\nencryption keys and also provide a way for\n\n54\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.140\nrecovery if somebody happens to\nlose access to their password.\n\n55\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.900\nWell do they lose access to their data?\n\n56\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.610\nWell for the most part if we don't\nhave some kind of recovery in place,\n\n57\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.870\nthen they will lose access to\ntheir information and Dan I know,\n\n58\n00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.270\nwe have talked about this before there are\na couple of things that go on in security,\n\n59\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.840\nwell there's quite a few\nthings that go on in security.\n\n60\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.950\nBut two of the things we have,\nthe more secure you make something\n\n61\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.560\nwell sometimes it can make it\nchallenging on the end users as well.\n\n62\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.100\nSo we want to implement encryption but\n\n63\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.040\nat the same time we want people to\nhave access to their information.\n\n64\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.750\nIf, they first of all if they need it,\n\n65\n00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.160\nsecond of all if they\nhappen to lose passwords,\n\n66\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.290\nwe want a way that they can recover\nthat information so they regain access.\n\n67\n00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.050\nSo, Dan one of the first things we're\ngonna do is we're gonna look at some of\n\n68\n00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.010\nthe components that we have inside\nof the Microsoft BitLocker,\n\n69\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.780\nadministration and monitoring.\n\n70\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.690\n>> Yeah, Wes, you mentioned central or\ncentralization, should I say,\n\n71\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.120\nwe don't want things decentralized.\n\n72\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.800\nAnd when I think Microsoft and\n\n73\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.780\ndecentralization, I'm thinking server,\nI'm thinking domain controller.\n\n74\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.400\nAnd that's obviously one of probably the\nbiggest critical portion to this system.\n\n75\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.020\n>> That's right Dan,\n\n76\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.760\nwe do want centralized administration\nwhen it comes to MBAM.\n\n77\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.740\nSo let's go ahead and look at some of\nthe components that we have here so\n\n78\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.640\nwe can get more of an idea of what\nthe infrastructure is behind the scenes.\n\n79\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.210\nNow I've got a diagram up and\nwe've got some of the basic components.\n\n80\n00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.830\nAnd then we'll talk about some of\nthe roles that these devices perform.\n\n81\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.540\nSo you'll see, just like Dan mentioned\nwe've got a series of servers.\n\n82\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.370\nHow you set this up is really\ncontingent on what kind of environment,\n\n83\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.500\nbut we are going to have\ntypically three servers.\n\n84\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.690\nIn this case for\n\n85\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.040\nour demonstration purposes they\nare going to be running server 2012R2.\n\n86\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.680\nWe've got some managed clients and these\nare the clients that we are going to be\n\n87\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.530\nmanaging things like their passwords,\ntheir recovery keys as well.\n\n88\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.740\nAnd then we've got a third,\nif you will, type of device here, and\n\n89\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.650\nthis next one can be a client or\na server, it really doesn't matter.\n\n90\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.015\nAnd let me show you what I mean by that.\n\n91\n00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:24.315\nBecause these servers that we have and\n\n92\n00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:27.855\nthe management workstation as\nwe see will come in handy.\n\n93\n00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:30.585\nSo one of the things that you need\nas your domain controller, right?\n\n94\n00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:33.580\nYou have to have an active directory\ndomain, that's gonna be a prerequisite for\n\n95\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.790\nusing MBAM.\n\n96\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.300\nThe next thing that we're gonna\nhave is we're gonna have a couple\n\n97\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.060\nother servers that are all\ndirectly related to MBAM.\n\n98\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.500\nAnd we have the Administration and\nMonitoring Server.\n\n99\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.740\nWe also have a series of database servers,\nand this is multiple databases, typically,\n\n100\n00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.110\nrunning on a single server.\n\n101\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.110\nAnd then we have this\nmanagement workstation.\n\n102\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.060\nNow I do wanna mention,\n\n103\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.130\nwith a management work station, a doesn't\nhave to be a dedicated work station.\n\n104\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.590\nNow you could, if you choose to,\nmake a dedicated work station, but\n\n105\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.010\nyou really don't need that.\n\n106\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.320\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n107\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.330\none of the things that we should be doing\nhere is looking at the individual pieces.\n\n108\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.320\nNow the domain controller,\n\n109\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.600\nunderstand it's running\nActive Directory Directory Services,\n\n110\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.420\nit's your identity management solution.\n\n111\n00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.030\nThat's pretty obvious anytime you talk\nabout active directory, but what might not\n\n112\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.780\nbe so obvious is what are some of the\nroles that these servers are performing.\n\n113\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.370\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the very first one.\n\n114\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.570\nAll right, the very first one is\nthe Administration and Monitoring Server.\n\n115\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.630\nNow, this holds a couple of roles for\nus that we'll use inside the MBAM.\n\n116\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.300\nOne of the things its gonna hold is\nits gonna hold the Administration and\n\n117\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.850\nMonitoring Website.\n\n118\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.440\nNow, with the Administration Monitoring\nWebsite keep in mind that what this is\n\n119\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.680\ngonna be used for\n\n120\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.310\nis to help users regain access to their\ncomputers when they're locked out.\n\n121\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.820\nNow that's the user portion of this.\n\n122\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.810\nWhat does it help as far as\nadministration and monitoring website, for\n\n123\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.910\nour administrators, the people that\nare going to be supporting the users?\n\n124\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.130\nWell, this is where they\ncan view the reports.\n\n125\n00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.400\nThey can view and display things like\ncompliance status, recovery activity for\n\n126\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.420\nthe different clients.\n\n127\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.930\nSo, maybe you wanna find out have there\nbeen any recovery requests as it is.\n\n128\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.850\nSomebody loses access to their\nBitLocker encrypted drive, well,\n\n129\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.840\nthey're gonna have to submit a request for\nrecovery, and\n\n130\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.560\nthey're gonna have to give a reason and\nthen you're gonna have to approve it.\n\n131\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.540\nSo one of the other handy things with the\nadministration and monitoring website is,\n\n132\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.129\ngiving the administrators the ability\nto implement things like recovery.\n\n133\n00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.790\nNow the next thing that we have\nhere is the self service portal.\n\n134\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.910\nNow with the self service portal, one of\nthe things we need to keep in mind is,\n\n135\n00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.400\nif you set this up, this gives your users\na point of access that like it says,\n\n136\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.940\nself service portal,\nthey can connect to a website.\n\n137\n00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.150\nRemember I was telling you\nthat they have to file for\n\n138\n00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.140\na request to gain recovery\naccess back into their drive.\n\n139\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.250\nWell, a self-service portal is\nwhere they're gonna do that.\n\n140\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.541\nThey're going to go to that website and\nif they have been locked out,\n\n141\n00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:03.324\nthey're gonna submit a request\nthat's gonna make its way\n\n142\n00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:06.584\ninto the administration and\nmonitoring website so that when your.\n\n143\n00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:10.734\nUsers, not your users, excuse me,\nyour administrators, your help desk staff,\n\n144\n00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:15.005\nwhen they login to the website and they go\nto the recovery section, they're gonna see\n\n145\n00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:18.560\nthat a request has been pending and\nyou can either approve or deny it.\n\n146\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.980\nSo administration and\n\n147\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.490\nmonitoring server, again keep in mind\ndoes run on a Window's server box.\n\n148\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.040\nAll right,\nnow how about the database servers?\n\n149\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.160\nNow when we look at the database servers,\nkeep in mind that there are multiple\n\n150\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.070\ndatabases that are gonna\nbe running on this server.\n\n151\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.940\nFor our demonstration purposes,\nwe're gonna be using Microsoft SQL 2014.\n\n152\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.770\nWe will put in our show notes so you can\ngain some more information on what's\n\n153\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.030\nSQL editions are supported for MBAM.\n\n154\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.478\nCuz there are some different ones, and\n\n155\n00:08:54.478 --> 00:08:58.984\nbe aware of those if you\nplan on implementing this.\n\n156\n00:08:58.984 --> 00:09:02.386\nYour database server's also\ngonna be running a web site.\n\n157\n00:09:02.386 --> 00:09:05.266\nIn this case, Microsoft,\nit's gonna be IIS or\n\n158\n00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:08.955\nInternet Information Services and\nwe're gonna need that.\n\n159\n00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:13.903\nThat's what helps to provide the services,\nif you will, to some of the websites that\n\n160\n00:09:13.903 --> 00:09:16.453\nwe're gonna connect to,\nwhether it be recovery or reports.\n\n161\n00:09:16.453 --> 00:09:20.682\nAnd that comes along the line,\nwe got a recovery database.\n\n162\n00:09:20.682 --> 00:09:24.184\nWhen the information,\nthe recovery information is sent,\n\n163\n00:09:24.184 --> 00:09:26.010\nit's sent to a service point.\n\n164\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.878\nAnd that service point is\nthis recovery database and\n\n165\n00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:32.209\nthat database is gonna store\nall the recovery information.\n\n166\n00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:37.882\nNow the other thing MBAM allows us\nto do is to monitor compliance and\n\n167\n00:09:37.882 --> 00:09:41.845\naudits, recovery\ninformation if we need to.\n\n168\n00:09:41.845 --> 00:09:45.096\nAnd that's another database that\nis gonna be stored on this server.\n\n169\n00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:49.810\nAnd again, compliance and audit database.\n\n170\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.404\nLet's say if I am a part of the help\ndesk role and I wanna find out what\n\n171\n00:09:54.404 --> 00:10:00.422\ndevices currently in my company are\ncompliant versus none compliant, right?\n\n172\n00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:04.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna run that\nreport and that database has to be present\n\n173\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.870\non this server in order to be able to\nsee the results of running that report.\n\n174\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.240\nSo please do keep that in mind.\n\n175\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.920\nNow you'll also have the reports database\nitself that stores this information.\n\n176\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.865\nSo a few different types of databases\nthat we have to be ready for\n\n177\n00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:22.306\nand we have to have installed.\n\n178\n00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:27.464\nOne of the things inside of the SQL server\nthat MBAM relies on more than anything\n\n179\n00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:32.562\nelse, you might have seen it abbreviated\nout there, and that's your SSRS.\n\n180\n00:10:32.562 --> 00:10:37.450\nAnd that's the SQL Server Reporting\nServices in the native mode.\n\n181\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.380\nSo, keep in mind that when we\ntalk about SQL specifically,\n\n182\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.310\nthat's what MBAM is looking for when it\ncomes to the support on the SQL side.\n\n183\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.460\nNow the next thing we have is\nthe Management Workstation.\n\n184\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.860\nNow when it comes to\nthe Management Workstation,\n\n185\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.780\nkeep in mind that this does not\nhave to be a dedicated client,\n\n186\n00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.560\nit doesn't have to be a dedicated server,\nall right?\n\n187\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.000\nWhat this does is this is\nthe place where you're going to\n\n188\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.800\nextract the MDOP Active Directory\ngroup policy templates, all right?\n\n189\n00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.500\nSo we need a way to provision\nActive Directory and get it prepared,\n\n190\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.250\nso they tell you to use\na Management Workstation and\n\n191\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.890\nif you wanted,\nyou can make a dedicated workstation.\n\n192\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:25.330\nBut keep in mind that when you\nare administering to MBAM,\n\n193\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.460\nyou're doing everything\nreally through a web browser.\n\n194\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.230\nSo it really doesn't have to be a\ndedicated workstation, like for instance,\n\n195\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.320\non my server, if I wanted to,\nif I had a server that connected to\n\n196\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.220\na centralized network share where those\ntemplates are, well I could use that.\n\n197\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.900\nI could connect to that location,\nI could pull down those templates,\n\n198\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.960\nwe can extract them, and\nthen if I want to turn around and\n\n199\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.970\nput them back up on the share, and\nimport them into Active Directory.\n\n200\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.770\nSo that's really one of the big uses for\nthe Management Workstation.\n\n201\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.940\nNow Microsoft does call it out, but they\nwill tell you, if you go out to TechNet\n\n202\n00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.510\nand documentation, that you certainly\ndon't have to reserve a whole\n\n203\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.630\nentire workstation just for the purposes\nof extracting a few templates.\n\n204\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.870\nBut for security purposes,\nif you want to, you certainly could.\n\n205\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.390\nNow, one of the last things that\nwe've gotta talk about is the client.\n\n206\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:17.262\nLet me go back to this slide here,\nso we've got Managed Clients.\n\n207\n00:12:17.262 --> 00:12:21.135\nNow, when it comes to the Managed Clients,\nthese are the devices if you will,\n\n208\n00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:23.498\nthat well, we're gonna be managing, right?\n\n209\n00:12:23.498 --> 00:12:27.515\nThey're the ones that are going\nto be connecting to your\n\n210\n00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:32.218\nActive Directory's domain controller,\npulling down the group\n\n211\n00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:37.176\npolicy settings that we put into place,\nand then implementing those\n\n212\n00:12:37.176 --> 00:12:42.500\nsettings on the different types of\ndrives that we have inside of Windows.\n\n213\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.470\nFor instance, your fixed data drives.\n\n214\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.180\nAgain, if some of this information on\nBitLocker itself, you haven't seen before,\n\n215\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.860\ngo back and check out some of our\nepisodes where we do talk about BitLocker\n\n216\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.910\nin more depth as far as\nthe client aspect goes.\n\n217\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.880\nBut keep in mind that there are three\ndifferent types of drives today that you\n\n218\n00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.970\ncan encrypt potentially based on what\nyour GPO is inside of BitLocker, right?\n\n219\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.450\nWe've got our fixed data drives.\n\n220\n00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.780\nWell, what's a fixed data drive?\n\n221\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.850\nIt's a drive that is literally inside\nof your computer and it's not like\n\n222\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.860\na removable drive or it's certainly not\ngonna just walk over and unplug it.\n\n223\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.980\nNow this isn't setup by default, and\n\n224\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.040\nwe're gonna show you guys how to deploy\nsome of the group policy settings and\n\n225\n00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.750\nwhat you can do, but by default, this is\ntypically disabled unless you enable it.\n\n226\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.410\nNow the one that's really\nimportant that we look at\n\n227\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.520\nare the operating system drives right?\n\n228\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.250\nThat's the one that's really,\nreally important for us and\n\n229\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.980\nwe also have the ability to encrypt\nthe operating system drives.\n\n230\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.850\nThe last one is what if we wanna\nimplement BitLocker To Go?\n\n231\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.296\nWell, we have the ability,\njust like in any BitLocker implementation,\n\n232\n00:13:48.296 --> 00:13:51.964\nhere with MBAM, we have the ability to\nsay, we're gonna do BitLocker To Go and\n\n233\n00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.815\nwe're gonna allow the encryption\nof our removable drives.\n\n234\n00:13:54.815 --> 00:13:57.367\nNow one of the really cool things\nthat you can do as well, and\n\n235\n00:13:57.367 --> 00:14:00.757\nyou'll see some of this coming up, is we\ncan also set things like auto unlock.\n\n236\n00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:04.008\nSo at this particular client,\nif somebody's got one of those removable\n\n237\n00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:07.765\nthumb drives and they plug it into the\ndevice, if they're sitting at that device.\n\n238\n00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:09.235\nIt automatically unlocks it for\n\n239\n00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:12.050\nthem and they don't have to\nworry about a recovery key.\n\n240\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:17.040\nSo that gives you kind of an idea\nof the drives themselves that,\n\n241\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.650\nand the hard drives I should say,\nthat we're gonna encrypt.\n\n242\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.190\nNow what is BitLocker doing for\nus as far as the encryption, right?\n\n243\n00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.730\nCuz at this point, so far,\nwe don't need MBAM, right?\n\n244\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.990\nWe could do all that with the stand alone\nBitLocker client side implementation.\n\n245\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.220\nSo here's what where MBAM comes into play.\n\n246\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.520\nIf you have set up a very\nintricate infrastructure, right?\n\n247\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.100\nYou're gonna say we gotta be secure,\nwe've got to encrypt fixed drives, right?\n\n248\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.905\nWe've got to encrypt,\n\n249\n00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:48.205\nobviously our operating system\ndrives are very important, too.\n\n250\n00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:50.850\nWe also got to encrypt\nour removable drives.\n\n251\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.838\nNow that's for one device, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:52.838 --> 00:14:53.759\nCan you imagine 500 devices?\n\n253\n00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:58.194\nNow, 500 devices, all right,\nI'm gonna try my math here,\n\n254\n00:14:58.194 --> 00:15:04.645\ntimes three different potential drives,\nthat's 1,500 little objects, right?\n\n255\n00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:10.650\n1,500 objects that have passwords and\nhave recovery keys.\n\n256\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.070\nAnd if any one of those are lost,\n\n257\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.450\nyou potentially lose\nthe information that's on those.\n\n258\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.425\nAnd that's where we get to the point\nMBAM's gonna help us to manage,\n\n259\n00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:22.465\nmaintain and keep track of these objects.\n\n260\n00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:25.745\nAgain, like our BitLocker passwords.\n\n261\n00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:30.275\nHow about TPMs, the trusted platform\nmodule, that's a big thing too.\n\n262\n00:15:30.275 --> 00:15:36.590\nBeing able to take ownership of a managed\ndevice's TPM and reset it without\n\n263\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.650\nhaving to completely erase or format\nthe drive and lose all the information.\n\n264\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.584\nJust like BitLocker To Go\nstoring that information,\n\n265\n00:15:44.584 --> 00:15:46.546\nallowing auto unlock if we need to.\n\n266\n00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:51.268\nSo Dan, a lot of different components here\nbut keep in mind that one of the things\n\n267\n00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:55.501\nthat's gonna run on these managed\nclients is something known as well,\n\n268\n00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:59.403\nimagine this, the MBAM agent,\nwhich is really the MBAM client.\n\n269\n00:15:59.403 --> 00:16:02.679\nAnd it collects the information,\nthe drive password information,\n\n270\n00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:06.590\nit collects the recovery information,\nand depending on how you set it up.\n\n271\n00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.693\nIt could store that in that centralized\nrecovery database that we talked about.\n\n272\n00:16:09.693 --> 00:16:12.140\nNow, you don't necessarily\nhave to do that.\n\n273\n00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.960\nAnd again as we progress through\nthis series we'll show you that\n\n274\n00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.080\nthere are a few different options that\ndo allow me the ability I could say,\n\n275\n00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.230\nyou know what let's just keep\nthe recovery keys up there.\n\n276\n00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.040\nI'm not gonna keep the passwords and\nreally when it comes down to it,\n\n277\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.130\nit's up to how you set it up.\n\n278\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.900\nBut I'm just gonna keep\nthe recovery keys up there.\n\n279\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.720\nAnd that's what we're gonna manage and\nmaintain.\n\n280\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.560\nYou could go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n281\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.550\nAnd if you set it up right,\n\n282\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.790\nyou could also have the entire key\npackage could be delivered up to MBAM.\n\n283\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.490\nNow how does that benefit me?\n\n284\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.330\nAgain, imagine we've got\n1,500 different objects.\n\n285\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.850\nWe've got 500 computers, potentially\nthree different encryption keys for\n\n286\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.690\nthe different drive types.\n\n287\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.970\nWell, what happens if\nwe lose one of those?\n\n288\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.730\nWhat happens if we lose the password?\n\n289\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.130\nWell, we could do the recovery.\n\n290\n00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.260\nBut if we go a little bit\nfarther than this and\n\n291\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.880\nwe take the key package itself and\nstore it up in MBAM.\n\n292\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.720\nNow not only can you recover the drive,\nbut you can also allow a user to\n\n293\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.420\ngain access back to the drive without\nhaving to go into recovery mode.\n\n294\n00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.680\nAnd that's a good thing that ensures\na little bit more and I want to say fault\n\n295\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.330\ntolerance, it's not really fault tolerance\nbecause you'd have to have double,\n\n296\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.600\ndual databases but it does give us\nmore than one option, all right.\n\n297\n00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.650\nIf you have for instance maybe a BitLocker\nkey gets corrupted itself, right?\n\n298\n00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.320\nYou maybe don't want to recover you\njust want to restore the password to its\n\n299\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:26.890\noriginal state.\n\n300\n00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:32.050\nWell you can do that provided that these\nkeys of both types recovery and the key\n\n301\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.510\npackage for the BitLocker passwords\nare stored in the centralized database.\n\n302\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.990\nSo a lot of different components here Dan,\nand when it comes down to it it can be\n\n303\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:44.290\na little challenging when you first\nsee it, as to what you have here.\n\n304\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.190\nBut when you look at it you really only\nhave a few roles that we're looking at,\n\n305\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.020\nkeep in mind we're looking at our\ndomain controller, our clients\n\n306\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.920\nhave to be joined into the domain,\nthis is managed through group policies.\n\n307\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.010\nSo if [LAUGH] I have devices that\naren't joined into the domain I\n\n308\n00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.690\ncertainly can't implement group\npolicy objects against them.\n\n309\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:06.360\nWe have our administration and monitoring\nweb server, few different roles on that.\n\n310\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.850\nDatabase servers,\nthree different types of databases.\n\n311\n00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.870\nManagement workstation, again, doesn't\nhave to be a dedicated workstation.\n\n312\n00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.460\nDon't have to waste an entire device,\nif you want.\n\n313\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.180\nYou can really just extract those ADML and\n\n314\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.430\nADMX files, import them into your\nactive directory, and really,\n\n315\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.170\nwhen it comes down to it, that's all you\nneeded the management workstation from.\n\n316\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:31.450\nThen after that, your users, or\nyour help desk, whatever dedicated\n\n317\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.738\ncomputer that they sit at, they can really\nmanage all aspects from that location.\n\n318\n00:18:35.738 --> 00:18:41.180\nSo, yeah, so Dan I really think that\ncovers the majority of the components.\n\n319\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.890\nCheck your documentation, check the show\nnotes, we'll put some information.\n\n320\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.960\nTakes you out the tech net shows you these\ndifferent components so that when it comes\n\n321\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.560\ndown to it and you decide that one\nyou're testing for Windows client exams.\n\n322\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.590\nI know that Windows client exams\nsometimes have questions on MBAM itself.\n\n323\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.740\nWell, you'll need to know these components\nif they do ask you questions about that.\n\n324\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.190\nSo if you're in a certification endeavor,\n\n325\n00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.460\nmake sure you're aware\nof these components.\n\n326\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.090\nIf you're deploying MBAM itself,\nthen you'll definitely want to know these.\n\n327\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:16.840\nI will tell you,\n\n328\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.350\none of the things that I do want to\nmention here is kind of give you guys\n\n329\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:24.966\nan idea of how we're gonna set up our\ndemonstration of MBAM from here on out.\n\n330\n00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:30.220\nEven though we have quite\na few different roles here,\n\n331\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.990\nall right, I'm gonna implement\nboth the administration and\n\n332\n00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.270\nmonitoring server and\nthe database servers on a single server.\n\n333\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.770\nOkay, now a little bit of a side note for\n\n334\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.970\nthis, I want you to keep in mind that\nthis is a test environment only.\n\n335\n00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.270\nIt's not really recommended to put\nall the databases on a single server.\n\n336\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:55.460\nYou can use dedicate, and you really\nwant to use more than one server here.\n\n337\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.460\nSo, for the test environment purposes,\n\n338\n00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.860\nwe're really going to have three\ndifferent computers, all right?\n\n339\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.840\nWe're going to have our domain controller,\ngot to have that, and\n\n340\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.980\nour administration and\nmonitoring server, our data base server,\n\n341\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.730\nthey're going to be on\nthe same server itself.\n\n342\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.190\nAnd then finally we're gonna\nshow you the client too.\n\n343\n00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.150\nGotta have a client because why have\nMBAM if we're not gonna demonstrate\n\n344\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.470\nthe management of\nthe BitLocker keys there, Dan.\n\n345\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.680\n>> Now Wes, I've worked with Malwarebytes\na lot, especially in a domain environment,\n\n346\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.430\nand my typical experience with a user\ninteraction and someone calls me up and\n\n347\n00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.100\nsays I need a recovery key.\n\n348\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.210\nThat is at the time of boot.\n\n349\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.934\nSo, they boot their computer, and\n\n350\n00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:36.921\nthe computer is saying you\nrequire a BitLocker recovery key,\n\n351\n00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:40.772\nyou can call your network administrator,\nor your system's administrator and\n\n352\n00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:44.353\nget that from them, or maybe you have\nthat yourself if that is who you are.\n\n353\n00:20:44.353 --> 00:20:49.306\nDoes this take away that portion,\nis it all manners that you can\n\n354\n00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:53.511\njust submit something I can\ngo into that web portal and\n\n355\n00:20:53.511 --> 00:20:56.980\nclick approved and\nthen all that goes away.\n\n356\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.750\nOr do we still have to enter recovery\nkeys or does that take that away?\n\n357\n00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.790\n>> Well, that's a great question.\n\n358\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.090\nThere are a couple of things,\nit's not completely automated.\n\n359\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.990\nIf it was completely automated,\nthen the problem is how do I\n\n360\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.380\nknow that the person themselves\nare the valid owner of the key.\n\n361\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.400\nSo, there a couple of\nthings that you need.\n\n362\n00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.500\nNow, what we'll talk a little bit more\nabout the roles that are coming up,\n\n363\n00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.020\nbecause, really, how you do this\nis contingent on what your role\n\n364\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.780\ninside the administration\nwithin MBAM in general.\n\n365\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.150\nBut usually what the step is,\nis it's not completely automated but\n\n366\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.330\nthat self-service portal is\nwhere they're gonna connect to.\n\n367\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.420\nAnd what they're gonna do is they're gonna\nget a list of options that says okay,\n\n368\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.220\nyou need to submit a recovery.\n\n369\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.640\nNow in our GPO's we'll configure it so\nwe've got the right URL.\n\n370\n00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.250\nAnd that’s how we choose to do it and\nthen you’re help does users.\n\n371\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.770\nThe people that are administering\nto a MBAMs website can log in and\n\n372\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.810\nthey could see your request.\n\n373\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.100\nBut there are couple a things\nthat their gonna they need.\n\n374\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.680\nAt the very minimum they're\ngonna need the recovery ID\n\n375\n00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.080\nthat shows up on the computer's interface\nwhen it goes into recovery mode.\n\n376\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.330\nWe've lost our BitLocker password,\nwe don't know what it is so\n\n377\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.280\nwe can enter in to recovery mode.\n\n378\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.600\nWe enter into recovery mode, there is\nan identifier that is on that screen.\n\n379\n00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.690\nWell that identifier has to be used and\nhas to be submitted to the administrator,\n\n380\n00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:19.640\nso they first of all know\nwhat BitLocker drive it is.\n\n381\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.620\nThe other thing we need\nis a computer name.\n\n382\n00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.790\nThe computer name,\nif you, one of the roles,\n\n383\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.900\none of the lesser roles I guess you would\nsay, if you're help desk and not advanced\n\n384\n00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.530\nhelp desk is that they'd have to go\na little bit farther in their day, and\n\n385\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:37.710\nthey'd also have to put the user domain,\nthe computer name, and the recovery ID.\n\n386\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.280\nIf you're advanced help desk,\nthen you pretty much got all access, and\n\n387\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.170\nall you really need is a recovery ID.\n\n388\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.170\nAnd at that point, we can submit\nthe recovery ID, we can give them that\n\n389\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.820\ninformation, and we can basically\ngive them the recovery password.\n\n390\n00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.400\nThey can enter it in, once they enter\nthat in they can unlock drive and\n\n391\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.740\nthen from there they can reset\ntheir BitLocker password.\n\n392\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.110\nAnd it's you know kind of like\nresetting your username's password,\n\n393\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.200\nif you needed to change your password\non your local computer there.\n\n394\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.800\n>> Thanks.\n\n395\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.200\nWell obviously there's\na lot of components,\n\n396\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.180\na lot of things that we\nneed to get down and\n\n397\n00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:14.440\ndirty with when it comes to the Microsoft\ndesktop optimization pack itself And\n\n398\n00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.020\nworking with BitLocker is\nalways a grand old time.\n\n399\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.560\nSo we look forward to seeing you guys\nin the upcoming episodes, but as for\n\n400\n00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.860\nthis one, Wes it looks like we have\ncovered all of our foundational bases, so\n\n401\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.840\nwe're going to call it a wrap for\ntodays show.\n\n402\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.010\nThanks for dropping by Wes,\nthanks for explaining for\n\n403\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.760\nus, and we thank you guys for watching.\n\n404\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.420\nSigning off for IT PRO TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n405\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.350\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n406\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.574\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n407\n00:23:34.574 --> 00:23:42.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:20.586\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing with our series\n\n4\n00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:24.562\non the Microsoft Desktop Optimization\nPack, and joining us back in the studio to\n\n5\n00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.280\nhelp us out with that is our\ngood friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.355\nWes, welcome back to the show sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n7\n00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:31.179\n>> Thanks for having me here,\nI'll tell you Dan,\n\n8\n00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.196\nthat's one that I don't\nmind using an acronym for.\n\n9\n00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:33.800\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a-\n\n10\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.420\n>> No doubt.\n\n11\n00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.570\n>> It's like the song that never ends\n\n12\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.825\nthere.\nBut that's right,\n\n13\n00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.990\nwe're back with some MDOP, and\nwe're continuing along and\n\n14\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.350\nhere comes another acronym, MBAM.\nWe're\n\n15\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.960\ntalking about the Microsoft BitLocker\nAdministration and Monitoring.\n\n16\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.430\nAnd one of the things that\nwe're going to go into today\n\n17\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.710\nis preparing your Active Directory\ninfrastructure to get it ready so\n\n18\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.150\nthat it'll support MBAM when\nyou decide to deploy it.\n\n19\n00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.517\nNow, there are some things that you\nhave to consider cuz there are a few\n\n20\n00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:05.603\ndifferent roles that we need to set up,\nand users versus groups.\n\n21\n00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:09.735\nAnd we kind of want to show you guys the\ndifferent user groups/roles that you're\n\n22\n00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.754\ngonna see that need to be implemented.\n\n23\n00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:14.974\nSo if you're in a certification\nendeavor and they ask you about MBAM,\n\n24\n00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:18.903\nwell you'll be able to knock it out of the\nballpark, if maybe you're just planning on\n\n25\n00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:21.870\ntesting this, maybe you do want\nto roll this out to production.\n\n26\n00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.680\nWell, it's still gonna be, either way,\nyou're still gonna have to\n\n27\n00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.255\nknow what are the roles and what are\nthe groups that we have inside of MBAM?\n\n28\n00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.672\n>> Wes, we're still actually, still in\nkind of the pre-stages as well, right?\n\n29\n00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:33.480\n>> That's right,\n\n30\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.445\nit's funny because at this point we\nhaven't deployed anything from MBAM.\n\n31\n00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.520\nWe've just been talking about it,\nand that's why it is good planning.\n\n32\n00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.610\nI'm glad you mentioned that Dan.\n\n33\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.702\nPlanning is everything, and\nwe're really in the planning phase here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:48.619\nAnd this should help you out and\n\n35\n00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.213\ngive you a good Idea of what you have\nto set up prior to even deploying MBAM.\n\n36\n00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.215\nRemember in a previous episode we\ntalked about the MBAM components.\n\n37\n00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.195\nYou need to know those components.\n\n38\n00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.975\nYou need to know what\noperating systems you need.\n\n39\n00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:05.500\nWhat server roles that you're gonna\nprovision in order to support MBAM.\n\n40\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.950\nSo a lot of setup beforehand, but once you\nknow the steps, you know what you have to\n\n41\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.740\nsetup, it will hopefully make you,\nand that's at least the goal here.\n\n42\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.040\nIs to make your deployment\nof MBAM a little bit easier,\n\n43\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.960\ngo a little bit smoother than, obviously,\nyour end certification endeavor there.\n\n44\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.010\nYou'll be able to answer those questions\nand get them right on the exam, too.\n\n45\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.480\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.930\nwe'll jump right into some of\nthe roles that we have inside of MBAM.\n\n47\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.285\nNow, I do want you to keep in mind that\nsome of these roles can be combined.\n\n48\n00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.805\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nmention the roles.\n\n49\n00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:36.925\nAnd then we're gonna set them up.\n\n50\n00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:38.275\nWe're gonna show you how to set them up.\n\n51\n00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:41.715\nSo keep in mind that in some aspects here,\n\n52\n00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:44.800\nsome of these roles could be combined\ninto a single user or group.\n\n53\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.830\nOne of the first things that we have to\nthink about is our administration and\n\n54\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.110\nmonitoring website.\n\n55\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.220\nNow what is this website gonna be for?\n\n56\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900\nLet's keep in mind that this is gonna be\nwhere your Helpdesk Users are going to,\n\n57\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.930\nwell, help their end users\neither recover their drives,\n\n58\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.700\nmanage and maintain things\nlike trusted platform modules,\n\n59\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.170\nthe TPMs, and\neven see compliance information as well.\n\n60\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.240\nNow when it comes to the users,\nwe've got two different roles here.\n\n61\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.020\nWe've got Helpdesk and we also have\nwhat's known as Advanced Helpdesk.\n\n62\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.390\nNow when we look at the roles, Helpdesk\nspecifically, these roles, you will see,\n\n63\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.640\nprovide the ability to manage the TPMs and\nalso manage drive recovery.\n\n64\n00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.230\nNow, the other role that we have\nis the Advanced Helpdesk User.\n\n65\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.850\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwell wait a second, Wes.\n\n66\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.870\nWhat's the difference between a Helpdesk\nand an Advanced Helpdesk User?\n\n67\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.160\nMaybe a little bit more flare.\n\n68\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.070\nBut under the hood what's gonna happen is\nthe fact that the Advanced Helpdesk Users,\n\n69\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.820\nthey have all access, right.\n\n70\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.150\nSo, if you've ever been to a concert and\nyou see somebody with the all access pass,\n\n71\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.510\nyou're like, man I wish I had that.\n\n72\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.340\nWell, that's essentially what your\nAdvanced HelpDesk Users are gonna have.\n\n73\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.460\nTheir gonna have all access to the\nadministration and monitoring websites.\n\n74\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.030\nYou might ask yourself, well wait a\nsecond, well what's really the difference?\n\n75\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.330\nSome of the differences are on how\nthey recover drives, if you will.\n\n76\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.550\nSo for instance,\nif you're in a Helpdesk position, and\n\n77\n00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.315\nyou go to recover somebody's drive that's\nbeen encrypted and then managed through\n\n78\n00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:21.295\nyour Microsoft BitLocker Administration\nand Monitoring platform.\n\n79\n00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:25.690\nThen the Helpdesk, all they can do is\nmanage the TPMs and the drive recovery.\n\n80\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.380\nAnd more importantly,\nwhen it comes to drive recovery,\n\n81\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.518\nthey've got to enter\na little bit more data.\n\n82\n00:04:30.518 --> 00:04:35.291\nIn the previous episode one of the things\nthat Dan had asked is the information\n\n83\n00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:39.340\nthat we have to provide,\nis this an automated approach, right?\n\n84\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.290\nDoes a user,\nthey forget their BitLocker password.\n\n85\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.240\nCan they just fill out a form,\nautomatically get sent up, and\n\n86\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.930\nwe click some kind of button and\nthey're recovered.\n\n87\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.260\nWell, there again,\n\n88\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.390\nit's really contingent on these two\nroles on how that's gonna be done.\n\n89\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.420\nSo if you're a Helpdesk User, you gotta\nenter a little bit more information before\n\n90\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.470\nyou can do drive recovery.\n\n91\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.070\nYou gotta enter the computer name and the\nuser's domain name, or domain in general.\n\n92\n00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.660\nAnd then also a recovery identifier.\n\n93\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.764\nNow the recovery identifier,\nif you're not familiar with what that is,\n\n94\n00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:13.093\nthat's associated with a recovery key.\n\n95\n00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:20.178\nThe recovery key is a 48 digit key,\nkind of like activation is in software,\n\n96\n00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat is going to be tied to\na specific encryption of BitLocker.\n\n97\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.650\nAssociated with the recovery\nkey is a drive identifier.\n\n98\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.230\nIt's a little key ID that says, okay,\n\n99\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.850\nthis ID is associated with this drive and\nthis 48 digit recovery key.\n\n100\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.840\nIf you're in the Helpdesk group then you\nhave to put in again the computer name,\n\n101\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.250\nthe user's domain and that recovery ID.\n\n102\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.240\nNow Advanced Helpdesk Users not\nonly have a complete access\n\n103\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.440\nto the administration and\nmonitoring website,\n\n104\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.710\nthey don't have to put in the user\ndomain and the computer name.\n\n105\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.370\nAll they have to know is the recovery ID,\nso\n\n106\n00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.110\nthis might be something where maybe your\nHelpdesk is trying to recover a drive and\n\n107\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.090\nthe user says, well I'm not\nreally sure what my domain is.\n\n108\n00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.370\nWe'll just give you a scenario here.\n\n109\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.800\nWhat if scenario, where maybe they don't\nknow not only what the user name is,\n\n110\n00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.700\nmaybe they don't know what\ntheir computer name is.\n\n111\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.600\nWell if you don't have that information\nthen this might be something\n\n112\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.060\nthat you perform escalation.\n\n113\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.042\nIf I don't have the privileges,\npermissions or know how to help an end\n\n114\n00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:31.622\nuser then I'm gonna have to\nescalate it somebody higher tier,\n\n115\n00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:35.625\nlevel tier that does know how to or\nhas the privileges to perform that.\n\n116\n00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:38.724\nAnd that's where the Advanced Helpdesk\ncomes in, because if they\n\n117\n00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:42.373\ndon't have a user's domain, they don't\nhave the computer ID, then they get\n\n118\n00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:45.890\nthe ability to just put in the recovery\ninformation, and they're good.\n\n119\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.640\nNow you might say, well wait a second,\nwhere do we get the recovery IDs?\n\n120\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.710\nWell we'll show you when we do a recovery\nlater on, but let's just go ahead and\n\n121\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.560\ngenerically set the stage.\n\n122\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.042\nAnd allow that the recovery ID,\nwhen you forget a BitLocker password, or\n\n123\n00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.700\nmaybe you enter wrong and\nit enters into recovery mode.\n\n124\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.411\nRight there on the computer screen will\nbe that ID that the end user's gonna have\n\n125\n00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:09.380\nto report to whoever the Helpdesk user\nis in order for them to enter it.\n\n126\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.130\nNow I do want to make one mention.\n\n127\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.040\nAnd they mention this out in TechNet, and\n\n128\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.680\nlike I said, we're gonna litter you guys\nwith a whole bunch of show notes here and\n\n129\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.780\nsome URL so that you can go and research\nthis information more on your own.\n\n130\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.320\nIf you wanna get even more\ninformation about some of the roles.\n\n131\n00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.090\nBut, one of the things they\npoint out here is that,\n\n132\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.020\nmy head's kind of covering it up here.\n\n133\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.120\nIf the user is a part of both\nof these groups, all right?\n\n134\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.020\nSo let's say Dan comes in,\nDan's part of the Helpdesk.\n\n135\n00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.530\nDan says all of the sudden, hey I need\nto gain access to that recovery console.\n\n136\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.810\nAnd we don't have that information.\n\n137\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.809\nSo I say okay, you know what Dan?\n\n138\n00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:49.549\nLet's make you an Advanced Helpdesk User.\n\n139\n00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:53.300\nWell now those permissions\nare gonna override the Helpdesk.\n\n140\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.537\nSo If you have one user in both groups,\nbe careful with this,\n\n141\n00:07:56.537 --> 00:08:00.960\nremember we're talking about security,\nthat's what BitLocker's all about.\n\n142\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.782\nAnd if you are looking for principle of\nleast privilege and you give somebody\n\n143\n00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:08.498\naccess to both user groups,\nthen the Advanced HelpDesk will overwrite.\n\n144\n00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:13.496\nSo potentially, you could be giving\nsomebody more access than exactly\n\n145\n00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:16.470\nwhat they need, so do keep that in mind.\n\n146\n00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.000\nSo Dan, when it comes to the Helpdesk,\nand you know what I didn't mention is,\n\n147\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.420\nthe users here, they can be a group or\nit could be a specific user.\n\n148\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.858\nNow we talk about\nrole-based access control.\n\n149\n00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:32.649\nAnd I really would agree that this is\nthe way that we should be doing that,\n\n150\n00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.710\nrather than just having a single user.\n\n151\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.181\nCuz if you're in a large\nEnterprise environment,\n\n152\n00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:40.869\nyou're probably not just going to have\na single user for Helpdesk, right?\n\n153\n00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:44.851\nSo I would recommend that if you're gonna\nset this up, even though the documentation\n\n154\n00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:48.020\nsays it could be a user or group,\nI would make these groups for both.\n\n155\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.132\nBecause then in Active Directory,\nwhen go to provision your users,\n\n156\n00:08:51.132 --> 00:08:52.214\nthen you create a user.\n\n157\n00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:54.163\nOr as you hire onboard new staff,\n\n158\n00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:58.838\nyou can drop them right into the Advanced\nHelpdesk group or the Helpdesk group.\n\n159\n00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:03.521\nAnd in the background, one of\nthe great things about the MBAM setup,\n\n160\n00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:05.640\nis it manages the privileges.\n\n161\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.225\nWhen it goes through and it installs,\nit provisions in Active Directory\n\n162\n00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:12.869\nthe appropriate permissions for\nthe roles that these groups provide, or\n\n163\n00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:15.240\nthe functionality that\nthese groups provide.\n\n164\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.170\nAnd that's why I would say, don't limit\nyourself to just user or a group.\n\n165\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.620\nNow, in demonstration purposes you might\nsee that I will not be practicing what I\n\n166\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.240\npreach in here.\n\n167\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.320\nJust for the demonstration purposes.\n\n168\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.310\nBut definitely in your Active Directory\nyou wanna be careful on how you do this.\n\n169\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.149\nAnd you don't wanna tie this or\nassociate it with just a single\n\n170\n00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:34.200\nend user because well,\nthat can always cause problems here.\n\n171\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.100\n>> And Wes, you were saying, just to\nmake sure and clarify, and I thought,\n\n172\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.450\nI understand.\n\n173\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.520\nIs that when we're talking about\nthe access privileges when it comes to\n\n174\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.310\neither the user or group that we create\nfor this, is that it is aggregate.\n\n175\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.343\nIt is not, I've got two sets of,\nif I'm in both groups and\n\n176\n00:09:51.343 --> 00:09:56.004\nI've got two sets of permissions,\nthe least amount of privilege wins.\n\n177\n00:09:56.004 --> 00:10:00.500\nIt's they aggregate together, and then\nthat becomes how much privilege I have.\n\n178\n00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.600\n>> That's a very good question there and\nthat is right.\n\n179\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.340\nWhen we talk about things like\npermissions and sharing permissions,\n\n180\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.460\ncombined with MTFS permissions,\nin some of our other episodes,\n\n181\n00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.010\nright, we know that it's the most\nrestrictive that wins out.\n\n182\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.150\nSo if somebody's got read and they've\ngot full control and we're talking about\n\n183\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.270\ncomparing NTFS to shared permissions,\nright, the most restrictive comes out.\n\n184\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.960\nGotta be careful with this one though,\nbecause if they're in both groups,\n\n185\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.520\nthey get more access, and\nthat's where the problem could come in.\n\n186\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.520\nSo the administration and monitoring\nwebsite know the user roles, if you will,\n\n187\n00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.380\nthe group roles.\n\n188\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.652\nBe very careful when\nyou're planning it out,\n\n189\n00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:39.044\nbecause they could potentially have\naccess to a lot of information.\n\n190\n00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:43.311\nSo for instance,\nlet's talk about a disgruntled employee.\n\n191\n00:10:43.311 --> 00:10:45.314\nWell, if they're\nan Advanced Helpdesk user,\n\n192\n00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:47.628\nkeep in mind all they need\nis a recovery ID, all right?\n\n193\n00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:52.420\nSo I am the disgruntled employee, I grab\nDan's Windows 10 machine that's been\n\n194\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.180\nencrypted with BitLocker and\nI hit a couple of wrong passwords.\n\n195\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.600\nIt throws it into recovery mode or\nI just hit Enter and\n\n196\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.400\nthrow it right into recovery mode,\nI've got the recovery ID.\n\n197\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.430\nNow I don't Dan,\nI don't need the help desk.\n\n198\n00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.290\nAll I need to do is log in to\nthe administration website\n\n199\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.520\nput in the recovery ID and\nI now have access to his information.\n\n200\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.226\nSo make sure that you're advanced\nuser is a trusted user, right?\n\n201\n00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:18.179\nWhen we talk about that,\n\n202\n00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:23.810\nmake sure that it's somebody within\nyour infrastructure that you do trust.\n\n203\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.340\nNow, we're not done there.\n\n204\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.990\nJust when you thought we 're done,\nwait, there's more.\n\n205\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.360\nNow we've got a lot more\ninformation that we kinda need to\n\n206\n00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.170\nbe aware of when it\ncomes to the end users.\n\n207\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:39.070\nNow, next thing we have are what\nare known as the database accounts.\n\n208\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.360\nNow keep in mind that\nsome of these accounts,\n\n209\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.570\nyou might have one user that is\nconfigured kinda like a service account,\n\n210\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.180\nwhere you're not really using\nit specifically to log in.\n\n211\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.830\nAnd when we set this up and provision it\ninside of MBAM, it'll make more sense and\n\n212\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.040\nwe'll be sure to point those out.\n\n213\n00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.480\nNow the database accounts, we've got the\ncompliance and audit database, all right?\n\n214\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.741\nAnd we're gonna need to gain access\nto that compliant and audit database.\n\n215\n00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:09.280\nNow, how we gain access is, again,\ncontingent on the role we are performing.\n\n216\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.170\nIf it is kind of like a service account,\nyou're gonna need a user or\n\n217\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.740\na group with read/write access, right?\n\n218\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.101\nBecause if I wanna read information,\nright,\n\n219\n00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:21.590\nI'll only need a read only permission,\nright?\n\n220\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.250\nAnd we'll talk about that\nuser role coming up, too.\n\n221\n00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.720\nBut if I wanna send information\ninto that database, right?\n\n222\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.690\nWe need an account that\ncan write to the database.\n\n223\n00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.240\nSo you need a user or\na group that has read/write access.\n\n224\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.280\nSo we do need to create that.\n\n225\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.530\nNow, for the purposes of maybe\nwe have an administrator, right,\n\n226\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.580\nwe have a Helpdesk user that we\nwant to be able to run reports.\n\n227\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.800\nWe don't want them to\nmodify any information.\n\n228\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.900\nWe don't want them recovering information.\n\n229\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.460\nWe just want them to be able to build and\ngenerate a report.\n\n230\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.310\nDan comes to me and says, hey Wes, I need\nan Enterprise compliance report right now.\n\n231\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.893\nDan doesn't want me to be able to modify\nany information in that database, but\n\n232\n00:12:58.893 --> 00:13:01.464\nhe needs that documentation and\nhe needs it yesterday.\n\n233\n00:13:01.464 --> 00:13:05.278\nWell if I've got a user group for\nthe compliance and audit database\n\n234\n00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:09.310\nset up with the read-only permission,\nthen I as a user could do that.\n\n235\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.740\nI could perform that functionality.\n\n236\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.010\nI could say, absolutely, let me log in\nto the monitoring and administer and\n\n237\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:20.960\n[LAUGH] administration and monitoring\nwebsite, and let me run a report, right?\n\n238\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.070\nI could run a report, I can view\nthe report, capture that information, and\n\n239\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.070\nI could email it out to Dan, there's the\nreport, I didn't modify any information.\n\n240\n00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.800\nSo keep in mind that you need a user or\ngroup with the read-only\n\n241\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.796\npermission as well, inside of\nthe compliance and audit database.\n\n242\n00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:39.270\nNow these users or groups, and\n\n243\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.470\nyou're gonna see that we're gonna\ncreate a user for this one.\n\n244\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.080\nAnd we're gonna use it kinda\nlike a service account.\n\n245\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.948\nBecause it enables the web applications\nto access and modify the database.\n\n246\n00:13:47.948 --> 00:13:51.300\nThe read-only account\ndoes exactly like I said,\n\n247\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.070\nwhere that allows me to at least run\nreports against the database, right?\n\n248\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.590\nDo we have any recovery requests right\nnow that are currently pending in that\n\n249\n00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.147\ndatabase?\n\n250\n00:13:59.147 --> 00:14:01.790\nWell, I don't need to modify\nany information, right?\n\n251\n00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.581\nI don't need to go over and\nperform a drive recovery,\n\n252\n00:14:04.581 --> 00:14:08.314\nI don't need to manage a TPM, so\nI don't need any read/write access.\n\n253\n00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.020\nAnd that's where your\nread-only group comes in.\n\n254\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.570\nNow, we also have the recovery database\nthat I want you to keep in mind too.\n\n255\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.900\nWith the recovery database, we also need\nanother account that has, and again,\n\n256\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.850\nit could be user or\n\n257\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.250\nit could be a group, the recovery\ndatabase that has read/write access.\n\n258\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.560\nKeep in mind that these are like a web\napplication, like a service account.\n\n259\n00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.520\nWe need to be able to write recovery\ninformation into that database.\n\n260\n00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.080\nSo if it's sent up to the MBAM,\nwell, do we have an account provision\n\n261\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.390\nthat could turn around and write that\ninformation into the recovery database?\n\n262\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.640\nWell, that's where your user or\ngroup with read/write access comes in.\n\n263\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.350\nNow, if we're just pulling\na report from a recovery database,\n\n264\n00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.540\nthat's where our read-only user comes in.\n\n265\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.220\nSo we're gonna need a user with read-only.\n\n266\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.830\nNow, again this comes back to enabling\nthings like web applications to access\n\n267\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.380\nthe audit and the recovery information\nthat's inside of that database.\n\n268\n00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.380\nSo database accounts, very,\n\n269\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.440\nvery important,\npay attention to how you set them up.\n\n270\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.936\nWe're gonna demonstrate it coming up and\n\n271\n00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:11.440\nwe'll definitely show you\nexactly where to set these up.\n\n272\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.494\nBut the database accounts are very,\nvery important.\n\n273\n00:15:16.494 --> 00:15:19.526\nAll right, now,\nnotice that you're gonna see some, Dan,\n\n274\n00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:21.260\nif you haven't noticed already.\n\n275\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.790\nIt gets a little redundant here because\nnow we've got the compliance and\n\n276\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.160\naudit database.\n\n277\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.254\nWell, the thing is, we have reports and\nwe have connections.\n\n278\n00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:30.050\nSo a lot of things going\non in the background.\n\n279\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:36.553\nNow, with reporting, we don't need\nany read/write access, right?\n\n280\n00:15:36.553 --> 00:15:39.340\nReporting is not about modifications.\n\n281\n00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.150\nReporting is only about\ncollecting information.\n\n282\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.580\nViewing information for one and then\npotentially collecting that information.\n\n283\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.607\nBut certainly not making any\nmodifications to the information.\n\n284\n00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:51.597\nSo what the reporting group,\nand do I have a,\n\n285\n00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:56.430\nlet me correct this because\nthis really isn't a user.\n\n286\n00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.788\nIt’s a group only, all right?\n\n287\n00:15:57.788 --> 00:16:02.118\nThe reporting group is a Group role that,\nagain, the role-based administration,\n\n288\n00:16:02.118 --> 00:16:05.605\nif I'm gonna be the person that's\ngonna be collecting the reports,\n\n289\n00:16:05.605 --> 00:16:08.620\nwe create the group,\nwe put the user in the group.\n\n290\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.290\nMBAM, when we configure it in the\nbackground, already has permissions and\n\n291\n00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.100\nprivileges set for us, and\nwe don't have to do that.\n\n292\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.190\nOne of the last ones that we've got is\nthe compliance and audit database, right,\n\n293\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.520\nwe've got connections\nthat need to be made.\n\n294\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.790\nNow, this does need a user\nwith read write access.\n\n295\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:29.837\nAnd again, some of the read write access\nuser or group that you've configured\n\n296\n00:16:29.837 --> 00:16:34.594\nin the previous roles, you can just\nsupplement these with those as well.\n\n297\n00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:36.323\nAnd that'll be perfectly fine.\n\n298\n00:16:36.323 --> 00:16:38.898\nAgain, depends on how complex\nyour infrastructure is,\n\n299\n00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:41.160\ndepends on where\nthe databases are setting up.\n\n300\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.705\nAnd how your company's security\npolicies are gonna go,\n\n301\n00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:45.143\nwho should have access to this.\n\n302\n00:16:45.143 --> 00:16:48.400\nSo lot of planning here but\njust generically for our demonstration\n\n303\n00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.262\npurposes, you're gonna see that we're\ngonna use a lot of the same accounts.\n\n304\n00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:57.415\nNow we also [LAUGH] as we can see here,\nit definitely\n\n305\n00:16:57.415 --> 00:17:02.880\nrepeats itself that we need a user or\ngroup with read-only permissions as well.\n\n306\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.361\nLikewise in the first in\nthe first part of this,\n\n307\n00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:08.640\nit enables the web applications\nto gain access and recovery.\n\n308\n00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.564\nSo a lot of different groups here, Dan,\n\n309\n00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:14.470\nwhat do you say maybe we bump on over to\nActive Directory and let's provision these\n\n310\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.166\nand let's get Active Directory prepared\nand ready to go, what do you think?\n\n311\n00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:19.802\n>> Yeah enough chat, let's show something.\n\n312\n00:17:19.802 --> 00:17:20.400\n>> There we go.\n\n313\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.210\nSo I've gone ahead and\n\n314\n00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.910\nI've got my domain controller\npulled up right here, ready to go.\n\n315\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.470\nAnd what we're gonna do,\ncouple of different things here.\n\n316\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.240\nI've got Active Directory users and\n\n317\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.860\ncomputers already kinda pinned\nto the task bar down here.\n\n318\n00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:40.160\nAnd that's just for my lab purposes, but\nI wanna show you a couple different ways,\n\n319\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.450\ndepends on if I can type\na password in correctly.\n\n320\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.572\nWell, we know I can type it incorrectly,\nbut how about correctly?\n\n321\n00:17:46.572 --> 00:17:51.215\n[LAUGH] But if you've been around Active\nDirectory for a little bit, you might use,\n\n322\n00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:55.659\nwhich is what I'm gonna use, the oldie but\ngoodie, Active Directory Users and\n\n323\n00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:56.410\nComputers.\n\n324\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.100\nAnd I did that kind of fast, guys, and\n\n325\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.090\nlet me just not assume that you\nguys know where we're going here.\n\n326\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.700\nSo I just opened Server Manager,\nwent to Tools, and\n\n327\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.060\nI opened ADUC, all right,\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n328\n00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.006\nSome of you that have been in some of the\nnewer Server editions, you might be using\n\n329\n00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:17.247\nADAC, the Administration, what is that,\nActive Directory Administration Center\n\n330\n00:18:17.247 --> 00:18:20.181\nthere, forgot what ADAC and\nADUC [LAUGH] stand for.\n\n331\n00:18:20.181 --> 00:18:21.442\nGotta love the acronyms.\n>> That's not confusing.\n\n332\n00:18:21.442 --> 00:18:22.436\n>> No, not at all.\n\n333\n00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:25.990\nBut we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna use\none that probably some people have been\n\n334\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.480\nfamiliar with before in the past.\n\n335\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.620\nAll right, now inside of Active Directory\nUsers Computers, we'll go ahead and\n\n336\n00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.950\nexpand this,\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n337\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:34.730\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\n\n338\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.650\nwe're gonna provision all of these\nusers that we just talked about.\n\n339\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.760\nAll right, so let me go ahead,\n\n340\n00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.400\nfirst thing I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna expand out the domain.\n\n341\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.330\nHow you set this up is\ncontingent on what your\n\n342\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.040\nActive Directory\ninfrastructure already is.\n\n343\n00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.880\nYour OU structure, your user structure.\n\n344\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.470\nSo certainly understand that these\ngroups and roles have to be here.\n\n345\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.440\nHow you set them up is really on how\nyour administrator, your engineers,\n\n346\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.110\nyour enterprise admins,\nhow they have that set up.\n\n347\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.670\nSo you'll definitely have to do\nsome talking with them for sure.\n\n348\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.310\n>> So your AD policy will basically\ndictate how you set this all\n\n349\n00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.530\ninto your Active Directory?\n\n350\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.820\n>> That's right, we have to have them\nthere for the purposes of managing\n\n351\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.410\nthe databases and managing the web\napplication pools in the background.\n\n352\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.370\nThey have to be there,\nwhere you put them, exactly like Dan said.\n\n353\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.030\nIt will be up to your infrastructure.\n\n354\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.680\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n355\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.150\nlet's talk about the first couple\nof groups that I want to create.\n\n356\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.530\nAnd, how you do this is, again, up to you.\n\n357\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.415\nI'm just gonna right-click out here in\na blank area, and I'm gonna choose Group,\n\n358\n00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:33.300\nall right?\n\n359\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.454\nNow with the group, the first one\nthat we're gonna do is Reporting.\n\n360\n00:19:37.454 --> 00:19:41.010\nAll right, now, remember that\nthis is a Global group, right,\n\n361\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.270\nwe're gonna be able to\nassign permissions to it.\n\n362\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.830\nWe're just gonna leave,\nSecurity group, I'm sorry.\n\n363\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.590\nWe're gonna assign permissions to it and\n\n364\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.860\nI'm just gonna leave it right like that,\nall right?\n\n365\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.470\nSo that's our Reporting group.\n\n366\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.480\nRemember that's one that we needed.\n\n367\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.000\nNow we've got a couple of other groups.\n\n368\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.930\nRemember we talked about\nnot only reporting,\n\n369\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.080\nwe talked about two of\nour Help Desk groups.\n\n370\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.690\nWe talked about, well, Help Desk.\n\n371\n00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.780\nWe've also talked about\nadvanced Help Desk.\n\n372\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.830\nLet's go ahead and\nget those groups provisioned.\n\n373\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.610\nSo we're just gonna right-click\nall out here in a blank area.\n\n374\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:15.236\nWe're gonna chose another Group here and\nwe're gonna call this HelpDesk.\n\n375\n00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:17.450\nAll right and\nwe're just gonna zoom in there so\n\n376\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.620\nyou guys can see what we're doing.\n\n377\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.520\nAgain, we're just gonna\ncall this one HelpDesk.\n\n378\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.530\nJust gonna leave it at\nthe default Global group.\n\n379\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.670\nIt's gonna be a Security group so that\nMBAM can assign its permissions to it.\n\n380\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.310\nAnd we'll choose OK.\n\n381\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.930\nNow we also have, right,\nremember a little bit more flair,\n\n382\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.500\na little bit higher up on the totem\npole is the advanced help group.\n\n383\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.530\nWe need to create one there as well.\n\n384\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.720\nNow, the names of these groups\naren't really specific.\n\n385\n00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.290\nRemember Active Directory under\nthe hood's just looking at a security\n\n386\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.188\nidentifier, a SID.\n\n387\n00:20:45.188 --> 00:20:48.100\nSo keep it, the naming convention and\n\n388\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.240\nsomething that is relative to you and\nyour environment.\n\n389\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.830\nI would say easily identifiable.\n\n390\n00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:59.760\nSo since I'm not too creative here, I'm\ngonna just gonna call this AdvHelpDesk.\n\n391\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.850\n>> Yeah, don't call them Scooby or\nShaggy or Bart Simpson or whatever.\n\n392\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.610\nCuz then you're like if you leave or\nif something happens,\n\n393\n00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.330\nyou don't use it for a while.\n\n394\n00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.614\nYou're like what is that account for\nagain?\n\n395\n00:21:08.614 --> 00:21:11.894\nIt doesn't really lend itself\nto being very descriptive so\n\n396\n00:21:11.894 --> 00:21:15.447\nalways be descriptive when you\ncreate your users and or groups.\n\n397\n00:21:15.447 --> 00:21:16.331\nAnd don't forget,\n\n398\n00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:19.254\nthere's a description bar there\nthat will help with that as well.\n\n399\n00:21:19.254 --> 00:21:21.028\nSo if you do want to\nget a little creative,\n\n400\n00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:23.430\nyou can and the description\nwill help you out with that.\n\n401\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.691\nJust always put something descriptive,\nI say.\n\n402\n00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:29.948\n>> And that's a good point, [CROSSTALK]\njust basic naming conventions, absolutely.\n\n403\n00:21:29.948 --> 00:21:33.527\nBecause if I name computers Omichron,\nif I name them Megatron,\n\n404\n00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:36.641\nif I name them Optimus Prime,\nif I name them Snake Eyes,\n\n405\n00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:40.180\neverybody's gonna say you're\na geek from the 80s, right?\n\n406\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.230\nBut when we look at those computers,\nwe have no clue what role they perform or\n\n407\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.120\nwhat they're doing for\nus inside of our network.\n\n408\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.921\nSo your naming convention is important.\n\n409\n00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:50.849\nSo now that we've got advanced help desk,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n410\n00:21:50.849 --> 00:21:51.870\nchoose OK to this one.\n\n411\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.760\nAll right, recap real quick.\n\n412\n00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.150\nWe've got three groups created, right?\n\n413\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.170\nWe've got the reporting group,\nwe've got the help desk group and\n\n414\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.290\nwe've got the advanced help desk group.\n\n415\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.460\nGot a couple more, remember.\n\n416\n00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.060\nNow, for\nthe purposes of this demonstration,\n\n417\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.730\nremember that I told you you\ncan create a group or a user.\n\n418\n00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.600\nNow I'm gonna make it simple, I'm gonna\ncreate a user for my read write, and\n\n419\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.950\nmy read onlys that we were talking about.\n\n420\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.980\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n421\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.050\nI'm gonna create New and User.\n\n422\n00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.746\nAll right, and Dan like I said,\nmy creative nature has got the best of me\n\n423\n00:22:24.746 --> 00:22:27.819\nhere, and\nwhat I mean by that is lackthereof.\n\n424\n00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:31.979\n[LAUGH] So, what I'm gonna do, is I'm\ngonna name that account, that account\n\n425\n00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:36.660\nthat's gonna be used to connect the web\napplications, I'm gonna call it MBAMRW.\n\n426\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.840\nI can look right at it,\nI know it's MBAM, and\n\n427\n00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.630\nit's supposed to be a read write account.\n\n428\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.680\nAnd I'm gonna choose Next.\n\n429\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.300\nNow, be careful on this one.\n\n430\n00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.310\nLike a lot of service accounts, and I know\nin Active Directory there are other ways\n\n431\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.660\nto provision service accounts guys,\nand if you're not familiar with that,\n\n432\n00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.000\ngo check out some of our\nActive Directory episodes.\n\n433\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.500\nWe're gonna go ahead, we're gonna set our\ngeneric password of dot dot dot dot dot,\n\n434\n00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.140\nand I'm gonna uncheck this\nuser must change password.\n\n435\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.650\nKeep in mind that if you're using this for\na service,\n\n436\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.080\nyou certainly don't want it to log on and\nthen the password's no good.\n\n437\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.402\nAnd I'm also gonna go ahead and say,\nuser cannot change password and\n\n438\n00:23:13.402 --> 00:23:14.441\nuser never expires.\n\n439\n00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:17.721\nNow, this is not the way you have to do\nit but again, for the testing purposes,\n\n440\n00:23:17.721 --> 00:23:20.640\nthis is the way we're gonna set it up and\nwe're gonna choose Finish.\n\n441\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.540\nSo that gives me my read write account.\n\n442\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.150\nNow you can probably see,\n\n443\n00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.350\nas creative as I am, [LAUGH] what\nmy read only account's gonna be.\n\n444\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.540\nSo we'll go ahead and choose New,\nand we're gonna choose User.\n\n445\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.385\nAnd I'm just gonna call this MBAMRO.\n\n446\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.740\nAnd same thing for the login name.\n\n447\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.555\nAgain, MBAMRO.\n\n448\n00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:46.630\nWe'll do the same thing that we did\nfirst with our read write account.\n\n449\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.611\nWe'll choose Next, we're gonna uncheck\nUser must change password at next logon.\n\n450\n00:23:50.611 --> 00:23:54.892\nAnd we're gonna choose Cannot change\npassword and Password never expires.\n\n451\n00:23:54.892 --> 00:24:01.614\nAnd then we're gonna put back up here\nour lovely dot, dot, dot password.\n\n452\n00:24:01.614 --> 00:24:04.800\nAnd we're gonna chose Next and\nthen Finish.\n\n453\n00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:10.040\nAll right, so that gives us our rewrite\naccount, our read only account.\n\n454\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.100\nThat gives us our three groups that\nwe need in our reporting group,\n\n455\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.150\nour help desk, and\nour advanced help desk group.\n\n456\n00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.200\nSo now we've got the users ready to go,\nDan.\n\n457\n00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.530\nNow it looks like we're, well,\n\n458\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.330\nready to control some\nActive Directory machines here.\n\n459\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.430\n>> Yeah, now we've talked about this\nin a prior episode that we're gonna\n\n460\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.240\ncontrol this through group policy,\nbut I've been in group policy before.\n\n461\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.340\nI've done a default installation of\nthese things many, many times, and\n\n462\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:42.200\nI don't recall ever seeing any\ntype of controls for MBAM.\n\n463\n00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.590\n>> Really?\nYou know what, you think he's right?\n\n464\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.260\nWell, let's find out.\n\n465\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.590\nLet's find out what Dan's talking about.\n\n466\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.610\nLet's go ahead, and we're gonna go\nback to our domain controller here.\n\n467\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.850\nBut this time,\nwe're gonna launch up the GPMC.\n\n468\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.420\nSorry for the acronym, guys out there,\nthe group policy management console.\n\n469\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.080\nAnd let's see if we can find\nout what Dan's talking about.\n\n470\n00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.148\nI'm gonna go back to\nthe server manager here, and\n\n471\n00:25:00.148 --> 00:25:03.067\nwe'll let server manager take\na second here, it'll launch back up.\n\n472\n00:25:03.067 --> 00:25:08.133\nAnd we're gonna go down to group policy\nmanagement, all right, and what I'm\n\n473\n00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:13.295\ngonna do is I'm gonna go ahead, and\nI think I'm gonna specify a BitLocker GPO.\n\n474\n00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:17.053\nAnd we're gonna look more at the GPOs\ncoming up in later episodes, but\n\n475\n00:25:17.053 --> 00:25:20.350\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna expand out the domain.\n\n476\n00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.900\nLet me go ahead and make this a little\neasier for you guys to see out there.\n\n477\n00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.263\nAll right, and what we're gonna\ndo is under group policies here,\n\n478\n00:25:27.263 --> 00:25:31.205\nwe're gonna choose new, and I'm gonna\ncall this BitLocker Management, right,\n\n479\n00:25:31.205 --> 00:25:33.533\nbecause we are set up for\nBitLocker Management.\n\n480\n00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:37.419\nIf I can spell management.\n\n481\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.062\n>> The silent Z gets you every time.\n\n482\n00:25:40.062 --> 00:25:42.896\n>> The silent Z, man,\nwhy did they put a J in BitLocker?\n\n483\n00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:43.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n484\n00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.960\nand then we're gonna go ahead, what we'll\ndo is we'll just open this policy up.\n\n485\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.500\nNow, like I said, we're gonna show you\ndeploying some of these settings here.\n\n486\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.360\nAll right, but\nwhat Dan was mentioning here is if, and\n\n487\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.890\nlet me see if I can make that a little\neasier for you guys to see there.\n\n488\n00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.060\nI know it's a little difficult here.\n\n489\n00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.440\nIf I come under Computer Configurations\n> Administrative Templates,\n\n490\n00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.970\nall right, and then under\nWindows Components, you're gonna see,\n\n491\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.490\nwell, we've got BitLocker Drive Encryption\nright there, all right?\n\n492\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.816\nAnd this is where we've talked about\nin other episodes how you do clients,\n\n493\n00:26:14.816 --> 00:26:17.760\njust basic BitLocker administration.\n\n494\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.550\nThis has nothing to do with MBAM.\n\n495\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.810\nIt doesn't have anything to do with MBAM.\n\n496\n00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.315\nAll right, so\nif I look down through this list and\n\n497\n00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:27.920\nI get down there to well,\nm, I only see one thing.\n\n498\n00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.700\nIt says Maintenance Scheduler.\n\n499\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.029\nWell, that's because MBAM and,\nreally, by association,\n\n500\n00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:37.440\nmight be good to mention this,\nMDOP in general,\n\n501\n00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.018\nthe whole entire kind of suite\nof technologies, is it natively,\n\n502\n00:26:42.018 --> 00:26:46.877\nby default, inside of Active Directory's\ngroup policy settings.\n\n503\n00:26:46.877 --> 00:26:48.247\nSo what we have-\n>> This is a bolt on.\n\n504\n00:26:48.247 --> 00:26:51.977\n>> That's right, that's right, this is\na modular add-on that we're gonna add on\n\n505\n00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.740\nafter the fact, and\nwe need to show you how to do that.\n\n506\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:00.530\nNow one of the great things about\nthe MDOP, as they would, the templates,\n\n507\n00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.150\nthe group policy templates that we need,\nis they're free for download.\n\n508\n00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.560\nAnd like I said,\nwe're gonna put this in the show notes.\n\n509\n00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.140\nI've got the URL, so\nthat if you wanted to go out and\n\n510\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.850\nyou can download MDOP's templates,\nyou can do that.\n\n511\n00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.750\nBut keep in mind that we need\na couple different files.\n\n512\n00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.810\nWe need our Settings file,\nwhich is our ADMX file, and\n\n513\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.350\nwe need our language files,\nright, all associated with MBAM.\n\n514\n00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.290\nNow, I might be talking\nforeign to you right now.\n\n515\n00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.880\nIf this information, ADMX and\n\n516\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.480\nADML files makes absolutely no\nsense to you, it's okay for\n\n517\n00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.690\nMBAM if you're studying it, and you really\ndon't need to know too much about that.\n\n518\n00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.980\nBut if you want more of that,\ndefinitely check out Active Directory.\n\n519\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.560\nSo Dan, let's go ahead and let's\nprovision group policy to, like you said,\n\n520\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.930\neven recognize the fact that MBAM or\nMDOP even exists.\n\n521\n00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.120\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and close down\nthe Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n522\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.220\nAnd we'll come back to that\ngroup policy a little bit later.\n\n523\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.482\nNow, there's a right way to do this.\n\n524\n00:27:55.482 --> 00:27:57.930\n[LAUGH] And\nthere's a wrong way to do this, and\n\n525\n00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:02.800\nlet me give you a heads-up, first of all.\n\n526\n00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.581\nIf I decided that I wanted to open these,\nyou can see right here, look here,\n\n527\n00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:12.540\nDan, we've got our ADML files, man,\nand we've got all kinds of ADMX files.\n\n528\n00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:19.200\nBut I want you to tell me, if you can\nthere, Dan, which one of these is English,\n\n529\n00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.260\nwhich one of these might be Japanese,\nwhich one is Spanish, English?\n\n530\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.570\n>> It's the one right there.\n\n531\n00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.105\n>> It's the one that says BitLocker,\nright?\n\n532\n00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:28.960\n>> [LAUGH] It's that one,\nno, no, the other one, Wes.\n\n533\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.150\n>> That's right.\n\n534\n00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.700\nSo you notice that you have this\ncompression tool and like plenty of zipped\n\n535\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.930\nfiles, right, we can unzip a file, and\nthen it extracts it to the location.\n\n536\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.840\nIf you do that, you're gonna have one ADML\nfile that says BitLocker management and\n\n537\n00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.900\n216 of them in brackets all\nnumerically sequentially numbered,\n\n538\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.640\nso that's not the way you do this\nwith what is known as a cab file.\n\n539\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.880\nOur template here if we, or\nwhere our templates are,\n\n540\n00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.350\nif I look at the properties here,\nyou're gonna see that it is a cab file.\n\n541\n00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.900\nSo we have to treat it\na little bit different.\n\n542\n00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.670\nSo we have to drop back\ndown to essentially\n\n543\n00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.180\nthe command prompt in order to do this.\n\n544\n00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.100\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo this through PowerShell.\n\n545\n00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.210\nBut before we do this, let me show you the\nsteps to make this a little bit easier.\n\n546\n00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.500\nI'm gonna actually take\nthis to local disk C.\n\n547\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.370\nI'm gonna drop this right here, and\nI'm gonna create a folder real quick.\n\n548\n00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:25.310\nAnd we'll just call it MDOP_Templates.\n\n549\n00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.720\nOr templats, whatever that might be.\n\n550\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.810\nAnd let's go ahead and\nfire up our BitLocker here.\n\n551\n00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.950\nAll right, and\nwe'll get back down to C: there.\n\n552\n00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.680\nAnd let's make sure that\nwe have our cab file, and\n\n553\n00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.180\nyou can see that we have our directory\nthere for our REM.templates.\n\n554\n00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.500\nNow in order to extract this,\nyou're gonna run your expand command.\n\n555\n00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.060\nAll right, and the first thing that you're\ngonna do is you're gonna point it to\n\n556\n00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:58.420\nthe cab file itself, so\nwe're just gonna do c:\\ and there we go.\n\n557\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.900\nWe've got MDOP_Templates cab file.\n\n558\n00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:07.260\nNext thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna specify switch F:*.\n\n559\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.950\nKeep that in mind or it will error out,\nand now we've gotta say,\n\n560\n00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.852\nokay, expand utility.\n\n561\n00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:16.000\nYou're gonna expand the cab file,\nbut what are you gonna do with it?\n\n562\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.200\nWell, that's why we went ahead and\nwe created that folder ahead of time.\n\n563\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.710\nSo let's go ahead and\npoint it to that folder.\n\n564\n00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.190\nAnd this will be MDOP,\nand you'll see templates.\n\n565\n00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.556\nAnd when we fire this one off here,\nyou're gonna see, man, a whole bunch of,\n\n566\n00:30:28.556 --> 00:30:30.400\ndid you see the matrix in there somewhere?\n\n567\n00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.837\nI think it was in there-\n>> Neo!\n\n568\n00:30:31.837 --> 00:30:33.462\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n569\n00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:38.461\nSo we've got all of this information\nhere that's been expanded or extracted,\n\n570\n00:30:38.461 --> 00:30:39.610\nif you will.\n\n571\n00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.023\nLet's go ahead and do a little bit,\nchange the directory here,\n\n572\n00:30:44.023 --> 00:30:48.370\nand we'll go into MDOP_Templates,\nand we'll do a dir here.\n\n573\n00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.920\nAnd now we've got\nMicrosoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n574\n00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.040\nLet's go ahead, Dan, and\nlet's go walk about here for a second, and\n\n575\n00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.760\nwe'll get into that location too.\n\n576\n00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.210\nAnd let me go ahead and clear this,\nand let's do a dir here.\n\n577\n00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:07.040\nNow these aren't just for MBAM alone.\n\n578\n00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.040\nYou can see all the different\nrevisions of MBAM,\n\n579\n00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.910\nand all the other utilities that are part\nof the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack\n\n580\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.530\nif you want to import them\ninto your Active Directory.\n\n581\n00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.220\nNow, we're gonna talk about some of\nthese other technologies in later\n\n582\n00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.710\nportions of this series.\n\n583\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.580\nBut the ones that I really\nwant here is MBAM, oops,\n\n584\n00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.722\nlet me make sure that I get it right here\n[LAUGH] MBAM 2.1 with Service Pack 1.\n\n585\n00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:34.180\nNow so\nthat will make it a little bit easier,\n\n586\n00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.910\nwe'll open another file explorer here.\n\n587\n00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.913\nAll right, and\nput that one over there, and\n\n588\n00:31:39.913 --> 00:31:42.842\nlet's go ahead and get into our templates.\n\n589\n00:31:42.842 --> 00:31:44.039\nNow with the templates,\n\n590\n00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:47.050\nyou've got two different files\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n591\n00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.360\nYou've got your ADMX files.\n\n592\n00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.240\nNow the ADMX files are the settings for\nBitLocker's management, right.\n\n593\n00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.027\nThat's the settings themselves.\n\n594\n00:31:55.027 --> 00:31:57.818\nNow they go into local disc C, and\n\n595\n00:31:57.818 --> 00:32:02.725\nthey're gonna go into\nthe policy's definition folder.\n\n596\n00:32:02.725 --> 00:32:07.028\nAnd, you can see here on the left hand\nside, this is where all of our settings\n\n597\n00:32:07.028 --> 00:32:11.210\nare that Dan mentioned, that we see\ninside of the GPO by default, right?\n\n598\n00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.540\nWell the problem is there isn't\nany BitLocker management in here.\n\n599\n00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ndo our control C.\n\n600\n00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.780\nCopy those over, control V.\n\n601\n00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.120\nWe're gonna paste them\nright into the ADMX files.\n\n602\n00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.620\nBut we're not done there.\n\n603\n00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.320\nNow our settings are present,\n\n604\n00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.230\nbut unfortunately we can't render\nthem in any language here.\n\n605\n00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.110\nAnd that's what the ADML file is, and\n\n606\n00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.710\nthat's where you have to pay\nattention to which language, right?\n\n607\n00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.170\nIf you're in Japan,\nobviously you're gonna want the ja.\n\n608\n00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.990\nIf you're in different locations you're\ngonna pick whichever the language is\n\n609\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.175\nthat's native to your tongue.\n\n610\n00:32:42.175 --> 00:32:46.960\nWe'll go ahead,\nwe're gonna copy these 80 ml files.\n\n611\n00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.760\nAnd these go into the en-US folder.\n\n612\n00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:56.180\nYou can see that we're using\nthe English addition of Group Policy.\n\n613\n00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.210\nWe paste them in there and\nwe're ready to go, right?\n\n614\n00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.410\nWell, let's verify.\n\n615\n00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:03.800\nThat's one of the things\nyou do want to do,\n\n616\n00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.030\nyou want to verify that those\nsettings are now there.\n\n617\n00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.820\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll fire up Server Manager here.\n\n618\n00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.220\nWe're gonna choose Tools.\n\n619\n00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.830\nWe'll get back to Group Policy Management.\n\n620\n00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:18.210\nAnd remember that BitLocker\nmanagement GPO that we created.\n\n621\n00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.440\nAnd earlier, like Dan said,\nhey, where are those settings?\n\n622\n00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.290\nThey weren't there.\n\n623\n00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.450\nWell let's find out if\nmagically they have appeared.\n\n624\n00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.790\nSo I'm just getting into\nGroup Policy here, guys.\n\n625\n00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.562\nI'm just right clicking on\nthe group policy in question here,\n\n626\n00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:32.560\nthe BitLocker Management, choosing edit.\n\n627\n00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.400\nAnd now when we get in here, and\nlet me zoom in a little bit,\n\n628\n00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.960\nmake it easier for you guys to see.\n\n629\n00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.260\nWe'll go ahead and\nexpand out the same location.\n\n630\n00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.840\nPolicies, Administrative Templates,\nthen Windows Components.\n\n631\n00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.510\nAnd by the way, if you're in an exam\nsituation, I would know this for the exam.\n\n632\n00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.540\nLike if you're in a Windows Client\ncertification, they might ask you this.\n\n633\n00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.335\nBut remember, that's the one that we\nseen earlier that was already there,\n\n634\n00:33:58.335 --> 00:33:59.940\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n635\n00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.130\nBut if we scroll down here, notice,\nremember we only had one M and\n\n636\n00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.670\nit said Maintenance Scheduler?\n\n637\n00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.850\nNow look what we have.\n\n638\n00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.790\nWe have MDOP MBAM.\n\n639\n00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:13.170\nAnd under here,\nit adds the same additional\n\n640\n00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.840\nones that we've seen under\nthe BitLocker administration, right?\n\n641\n00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.600\nIt's no different than\nwhat Normal bit lies.\n\n642\n00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.343\nNormal, I don't know if there's\na normality against it, but\n\n643\n00:34:21.343 --> 00:34:24.170\nthis is what basic BitLocker\nmanagement would be.\n\n644\n00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.630\nBut now we have Client Management,\nall right?\n\n645\n00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:32.050\nAnd we look at the Client Management, we\ncan control things like the Services and\n\n646\n00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.930\ndifferent things inside of MBAM that\nwe just didn't have the flexibility.\n\n647\n00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:40.510\nAnd Group Policy by default doesn't\nhave the reach to go out and grab and\n\n648\n00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.160\nconfigure those.\n\n649\n00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.020\nNow we've got those groups ready to go.\n\n650\n00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.410\nWe've got our ADMX files in the right\nlocation, we've got our language,\n\n651\n00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:52.910\nour ADML files in the right location,\nActive Directory, this server,\n\n652\n00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.310\nthis domain itself,\nshould be provisioned, and\n\n653\n00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.770\nwe should be prepared to start\ngetting ready to deploy MBAM.\n\n654\n00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:59.890\n>> Awesome stuff, Wes.\n\n655\n00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.170\nAnd this is what it takes for\nus to prepare.\n\n656\n00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.270\nIt's not just a turn key operation.\n\n657\n00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.540\nWe have to bolt some things on, slap some\nthings together, so that when we are done\n\n658\n00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.950\nwith that, then we're ready to implement\nthis in our networks and our environments.\n\n659\n00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.910\nWes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n660\n00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.730\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thanks for explaining this for us so\n\n661\n00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.630\nthat we didn't maybe dive headfirst into\na problem we weren't even ready for.\n\n662\n00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.010\nWe didn't even know it existed.\n\n663\n00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.450\nNow we're ready to rock and roll.\n\n664\n00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.670\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n665\n00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.080\nHopefully this has informed you\nas far as the MDOP series goes.\n\n666\n00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.920\nBut it is time for us to sign off.\n\n667\n00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.140\nFor ITProTV,\nI’ve been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n668\n00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.970\n>> And I’m Wes Bryan.\n\n669\n00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.648\n>> Well see you next time.\n\n670\n00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:41.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Pro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.155\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:21.025\nIn todays episode we\nare continuing on with our\n\n5\n00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.935\nMicrosoft desktop optivation pack series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:27.625\nJoining us back in the studio to help\nus out with that to help guide our way,\n\n7\n00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.055\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.785\nWes, welcome back to the show\nsir how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:32.085\n>> It's going great as always.\n\n10\n00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.870\nGood to be here with the IT Pro.TV\nin the studios and that's right,\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.180\nwe are moving on with our Microsoft\nbitlocker administration and monitoring.\n\n12\n00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.300\nAnd if you've been watching this series\nyou might be asking well what have we done\n\n13\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.150\nso far with MBAM?\n\n14\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.625\nAnd the answer to that is\nwell absolutely nothing.\n\n15\n00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.080\n[LAUGH] We have a lot of prerequisites.\n\n16\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.671\n>> We got it ready right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:53.585\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n18\n00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:54.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Working up to it.\n\n19\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.630\n>> That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.924\n>> It's a process.\n\n21\n00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.590\n>> [LAUGH] We, in the first episodes\nwe kind of showed you a little bit\n\n22\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.210\nabout the components so you know what to\nexpect if you are gonna implement mbam and\n\n23\n00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.420\nin one of the episodes we also went\nahead and provisioned active directory.\n\n24\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.830\nSo that in the installation of MBAM,\nactive directory says, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.390\nI understand what's going on here and we\ndon't catch active directory by surprise.\n\n26\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.750\nIn this episode,\nwe're going to get to the installation.\n\n27\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.060\nWe're actually going to install MBAM.\n\n28\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.630\nI know you've been waiting for\nit for the last two episodes here.\n\n29\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.100\nIn the third episode,\nwe've got you covered.\n\n30\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.930\nSo there are some prerequisites that\nwe are going to go through as far as\n\n31\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.490\ninstalling MBAM.\n\n32\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.330\nUnfortunately, like a lot of software,\nyou can't just go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.100\nthrow the software and\nhope everything's going to work.\n\n34\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.980\nOur server needs to be prepared even\nthough we've got active directory,\n\n35\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.200\nour domain prepared for MBAM.\n\n36\n00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.540\nSo we're going to walk through\ngetting this server prepared,\n\n37\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.040\nand then finish this episode with\nactually installing the AMBAM software\n\n38\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.860\nnow as far as some of the prerequisites\ngo, there is a handful of them and IAS and\n\n39\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.190\nSQL server we're gonna put those in the\nshow notes you're gonna see us do it here.\n\n40\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.940\nBut we're really not gonna go into too\nmuch depth on each individual piece and\n\n41\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.730\ntalking about it.\n\n42\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.930\nBut we'll definitely put that in the show\nnotes and we'll put some documentations\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.900\nout there at Tech Net we'll put\nsome URLs that we can refer you to.\n\n44\n00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.690\nSo if you really are thinking\nabout deploying this out,\n\n45\n00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.930\nyou'll have a good laundry list\nof the information ready to go.\n\n46\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.240\nSo that you can install MBAM.\n\n47\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.640\nSo let's go ahead, Dan you say\nwe've been waiting for awhile now,\n\n48\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.990\nwe've been talking a lot about it.\n\n49\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.820\nLet's go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.680\nget a little bit closer to actually seeing\nwhat the m-band console looks like.\n\n51\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.440\nOne of the first things we're gonna do,\nremember we had a series of servers,\n\n52\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000\nwe had a domain controller, we had two\nWindows Server 2012, our two servers.\n\n53\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.820\nWe're gonna take those two servers and,\nin the demo environment,\n\n54\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.980\nwe're gonna merge those into one.\n\n55\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.260\nYou can in a larger environment.\n\n56\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.030\nAnd it's probably recommended at larger\nenvironments that you separate these roles\n\n57\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.410\non a two different servers,\nwhether it be the administration and\n\n58\n00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.800\nthe monitoring website, or\nthat server in general.\n\n59\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.720\nRemember it has the admin and\nmonitoring website in the self portal.\n\n60\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.310\nAnd then we have our databases on\nanother server which are compliance and\n\n61\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.320\naudit databases, our recovery databases,\nand again, for a lot of the larger\n\n62\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.000\nenvironments, you'll probably separate\nthose roles onto different servers.\n\n63\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.720\nHere on our server,\nlet's see what did I name this server?\n\n64\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.340\nServer01, we're actually going to be\ninstalling the prerequisites not only for\n\n65\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.040\nMBAM but also the prerequisites for\nthe SQL Server coming up too.\n\n66\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.290\nSo let's go ahead and we'll dive right\nin here, one of the first things that\n\n67\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.130\nwe're going to do is we have to\ninstall IIS, IIS is a requirement.\n\n68\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.250\nWe've got websites running, we don't have\na webserver, we don't have any websites.\n\n69\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.890\nThat is something that we need to do.\n\n70\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.170\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna walk through the Adrole and\n\n71\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.690\nfeatures wizard here.\n\n72\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.480\nWe're gonna select the current\nserver that we're on.\n\n73\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.340\nIf you haven't seen how to do installation\nof some of these roles and features,\n\n74\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.890\nwe've got a lot of good server episodes\nthat can walk you through these\n\n75\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.980\nindividual steps,\ngo ahead and check those out.\n\n76\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.980\nIf any of this, if the server manager\nconsole seems foreign to you and\n\n77\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.070\nyou can kind of refresh what that's about\nwhen you come back to this episode.\n\n78\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.610\nAll right, so in IIS we're gonna\nscroll down here in our features or\n\n79\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.260\nthis is our roles list and we're going to\ninstall the web server and thank goodness,\n\n80\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.420\nit's not like it was back\nin 2003 have to go get your\n\n81\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.770\ninstallation media somewhere and\nfigure out all the prerequisites.\n\n82\n00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.460\nIt's going to let us know.\n\n83\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.610\nWe've got to add some\nfeatures with this too.\n\n84\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.440\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwalk through.\n\n85\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.240\nNow, there are a few features in\nthe server itself that need to be present,\n\n86\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.130\nso we're gonna wanna have these.\n\n87\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.940\nI'm gonna go ahead and expand this out.\n\n88\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.030\nWe're gonna want the .NET three framework.\n\n89\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.210\nNow the .NET 3.5, excuse me, framework\nis actually for your SQL SQL platform.\n\n90\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.510\nBut since we're here, we might as well\ngo ahead and install it all at once and\n\n91\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.020\nnot have to come back and\nhave SQL look for the prerequisites and\n\n92\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.820\nsay well this is missing,\nyou have to go back and install it.\n\n93\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:10.000\nNow under the .NET 4.5 features, there are\na couple of things that we need here too.\n\n94\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.849\nWe're going to expand\nout the WCF services.\n\n95\n00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.670\nAnd what we needed here\nare couple of different things.\n\n96\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.450\nWe need the http activation.\n\n97\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.350\nAnd it's gonna actually, what's really\nkinda cool about this, I like the NR.\n\n98\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.370\nSome of these features and\napplication development,\n\n99\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.150\nwe actually need to support MBAM.\n\n100\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.880\nSo that's gonna come into play for\nus nicely.\n\n101\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.480\nWe also need the TCP activation as well.\n\n102\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.390\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and scroll down.\n\n103\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.980\nCuz there's another one down\nhere that kinda hides itself And\n\n104\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.390\nthat is the Windows process activation\nservice if I expand this out\n\n105\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.560\nmake sure all three of these are checked\nthe Process Model, .NET Environment 3.5.\n\n106\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.420\nAnd the configuration APIs you can\nsee that it isn't selected here and\n\n107\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.730\nthat will cause you a problem so you\nwanna make sure that that is selected and\n\n108\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.840\nthen we'll chose next.\n\n109\n00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.090\nNow that has got some of the features in\nthe server itself that we need installed,\n\n110\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.990\nbut we do have some things now that we\nbet into IIS's configurations that we\n\n111\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.810\nneed to kinda peek and tweak and\nmake sure we have available.\n\n112\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.950\nSo we'll go ahead and choose next to this.\n\n113\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.930\nNow one of the good things is that, by\ndefault, under the Common HTTP Features,\n\n114\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.640\nboth of the ones that we\nneed are already selected,\n\n115\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.890\nyou need your default document and\nyour static content.\n\n116\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.380\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna scroll down here a little bit.\n\n117\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.820\nWe're gonna put the other\none you need under security.\n\n118\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.240\nYou need Windows authentication and\n\n119\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.550\nthen we have some application development\nextensions that we need as well.\n\n120\n00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.110\nAnd one of the great things about\nthis is when we added our 4.5 feature\n\n121\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.760\n.NET framework,\nit added the ISA API extensions and\n\n122\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.510\nthe filters as well so\nwe should be good for there.\n\n123\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.680\nLet me just scroll through here and double\ncheck, make sure that we have everything\n\n124\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.800\nand we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose next.\n\n125\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.630\nNow if your machine doesn't have an\ninternet connection you are gonna have to\n\n126\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.780\nkeep in mind that it needs access\nto an ISO so let me go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.530\njust reassure that we have our\ninstallation media present and\n\n128\n00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.500\navailable All right, and there it is.\n\n129\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.380\nI've got my sever installation there.\n\n130\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.940\nJust wanna make sure gonna specify\nthat alternate path here real quick.\n\n131\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.950\nAnd it might be unique to\nyour own environment, so\n\n132\n00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.650\njust pay attention to where\nyour optical drive might be and\n\n133\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.460\nwe're in the sources backslash sxs.\n\n134\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.160\nWe'll go ahead and choose okay,\nand we're gonna to go ahead and\n\n135\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.630\ninstall those features.\n\n136\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.058\nNow, as the installation progresses\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n137\n00:07:47.058 --> 00:07:51.326\none of things we have to install\nnext Is the SQL installation.\n\n138\n00:07:51.326 --> 00:07:53.049\nBut rather than make you sit here and\n\n139\n00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:56.557\nwait through the magic of TV we're gonna\ngo ahead and take a TV timeout and\n\n140\n00:07:56.557 --> 00:08:00.560\nwe'll come back and we're gonna\nmove on with the SQL installation.\n\n141\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.320\nAll right, so we finished our IAS\ninstallation, and then the next thing that\n\n142\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.840\nwe're gonna do, we got a couple more\nthings that we need to install.\n\n143\n00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.220\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's go back to my computer here, and\n\n144\n00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.800\nyou can see the installation\nis successful.\n\n145\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.670\nAnd you can see the summary.\n\n146\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.970\nKeep in mind some of\nthe prerequisites that you need.\n\n147\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.940\nOne of the great things, though,\nI will tell you about the MBAM software is\n\n148\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.970\nif you go to install MBAM, and\nyou don't have these prerequisites,\n\n149\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.640\nit's gonna give you a list at the end,\na summary that says prerequisites not met,\n\n150\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.360\nand you can always go back and\nreinstall them.\n\n151\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.300\nNow there is a stand alone piece of\nsoftware that you have to install.\n\n152\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.370\nAnd let me kinda zoom in here, so\nyou guys can see what that is.\n\n153\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.230\nThat's the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC\nfourth edition.\n\n154\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.020\n>> That's a mouthful.\n\n155\n00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.066\n>> Boy, I'll tell you what.\n\n156\n00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that is a super acronym for sure.\n\n157\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.390\nBe careful on where you get this.\n\n158\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.080\nIf you get this, you can potentially\ndownload the whole entire Visual Studio.\n\n159\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.860\nYou don't need that.\n\n160\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.930\nThey do have a standalone installer.\n\n161\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.970\nI made the mistake of going through and\ndownloading about six\n\n162\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.810\ngigabytes of information when you\nonly need a few hundred megs at best.\n\n163\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.070\nAnd you can see here, it's just a standard\nEULA, just say I agree and install.\n\n164\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.030\nThe set up process,\nfairly straightforward,\n\n165\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.820\nthe installer does all the work for you.\n\n166\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.901\nOnce it's done,\nwe're just gonna click close on this.\n\n167\n00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:20.337\nAnd now, the next thing that we're\ngonna be doing, we'll go ahead and\n\n168\n00:09:20.337 --> 00:09:21.360\nlet this finish installing.\n\n169\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.390\nThe next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n170\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.670\nwe're gonna install the SQL server.\n\n171\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.400\nSQL server has to be present, remember,\n\n172\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.530\nbecause you're gonna be\nrunning your databases.\n\n173\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.860\nSo it is important to\nhave that software up and\n\n174\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.700\nrunning on your server\nbefore we install MBAM.\n\n175\n00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.132\nNow, for the purposes, and\nit looks like it's successful,\n\n176\n00:09:41.132 --> 00:09:45.030\nfor the purposes of this demonstration,\nwe're using SQL 2014.\n\n177\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.537\nI know 2016 is out now.\n\n178\n00:09:47.537 --> 00:09:54.622\nI know that there's 2012, MBAM supports\nmultiple different versions of SQL server.\n\n179\n00:09:54.622 --> 00:09:58.634\nSo depending on what your company's\nrunning, what you have access to,\n\n180\n00:09:58.634 --> 00:10:03.174\njust look at the prerequisites and some of\nthe supported SQL installations to make\n\n181\n00:10:03.174 --> 00:10:06.820\nsure that you are prepared for\nwhatever environment you're in.\n\n182\n00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.760\nSo we'll go ahead, and what we're gonna\ndo is we're just gonna mount our ISO.\n\n183\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.410\nOne of the great things I like about in\nWindows today, you don't have to go to\n\n184\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.930\na third party software like\nVirtual CloneDrive or anything anymore.\n\n185\n00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.180\nIt's got native capabilities\nto mount these ISOs.\n\n186\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.700\nNow what we wanna run here\nis the setup.exe here.\n\n187\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:30.082\nWe'll go ahead and run that, And\n\n188\n00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:32.820\nprobably ran about four instances of that.\n\n189\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.343\nSo takes a little bit, and\nas this software goes to start up,\n\n190\n00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:43.670\nit's going to just inspect what state that\nthe server is here, and there it goes.\n\n191\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.040\nAnd another thing to keep in mind is that\nas we go through our SQL installation,\n\n192\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.510\nit's gonna be very basic.\n\n193\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.150\nIt's gonna be pretty much just\nall of the defaults here.\n\n194\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.280\nWe're gonna make sure\nthat our administrator\n\n195\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.700\nis the user that can access\nthe SQL database here.\n\n196\n00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.930\nAnd boy, this one takes a little bit.\n\n197\n00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.972\nYeah, and I did open quite a few instances\nthere, went click happy on that one, Dan,\n\n198\n00:11:06.972 --> 00:11:07.490\nfor sure.\n\n199\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.697\n[LAUGH] We'll go to our installation here,\nover on the left hand side at the top,\n\n200\n00:11:12.697 --> 00:11:17.130\nand we're gonna choose a new SQL\nserver standalone installation,\n\n201\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.530\nor add features that we already had,\nour SQL server.\n\n202\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.300\nNow what's interesting about this is\nthere's only really a couple of these\n\n203\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.010\nfeatures in SQL that you\nneed to support MBAM.\n\n204\n00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:34.510\nSo you don't need some of the elaborate\nservices and features that SQL has in it.\n\n205\n00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.020\nIf you are going to scale\nup to a larger environment,\n\n206\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.450\nif you have thousands of devices, you\nmight be using things like fail over and\n\n207\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.480\nsome of the other things that SQL offers.\n\n208\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.455\nBut again, for the purposes of this\ndemonstration being small and just knowing\n\n209\n00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:52.490\nhow to get MBAM up and running, that's\nreally what's gonna be important for us.\n\n210\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.476\nNow, we've got our product key all set up,\nready to go.\n\n211\n00:11:56.476 --> 00:12:00.490\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose next,\nand we're going to sign our life away.\n\n212\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.650\nWe'll test Dan at the end of this\nepisode on that little subsection of\n\n213\n00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.760\nthe clause of this EULA, make sure\nthat I didn't just sign my car or\n\n214\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.390\nmy paycheck for\nthe next nine months away from Microsoft.\n\n215\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.275\n>> You're in no danger, it's kidneys.\n\n216\n00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:16.780\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, very good.\n\n217\n00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.530\nAll right, so\n\n218\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.060\nnow what it's gonna do is it's gonna\ngo through, and it needs to know,\n\n219\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.980\nare the prerequisites for installing SQL,\nare they there and are they available?\n\n220\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.020\nAnd we went ahead and\nwhen we were installing IIS,\n\n221\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.990\nwe made sure that these\nprerequisites were available.\n\n222\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.671\nThe one that we do need to make\nsure that's installed to support,\n\n223\n00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:44.630\nSQL Reporting Services is going to be\nthe .Net Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1.\n\n224\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.500\nAnd you can see, when Dan and I were\ninstalling the IIS, we went ahead and\n\n225\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.420\nincluded that in there.\n\n226\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.300\nThere's no reason to double up on that.\n\n227\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.244\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose Next.\n\n228\n00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:59.319\nAnd one of the interesting\nthings you might see,\n\n229\n00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:01.600\nit's gonna error out on me here.\n\n230\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.910\nI need to give it some Internet\nconnectivity, so let me go ahead and\n\n231\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.990\ndo that real quick.\n\n232\n00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:14.159\nThrough the power of virtual machines,\nwe can enable a network adapter,\n\n233\n00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:17.910\ngive it a second to pick up\nan IP address here real quick.\n\n234\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.510\nAnd we can just wait for\nit to grab its IP address.\n\n235\n00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:28.355\nAnd one of the things that it's telling\nme is it wants to check to make sure you\n\n236\n00:13:28.355 --> 00:13:32.820\nhave updates available, and it's saying,\nhey, I can't find your update server here.\n\n237\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.040\nAll right, so one of the things that\nyou might run into a little bit of\n\n238\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.170\nproblem is if you don't have\nan Internet connection for\n\n239\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.830\nwhen you're checking on\nwhether updates are available.\n\n240\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.330\nAnd when I enabled the network adaptor,\nsometimes the installer here,\n\n241\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.170\nit doesn't realize that you have\nenabled the network adaptor.\n\n242\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.940\nSo if that happens, just close\nthe installer, give yourself Internet\n\n243\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.190\nconnection, close the installer down,\nand then just go ahead and restart it.\n\n244\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.550\nAnd then it picks up on the fact, and\nyou could see it doesn't give a problem or\n\n245\n00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.450\nanything right there.\n\n246\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.900\nAnd it says, hey,\nyou needed an Internet connection just for\n\n247\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.580\nus to tell you every bit of\nthose steps were skipped.\n\n248\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.735\nI don't know if you caught there, so\nit does kind of balk at you there.\n\n249\n00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:13.075\nNow, the firewall,\nit's giving us a warning here.\n\n250\n00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:15.605\nAgain, we're not really going into\nSQL here, but this is more for\n\n251\n00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.365\nthe remote management side of SQL.\n\n252\n00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:20.115\nSo, it's just letting you know\nthat that's blocked right now.\n\n253\n00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:23.452\nAnd if you want anybody to\nremotely manage this SQL server,\n\n254\n00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:25.802\nthen you're gonna have to deal with that.\n\n255\n00:14:25.802 --> 00:14:28.822\n>> So Wes, we're installing,\nobviously, we've installed IIS, so\n\n256\n00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:30.062\nnow we're installing SQL.\n\n257\n00:14:30.062 --> 00:14:33.362\nThese are all components for, that\ngives us the ability to obviously like\n\n258\n00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:37.290\nhave a list of items and attributes,\nthat's gonna be our database, right?\n\n259\n00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.450\nThat's what SQL's for.\n\n260\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.820\nAnd then IIS,\nis that gonna run the graphical front end?\n\n261\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.050\n>> It's interesting-\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Management.\n\n262\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.580\n>> Yes, and that's absolutely correct.\n\n263\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.500\nWhat IIS does is it runs\nthe administration and monitoring website.\n\n264\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.937\nSo that's why we need the web server, and\n\n265\n00:14:52.937 --> 00:14:58.100\nthe databases that Dan's talking about are\nwhere the information on the backend goes.\n\n266\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.362\nSo if I'm the advanced help desk role,\n\n267\n00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:04.560\nright, that we were talking about in a\nprevious episode, right, I need to connect\n\n268\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.960\nto the management interface, again,\nthe administration and monitoring website.\n\n269\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.200\nBut then I wanna run a compliance report,\nright, on that website.\n\n270\n00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.550\nWell, where does it gather\nthat information from?\n\n271\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.680\nAnd this is where SQL comes into play for\nus, what we're setting up now.\n\n272\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.340\nBecause that information is sitting\nin things like the compliance and\n\n273\n00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.820\naudit database inside of the SQL server,\n\n274\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.060\nthe recovery database as well,\nindividual compliance reports.\n\n275\n00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.770\nAll that information gets stored on the\nbackend in actually three different SQL\n\n276\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.722\ndatabases here.\n\n277\n00:15:33.722 --> 00:15:37.376\nAll right, so we'll go ahead, and we'll\nmove forward in the installation here.\n\n278\n00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:39.680\nWe're gonna let it look through\nwhat are the instances.\n\n279\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.810\nOne of the great things\nare we only need two.\n\n280\n00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.289\nWe need the database engine services, and\nthen this is really, really important.\n\n281\n00:15:46.289 --> 00:15:51.066\nAnd if you're in a certification endeavor,\nif you happen to come across this\n\n282\n00:15:51.066 --> 00:15:55.548\nmaybe in a client exam, where they're\nsaying you need to support MBAM,\n\n283\n00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:58.799\nwhich of these components\nare required to support?\n\n284\n00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:01.292\nDon't worry about all the SQL stuff.\n\n285\n00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:05.492\nJust know that it's SQL services or\nSQL server reporting services and\n\n286\n00:16:05.492 --> 00:16:09.693\nthat's what we're really putting\nhere is the reporting services and\n\n287\n00:16:09.693 --> 00:16:11.700\nwe'll go ahead and choose next.\n\n288\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.590\nNow from here on out guys,\nwe're just leaving the defaults.\n\n289\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.770\nWe're really not doing\nanything out of the ordinary.\n\n290\n00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.730\nYou're going to see on the next couple\nof pages, we have to figure out\n\n291\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.220\nwhat is the end user, if you will, that's\ngoing to be responsible for the database\n\n292\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.770\nas far as setting it up, and that's just\ngoing to be our local administrator.\n\n293\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.780\nWe're going to keep\nthe default instance the same.\n\n294\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.210\nWe're not even changing the names or\nanything, all right.\n\n295\n00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.890\nAnd what's great about this too, Dan,\neven though I say that we're putting this\n\n296\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.530\nadministrator in as\nmanaging the SQL database,\n\n297\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.490\nit's really gonna be that's gonna do this.\n\n298\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.530\nThis is just for the setup portion.\n\n299\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.620\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nI'm gonna change all of these\n\n300\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.660\nservices to start up automatically, again\njust for the purposes of the demonstration\n\n301\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.910\non the back end if you are doing this\nyo might have to look for your SQL or\n\n302\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:01.260\nyour database administrators on how they\nwant to fine tune SQL to suit their needs.\n\n303\n00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.960\nChoose next here.\n\n304\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.540\nAnd here's where we add the users,\nremember we added that\n\n305\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.990\nWindows authentication mode, we're\njust gonna add the current user here.\n\n306\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.390\nVery easy, straightforward process.\n\n307\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.570\nWe'll choose next.\n\n308\n00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.050\nNow, you've got a couple of\nthings that you can do here.\n\n309\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.400\nIf you want to do post configuration,\nand that's not really too fun but\n\n310\n00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.250\nyou can if you want, we can say\njust install the service now but\n\n311\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.720\ndon't do anything and\nwe'll configure it later.\n\n312\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose this option and for\n\n313\n00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.680\nyour testing purposes,\nI would suggest this.\n\n314\n00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.330\nNotice how it says, installs and\nconfigures the report server in native\n\n315\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.610\nmode, this server is operational\nafter this setup completes.\n\n316\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.860\nThat's what we want, cuz we want,\n\n317\n00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.890\nonce these two major roles\nare implemented on this server,\n\n318\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.750\nwe want MBAM to be able to connect to them\nright away, during its setup process.\n\n319\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.720\nSo that's why I'm gonna\nchoose that option there.\n\n320\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.570\nWe'll choose next.\n\n321\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.310\nAll right.\nAnd we got our typical\n\n322\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.630\nsummary pane that you see on just\nabout any installation and server or\n\n323\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.630\nclient installation on different software,\nthe different features that you've chose.\n\n324\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.980\nMake sure that you do review them.\n\n325\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.050\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ngo through the installation process.\n\n326\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.740\nNow, with the installation process on SQL,\n\n327\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.110\nit could take awhile cuz there's\na lot of stuff that goes on.\n\n328\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.110\nA lot of checks and\nbalances that come into play for us so\n\n329\n00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.070\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna use the magic of a TV and\n\n330\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.110\nwe're gonna come back once\nthis installation is finished.\n\n331\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.760\nSo that you don't have to sit here and\n\n332\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.359\ndredge through the long\ninstallation process.\n\n333\n00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.420\nAll right, so looks like our\nSQL installation has finished.\n\n334\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.140\nAnd let's take a look at it and just\nverify that everything did succeed and\n\n335\n00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.120\nthat we are successful.\n\n336\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.790\nWe do have one of the big components\nthat we need for Mbam and\n\n337\n00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.630\nthat's that reporting\nservices in the native mode.\n\n338\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.540\nSo, looks like we're good there,\nnow I've gone ahead and\n\n339\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.320\nI already pulled over\nthe Microsoft Desktop optimization Pack.\n\n340\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.050\nRemember we showed you how to mount\nthe file, extract the information,\n\n341\n00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.980\nif you dont see that,\nif you don't know how to do that,\n\n342\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.960\nvery easy just like we did\nSQL when we installed it.\n\n343\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.540\nWe're going to right click on it and\nchoose mount.\n\n344\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.310\nAnd as you can see right here,\n\n345\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.240\nwe've got all the different various\ncomponents that are known as MDOP.\n\n346\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.720\nAnd the one that we want\nhere is going to be MBAM.\n\n347\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.770\nI've gone ahead and\nI've already copied it over, and\n\n348\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.765\nwe're now Looking at this folder here.\n\n349\n00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:27.285\nNotice that there are a few\ndifferent additions of MBAM.\n\n350\n00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:33.305\nPay attention to the one that\nis specific to your environment.\n\n351\n00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:37.810\nWe're doing this with Windows 10, because\nthat's the current operating system.\n\n352\n00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:43.990\nSo if you want to do that, you're going\nto use the MBAM 2.5 with service pack 1.\n\n353\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.060\nI will tell you that 2.5\ndoes support Windows 10.\n\n354\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.230\nBut this has got some interesting\nfeatures that I want to talk about.\n\n355\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:57.740\nThat kind of set it apart from\nthe earlier non service pack 1 edition.\n\n356\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.600\nWe'll go ahead and look in here.\n\n357\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.230\nWe've got some documentation.\n\n358\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.640\nSimple readme.txt document if you want and\nwe've got our installers.\n\n359\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.090\nThis is important,\nkeep in mind the architecture that you\n\n360\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:15.610\nare going to be supporting,\nyou can see 64-bit vs 32-bit.\n\n361\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.230\nAlright, and there's our server set-up so\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n362\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.630\nwe're gonna run the server set-up.\n\n363\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.720\nAnd we'll choose next and\nI'll go ahead and close this down.\n\n364\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.210\nGot our end user license agreement.\n\n365\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.365\nAgain, probably just gave\naway the other kidney.\n\n366\n00:20:30.365 --> 00:20:30.980\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n367\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.930\n>> You don't need kidneys right?\n\n368\n00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.018\n>> No.\n>> No they're overrated.\n\n369\n00:20:34.018 --> 00:20:36.970\n[LAUGH] Now, got a couple of things.\n\n370\n00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.230\nWindows update, the CEIP, the customer\nexperience improvement program.\n\n371\n00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust opt-out of both of those for now.\n\n372\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.630\nYou certainly, any software in\ngeneral should be updated even more so\n\n373\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.390\nwhen it's security software.\n\n374\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.020\nSo that is not for a production\nenvironment and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n375\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.650\nbegin the installation.\n\n376\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.320\nKeep in mind that it is, it does require\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n377\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.680\nBut, non administrator should never\nbe logging into servers anyways.\n\n378\n00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.430\nSo you should be good.\n\n379\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.145\nIf not, maybe you need to think\nabout maybe not using MBam, and\n\n380\n00:21:09.145 --> 00:21:10.530\n[LAUGH] review your security policy.\n\n381\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.380\n>> This is a great security episodes\nhere at ITPro TV that you might be\n\n382\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.123\ninterested in.\n\n383\n00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:16.621\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, absolutely, Dan.\n\n384\n00:21:16.621 --> 00:21:19.570\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nuncheck this.\n\n385\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.010\nWait, what happened?\n\n386\n00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.180\nWe're finished right?\n\n387\n00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.415\nUnfortunately not.\n\n388\n00:21:24.415 --> 00:21:29.010\n[LAUGH] All that did is getting\nour server ready for MBAM.\n\n389\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.520\nSo you can see there's a lot of stuff\nthat's very redundant if we ever get into\n\n390\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.360\nMBAM itself.\n\n391\n00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.070\nWell go down to our start menu,\nour start screen here, and\n\n392\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:42.200\nthis is one of the reasons I didn't\nwanna just go ahead and use that check\n\n393\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.570\nmark because you have this MBAM Server\nconfiguration wizard that's right here.\n\n394\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.140\nAnd by the way, if I would have\nleft that check box in there\n\n395\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.450\nthis is where it would have taken us but\n\n396\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.200\nI want you to see that it is on the start\nmenu and the start screen there.\n\n397\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.090\nAll right so\nwe're gonna add some new features here and\n\n398\n00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.430\nthis is the BitLocker Administration and\nMonitoring finally Dan after all of that\n\n399\n00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.700\nSetup we'll get to where well,\nwe need to be.\n\n400\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.280\nWe'll choose add features,\nnow remember some of the roles and\n\n401\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.680\nfeatures that we talked about.\n\n402\n00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.670\nYou gonna see that you give\nthe ability to check which services or\n\n403\n00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.750\nwhich features you wanna have\navailable on the server.\n\n404\n00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:22.180\nKeep in mind we're gonna have\nthe databases we got SQL already, right?\n\n405\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.080\nSo we can support databases now.\n\n406\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.180\nWe can also support the reports too.\n\n407\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.760\nThe other thing that we're gonna\nbe installing on this in the web\n\n408\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.320\napplications.\n\n409\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.910\nAnd that is the administration and\nmonitoring website.\n\n410\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.690\nAnd then the self service portal.\n\n411\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:44.560\nIf you are doing SCCM integration, you do\nhave the option to do that there, as well.\n\n412\n00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.420\nHowever, this is not a show\non SCCM integration.\n\n413\n00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.090\nSo we are not going to\nbe using that option.\n\n414\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.900\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nchoose next.\n\n415\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.630\nAnd what it's going to do is\nit's going to run through.\n\n416\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.030\nAnd it's going to look and make sure that\nwe have all the prerequisites and well,\n\n417\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.440\nif I don't have the prerequisite here,\nwe're just gonna go back and install it.\n\n418\n00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.420\nRemember one of the things that I told\nyou is that if you are installing MBAM,\n\n419\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.510\nand maybe you forgot a service, and\n\n420\n00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.380\nI very well you can see right here on\ncamera, I might have missed a service too.\n\n421\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.550\nIt's gonna let you know.\n\n422\n00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.060\nIt's searching for the prerequisite, and\n\n423\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.540\nat the end of it finds something that\nisn't available it's gonna tell you.\n\n424\n00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.270\nGo install that make sure that that's\navailable and then you can re ran.\n\n425\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.830\nHopefully we wont have to do that but if\nwe did there be a re ran the prerequisite\n\n426\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.270\ncheck and you could just come\nback here and do this again.\n\n427\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.330\nSo its It's looking for\nall those things that we've installed,\n\n428\n00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.720\nbased on the roles that we selected for\nMBAM here.\n\n429\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.590\nIt looks like its finished we've met the\nprerequisites, remember we have IIS and\n\n430\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.865\nthe various features of IIS.\n\n431\n00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:46.055\nWe have our, and I'm gonna try\nthis acronym here, ASP.netmvc4.\n\n432\n00:23:46.055 --> 00:23:49.787\nWow, I got it right the first time\n[LAUGH] and we've got our SQL server.\n\n433\n00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:53.229\n>> You know I find it interesting that\nyou think that Microsoft would realize,\n\n434\n00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:56.939\nthis is kind of a random aside, but you\nwould realize that there's probably gonna\n\n435\n00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:59.788\nbe people out there that are installing\nthis on a clean slate And\n\n436\n00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:01.813\nthey're gonna need these prerequisites.\n\n437\n00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:05.455\nWhy don't they just build an installation\npackage that has all those things built\n\n438\n00:24:05.455 --> 00:24:08.950\nin, and all you have to do is double click\nsomething and walk through a wizard?\n\n439\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.280\n>> Yeah, that would be great too, or\n\n440\n00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.290\nyou run your prerequisite check\nbefore you even start installing.\n\n441\n00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.420\nWhy wait until the end to check?\n\n442\n00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.760\nSo it looks like we're good there,\nDan, and we're ready to go.\n\n443\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.280\nFinally, guys, now I can finally say,\nhere's the time that you've been waiting\n\n444\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.010\nthree episodes for when we actually\nget into looking at installing MBAM.\n\n445\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.870\nSo we'll go ahead and choose next here.\n\n446\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.510\nNow remember some of the accounts\nthat we've already provisioned and\n\n447\n00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.900\ncreated ahead of time.\n\n448\n00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.730\nYou're gonna see us put them in there,\ninto some of these fields.\n\n449\n00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.860\nHowever if you don't remember those,\ngo back and\n\n450\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:47.250\nlook at that second episode that we\ncreated in provisioning active directory,\n\n451\n00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.650\ndirectory services to support MBAM.\n\n452\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.910\nAll right.\nNow when the server\n\n453\n00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.630\nname comes up we're just\ngoing to choose browse and\n\n454\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.800\nI'm just going to type in\nthe name of this server, SRV01.\n\n455\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.510\nAnd it finds it.\n\n456\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.480\nWe're just going to do a check name, and\n\n457\n00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.620\nit's going to throw it\nright in that field for us.\n\n458\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.760\nThat's where our compliance and\naudit database is going to be stored.\n\n459\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.520\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.090\nI'm going to go ahead and this is one\nof the great things I like about this.\n\n461\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.300\nYou do not have to do\nindividual configurations.\n\n462\n00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.960\nYou can customize it if you want.\n\n463\n00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.400\nIf you've got existing databases already,\n\n464\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.090\nyou know within your infrastructure you\nmight have to do some customization.\n\n465\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.250\nSince I don't, I'm going to leave\nthis blank and just use the defaults.\n\n466\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.055\nNow we have a read write access,\ndomain user or group.\n\n467\n00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:32.455\nIf you remember,\nI did create one that was called MBAM RW,\n\n468\n00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:35.575\nmakes it easy for me to remember\nwhat the name of that account is.\n\n469\n00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:39.675\nSo I'm just gonna do NJO\\ and\nthen we're gonna do MBAM RW.\n\n470\n00:25:39.675 --> 00:25:44.670\nAnd let me show you if it's\nnot in the right format.\n\n471\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.940\nAll right, let me go ahead and\nswitch down.\n\n472\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.300\nNotice that that name\nisn't in the right format.\n\n473\n00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.820\nMBAM picks up,\nthe installer picks up on that right away.\n\n474\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.050\nIt says wait a second,\nthat's not a valid name.\n\n475\n00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.900\nYou have to enter a valid domain,\nuser, or group.\n\n476\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.790\nSo remember to use your domain there.\n\n477\n00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.330\nNJO\\ and it finds them.\n\n478\n00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.274\nWe're to do NJO/ and\n\n479\n00:26:05.274 --> 00:26:11.400\nhtis is our read only access to\nthe compliance and audit database.\n\n480\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.080\nSo remember we created an account MBAM and\nthat was RO for read only.\n\n481\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.140\nNow we're setting up\nour recovery database,\n\n482\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.700\nthat's the next part of this, and\nwe're gonna do the same thing.\n\n483\n00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.160\nNotice it says you must provide a value\nfor this field, we'rego ahead and\n\n484\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.040\nchoose browse.\n\n485\n00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.790\nAnd I'm going to type SRV01, I've seen\nsome interesting abbreviations Dan,\n\n486\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.930\nSVR for server.\n\n487\n00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.910\nI always do SRV cuz Stevie Ray Vaughn is.\n\n488\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.030\n>> Yeah.\n>> One of my favorite guitarists.\n\n489\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.025\nSo it's got to be SRV and\nI can always remember it.\n\n490\n00:26:38.025 --> 00:26:42.510\n[LAUGH] Same thing with the database,\nit's here.\n\n491\n00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:47.480\nNotice that we have, we're gonna leave the\ndefaults and then the database name for\n\n492\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:53.310\nthis one is MBAM recovery and hardware and\nhere's something to keep in mind.\n\n493\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.370\nNotice that we have a read write access,\ndomain user group again.\n\n494\n00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.300\nAnd, I told you in provisioning some\nof the active directories, user names,\n\n495\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.880\ngroups, and roles,\nthat we would use a single name for\n\n496\n00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.130\nmultiple roles within MBAM,\nyou're gonna see it right here.\n\n497\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.180\nRight, we're gonna choose MJO/ and\nit'll be MBAM RW.\n\n498\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.620\nSo we're using that same\nread write account again.\n\n499\n00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.650\nAnd we're gonna choose next.\n\n500\n00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.150\nAll right.\n\n501\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.200\nIf it would've errored out,\nsee it's checking Active Directory,\n\n502\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.390\nthat's why we provisioned\nActive Directory first.\n\n503\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.130\nIt's checking Active Directory,\nand if it finds an error,\n\n504\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.380\nit's gonna error out on you and\n\n505\n00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.310\ntell you to fix those fields before\nyou can move along in the installer.\n\n506\n00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.470\nAll right,\nnow the reporting role domain group,\n\n507\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.870\nremember this is one that it didn't give\nyou the option of a user or a group.\n\n508\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.850\nThis is, you have to use a group for this.\n\n509\n00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.750\nSo we're gonna do NJO/,\nI'm gonna try to spell reporting right.\n\n510\n00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.580\nAnd we'll move down to the compliance and\naudit database connection.\n\n511\n00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.440\nNow here is something to keep in mind,\nand you'll find this out on Tech.net's\n\n512\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.240\ninformation, and this is something I would\nI would definitely pay attention to.\n\n513\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.380\nFor your compliance and audit database\nconnection, you're going to want to keep\n\n514\n00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.480\nit the same read write name that you named\nin the first portion of this wizard here.\n\n515\n00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.485\nSo we're going to choose\nthe same user name again.\n\n516\n00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:17.400\nNJO/ and it'll be MBAM RW, and\nwe'll put our super secret\n\n517\n00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.410\npassword of dot dot dot in the field and\nwe'll add a whole bunch of other dots.\n\n518\n00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.830\nBy the way, that's supposed to happen.\n\n519\n00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.210\nIt's encrypting this password on the fly.\n\n520\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.010\nWe'll choose next.\n\n521\n00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.900\nAnd hopefully it's gonna find out\nthat yeah, all of those names exist.\n\n522\n00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.410\nOur server's ready.\n\n523\n00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.890\nIt can communicate with the database.\n\n524\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.940\nIt finds out that, hey, it is there.\n\n525\n00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.410\nAnd then we can move forward.\n\n526\n00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.730\nAnd the next thing that we get to\nconfigure are the web applications.\n\n527\n00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.170\nNow for the purposes of this\ndemonstration, let me tell you,\n\n528\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.130\nyou should not be doing this next\nstep in a production environment.\n\n529\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.890\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n530\n00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:58.840\nUnderstand the basis of what you're\ncommunicating with these databases.\n\n531\n00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.210\nBit locker encryption key packages.\n\n532\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.630\nThe whole bit locker encryption key.\n\n533\n00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.130\nThe recovery key.\n\n534\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.400\nNow, Dan,\nI'm gonna throw a curve ball at you here.\n\n535\n00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.440\nWould you think you'd want that\ninformation going over HTTP, or HTTPS.\n\n536\n00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.390\n>> I want everything going over HTTPS.\n\n537\n00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.420\n>> That's one of the best\nanswers I think I've ever heard.\n\n538\n00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.950\nEverything should go over\nan encrypted communication.\n\n539\n00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.560\nSo you can provision a certificate.\n\n540\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.360\nIt is recommended.\n\n541\n00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.440\nI'm not going through setting\nup a PKI infrastructure here, so\n\n542\n00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.630\nwe're gonna go ahead and skip it,\nand it is going to warn you.\n\n543\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.650\nYou don't want to do this.\n\n544\n00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:35.050\nSo if you do have an internal PKI take,\n\n545\n00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.640\nprovision out an SSL certificate and\nassign it to this website so\n\n546\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.052\nyou can encrypt the communication\nbetween your clients and the database.\n\n547\n00:29:44.052 --> 00:29:46.970\nAll right now we're going\nto leave the port number.\n\n548\n00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:51.730\nYou could change this cuz remember that\nif you have other Web services running,\n\n549\n00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.950\nthat they might be using\nthis port already.\n\n550\n00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.830\nNow, the Web service application\npool domain account,\n\n551\n00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:03.660\nI'm gonna use that same NJO RW,\nor MBAM RW account.\n\n552\n00:30:05.035 --> 00:30:07.678\nYou can see a couple of these that\nwe're using more than once here.\n\n553\n00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:16.150\nWake up my mouse there.\n\n554\n00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.050\nHello computer.\n\n555\n00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.860\nAll right.\n\n556\n00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.690\nNow, we've got our compliance and\naudit database connection.\n\n557\n00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.190\nWe don't have to put anything there.\n\n558\n00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.630\nBut, just when you thought you were done\n\n559\n00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.560\nremember we had a few other roles that\nwe created a couple other groups.\n\n560\n00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.360\nWe need help desk to be able to use\nthis interface, this web site so\n\n561\n00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.480\nthe administration and monitoring website.\n\n562\n00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.770\nRemember we had two groups that were\nprovisioned in Active Directory.\n\n563\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.630\nI made it kinda easy for\nWes' typing abilities to find that, ADB.\n\n564\n00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.800\nAnd you can find my\nadvanced help desk group.\n\n565\n00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.330\nPuts it right there in the list.\n\n566\n00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.380\nRemember, the help desk role two,\nI just named it help desk.\n\n567\n00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.960\nNow if you're doing data migration role,\n\n568\n00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.930\nyou can see that it's optional here,\nI didn't go with the data migration role.\n\n569\n00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.130\nThe domain group here,\n\n570\n00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:06.870\nyou could if you want, you could also\nuse the systems SCCM integration here.\n\n571\n00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.250\nWe're not using integration, in fact we\ndidn't even include that in the software.\n\n572\n00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.760\nAnd we could also enable an auto reset for\nTPMs here.\n\n573\n00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.360\nWe're not gonna do this.\n\n574\n00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.780\nNow some of the last things that you can\ncustomize is that self service portal\n\n575\n00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:25.960\nright, by default it uses\nMicrosoft's famous Contoso IT.\n\n576\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.740\nWell, I might change this to\nmy company's name, right?\n\n577\n00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:36.150\nMaybe you want to just make it more,\nobviously, what your company is.\n\n578\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.030\nI could put Contact Helpdesk\nif I wanted to.\n\n579\n00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.955\nThe Helpdesk URL, well,\nwe could do www.Technet.com, right.\n\n580\n00:31:43.955 --> 00:31:48.120\n[LAUGH] That would be a nice\njoke on your end users.\n\n581\n00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.000\nObviously if you had an internal website\nfor help desk you'd put that URL there.\n\n582\n00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.772\nBut we'll go ahead and\njust populate that field.\n\n583\n00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:59.205\nIf you wanted to send a notice text\nfile to them you could, or hide that,\n\n584\n00:31:59.205 --> 00:32:00.943\nwe're not gonna modify that.\n\n585\n00:32:00.943 --> 00:32:01.911\nAnd you know what?\n\n586\n00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:04.265\nIt says it's gotta be HTTP.\n\n587\n00:32:04.265 --> 00:32:07.050\nIt wants a valid URL.\n\n588\n00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.986\nHow dare it.\n\n589\n00:32:09.983 --> 00:32:11.270\nTry that.\n\n590\n00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.210\nThere we go.\n\n591\n00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.260\nNeeds the HTTP there in the front.\n\n592\n00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.230\nAnd now what it's gonna do\nis it's gonna say okay,\n\n593\n00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.130\ncan I communicate with all these accounts?\n\n594\n00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:20.480\nAre these accounts provision?\n\n595\n00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.270\nCan I communicate with the database?\n\n596\n00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:23.830\nIs it set up and ready to go?\n\n597\n00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.570\nTo finalize the installation of the\nMicrosoft Bit Locker Administration and\n\n598\n00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.080\nMonitoring here, so\nwe'll give it a second there.\n\n599\n00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.670\nSo a lot of setup, you can see, down in\nthe background, just to get to this point.\n\n600\n00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.170\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind\nis that if you're not a volume licensed\n\n601\n00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:44.020\ncustomer, it's very hard to practice\nthis and to get efficient in it so\n\n602\n00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.490\nyou could pass an exam or\nyou would know enough about it to deploy.\n\n603\n00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.070\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwe've taken the time breaking down\n\n604\n00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.190\nevery single little step here so\nthat you can watch these videos.\n\n605\n00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.290\nYou can pause them at any state and\nsay okay, I need to provision and\n\n606\n00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.760\nget my infrastructure ready\nto even support MBAM.\n\n607\n00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.170\nNow you're gonna know the steps\nto do it from beginning to end.\n\n608\n00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.670\nSo, it looks like our\nsummary report is here.\n\n609\n00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.490\nNow, you can also go through this,\nagain, like every summary, double check,\n\n610\n00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.060\nespecially with something like MBAM.\n\n611\n00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.270\nYou're talking about\nsecurity software here.\n\n612\n00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.310\nDouble check,\nmake sure your settings are right.\n\n613\n00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.030\nThey also have this export\nPowerShell script, and\n\n614\n00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:24.000\nI kinda wanna show you this real\nquick before we move forward here.\n\n615\n00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.440\nNow, this PowerShell script\nis kinda interesting.\n\n616\n00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.380\nIf you ever wanted to know [LAUGH]\nhow to install PowerShell,\n\n617\n00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.530\nwell from excuse me, MBAM from\nthe PowerShell you can see it right here.\n\n618\n00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.550\nThese are all the commandlets\nthat you'd have to run.\n\n619\n00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.316\n>> Looks rather involved.\n\n620\n00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:41.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really does, it really does.\n\n621\n00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.190\nAnd you guys have seen just in\na half hour segment how good I type.\n\n622\n00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.160\nI opted out of not using that script.\n\n623\n00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.220\nSave the script.\n\n624\n00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.060\nIf your MBAM server\nhappens to get corrupt,\n\n625\n00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.230\nyou can always just apply\na PowerShell script.\n\n626\n00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.740\nIt goes through, configures MBAM And\nthe settings that you want,\n\n627\n00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.260\nyou don't have to go\nthrough that wizard again.\n\n628\n00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.010\nSo it's good to have.\n\n629\n00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.340\nAnd we're gonna choose Add.\n\n630\n00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.540\nNow, here's the point where it's\ngoing to check the features.\n\n631\n00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.390\nAnd it's interesting because first it's\ngonna check, you can see them in order.\n\n632\n00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:13.270\nIt needs to make sure that\nthere's communication.\n\n633\n00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:17.690\nThat we've typed names correctly,\nthat there is a connection,\n\n634\n00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.480\nthat the ports are valid and\nit could take a little bit.\n\n635\n00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.680\nSo we're gonna do another quick\nlittle magic of TV television.\n\n636\n00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.910\nAnd we'll come back when this\ninstallation's finished.\n\n637\n00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:33.280\nAll right, looks like the MBAM software\nhas finished installing itself.\n\n638\n00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.410\nLet's go ahead and take a look here,\n\n639\n00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:39.270\nbecause it will tell you some things to\ntake into consideration after it's done,\n\n640\n00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:43.810\nand it goes with each individual\nservice or feature here.\n\n641\n00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.200\nLike, for instance, on the administration\nand monitoring website, it's telling you,\n\n642\n00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.490\nyou don't have a certificate\nbound to that website, so\n\n643\n00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.090\nyou're gonna be using\nHTTP unencrypted traffic.\n\n644\n00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.180\nIt isn't HTTPS.\n\n645\n00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.740\nNow some of the other things\nthat you might find in here.\n\n646\n00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.850\nIf you don't set up your accounts\nright in Active Directory,\n\n647\n00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.440\nthere are service principle names, SPNs,\n\n648\n00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.200\nthat I've seen come back and\nit says can't enter the SPN.\n\n649\n00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.145\nThe other thing that Ive seen\ntoo is an account that you're\n\n650\n00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:20.605\nusing might say it needs to be\nprovisioned manually, for delegation.\n\n651\n00:35:20.605 --> 00:35:25.226\nIf these errors come up,\nI would kind of consider maybe,\n\n652\n00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:27.927\nin a test environment,\nrolling back your infrastructure.\n\n653\n00:35:27.927 --> 00:35:31.850\nDouble check how you provisioned your\naccounts in Active Directory because\n\n654\n00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.970\nif the provision's right,\nthe only warning you should get, and\n\n655\n00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.140\neven this one would be null and\n\n656\n00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.500\nvoid if you had bound the certificate to\nthe website, you wouldn't get this error.\n\n657\n00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.190\nSo Dan, lot of setup.\n\n658\n00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.980\nI realize guys out there,\nvery long process,\n\n659\n00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.550\nbut once you know the steps it\nshouldn't be too intimidating, and\n\n660\n00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.300\nit should be fairly straightforward.\n\n661\n00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.470\n>> Yeah, and Wes you did a great job of\nactually helping guide us through this,\n\n662\n00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.670\nbecause anytime you're working with\nsoftware you probably never worked before\n\n663\n00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:03.640\nor even if it seems very simple and\nsquared away, there usually are little\n\n664\n00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.965\ndips and valleys that you have to,\nthe stumbling stones as they were,\n\n665\n00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:11.970\nthat can make this process be a whole lot\nmore arduous than it really needs to be.\n\n666\n00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.100\nWes has done us the favor of actually\nfinding all those little caveats so\n\n667\n00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.060\nthat we can avoid them ourselves and\nhave a much smoother installation.\n\n668\n00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.120\nSo we appreciate that Wes.\n\n669\n00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And we thank you for\n\n670\n00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.468\nthe explanation on how to do this thing.\n\n671\n00:36:25.468 --> 00:36:28.830\nAnd now in upcoming episodes, we're really\ngonna get into the meat and potatoes,\n\n672\n00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.640\nactually start using this.\n\n673\n00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.320\nI know we still got\nthe client to install but.\n\n674\n00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.740\n>> That's right we're ready to rock.\n\n675\n00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.710\n>> We are so close to actually\nusing the system it's palpable.\n\n676\n00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.280\nSo hopefully we'll see you then and\nwe thank you again for stopping by Wes.\n\n677\n00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.870\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n678\n00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.040\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Laurie.\n\n679\n00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.860\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n680\n00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.968\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n681\n00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:55.440\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.360\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.660\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Microsoft.\n\n6\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.019\nWhat is it?\nThe Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n7\n00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right!\n\n8\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.090\nSay that three times fast if you can.\n\n9\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.860\nAnd as you can hear, the disembodied voice\nfrom the side here joining us today,\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.410\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.470\nWes, welcome to the show sir.\n\n12\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.790\nHow's it going?\n>> It's going okay.\n\n13\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.985\nI can think of Mecca lecca hi,\nmecca hiney ho.\n\n14\n00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:39.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n15\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.170\nSo we've been moving through Microsoft\nBitLocker Administration and Monitoring.\n\n16\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.650\nAnd it took us a couple of\nepisodes to get prepared to\n\n17\n00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.970\neven get MBAM into the infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.440\nWell we went ahead and we've set up MBAM.\n\n19\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.620\nWe've got it installed.\n\n20\n00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.930\nIt is in the domain.\n\n21\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.500\nIt's got it fingers out there somewhere,\nbut now it's time to go the other side.\n\n22\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.570\nThe dark side, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.415\nWe've got to the client side, and\n\n24\n00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:07.621\nnow we gotta make sure that our client\nis going to know what MBAM's even about.\n\n25\n00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.773\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:13.070\nwe'll jump right into the installation\nside here on our Windows 10 machine.\n\n27\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.710\nNow, let's go ahead first of all and\n\n28\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.670\nlet's ensure that we don't\nhave MBAM installed locally.\n\n29\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.960\nSo we're gonna drop down to\nthe Control Panel real quick.\n\n30\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960\nSystem and security.\n\n31\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.810\nAnd you're gonna see that BitLocker\ndrive encryption is there.\n\n32\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.440\nAnd we expect that to be there.\n\n33\n00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.780\nBut we don't have anything else yet.\n\n34\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.670\nAnd we're gonna come back\nhere after the installation.\n\n35\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730\nWe're gonna see something change here.\n\n36\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.470\nNow, when it goes to\ninstalling the client,\n\n37\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.960\nremember you have to have the MDOP, ISO.\n\n38\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.260\nYou mount the ISO, like we've showed\nyou in some of the previous episodes.\n\n39\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.810\nNavigate into MBAM, and remember that\nwe are in MBAM 2.1 Service Pack 1.\n\n40\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.469\nOr, excuse me, 2.5 Service Pack 1.\n\n41\n00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.610\nAnd we're gonna navigate into that\nfolder and into the installers.\n\n42\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.766\nWe're on a 64 bit machine,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n43\n00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:07.055\nArchitecture is important\nwhether it's 32 bit or 64 bit.\n\n44\n00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.499\nNow before when we were setting up\nthe server, I like how they label, and\n\n45\n00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.110\nthey make it very easy to\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n46\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.970\nRemember, our server,\nServer Setup versus the Client Setup.\n\n47\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.867\nSo this is gonna be the one\nthat we're gonna be choosing.\n\n48\n00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:23.697\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and run this, and\nwe've got our fourth or fifth end-user\n\n49\n00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:27.845\nlicense agreement in this series so\nfar, and we're not even done yet.\n\n50\n00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.400\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll accept the EULA here.\n\n51\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.480\nAnd we're gonna choose Next, and\nit's gonna go through the installation.\n\n52\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.380\nNow the installer process\nis fairly simple.\n\n53\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.380\nIn fact, that's the majority of\ngetting the client installed.\n\n54\n00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.020\nThere really isn't too much to it.\n\n55\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.630\nBut one of the things\nthat I'd like to show,\n\n56\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.430\nmake a little bit easier to understand\nwhere this is being installed.\n\n57\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.660\nAnd then show you just some simple\nverifications that the installation has\n\n58\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.290\nhappened, cuz when you have\nthese installers here,\n\n59\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.870\nthey're a little bit silent.\n\n60\n00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.220\nYou'll see as the progress goes,\none second remaining, nothing.\n\n61\n00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.360\nAnd that was it.\n\n62\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.600\nWell, is it installed?\n\n63\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.130\nWell, I'm not sure.\n\n64\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.990\nLet's find out.\nRemember, we just went to Control Panel.\n\n65\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.740\nWe had BitLocker drive encryption there.\n\n66\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.390\nLet's bump back over there.\n\n67\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.000\nWe'll launch the Control Panel again.\n\n68\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.500\nAnd we're gonna go into System and\nSecurity, and notice not only\n\n69\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.280\ndo we have our BitLocker drive options\nhere, our drive encryption here,\n\n70\n00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.510\nwe now have something else, and\nit's down at the bottom, right?\n\n71\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.520\nDown at the bottom here,\nwe have Bitlocker Encryption Options.\n\n72\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.450\nAnd that wasn't there before, right?\n\n73\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.110\nAnd you can see, hover to discover, we get\na little bit of information before we even\n\n74\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.280\nopen that up as to what that might be.\n\n75\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.240\nAnd let me hover over that again and\nyou can see Bitlocker Encryption Options.\n\n76\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.180\nAnd yes that is BitLocker Administration\nand Monitoring.\n\n77\n00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.080\nThat's what we want.\n\n78\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.720\nSo we'll go ahead and just open that up\nand verify that that screen is there.\n\n79\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.490\nNow we haven't set any settings.\n\n80\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.230\nBoy that's redundant there.\n\n81\n00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.270\nWe haven't configured any settings yet.\n\n82\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.536\nAnd so\nthere isn't really anything to look at.\n\n83\n00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:00.638\nNow remember on the client side here,\n\n84\n00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:03.864\nwe just wanna make sure that\nthat software has installed.\n\n85\n00:04:03.864 --> 00:04:10.090\nCouple other locations that we can go to\nto verify that this software's installed.\n\n86\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.240\nIf you open up your File Explorer and\nyou navigate down into Local Disk C.\n\n87\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.080\nAll right, and program files, there's\na Microsoft folder that's here that wasn't\n\n88\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.686\nhere before, and if I get into there,\nyou can now see M.MBAM.\n\n89\n00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:30.320\nAnd, boy, they took those acronyms and\nmade it really hard.\n\n90\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.875\nSo, Microsoft Desktop Optimization and\n\n91\n00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:36.823\nMicrosoft BitLocker Administration and\nMonitoring is there.\n\n92\n00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:38.490\nNow, you can see that it is here.\n\n93\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.738\nThe other thing that we can\nverify is that MBAMAgent.\n\n94\n00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:48.333\nThat is the client side agent that is\ngonna manage the communication between\n\n95\n00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:53.160\nany BitLocker happenings on this client\nand the MBAM server in the background.\n\n96\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.220\nAll right, so we've verified that\nyes the installation is there, but\n\n97\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.750\nwe can go a little bit further than that.\n\n98\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.572\nMaybe you want to find out there's\na service that is running, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:03.572 --> 00:05:07.427\nThe agent is running, but I wanna talk\njust a little bit about the service, and\n\n100\n00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:10.010\nhow you can verify that\nthe service is there as well.\n\n101\n00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.610\nAll right, now we're gonna go ahead, and\nI tell you what, we'll get to our little\n\n102\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.750\nsearch feature here, and\nwe'll type services.\n\n103\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.360\nAnd we'll launch our\nServices Console here.\n\n104\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.930\nNow in our Service Console,\nyou will see, if we zoom in here,\n\n105\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.570\nthat we have a BitLocker Management Client\nService available, and that it is running.\n\n106\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.190\nIt is a automatic delayed start, which\nmeans go ahead and start the service,\n\n107\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.620\njust don't put it in my boot process.\n\n108\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.380\nAll right,\nnow we can see that service is there,\n\n109\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.980\nmaybe you wanna do this\nfrom the Command Prompt.\n\n110\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.620\nWell, you have that option as well,\nif we launch our Command Prompt.\n\n111\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.280\nAnd let me go ahead and\nmake this a little easier for\n\n112\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.030\nyou guys to see out there real quick.\n\n113\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.139\nChange the font size here.\n\n114\n00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:06.370\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.900\nWell, that really didn't\nmake it much better, did it?\n\n116\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.870\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n117\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.110\n>> You did good with the hacker green,\nthough.\n\n118\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.506\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's right, got to learn the Matrix,\n\n119\n00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.410\nthat's for sure.\n\n120\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.710\nAnother command that you\ncan run here is net start,\n\n121\n00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.590\nthat's the net command\nwith a start parameter.\n\n122\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.570\nAnd what this does is it shows you all of\nthe services that are running right now.\n\n123\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.610\nNow, I'm sure you didn't catch it,\nthat's okay, but\n\n124\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.010\nif we scroll back up here towards the top,\nnotice that service that we've seen\n\n125\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.150\nin the graphical user interface\nwas in the background.\n\n126\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.670\nAll right, and\nyou can see here that we have\n\n127\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.150\nthe BitLocker Management Client Service,\nand that it is running.\n\n128\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.410\nNow, again, these are the services that\nyou need to insure that they are there for\n\n129\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.130\nthe client to do some\ncommunication between the servers,\n\n130\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.840\nthat you have available out there.\n\n131\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.450\nSo keep in mind,\nonce the installation is finished like\n\n132\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.400\nthere, again, Dan,\nnot really too much to do.\n\n133\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.830\nWe can look at some\nRegistry settings as well.\n\n134\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.350\nSome of these settings might be available,\n\n135\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.410\nother settings might happen when\nyou actually deploy policies.\n\n136\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.680\nBut Your BitLocker settings for\n\n137\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.130\nMBAM are actually in HKEY Local Machine\nunder Software and then Policies.\n\n138\n00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.475\nAnd you'll see right down here,\nwe've got this little key here,\n\n139\n00:07:30.475 --> 00:07:35.495\nMicrosoft, and if we expand that out,\nand we don't see anything yet.\n\n140\n00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:40.038\nWe're gonna look when we\nstart our whole BitLocker,\n\n141\n00:07:40.038 --> 00:07:43.355\nwhen we actually show you\nhow to do the encryption,\n\n142\n00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:48.234\nyou're gonna see that there is an FVE\nkey here that right now isn't there.\n\n143\n00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:53.040\nA couple other locations,\nanother location that you can look is\n\n144\n00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.312\nunder pretty much the same\nlocation HKEY Local Machine,\n\n145\n00:07:57.312 --> 00:08:01.228\nSoftware, and\nthen if you expand out, Microsoft.\n\n146\n00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:04.004\nAnd you scroll all the way down to M.\n\n147\n00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:07.170\nYou'll see that we have MBAM there,\nall right?\n\n148\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.931\nAnd you can see that MBAM is installed and\n\n149\n00:08:10.931 --> 00:08:15.540\nthat those registry settings are present.\n\n150\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.560\nNow, at this point, what we have to\ndo on our client side, excuse me on\n\n151\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.290\nthe server side is actually configure the\ngroup policies and configure the settings.\n\n152\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.360\nNow, once you verify that the client\nis installed, at this point,\n\n153\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.560\nwe've got communication between\nthe servers, we've got domains set up,\n\n154\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.290\nthe client's available.\n\n155\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.860\nNow, it's time to actually do some\nconfiguration inside of our domain\n\n156\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.960\ncontroller and let's go ahead and\njump into our group policy and\n\n157\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.040\nstart talking about some of\nthe management that we need to do.\n\n158\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.600\nAll right, so we're here on our domain\ncontroller, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.790\nwe'll launch up our server manager.\n\n160\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.940\nAnd from our server manager we're gonna\nlook for group policy management.\n\n161\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.900\n>> You bring up an interesting idea here,\nand this is something we kinda touched on\n\n162\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.770\nin a previous episode Is that the settings\nfor this thing, they're in group policy.\n\n163\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.970\nThat's where we're gonna\nactually create configuration.\n\n164\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.236\nIt's not inside of a,\nhere's the MBAM configuration tool, right?\n\n165\n00:09:12.236 --> 00:09:14.310\nIt's all under your policy.\n\n166\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.240\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n167\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.280\nThe only thing that you're really\ndoing from the administration\n\n168\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.650\nwebsite is either doing things like\nmanaging TPMs, drive recovery, or\n\n169\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.010\nseeing compliance information.\n\n170\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.920\nSo ,Dan's right,\n\n171\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.670\nall of the control of MBAM there is\nreally done through the group policy.\n\n172\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.500\nAnd that's why it is important to make\nsure that your active directory has\n\n173\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.730\nprovisions beforehand before you start\nthinking about managing devices with MBAM.\n\n174\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.500\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n175\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.430\nwe go to our tools, we'll drop down to\nour group policy management Go ahead and\n\n176\n00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:51.450\njust minimize our server manager there and\nwe are going to expand out our domain.\n\n177\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.760\nNow, when we were in our episode where we\nwere provisioning our Active Directory,\n\n178\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.800\nyou might remember, and if not,\njump back on over to that episode and\n\n179\n00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.240\nyou'll remember that we did have\na BitLocker Management Policy in\n\n180\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.710\nplace that we were\nverifying at that point.\n\n181\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.820\nThat those settings were available.\n\n182\n00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.760\nWell we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\ncreate one that we'll actually deploy this\n\n183\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.260\ntime, not just verifying that\nthe settings are present.\n\n184\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.210\nAnd we'll call it the same thing,\nwe're gonna call it BitLock, whoa.\n\n185\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.140\nAnd try that again, BitLocker Management.\n\n186\n00:10:30.682 --> 00:10:33.999\nAll right, and now we've got our\npolicy set, we'll go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:36.550\nright click on it and\nwe're going to choose edit.\n\n188\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.920\nAnd we'll kind of zoom in here,\nmake it a little easier for\n\n189\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.080\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n190\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.241\nSo, we're going to be first of all,\nwe're going to be under Policies Alright,\n\n191\n00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.550\nwe're gonna be under Policies,\nAdministrative Templates and\n\n192\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.284\nthen under Windows Components.\n\n193\n00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:56.854\nAnd again, if you're in a certification\nendeavor maybe they're asking about MBAM I\n\n194\n00:10:56.854 --> 00:11:00.930\nwould probably know these group policy\nlocations just in case they ask you.\n\n195\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.330\nWe're gonna be under\nWindows Components now.\n\n196\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.490\nAs we had also stated\nin a previous episode,\n\n197\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.785\nif you're not implementing MBAM itself,\nyou're gonna control your\n\n198\n00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:13.870\nBitLocker Encryption Settings all from\nthe BitLocker Drive Encryption section.\n\n199\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.130\nAnd this is not just available in\ngroup policy in Active Directory,\n\n200\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.910\nIt's also available in the local group\npolicy to the Windows Editions that\n\n201\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.130\nactually support a Windows 10 Pro and\nWindows 10 Enterprise.\n\n202\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.150\nBut remember, we're gonna scroll\ndown a little bit farther and\n\n203\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.400\nwe've got this MDOP MBAM, and\nyou can see BitLocker Management here.\n\n204\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.870\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna look at that.\n\n205\n00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.080\nNow, the first thing that we're gonna\ndo is some client side management.\n\n206\n00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.704\nAll right, when it comes to client\nside management, we'll go ahead and\n\n207\n00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:41.230\nselect that.\n\n208\n00:11:42.508 --> 00:11:45.000\nAll right ,and if we can scroll over here,\n\n209\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.430\nyou'll see that we have\na series of options.\n\n210\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.270\nAll right, the very first option that we\nhave is configuring the MBAM services.\n\n211\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.940\nWe need to point the client to those\ndifferent data bases that we have so\n\n212\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.640\nthey can store their information.\n\n213\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.130\nWell those are called service points and\n\n214\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.820\nthey have service point URL's\nthat we need to put into place.\n\n215\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.590\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nlet's zoom out there a little bit and\n\n216\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.810\nthen we'll go ahead and choose Enable.\n\n217\n00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.010\nAnd let's talk about a couple\nof these settings right here.\n\n218\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.760\nWe've got the very first one that we need\nis the Recovery service endpoint and\n\n219\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.620\nthis is a URL that we're gonna place here.\n\n220\n00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:23.930\nNow the URLs, we'll put them in\nthe notes so you're aware of those URLs.\n\n221\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.890\nWe'll also post some links that will\ntake you out to Microsoft's website so,\n\n222\n00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.730\nthat you'll have this information.\n\n223\n00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.030\nNow, the first one,\nhere with the Recovery service endpoint,\n\n224\n00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.230\nthis is going to be http, or\nhttps, keep that in mind,\n\n225\n00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.560\nif you bound a certificate to your\nMBAM website, you're gonna use https.\n\n226\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.695\nAnd then it's typically\njust your server name here.\n\n227\n00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:53.205\nAnd one of the things that I'll\nalso say is make sure you spell\n\n228\n00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:57.627\nthis URL right because I have seen,\neven in my own testing,\n\n229\n00:12:57.627 --> 00:13:01.605\nwhen I find out a problem as\nto maybe why I don't get any\n\n230\n00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:06.404\ncommunication between the client and\nsome of these databases?\n\n231\n00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:12.477\nIt's usually because I've typed\nsomething wrong here in the URL.\n\n232\n00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:17.072\nAll right, and\nthat's gonna be CoreServices.\n\n233\n00:13:17.072 --> 00:13:21.857\nService excuse me, singular .svc.\n\n234\n00:13:21.857 --> 00:13:25.172\nAll right, so now what we've said is that\n\n235\n00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:30.030\nwe've got our recovery\nservice endpoint ready to go.\n\n236\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.636\nAll right, now the next setting\nthat I have to figure out is,\n\n237\n00:13:33.636 --> 00:13:36.906\nwhat do I want to store in\na Recovery service endpoint?\n\n238\n00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.670\nWhat do I want to be\nallowed to be recovered?\n\n239\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.117\nI could say just the Recovery\npassword only, right.?\n\n240\n00:13:43.117 --> 00:13:48.125\nThat 48 digit recovery key, that if your\nBitLocker Drive is in the recovery mode or\n\n241\n00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:50.570\nwe could go a little bit farther.\n\n242\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.580\nWe could say,\nnot only the Recovery password but\n\n243\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.830\nwe want the key package, right?\n\n244\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.200\nYour BitLocker Encryption key.\n\n245\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.460\nDo I wanna take the whole\nBitLocker Encryption Key and\n\n246\n00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.800\npackage and place it there as well?\n\n247\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.690\nThat will be up to you.\n\n248\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:10.480\nNotice that the client\nchecking status frequency and\n\n249\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.170\nminutes is by default set to 90 minutes.\n\n250\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.520\nThat will come into play\na little bit later here for\n\n251\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.850\nus when we actually test\nsome of these settings.\n\n252\n00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.248\nThen the next thing that we have is\nthe Status reporting service endpoint.\n\n253\n00:14:22.248 --> 00:14:27.144\nAnd again, this is another one of those\ncrazy URLs that you need to have in place,\n\n254\n00:14:27.144 --> 00:14:30.396\nthat's basically going to\nbe pointing to a service.\n\n255\n00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:36.526\nSame thing, http:// and, again https,\nif you've got a certificate but\n\n256\n00:14:36.526 --> 00:14:42.920\nif you're using secure communications,\nwhich you typically should be.\n\n257\n00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.010\nThen it's going to be\nyour computer's name.\n\n258\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.710\nAnd where this service is provided.\n\n259\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:58.580\nAnd, then,\nthis is going to be the MBAMCompliance.\n\n260\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.892\nAnd that is StatusService and\n\n261\n00:15:03.892 --> 00:15:10.060\nagain, we're going to do the /.\n\n262\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:15.035\nAnd this is going to be StatusReporting.\n\n263\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.184\nHere I go, configuring the GPO wrong.\n\n264\n00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:22.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> ReportingService.\n\n265\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.382\n>> The most difficult portion of\nconfiguring it is actually being\n\n266\n00:15:26.382 --> 00:15:26.969\nable to type.\n\n267\n00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:29.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, being able to type,\n\n268\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.812\nof which I cannot do.\n\n269\n00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:33.291\n[LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n270\n00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.210\n>> Typing with Westmont.\n\n271\n00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.850\n>> You will fail.\n\n272\n00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.830\nSo, at this point we've\ngot the services ready.\n\n273\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.314\nNow, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll save this policy.\n\n274\n00:15:45.314 --> 00:15:46.368\n>> All right, and\n\n275\n00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:51.736\nI want to talk about some of the other\nsettings that we can potentially do here.\n\n276\n00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:54.685\nOne of them is a user exemption policy.\n\n277\n00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:56.171\nWell what is that about?\n\n278\n00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:58.771\nAll right user exemption policies.\n\n279\n00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:03.639\nYou know if I want to encrypt drives with\nin my company there might be a handful\n\n280\n00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:05.388\nof computers that maybe for\n\n281\n00:16:05.388 --> 00:16:10.120\nthe roles that they perform in our\ncompany we don't want them encrypted.\n\n282\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.440\nWell you might say well why would\nyou not want a device encrypted?\n\n283\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.110\nThink about about a public kiosk.\n\n284\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.470\nThere might be a certain, you know,\n\n285\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.590\nyou've got public computers where you're\nencrypting them, they're in a lobby.\n\n286\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.410\nGuests are using them.\n\n287\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.960\nYou certainly don't want them\ntyping in BitLocker passwords,\n\n288\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.200\njust to be able to log into the machine.\n\n289\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.890\nHalf of the time those machines\nare already logged in as a guest\n\n290\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.490\naccount anyway.\n\n291\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.590\nSo if I wanted I could set\nan exception here that says these\n\n292\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:39.030\ncomputers, they're gonna be\nexcept from BitLocker encryption.\n\n293\n00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.130\nWe got some other things\nthat we can do too,\n\n294\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.530\nif we have a security policy we could\nalways provide a URL that says hey this\n\n295\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.800\nour acceptable use this\nis our security policy.\n\n296\n00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.770\nAll right, so that's got the client\nmanagement part aspect done.\n\n297\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:57.270\nCheck real quick about some of\nthe MBAM settings here as well.\n\n298\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.700\nWe could and this is kind of cool,\nthis is what I think is really cool,\n\n299\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.890\nI could choose if I wanted\nthe encryption strength.\n\n300\n00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.490\nNow I'll tell you, by default,\nBitLocker uses AESD,\n\n301\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.800\nAdvanced Encryption Standard 128 bit.\n\n302\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.730\nBut what if I wanna set that\nto something different?\n\n303\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.630\nWell, guess what?\n\n304\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:22.710\nI do have the ability, if I choose to,\nthey don't just leave it there.\n\n305\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.660\nI've got a few options.\n\n306\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.640\nYes, if you wanted to,\nyou could strengthen the encryption.\n\n307\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.890\nYou can go 256 bit.\n\n308\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.670\nI caution you doing that though.\n\n309\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.190\nKeep in mind, every time we\ntalked about security before.\n\n310\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.968\nIf we're gonna increase\nthe encryption strength,\n\n311\n00:17:37.968 --> 00:17:41.510\nwe're also gonna increase the time\nit takes to encrypt the drive.\n\n312\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.620\nAnd if you imagine today\nat the drive sizes,\n\n313\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.020\nimagine a two terabyte drive\nwith information on it.\n\n314\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:52.090\nIf I use 256 bit encryption, it could take\ntwo or three days to encrypt that drive.\n\n315\n00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.000\nSo there's always you remember,\npros and cons.\n\n316\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.800\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nleave the defaults.\n\n317\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.500\nWe're not gonna change this, so\nI'll just change this to not configured.\n\n318\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.440\nBut, it is kinda, I really like\nthat feature Dan, where they give\n\n319\n00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.520\nyou the ability if you want to increase\nthe encryption strength, you can.\n\n320\n00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.630\n>> Yeah, cuz I might have a drive that\nhas recipes and random documents.\n\n321\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.390\nA great American novel I've been writing.\n\n322\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.430\nI'm sure it's awesome.\n\n323\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.410\nRight?\nJust random files,\n\n324\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.560\nI probably don't need the AES 256 and\nthe AES 120.\n\n325\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.040\nWe'll be just fine.\n\n326\n00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.130\nBut if I have maybe things that\nI'm going to have patented.\n\n327\n00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.200\nI have business plans,\n\n328\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.430\nthings very sensitive of nature I'm going\nto just sit and grin and bare the fact\n\n329\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.670\nthat that two terabyte drive is gonna take\nme a little bit longer to get through with\n\n330\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.740\nthe encryption because I need the highest\nlevel of security that I can get.\n\n331\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.040\nAnd they avoid that, or\nthat afford that for us.\n\n332\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.460\n>> They can.\n\n333\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.570\nIt really is nice to have options.\n\n334\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.170\nNot saying, okay you're stuck with this,\nyou know maybe you do have a machine and\n\n335\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.260\nlike Dan said where maybe\nyou do have one machine,\n\n336\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.540\nit's a server that's got\nsensitive patent information.\n\n337\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.870\nYou're like,\nI don't care how long it takes.\n\n338\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.580\nI'm going to encrypt it\nwith 256 bit encryption.\n\n339\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.210\nIt's nice to have that option.\n\n340\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.010\nNow, speaking of options,\n\n341\n00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:10.010\ngoing back into our group policy here,\nI want you to remember that we\n\n342\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.110\nhave two different locations in\nwhere we can configure BitLocker.\n\n343\n00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.670\nAnd one of things that you'll,\nlet me save you some hassle.\n\n344\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.240\nIs if you are going to\nuse these three options.\n\n345\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.150\nThe fix drive, operating system drive and\n\n346\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.010\nremovable drive,\nstay away from these settings up here.\n\n347\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.870\nAll right if you've implemented MBAM,\n\n348\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.920\nyou don't need to use this node\nanymore to configure your encryption.\n\n349\n00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.660\nUse these down here, all right?\n\n350\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.060\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n351\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.380\nSo the next thing we\nlook at is fixed drives.\n\n352\n00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.520\nWhat is a fixed drive?\n\n353\n00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.340\nA drive that is stationary\ninside the case of your PC.\n\n354\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.140\nAnd it isn't being moved.\n\n355\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.670\nIt's on a removable drive, right?\n\n356\n00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.860\nSo I could, if I wanted to,\nI could come over here and\n\n357\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.800\nwe could require fixed data\ndrive encryption settings.\n\n358\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.370\nAnd you can see some of\nthose settings there.\n\n359\n00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.040\nI can Enable.\n\n360\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.470\nWe talked about Allow Auto Unlock.\n\n361\n00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.670\nThis is kind of a cool feature, right?\n\n362\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.490\nDan's got a computer and\nhe's got a thumb drive.\n\n363\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.130\nAnd he's encrypted it with maybe,\n\n364\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.190\nthis is fixed data drive not\nthe removable data drive.\n\n365\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.610\nThe moment the machine boots up,\nall right,\n\n366\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.465\nsees that it's got a fixed\ndrive encrypted with BitLocker.\n\n367\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.580\nIt's still in the same machine,\nguess what?\n\n368\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.300\nJust go ahead you started the machine\nhere it's not the operating system drive,\n\n369\n00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.910\nyou don't have to type in\nthe password in order to get\n\n370\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.710\ninto the drive the moment the computer\nboots up, it unlocks for us.\n\n371\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.230\nSo you do have that option there.\n\n372\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.210\nLooking at a couple other\nsettings that we have here.\n\n373\n00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.450\nAgain using the configuration of\npasswords, if we will, to fixed drives.\n\n374\n00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.980\nI can require complexity if I want,\nrequire password.\n\n375\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.700\nI could allow,\ndo not allow a password complexity.\n\n376\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.160\nThat really doesn't make sense but\nmaybe somebody who doesn't know.\n\n377\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.460\nWe want you to be secure.\n\n378\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.668\nWe are going through all of this set up\njust to make sure that you're unsecure.\n\n379\n00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.290\n[laughs] We can Require\npassword complexity.\n\n380\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.770\nAgain, we could set\nthe character requirements.\n\n381\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.470\n>> One of the options one day will\nbe create website that allows\n\n382\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.132\nuniversal access to drive.\n\n383\n00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:07.870\n>> [LAUGH] That'd be perfect.\n\n384\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.560\nBitLocker 2000.\n\n385\n00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.650\n>> Yeah.\n\n386\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.510\nSo the other thing we have\nis a really cool feature,\n\n387\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.580\nI really like this, you're going to see it\non the operating system drives as well.\n\n388\n00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:25.000\nThat is this encryption policy\nenforcement settings, all right.\n\n389\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.900\nDo we want to require somebody to encrypt?\n\n390\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:33.020\nWell, we could do that but maybe we want\nto give them some kind of grace period\n\n391\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.570\nbefore, we're not postponing it anymore,\n\n392\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.570\nwe're gonna require you to\nencrypt that fixed drive.\n\n393\n00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.750\nWell, I can enable that and\n\n394\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.680\nI can set a threshold of how many days\nbefore they're no longer in compliance and\n\n395\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.270\nafter that fact, if they're not,\nwell guess what we might see that on\n\n396\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:52.190\nour enterprise compliance reports\nInside of the administration website.\n\n397\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.740\nSo we're not gonna enable that, but\nI do want to make mention of that.\n\n398\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.010\nSo let's talk about some things\nthat we are gonna enable.\n\n399\n00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.260\nAnd this is the one that we've\nbeen really looking at, and\n\n400\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.580\nthat's the operating system drive.\n\n401\n00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.640\nNow, these settings, understand,\nare a little bit different,\n\n402\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.400\nthan what you've seen in the basic\nBitLocker management, right.\n\n403\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.440\nOne of the settings, in fact, let me go\nahead and show you the other setting.\n\n404\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.580\nRight?\nSo, operating system drives.\n\n405\n00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.460\nIf we want non TPM mode,\n\n406\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.780\nwe always go to the require\nadditional authentication at startup.\n\n407\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.290\nWe enable this setting and\n\n408\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.180\nnow if you don't have a TPM\nyou can use a password, right?\n\n409\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.350\nWe're not managing that from this\nlocation anymore, so we'll go ahead and\n\n410\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.330\nwe're gonna get out of here.\n\n411\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.550\nWe're gonna go back to\nthe location that we need and\n\n412\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.590\nyou're gonna see that that, or I guess\nwe could say what you're not gonna see.\n\n413\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.220\nYou're not gonna see that setting in here.\n\n414\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.880\nNotice the require of\nadditional authentication and\n\n415\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.330\nthat setting's not here.\n\n416\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.210\nIt's because it's right under operating\nsystem drive encryption settings, and\n\n417\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.280\nit doesn't say that.\n\n418\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.940\nIt doesn't come out and just tell you\nthat and the reason I mention that is for\n\n419\n00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.100\nanybody that is in exam endeavor and\n\n420\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.790\nmaybe is very familiar with configuring\nbit locker from group policy.\n\n421\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.130\nBut not MBAM, so just keep that in mind.\n\n422\n00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:13.060\nNow, when I choose enable I want to\nyou notice this setting right here.\n\n423\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.400\nNotice what is says.\n\n424\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.810\nAllow BitLocker without a compatible TPM.\n\n425\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:23.070\nNow this is the setting that was like\nthe one that we've seen in the original\n\n426\n00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.630\nbasic BitLocker management.\n\n427\n00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.439\nSo know that it's kind of tucked\naway in a different location.\n\n428\n00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.850\nNow, if you wanted to you could\nselect your protector for\n\n429\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.120\nthe operating system drive for TPM.\n\n430\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.530\nPeople that do have TPM should increase it\nand say, not only do you have the trusted\n\n431\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.930\nplatform module with chip that's built\ninto the device there on the motherboard,\n\n432\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.920\nbut we're also gonna require you\nto enter whatever PIN we set.\n\n433\n00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.792\nAll right, and then we can set,\nwe can set a PIN limitation if we want,\n\n434\n00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:52.864\nhow strong of a PIN do we want?\n\n435\n00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:56.244\nAll right, now, we're gonna go ahead and\nI'll leave that at the defaults,\n\n436\n00:23:56.244 --> 00:23:59.844\nwe'll go ahead and just configure TPM and\nPIN, and we're gonna say okay to that.\n\n437\n00:23:59.844 --> 00:24:02.374\nAnd you will see that this is now enabled.\n\n438\n00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.443\nAll right?\n\n439\n00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:05.810\nNow we can also go a little bit father.\n\n440\n00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:10.215\nRemember one of the thing's that\nwe said is to allow a password for\n\n441\n00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:11.550\nnon-TPM devices.\n\n442\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.680\nWell, that inherently is a little less\nsecure than using the trusted platform\n\n443\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.520\nmodule because it's a security\ncryptographic processor built\n\n444\n00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.960\ninto the motherboard has to be there,\nright?\n\n445\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.140\nWell, we can go a little bit farther.\n\n446\n00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.360\nWe can say okay, yeah sure.\n\n447\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.990\nWe're gonna allow you to use passwords.\n\n448\n00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.210\nBut guess what?\n\n449\n00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.770\nJust like we did on the fixed drives,\nmaybe we're gonna require.\n\n450\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.840\nAnd we're gonna do this Dan,\ncuz I wanna show you guys this.\n\n451\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.680\nWhen it comes to management\nof the device so\n\n452\n00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.190\nwe can see that on that work station that\nwe had, it truly is managing that device.\n\n453\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:43.360\nSo we'll go ahead and require password\ncomplexity, and I'll leave it at eight\n\n454\n00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.480\ncharacters there, we won't be too\nbrutal on our end users, right?\n\n455\n00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.592\nNow there's a couple of other settings\nthat I would like to point out here.\n\n456\n00:24:50.592 --> 00:24:53.360\nWe've already seen the encryption\npolicy enforcement settings,\n\n457\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.110\nguys this is no different than what\nwe've seen on the fixed drives.\n\n458\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.980\nI will tell you this is a new feature,\n\n459\n00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.875\nand this is the reason I wanna\nkinda get back to it for a second.\n\n460\n00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:06.600\nIn MBAM 2.5, you could set a threshold.\n\n461\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.120\nBut one of the things that\nyou couldn't do is enforce\n\n462\n00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.170\na required BitLocker encryption.\n\n463\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.670\nService Pack one has changed that.\n\n464\n00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.980\nI can set that threshold to zero, and\n\n465\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.460\nthat says the moment that computer boots\nup, it checks group policy, the client\n\n466\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.911\nside extensions start rifling off the\nsettings on the local machine and says!\n\n467\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.670\nYou're going to go ahead and\nyou're going to encrypt now.\n\n468\n00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.030\nAnd that's one of the newer features\nthat's available in service pack one that\n\n469\n00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.930\nwasn't available in service pack two.\n\n470\n00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.530\nNow I'm not going to set that,\nbut I do want to bring it up and\n\n471\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.320\nmake mention of it just so you're aware.\n\n472\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.670\nAll right,\nnow you could go craziness, right?\n\n473\n00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.150\nYou could get really\ncrazy with these setting.\n\n474\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.210\nLet me show you one here.\n\n475\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.590\nTPMs, TPMs have validation profiles and\n\n476\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:58.450\ninside of the validation profiles\nthey have what's named these PCRs.\n\n477\n00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.260\nPCR is a platform\nconfiguration register guys.\n\n478\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.730\nLet's take the technicality and\nthe jargon out of it, all right.\n\n479\n00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.290\nThe trusted platform module has\nthe state of your operating system,\n\n480\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:14.083\nyour buy offs, early software that\nlaunches at boot time and all of it's\n\n481\n00:26:14.083 --> 00:26:20.350\nstate of configurations and in that TPM\nthat's where they store that information.\n\n482\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:25.350\nWell, these values have to be present for\nit to consider that the system\n\n483\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.440\nhasn't been modified or tampered with,\nyou don't have to set these.\n\n484\n00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.020\nIn fact,\nI would recommend staying away from them.\n\n485\n00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:38.040\nBut one thing I will tell you is\nthat PCR 11 has to be available for\n\n486\n00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.260\na BitLocker access policy to be in place.\n\n487\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.320\nIf we look down, you can actually\nsee that some of these there.\n\n488\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.270\nAnd notice the PCR 11\nBitLocker Access Control.\n\n489\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.340\nThat has to present.\n\n490\n00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.150\nSo if you are gonna modify these they tell\nyou use caution, the best thing you can do\n\n491\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.900\nis stay away from these and let the TPM\ndo its job and don't configure them.\n\n492\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.700\nBut, for security policies you\nmight have reasons to modify those.\n\n493\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.980\nSo, let's see,\ndid I forget anything there preboot?\n\n494\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.480\nI think we're good there.\n\n495\n00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.050\nJust wanna double check here real quick.\n\n496\n00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.510\nWe've got our used password policies, we\ndid have a question come up at one point.\n\n497\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.987\nWhen somebody had asked us,\nwell can you back up to active directory.\n\n498\n00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:20.398\nI do want to show you that one.\n\n499\n00:27:20.398 --> 00:27:24.429\nChoose how bitlocker protected operating\nsystems drives can be recovered.\n\n500\n00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.130\nAll right.\n\n501\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.530\nAnd notice that by default,\nit isn't enabled.\n\n502\n00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.040\nAll right?\n\n503\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.910\nAnd we can allow a DRA, the Data Recovery\nAgent, and we can also, if you see right\n\n504\n00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:39.070\nhere, Save BitLocker recovery information\nto Active Directory Directory Services.\n\n505\n00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.510\nYou don't have to turn this on.\n\n506\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.740\nThis is why we're using MBAM.\n\n507\n00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.850\nRight?\nIt's holding that information for us.\n\n508\n00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.430\nBut if you wanted to, you could do that.\n\n509\n00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:52.380\nAll right, so Dan it looks like let me\njust double check here real quick and\n\n510\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.970\nmake sure that I've got\nthose settings set up.\n\n511\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.920\nAnd then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna switch back over to our client here.\n\n512\n00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.150\nYou know what?\n\n513\n00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:06.220\nSo we've configured our GPO, do you\nthink that GPO's gonna do something?\n\n514\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.140\n>> It's gonna do a whole lot of nothing,\n\n515\n00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.570\nunless you actually link the GPO\nsomewhere inside an active directory.\n\n516\n00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.890\n>> Thank you Dan, for reminding\non me my active directory basics.\n\n517\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.267\nLet's go back over to our domain\ncontroller, because we're not done.\n\n518\n00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.125\nI'm so excited,\nI'm just like we got it done.\n\n519\n00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:23.977\n[CROSSTALK] And it's gonna do nothing.\n\n520\n00:28:23.977 --> 00:28:28.910\nHow you set up your domain is always again\ngoing to be relevant to your environment.\n\n521\n00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.330\nI'm going to go ahead and I'm going\nto create inside of active directory\n\n522\n00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:37.250\na new organizational unit for\na specific manage device.\n\n523\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.280\nAnd we'll just call this bit locker.\n\n524\n00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:48.170\nAnd we'll just call this managed devices,\nall right.\n\n525\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:52.980\nNow I've got that client that\nwe installed the MBAM client on.\n\n526\n00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.240\nIt's sitting right here in the default\ncontainer client 01 so I'm gonna do a move\n\n527\n00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.680\nhere and I'm gonna move this\nclient down to that bit locker OU,\n\n528\n00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.510\nand thanks to Dan,\nwe remember [LAUGH] group policy basics.\n\n529\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.610\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna take,\nI've gotta refresh this here real quick.\n\n530\n00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.600\nDo a refresh, there's that OU,\n\n531\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.900\nwe're gonna select it, we're gonna\nright-click, link an existing OU.\n\n532\n00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.900\nThere's our bit locker management, and\nwe'll just verify that it is there.\n\n533\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.570\nNow, we can switch over to the client.\n\n534\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.990\nNow, when we switch over to the client\nguys, there's a couple of things that I\n\n535\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:34.830\nalso want to show you here, provided\nwe have a little bit of time left.\n\n536\n00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.640\nLet's show you that M Bam does it's job.\n\n537\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.680\nWith normal bit locker encryption,\nthis is a virtual machine.\n\n538\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.030\nIt doesn't have a TPM, okay?\n\n539\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.520\nSo there's no way to turn bitlocker on\nunless I modify some group polices like\n\n540\n00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.590\nwhat we were showing you in the normal\nbitlocker drive encryption management.\n\n541\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:00.610\nLet's show you that, here on our\nclient we're gonna go ahead and\n\n542\n00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:06.650\ngo to our control panel, and\n\n543\n00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:11.810\nI'm gonna go to the basic BitLocker\ndrive encryption, all right?\n\n544\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.080\nAnd we're gonna turn on BitLocker.\n\n545\n00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.550\nNow as you can see when I\ngo to turn on BitLocker,\n\n546\n00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.670\nBitLocker's saying, wait a second.\n\n547\n00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.270\nThis device can't use a trusted\nplatform module, right?\n\n548\n00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.920\nIt's a virtual machine.\n\n549\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.950\nIt doesn't have a TPF.\n\n550\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.060\nSo I can't use it.\n\n551\n00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.090\nRight?\nSo\n\n552\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.160\nat this this point,\nwe can't use BitLocker.\n\n553\n00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.190\nLet's show you that M Bam\ntruly takes control over\n\n554\n00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.090\nthe machine settings\nwhen it comes to the TPM.\n\n555\n00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.720\nNow this is just gonna\ninvolve our command prompt.\n\n556\n00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.730\nWe'll launch our command prompt and\nwe're gonna do a gp update /force.\n\n557\n00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.260\nAll right.\n\n558\n00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:52.000\nWe want to verify that the group\npolicy that we just linked and\n\n559\n00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.520\nwhere we moved this device to that the\npolicy settings are going to take effect.\n\n560\n00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:02.930\nAll right, it looks like it\nhas completed successfully.\n\n561\n00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.910\nIf we wanted,\nwe could do a GP result real quick.\n\n562\n00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.890\nWith our forward slash\nR results at a policy.\n\n563\n00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.260\nAnd we could find out if that policy\nis applying to this computer.\n\n564\n00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.900\nAnd I can see that applied group policy\nobjects the bitlocker management\n\n565\n00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.480\npolicy that we just configured so\nit is there.\n\n566\n00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.590\nCould go a little bit farther if we wanted\nand we could even now remember I told\n\n567\n00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.390\nyou some of the settings that\nweren't in our registry at the time.\n\n568\n00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.320\nWe can go to reg edit now.\n\n569\n00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.444\nAnd same location that we were before,\nlet me collapse some of this guys.\n\n570\n00:31:35.444 --> 00:31:40.252\nWe're basically going to H key\nlocal machine, software, and\n\n571\n00:31:40.252 --> 00:31:44.062\nthen down to polices and\nyou'll see Microsoft and\n\n572\n00:31:44.062 --> 00:31:49.434\nnow notice here that there's this\nFVE key that wasn't there before.\n\n573\n00:31:49.434 --> 00:31:52.938\nLet's look at that and\nsee what that tells us.\n\n574\n00:31:52.938 --> 00:31:56.829\nAnd you gotta expand it out and then\nthere's MDOTBitLockerManagement on there.\n\n575\n00:31:56.829 --> 00:31:59.880\nHelps if I get on the right\nside of the river.\n\n576\n00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.000\nAll right, so notice that we've\ngot KeyRecoveryServiceEndPoint.\n\n577\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.010\nWell do you remember the settings\nthat we set up in all that\n\n578\n00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.140\ncrazy typing that we had to do?\n\n579\n00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.250\nWell there's our recovery service endpoint\nand there is the URL that we typed.\n\n580\n00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:16.340\nNotice that we have our\nStatusReportingServiceEndpoint.\n\n581\n00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.910\nWell, there's the URL that we've typed,\nand we're gonna get back to it.\n\n582\n00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.126\nYou can see the ClientWakeupFrequency.\n\n583\n00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:27.280\nRemember we had 90 minutes.\n\n584\n00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.470\nLet me see, is that 90?\n\n585\n00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.920\nYeah, 90 minutes there.\n\n586\n00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.620\nI remember the crazy 720 minutes\non the status reporting service,\n\n587\n00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.260\nwhich is interesting enough.\n\n588\n00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.410\nWe pull that setting into view so\nyou guys can see it,\n\n589\n00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.180\nand go from hexidecimal to decimal,\nyou can see its there.\n\n590\n00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.705\nNow coming up, we're going to make\na modification to these settings for\n\n591\n00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:44.595\nthe testing purposes.\n\n592\n00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:48.365\nSo we don't have to wait 720 minutes in an\nepisode that's only supposed to be a half\n\n593\n00:32:48.365 --> 00:32:52.415\nhour for anything to show up in\nthe compliance and data reports.\n\n594\n00:32:52.415 --> 00:32:56.565\nWe'll do that here when we go\nto look at the monitoring.\n\n595\n00:32:57.905 --> 00:32:59.445\nOur MBAM is set up.\n\n596\n00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:01.315\nWe know that our policy is applying.\n\n597\n00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:04.825\nRemember we just tried to turn\non BitLocker without a TPM,\n\n598\n00:33:04.825 --> 00:33:07.730\nand it said nope,\nit's not going to happen.\n\n599\n00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.410\nLet's go back to that same location again.\n\n600\n00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.860\nLet's go back to the control panel.\n\n601\n00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:17.561\nGo back to System and Security,\nand BitLocker Drive Encryption,\n\n602\n00:33:17.561 --> 00:33:20.500\nand we're gonna turn on BitLocker.\n\n603\n00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.670\nIt's not erroring out.\n\n604\n00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.460\nWhy?\n\n605\n00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.100\nBecause it's no longer looking\nto local group policy.\n\n606\n00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.300\nIt's no longer looking to the fact\nthat the settings aren't turned on and\n\n607\n00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.150\nit's saying, you don't have a TPM?\n\n608\n00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.895\nWell that's okay, but\nI'm looking at this policy right here, and\n\n609\n00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:38.509\nit's got a check mark that says, allow\nBitLocker encryption without a valid TPM.\n\n610\n00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:43.263\nSo now we can enter our password of dot,\ndot, dot, dot.\n\n611\n00:33:43.263 --> 00:33:45.132\nApparently, too many dots.\n\n612\n00:33:45.132 --> 00:33:47.408\nToo hard to spell dots.\n\n613\n00:33:47.408 --> 00:33:49.196\nAll right, we'll choose Next.\n\n614\n00:33:49.196 --> 00:33:51.796\nIt's going to ask us where do\nwe want to save this file?\n\n615\n00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:53.300\nYou still want to save this recovery file.\n\n616\n00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:58.160\nThe person that's using\nthe computer needs the recover key.\n\n617\n00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.240\nIt's only what happens when they lose the\nrecovery key that it becomes a problem.\n\n618\n00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.977\nNow I've already got a share set up.\n\n619\n00:34:03.977 --> 00:34:11.190\nYou cannot save this on the same C:,\nso you have to find another location.\n\n620\n00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.280\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll save it here,\nand then we'll choose Next.\n\n621\n00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.030\nAnd the option here,\nthere's not really too much of a lesson on\n\n622\n00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.970\nBitLocker in general, but we'll go\nahead and just honorable mentions.\n\n623\n00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.800\nDo you want to encrypt\nthe used space only, or\n\n624\n00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.860\ndo you want to encrypt the entire drive?\n\n625\n00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.850\nNow I would probably suggest,\ngo ahead and do the entire drive, but for\n\n626\n00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.309\nthe purposes of the encryption,\nhere, we want to go ahead and\n\n627\n00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:37.860\nwe'll just say just the used space.\n\n628\n00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.480\nNext thing we have is\nthe BitLocker integrity check.\n\n629\n00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.560\nYou want to run this.\n\n630\n00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.680\nBecause this verifies the keys can be\nread you can get back into your drive\n\n631\n00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.330\nafter the fact.\n\n632\n00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.240\n>> That's helpful.\n\n633\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.210\n>> I was going to say I would\ndefinitely run this one.\n\n634\n00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.580\nWe're going to choose Continue.\n\n635\n00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.640\nAnd we should see that\na restart is pending and\n\n636\n00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:58.000\nrequired, and yet you can see, my head\nwas in the way there, thank you there,\n\n637\n00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.690\nthe encryption will begin\nafter the computer's restart.\n\n638\n00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.089\nLet's go ahead, we're just gonna\nrestart this machine real quick.\n\n639\n00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.820\nI say real quick.\n\n640\n00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.365\nPending, 143 updates applying.\n\n641\n00:35:11.365 --> 00:35:15.500\n[LAUGH] We'll go ahead and restart this\nmachine, and then what we're gonna do,\n\n642\n00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:21.910\nwe'll log back into it, and we wanna\nsee the status of BitLocker encryption.\n\n643\n00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.870\nAll right, so restarting pending here.\n\n644\n00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.330\nAnd we're gonna use our manage-bde\n\n645\n00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.570\ncommand because it's a very\ngood command that gives\n\n646\n00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.710\nyou the command prompt to kinda see\nwhat's going on in the background.\n\n647\n00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.530\nSo here's our BitLocker password,\nor I should say interface,\n\n648\n00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.440\nwhere we've got to enter the password.\n\n649\n00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.123\nKeep in mind,\nall that does is unlocks the drive.\n\n650\n00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:46.820\nI still have to log in, right?\n\n651\n00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.800\nThat does not log me into the computer.\n\n652\n00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.440\nBitlocker says, okay.\n\n653\n00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.120\nNow the operating system's allowed to run,\nyou're going to get a login screen,\n\n654\n00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.530\nnow you can log in.\n\n655\n00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.860\nSo, we'll try to type that\nsuper secret password again.\n\n656\n00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.670\nAnd we get logged into this.\n\n657\n00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:05.660\nOne of the last things I wanna do in this\nepisode is fire up the command prompt,\n\n658\n00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.390\nshow you the manage-bde command, and\n\n659\n00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.640\nthe fact that this machine\nis now being encrypted.\n\n660\n00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.370\nAnd it is good to know the manage-bde\n\n661\n00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.690\ncommand anyways when it comes to managing\nyour BitLocker drive encryptions.\n\n662\n00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:25.306\nPlease keep in mind that this does require\nan administrative level command prompt.\n\n663\n00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:27.080\nAll right, and\ngive me a second here, guys.\n\n664\n00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.020\nWe'll make this just a little bit\neasier for you to see out there.\n\n665\n00:36:33.345 --> 00:36:35.105\nI'll go all Matrix on it again.\n\n666\n00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:41.950\nAnd we're gonna type manage-bde,\n\n667\n00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:47.280\nspace, and then -status.\n\n668\n00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.900\nAll right, and then it looks like this\nmachine is already 64% encrypted.\n\n669\n00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.980\nWe left the encryption the way,\nthe defaults, we didn't do 256.\n\n670\n00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.366\nWe can see the Key Protectors.\n\n671\n00:37:00.366 --> 00:37:01.369\nWhat are the Key Protectors?\n\n672\n00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:02.548\nAre we allowing pins?\n\n673\n00:37:02.548 --> 00:37:04.100\nAre we allowing TPMs?\n\n674\n00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.262\nAre we allowing passwords?\n\n675\n00:37:06.262 --> 00:37:10.227\nSo we can see that the password, or\nthe Key Protectors, as they call it,\n\n676\n00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:13.542\nhow are we protected the BitLocker\nkey is through a numerical\n\n677\n00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:17.850\npassword that we've set and\ndefined beforehand in the group policy.\n\n678\n00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.580\nAnd we're now managing out client through\nthe Microsoft BitLocker Administration and\n\n679\n00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.350\nMonitoring software.\n\n680\n00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.606\n>> Awesome stuff, Wes, and really actually\ndidn't seem to be that difficult.\n\n681\n00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:31.106\nI mean, we did all the hard work\nback in our previous episodes,\n\n682\n00:37:31.106 --> 00:37:35.090\nnow it's just basically reaping\nthe benefits of that hard labor.\n\n683\n00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:41.010\nWe're installing the client into\nthe actual client was relatively simple,\n\n684\n00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.090\nand any of the things that\nmight seem confusing,\n\n685\n00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.490\nwell you walked us through\nthose conundrums as well.\n\n686\n00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.830\nSo we appreciate those clarifications.\n\n687\n00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.600\nThat being said,\n\n688\n00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.410\nlooks like we have run out of time,\nbut we have a configured system.\n\n689\n00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.080\nWe're looking forward to getting into more\nof the meat and potatoes of that system.\n\n690\n00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.980\nBut we're outta time for this episode,\nso that'll have to be in the future.\n\n691\n00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.550\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPro TV.\n\n692\n00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.580\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n693\n00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.590\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n694\n00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.723\n>> See you next time.\n\n695\n00:38:08.723 --> 00:38:16.450\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:21.031\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we're continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.061\nwith our series Looking at the Microsoft\ndesktop, wait not operating.\n\n5\n00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:26.021\nThe optimization.\n\n6\n00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:28.830\nI get the desktop\noperating stuck in my head.\n\n7\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.730\nOptimization pack.\n\n8\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.210\nThat's what we're looking at today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.750\nJoining us in the studio to lend\nhis expertise on that topic,\n\n10\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.150\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.140\nWes, welcome to the show sir.\n\n12\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.380\nHow's it going?\n>> It's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.110\nAnd as always, it's good to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.270\nThat's right, MDOP.\n\n15\n00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.360\nI tell you what, they don't shy away\nfrom their acronyms when it comes to\n\n16\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.940\nany kind of desktop support.\n\n17\n00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.560\nSo we're coming back at you again with\nmore of the Microsoft BitLocker and\n\n18\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.180\nadministration and management.\n\n19\n00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.100\n>> Not so easy is it.\n\n20\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.370\n>> Apparantely I can't say it.\n\n21\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.160\nLet's try that again.\n\n22\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.510\nSo stepping back from that.\n\n23\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.460\nThe Microsoft Bitlocker administration and\nmonitoring software.\n\n24\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.270\nAnd in the first few episodes\nwe've shown you prerequisites and\n\n25\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.590\nhow to get it set up and how to configure\nsome of the settings in group policy,\n\n26\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.320\npreparing Active Directory as well\nas deploying the client out and\n\n27\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.260\nthen showing you some of the settings that\nyou could configure through our group\n\n28\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.540\npolicy management console.\n\n29\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.270\nBut now it's time to do a little\nbit of administration, if you will.\n\n30\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.310\nSo we're gonna look at some of the\nwebsites that we've talked about as well\n\n31\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.020\nas what can your end users expect to see?\n\n32\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.420\nAnd that's something good to know\nbecause if you're gonna troubleshoot it,\n\n33\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.430\nyou really have to be able to see\nwhat the end users are seeing.\n\n34\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.130\nSo that's where we're going to start.\n\n35\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.960\nFirst thing we're gonna do here, we'll\nkick it off with a little bit of a client\n\n36\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.480\nexperience and\nwhat they can expect to see.\n\n37\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.620\nSo I've got a Windows machine up here,\n\n38\n00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.350\nand in one of the previous\nepisodes that Dan and\n\n39\n00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.255\nI did, you might remember that we talked\nabout putting in an enforcement policy.\n\n40\n00:01:54.255 --> 00:02:00.240\nTaking a series of days and saying,\nwithin this amount of time you have,\n\n41\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.210\nyou can postpone your encryption,\nbut after let's say the fourth day,\n\n42\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.040\nyou're gonna be required to encrypt,\nand you can see that right here, and\n\n43\n00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.750\nthis is what they're gonna see\nonce group policy fires off.\n\n44\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.330\nYour client machine\ncontacts Active Directory,\n\n45\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.200\nlooks at what the policy is and\nthen you turn around and\n\n46\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.810\nyou contact the reporting database\nserver in the background.\n\n47\n00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.510\nAnd then it says you know what?\n\n48\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.252\nYou're reporting that you're not in\ncompliance right now because your drive\n\n49\n00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:32.160\nisn't encrypted so\nthis screen does come up.\n\n50\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.180\nAnd as you can see,\nit gives us the option to postpone it.\n\n51\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.025\nRemember one of the newer features\nin MBAM 2.5 Service Pack One\n\n52\n00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:43.650\nwas the fact that we could\nenforce it right away.\n\n53\n00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.225\nWe can say you we're not gonna\nallow you to postpone it.\n\n54\n00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:47.935\nThe moment you see this,\n\n55\n00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:51.205\nwe're gonna only give you\nthe option to start the encryption.\n\n56\n00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:55.595\nNow, it's a little bit different\non how we do the encryption versus\n\n57\n00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:58.872\nmaybe what you've traditionally\nseen in the the control panel.\n\n58\n00:02:58.872 --> 00:03:02.292\nAnd what I like about this is\nthey put that front and center.\n\n59\n00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:03.762\nYou cannot ignore it.\n\n60\n00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:05.842\nIf you see me grabbing\nonto the control panel,\n\n61\n00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.772\nthat's still right there in the front.\n\n62\n00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:11.579\nSo they really do not want you,\nthere's no way to miss it,\n\n63\n00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.468\nlet's just put it that way.\n\n64\n00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:17.462\nSo let me kinda pull this to the side here\nand show you maybe what you've already\n\n65\n00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:19.742\ntraditionally seen with\nBitLocker encryption.\n\n66\n00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:22.380\nWe could turn our BitLocker\nencryption on here.\n\n67\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.030\nAnd a lot of us that maybe have studied\nfor some of the client exams in the past,\n\n68\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.140\nyou've probably seen this route\nmore than maybe you want to.\n\n69\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.260\nBut with the BitLocker encryption\noptions that we have here,\n\n70\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.740\nremember that there is an additional\noption that is controlling this down here.\n\n71\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.120\nBecause we do have the MBAM\nclient installed so\n\n72\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.190\nthe MBAM client is communicating with our\nservers, our compliant servers, and then\n\n73\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.853\nagain with Active Directory to see where\nthe policies are, what the policies state.\n\n74\n00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:57.760\nAnd in this case, our policy is\nstating that we can postpone it for so\n\n75\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.540\nmany days, or we can start the encryption.\n\n76\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.455\nBut let's go ahead, and\nwe're gonna start the encryption.\n\n77\n00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:03.610\nNow keep in mind guys,\nwe're not gonna wait for\n\n78\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.390\nthis thing to do a full encryption,\nbut we do want to show you\n\n79\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.740\nwhat it looks like when the user\nstarts their encryption process.\n\n80\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.770\nNow notice that the screen is a little\nbit different, but Dan you can see,\n\n81\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.200\nsteps are really pretty much the same\nas you would see on the interface.\n\n82\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.660\nNow another way to understand that yes,\nMBAM is controlling this,\n\n83\n00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.250\nthis is a virtual machine guys.\n\n84\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.860\nSo no TV magic or voodoo out there,\n\n85\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.690\nthis is a virtual machine\nthat we're controlling.\n\n86\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.180\nAnd keep in mind that it\ndoesn't have the TPM.\n\n87\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.390\nSo remember if you don't have\na trusted platform module by\n\n88\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.490\ndefault you can't use\nBitLocker encryption without\n\n89\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.040\nconfiguring a couple of group policies\nthat allow that option to be changed.\n\n90\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.870\nBut because we're managing it through\nthe MDOP MBAM portion of the GPO,\n\n91\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.880\nthat is gonna be completely ignored and\nit's gonna let us know that if we want to\n\n92\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.510\nallow non-TPM platforms to use BitLocker,\nwe could choose to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.600\nAnd that's what we've done here and that's\nwhy it isn't throwing an error that says\n\n94\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.360\nthat you can't use it because no\ntrusted platform module has been found.\n\n95\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.500\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll enter our password here.\n\n96\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.730\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ncreate our password.\n\n97\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.770\nNow the interesting thing that\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n98\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.970\nWhen we go through the encryption\nprocess in the traditional, and\n\n99\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.860\nit looks like, so\nhopefully I can pause on that.\n\n100\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.950\nI didn't get to.\n\n101\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.600\nBut so when you encrypt through\nthe normal BitLocker interface,\n\n102\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.740\nyou might realize that you\nhave to set a recovery key,\n\n103\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.650\nyou've got to save it to a file,\nto a different location.\n\n104\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.720\nWe've actually done that here\nin some of the episodes, so\n\n105\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.250\nif you haven't seen that go back and\nwatch some of those earlier episodes.\n\n106\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.080\nSo you might be asking yourself well,\nwhy didn't it save the recovery key here?\n\n107\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.660\nIt didn't even ask me,\ndidn't give me the no,\n\n108\n00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.630\nyou can't save this on the same\ndrive that it's gonna be encrypted.\n\n109\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.560\nAll those good little warnings that you\nget when you're setting up BitLocker.\n\n110\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.448\nWell, why is that?\n\n111\n00:05:56.448 --> 00:06:02.240\nWell, I want you to remember that, in some\nof the settings that we've looked at,\n\n112\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.800\nkeep in mind that this isn't\nbeing stored locally anymore.\n\n113\n00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.010\nIf you remember some of those registry\nkey settings that we were looking at,\n\n114\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.640\nkeep in mind that it's actually\nbeing managed by MDOP.\n\n115\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.480\nAnd if we look at some of those\nregistry settings in here,\n\n116\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.732\nyou'll remember that we set\nup a recovery point service.\n\n117\n00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:28.040\nSo where the recover information\nwould get sent to a database, and\n\n118\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.240\nyou can see that right here.\n\n119\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.730\nSo that's one of the reasons, and\n\n120\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.370\nwhat I mean more specifically by that is\nnotice the key recovery service endpoint.\n\n121\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.982\nWell that's the actual service that's\ngonna receive the recovery key and\n\n122\n00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:42.685\nthe way we set it up,\nif you remember, Dan,\n\n123\n00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.630\nwas the fact that we did\nthe key package as well.\n\n124\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.260\nWe said we wanna save all of it.\n\n125\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.910\nWe don't wanna just save the recovery key.\n\n126\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.550\nWe'll save the BitLocker encryption key\nin case we ever need to recover it and\n\n127\n00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.740\nyou can do that likewise.\n\n128\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.540\nSo that's one of the reasons\nwe aren't getting\n\n129\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.370\nthat warning about the recovery key\nis because it's automated for us now.\n\n130\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.820\nRemember with your end user experience,\nthe less they have to interact with it,\n\n131\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.620\nthe less they can be in control of it,\nand really\n\n132\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.020\nthe less they see of a certain technology,\nit just makes for a better experience.\n\n133\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.620\nI don't need to worry about,\nwhere did they save it?\n\n134\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.030\nDid they save it to a thumb drive?\n\n135\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.710\nDid they save it to the corporate shared?\n\n136\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.760\nDid they save it locally?\n\n137\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.004\nWhere did they save it?\n\n138\n00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:27.140\nIn this aspect,\nthe client doesn't need to do any of that.\n\n139\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.730\nThey just, like you see,\nthey set the password and\n\n140\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.250\nit starts the encryption process.\n\n141\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.840\nThat being said, the other thing\nthat it didn't require us to do, and\n\n142\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.892\nmaybe you might remember this as well,\nDan, is the fact that,\n\n143\n00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:46.495\nwhen we set the BitLocker encryption\nup without MBAM, what does it do?\n\n144\n00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:49.705\nIt requires us to run\na system integrity check and\n\n145\n00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:55.041\nrestart the computer before the BitLocker\nencryption process will even start.\n\n146\n00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.830\nBut if I jump down to\na command prompt here, And\n\n147\n00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.090\nI'll make this a little bit easier for\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n148\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.250\nI know the gray's sometimes\na little bit hard to see.\n\n149\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.643\nWe'll change that up a little bit.\n\n150\n00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:14.540\nNow we'll do eye piercing yellow.\n\n151\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.300\nThat looks like it didn't\nchange it too much.\n\n152\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.198\nAll right.\nSo if we run our manage-bde command\n\n153\n00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:27.110\nwith the option being-status here.\n\n154\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.770\nAnd we give that a second to run and look\nat the system, we're gonna find that yes,\n\n155\n00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.400\nthe bit locker encryption\nprocess has been started.\n\n156\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.420\nWe've got to be in administrative level\ncommand prompt, let's try that again.\n\n157\n00:08:42.819 --> 00:08:44.200\nAll right.\n\n158\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.180\nAnd hopefully that will\nget us started up there.\n\n159\n00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.560\nThere we go.\nThat's what we want.\n\n160\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.010\nSo, now if we try that.\n\n161\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.830\nImage-bde, remember\n\n162\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.150\nwith the status parameter,\nthere we go that's what we want to see,\n\n163\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.020\nnotice we're already half way done with\nthe encryption process already and\n\n164\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.310\nwe didn't have to restart the machine\nkeep in mind that our key protectors,\n\n165\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.250\nwe can see that the password is there,\nthe numerical password.\n\n166\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.970\nRemember your key protectors are how\nare you protecting the bit locker\n\n167\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.050\ndrive in general.\n\n168\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.540\nYou might see a TPM in here if you\nsee a TPM a lot of times you'll see\n\n169\n00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.560\nsome of the things that we've\ntalked about in other episodes like\n\n170\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.500\nthe platform configuration registers.\n\n171\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.840\nBut for us, right here,\nwe're just using a password.\n\n172\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.270\nSo, pretty straight forward process here.\n\n173\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.240\nVery transparent to the end-user.\n\n174\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.760\nI say transparent,\ntransparent in the fact that there's\n\n175\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.720\nthis huge interface here\nthat won't go away.\n\n176\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go ahead and close this out.\n\n177\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.850\nNow the good about this is\nif you notice it says it\n\n178\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.520\ncould take several hours, right?\n\n179\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.100\nBut you can continue to use your\ncomputer during the encryption process.\n\n180\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.130\nSee, if we were to deploy this out with\nthe normal BitLocker encryption and\n\n181\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.908\nlet's say somebody logs into the machine.\n\n182\n00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:06.850\nThe machine grabs the group policy and\nthey're in the middle of working,\n\n183\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.670\nwell it's gonna require a restart.\n\n184\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.800\nNow, I don't, Dan, have you ever had\nsomebody who stays logged in to a computer\n\n185\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.410\nand doesn't actually restart the computer?\n\n186\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.205\nSo, if you push out a policy here and\nthe person doesn't restart the computer,\n\n187\n00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:20.045\nthe encryption process\ndoesn't even happen.\n\n188\n00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:23.625\nThey've got 15 tabs open in a browser,\nthey got all their different line of\n\n189\n00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:26.715\nbusiness products open but\nthey don't restart the computer.\n\n190\n00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:29.952\nAnd that's another good thing is\nthat they can continue to work.\n\n191\n00:10:29.952 --> 00:10:32.492\nAll right, and the other thing too,\n\n192\n00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:36.642\nI like this, computer should remain\nplugged in during the encryption process.\n\n193\n00:10:36.642 --> 00:10:39.062\nYeah, it's kind of hard to encrypt\nsomething if you don't have electrical\n\n194\n00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:40.932\ncurrent running to the computer.\n\n195\n00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.802\nBut all joking aside,\n\n196\n00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:45.382\nyou do want to make sure that it\nisn't interrupted in this process.\n\n197\n00:10:45.382 --> 00:10:47.772\n>> That's not as far-fetched\nas you might think there, Wes.\n\n198\n00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:48.722\nI actually had a lady.\n\n199\n00:10:48.722 --> 00:10:49.392\nShe called me up and\n\n200\n00:10:49.392 --> 00:10:53.600\nsaid I'm having trouble accessing\nthe files on my thumb drive.\n\n201\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.550\nI can't see them.\n\n202\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.980\nOkay, let me log into your computer and\ndo a remote connection.\n\n203\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.170\nAnd I went to the computer\nmanagement area, and I saw,\n\n204\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.780\nwell there's no thumb drive here,\nI'm not seeing it as well.\n\n205\n00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.385\nIs it securely plugged in?\n\n206\n00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:07.982\nShe goes, it needs to be plugged in?\n\n207\n00:11:07.982 --> 00:11:12.195\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said, yes, these electrical devices\n\n208\n00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:14.955\ndo require electricity and\nconnections for them to work.\n\n209\n00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:17.625\nSo don't think that these\nwarnings are there for nothing.\n\n210\n00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:22.295\nI have actually experienced\nsomeone who thought that,\n\n211\n00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:25.245\nby osmosis, or magic or something,\n\n212\n00:11:25.245 --> 00:11:30.038\nthe files got from one device to the other\nwithout actually making physical contact.\n\n213\n00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:31.370\n>> [LAUGH] It can definitely happen.\n\n214\n00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:36.400\nIn fact, one of our other hosts Mike\nhad made a point one that he was giving\n\n215\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.310\npeople some technical advice,\ntrying to help them out,\n\n216\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.980\nand he says okay restart the computer,\nand the person said okay, it's restarted.\n\n217\n00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.150\nAnd he's like wow, that's faster,\nyou must have like a supercomputer,\n\n218\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.900\nlet's try that again,\ncan you reboot the computer?\n\n219\n00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.120\nOkay it's done and turns out the person\nthought rebooting the computer was just\n\n220\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.380\nturning the monitor on and off,\nthat's all they were doing.\n\n221\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.240\nI never put it past anyone for sure.\n\n222\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.410\nThis is really what the end user\nthemselves, they are going to see.\n\n223\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:06.130\nBut now as administrators we've got to\nfigure out what are we going to see on our\n\n224\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.140\nend, and that's where the administration\nand monitoring website comes in for us.\n\n225\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.840\nSo I've gone ahead and I've pulled up\nthe administration and monitoring website.\n\n226\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.270\nHere, let me get logged\nback into my machine.\n\n227\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.690\nThere are two major sites that\nI wanna make you guys aware of.\n\n228\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.460\nNow.\n\n229\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.610\nThese will be a little bit different\ndepending on your situation or\n\n230\n00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.750\nyour server names.\n\n231\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.030\nWhen you are going for\n\n232\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.440\nlet's say the administration monitoring\nwebsite which we're on right now.\n\n233\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.570\nThat's actually the help desk so\nis your HTTP or\n\n234\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.900\nHTTPS if you've bound that certificate\nto secure the communications,\n\n235\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.640\nwhich I would recommend doing,\nit'll be HTTPS.\n\n236\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.970\nAnd then it's your server name,\nand then it's /helpdesk.\n\n237\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.530\nNow, depending on what\npermissions you have.\n\n238\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.480\nSee, I've set up my account\nwith the permissions already.\n\n239\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.900\nRemember we showed you in the first\npart of provisioning Active Directory,\n\n240\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.990\nthe roles and\nthe groups that are needed here.\n\n241\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.460\nI've put my account in those roles and\ngroups so that I can gain access for\n\n242\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.660\nthe purposes of demonstration to you.\n\n243\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.860\nThe other one is the reports\nwebsite as well.\n\n244\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.650\nAnd, again, probably not too big of\na secret on what you would find there,\n\n245\n00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:19.590\nyour reports.\n\n246\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.390\nThis is the location where we'll\nsee a lot of the SQL stuff that we\n\n247\n00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.480\ndid on the back end.\n\n248\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.950\nI got the databases ready and\nthen configured the accounts and\n\n249\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.940\nthe connections to them.\n\n250\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.010\nThat's where we're gonna go here.\n\n251\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.250\nBut let's go ahead, and let's just\nkinda look at what we could do here.\n\n252\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.420\nSo for instance, drive recovery.\n\n253\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.260\nYou'll see, depending on what the role is,\nremember we have two different roles or\n\n254\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.580\ngroups, and\nroles associated with it, remember,\n\n255\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.270\nwe have an advanced help desk group,\nand we also have the help desk group.\n\n256\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.110\nnow the help desk group, if you're in\nthat group, you're gonna see that these\n\n257\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.350\ntwo fields here are required, including\nthe key ID, in order to do a recovery.\n\n258\n00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:06.240\nIf you're in the advanced help desk group,\nthen you get all access to this website.\n\n259\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.970\nAnd you're not required to put in,\nas you can see\n\n260\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.940\nwe don't have any little red asterisk\nsymbol like we do on the key IDs,\n\n261\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.990\nbecause the users that are in\nthe advanced help desk group.\n\n262\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.250\nThat's all they have to provide.\n\n263\n00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.810\nThey have to provide the key id and\nthen a reason as to\n\n264\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.560\nwell why is it that you're\nrequiring to unlock this drive?\n\n265\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.530\nAnd that's important, right?\n\n266\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.170\nThat's gonna be important for\nthings like your recovery audit.\n\n267\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.700\nRight?\n\n268\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.160\nIf you do have a machine,\nsomebody's lost their password well,\n\n269\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.640\nmaybe you have a security policy.\n\n270\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.610\nMaybe you have checks and\nbalance in place.\n\n271\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.750\nIt's not just as simple as Wes or Dan as\nthe administrators coming in here and\n\n272\n00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.750\nunlocking a drive.\n\n273\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.360\nMaybe we've gotta go through a formality,\na process that says, okay.\n\n274\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.890\nAnd I don't mean an interrogation,\nbut why did the person?\n\n275\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.810\nWas the user doing due\ndiligence on their part?\n\n276\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.030\nSo you might have something on\nthe back end that says you gotta go\n\n277\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.960\nthrough these steps and that's whatever\nis tailor made to your company.\n\n278\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.110\nAnd then once it's been submitted and\napproved, then maybe you come up here.\n\n279\n00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.770\nBut remember the advance help desk,\nall they need is the key ID.\n\n280\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.450\nWe're gonna show you the recovery\npart of this coming up, all right?\n\n281\n00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.610\nNow if you have devices that have TPM's,\n\n282\n00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.590\nthe Trusted Platform Module, remember\nthose are cryptographic processors that\n\n283\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.720\nare inside of the machines themselves,\nwe can't just take those out.\n\n284\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.840\nIt's not like the hard drives and\n\n285\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.810\nother components within\na computer that we can take out.\n\n286\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.815\nBut one of the things that you\ncan do is if the user does have\n\n287\n00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:40.737\na Trusted Platform Module, and\nyou can see that it's not gonna accept\n\n288\n00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:45.764\ntheir BitLocker PIN, they do tell\nyou to try the drive recovery first.\n\n289\n00:15:45.764 --> 00:15:50.104\nBecause remember, with the management of\nthe TPM, you have to set TPM ownership,\n\n290\n00:15:50.104 --> 00:15:52.274\nand there can only be\none owner of the TPM,\n\n291\n00:15:52.274 --> 00:15:55.934\nbut Basically what you could do here\nis a little bit more information.\n\n292\n00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:59.373\nAnd this is something I'm gonna kinda\njump back and forth if you are maybe in\n\n293\n00:15:59.373 --> 00:16:02.350\na testing situation where\nthey're asking you about MBAM.\n\n294\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.110\nThe different requirements between\ntwo different recovery types.\n\n295\n00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.770\nRight?\nNotice that now I need a computer domain\n\n296\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:14.240\nand I need the computer name and\nthe reason for requesting\n\n297\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.920\nthe ownership file and that's where\nthe TPM ownership comes into play for us.\n\n298\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.320\nRemember, there can only be one owner.\n\n299\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.900\nNow we can turn off the TPM and\n\n300\n00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.100\nthat basically turns off the BitLocker\nencryption so how you do this,\n\n301\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.630\npay attention because it does\npresent a security vulnerability.\n\n302\n00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.250\nBut if you are in some kind of exam\nendeavor remember computer domain,\n\n303\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.760\ncomputer name And then the reason for\n\n304\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.050\nresetting the TPM if you will\nare completely turning it off as a recap.\n\n305\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.740\nRemember, drive recovery if you're part\nof the help desk you need to put in these\n\n306\n00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.630\nfields, including the key ID if\nyou're an advanced help desk\n\n307\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.480\nyou only need the key ID as\nfar as a reason to unlock.\n\n308\n00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.340\n>> Tell you what I wish I had\nthis tool back when I was in\n\n309\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.130\nan enterprise environment because I did\nmore bit locker key recovery things.\n\n310\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.540\nThat was like after we\nimplemented bit locker\n\n311\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.240\nthat became like half my job [LAUGH]\nI'm trying to get past this and\n\n312\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.610\nneed a recovery key, and\nI'm like here we go.\n\n313\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.491\n>> And Dan, that's a good point to make,\nthat really is one of the benefits of\n\n314\n00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:21.335\nMBAM is because I can only imagine that\nwas a completely decentralized nightmare.\n\n315\n00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:24.000\nBecause if you're doing\nthis through group policy,\n\n316\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.160\nyes you do have the option to backup\nthe keys to active directory, but\n\n317\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.900\nit's still decentralized in the fact that\nevery single one of these individual\n\n318\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.070\ndevices have to be managed independently\nof each other, where in this situation\n\n319\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.295\nyou can see that this website collectively\n>> Brings all of that information into\n\n320\n00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:44.485\na single interface and would have saved\nDan a whole bunch of nightmare and\n\n321\n00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:48.415\nheadaches not having to do this\nindividually one at a time.\n\n322\n00:17:48.415 --> 00:17:50.995\nSo that's a good thing to have.\n\n323\n00:17:50.995 --> 00:17:54.255\nAlso I will tell you one other thing that\nis missing right here cuz I wanna show\n\n324\n00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:57.440\nyou the ports interface and\nI did this on purpose.\n\n325\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.090\nIf you are part of the reporting group too\n\n326\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.520\nyou will see there will be a third\noption over here, and be aware of that.\n\n327\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.200\nIt would say reports but it's kind\nof generic because then it gives you\n\n328\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.170\nthe ability to do some of the things\nthat we're going to do with a full blown\n\n329\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.260\ninterface like run an enterprise\ncompliance report, a computer compliance\n\n330\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.320\nreport, so a specific computer,\nand then do a recovery audit.\n\n331\n00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.160\nSo, you're going to see\nall of that coming up but\n\n332\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.290\nwe're going to show you the full\nwebsite that you can do this on.\n\n333\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.400\nBut they do give you the ability,\nif the end user has the right permissions,\n\n334\n00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.210\nthey're going to see all of\nthis in this single interface,\n\n335\n00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.340\nwhich is another good thing.\n\n336\n00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.740\nSingle interface I don't have\nto jump between websites but\n\n337\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.760\nkeep in mind we talk about,\nprincipal at least privilege and\n\n338\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.300\nseparation, role separation here\nyou might not have the same person.\n\n339\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.230\nYou might not be the one\nthat does the audits.\n\n340\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.975\nTo be the same person that's\nproviding the information\n\n341\n00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:47.275\nIn the audits that may be\na conflict of interest there.\n\n342\n00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:52.585\nSo, the next thing we have to look at is\nthings like the compliance and the audit\n\n343\n00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:57.765\ndatabase themselves, and that's where the\nsecond, let me go ahead and tell you what,\n\n344\n00:18:57.765 --> 00:19:03.027\nprobably have To refresh this page,\nperiodically, you do have to refresh it.\n\n345\n00:19:03.027 --> 00:19:04.087\nOkay, good good good.\n\n346\n00:19:04.087 --> 00:19:07.017\nIf you ever get an error, if you've been\nlogged into this for a little bit and\n\n347\n00:19:07.017 --> 00:19:10.517\nyou get this crazy html\nerror across the page,\n\n348\n00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:14.937\nall you have to do is shut the web browser\ndown if a refresh doesn't work, and\n\n349\n00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:17.907\nthen launch it back up and\nit's gonna ask you to re-authenticate.\n\n350\n00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:20.237\nAgain, keep in mind the information\nthat you have here.\n\n351\n00:19:20.237 --> 00:19:25.170\nThe information contained in this website\npotentially could give people access,\n\n352\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.870\nunauthorized access to encrypted\ninformation that's very\n\n353\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.810\nimportant to your company.\n\n354\n00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.570\nSo it's not a bad thing for sure.\n\n355\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.740\nNow this is, as you can see, remember\none of the biggest roles, actually,\n\n356\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.410\none of the only roles Dan\nthat you've seen Dan and\n\n357\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.760\nI install was the SQL\nserver reporting service.\n\n358\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.290\nRemember we did the database engine,\nbecause that,\n\n359\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.760\nit's the engine that runs the whole thing.\n\n360\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.190\nSo we needed that, but\nthis is really what we needed.\n\n361\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.130\nAnd it's great because you\ndon't have to know SQL.\n\n362\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.110\nI don't know SQL Server.\n\n363\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.980\nI can spell it on my best day, but\n\n364\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.720\nthe great thing about this software\nhere is that it knows what to configure.\n\n365\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.460\nIt knows how to set up the interface.\n\n366\n00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.630\nIf you got IIS like we do our webpage\nhere, then they communicate together.\n\n367\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.630\nAnd what you're left with if you've set\nit up right is a simple FI web-based\n\n368\n00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.940\ninterface that you really didn't have\nto configure too much on the back end.\n\n369\n00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.290\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n370\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.220\nI'll tell you what,\nlet's open this up and see what we got.\n\n371\n00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.240\nRemember language?\n\n372\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.360\nLanguage specific?\n\n373\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.050\nWe got Japanese over here I believe.\n\n374\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.210\nAnd I believe that's Russian.\n\n375\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.060\nI'm not sure what some\nof these other ones are.\n\n376\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.220\n>> Go over here and let's do that.\n\n377\n00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:25.941\n>> Yeah, France, there we go.\n\n378\n00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:26.517\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n379\n00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:29.136\nyou've got the different packs\nthat are baked right into it.\n\n380\n00:20:29.136 --> 00:20:31.890\nAnd of course,\nwe're gonna want the en-us here.\n\n381\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.980\n>> If you are a US english speaker.\n\n382\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.800\n>> That's right.\n\n383\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.100\n>> We are a global company here.\n\n384\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.760\n>> We are.\n\n385\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.160\nWe could have some French\nspeaking people out there,\n\n386\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.080\nwe could have our viewers\nout there in Europe.\n\n387\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.680\nWhatever language is to your native tongue\nwith the one that you're gonna be using.\n\n388\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.700\nAnd here we go,\nwe've got these different reports.\n\n389\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.910\nAnd what's great about is, in fact,\n\n390\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.460\nI know that we've got some\nother episodes going on on SQL.\n\n391\n00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.120\nAnd Dan and I were talking about\n\n392\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.680\nthis right before we started filming this\nepisode about how confused I look at,\n\n393\n00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.460\nwhen I see somebody talking\nabout generating a SQL query.\n\n394\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.980\nThat's beyond me.\n\n395\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.075\nBut the great thing is I\ndon't have to know that.\n\n396\n00:21:13.075 --> 00:21:14.480\nMBAM does it for you.\n\n397\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.590\nOnce you get it set up,\n\n398\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.996\nif I wanna do an Enterprise\nCompliance Report, I click a link.\n\n399\n00:21:18.996 --> 00:21:24.315\nAnd I click a link, and\nonce I do that, it's going to\n\n400\n00:21:24.315 --> 00:21:28.595\ngenerate this report on the back end for\nme by communicating with the database.\n\n401\n00:21:28.595 --> 00:21:31.605\nGrabs that information, analyzes it, and\n\n402\n00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:36.060\nthrows it into a graphical user interface,\nsomething that I can interpret and\n\n403\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.550\nI don't have to know Sequel and\nthat's a really good thing here.\n\n404\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.690\nSo I can get an idea that I have well 67\n\n405\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.210\npercent compliance according to my\nwhole company now understand for\n\n406\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.240\nthe purposes of demonstration\n>> Non compliance.\n\n407\n00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.484\n>> Non compliance thank you\nthat's right thank thank you.\n\n408\n00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:55.250\n>> Red is bad green is good [LAUGH]\n>> Very good and see that's the benefit.\n\n409\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.560\nYou didn't have to know SQL.\n\n410\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.655\nWe've got picture books.\n\n411\n00:21:58.655 --> 00:22:00.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Pop ups, nice.\n\n412\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.800\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n413\n00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.940\nAnd like I said for the testing purposes,\nyou'll see one of the clients\n\n414\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.840\nthat we had the other day that we put\nin here and you'll see a couple more.\n\n415\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.220\nBut I don't know exactly\nwhat's going on with him but\n\n416\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.840\nI can see that we've got some computers.\n\n417\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.290\nI can see the computer name and\nagain overall compliance.\n\n418\n00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.120\n33 percent,\nwow that's an interesting number.\n\n419\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.490\nI think I'm gonna play like a four\nlottery or something like that.\n\n420\n00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.080\n66.67 percent Non-compliant, remember\nred is bad, remember what Dan said.\n\n421\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.590\nWe've got no exemption set,\n\n422\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:38.800\nkeep in mind that if we did have some\nmaybe computers that we wanted to manage.\n\n423\n00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.220\nAnd I tell you with\nthe exemption policies,\n\n424\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.180\nyou could do this a different way.\n\n425\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.490\nYou got to be fair and honest on this,\nif I don't want it to be managed with MBAM\n\n426\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.670\nchances are I'm not gonna put that\ncomputer in the OU Inactive Directory, and\n\n427\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.560\nit's not managed with MBAM, so\nthere's more than one way to do this,\n\n428\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.790\nlet's just be honest.\n\n429\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:02.020\nAnd we can say, one compliant,\ntwo non-compliant, three non-exempt.\n\n430\n00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.810\nI can tell every one of these machines\nthat the reason they're not compliant is,\n\n431\n00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.540\nat some point,\nwe're requiring Bit Locker to manage them.\n\n432\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.200\nSo, really cool interface.\n\n433\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:18.050\nNow, with that being said well can we find\nout a little bit more, well I could and\n\n434\n00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.230\nlet me back up here we're going to do this\na couple times you're going to see me jump\n\n435\n00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.850\nback and forth a couple times I could do\na computer compliance report right and\n\n436\n00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.780\nI'll show you how that relates\nback to the enterprise compliance\n\n437\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.770\nreport that we just run in a second.\n\n438\n00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.690\nBut, let's go ahead.\n\n439\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.630\nNow, this one isn't so flashy, right?\n\n440\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.000\nIt just says device.\n\n441\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.241\n>> I don't think there's anything there.\n\n442\n00:23:38.241 --> 00:23:39.436\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n443\n00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:43.292\nThey didn't put too much flair into this\nwebsite here because you're only looking\n\n444\n00:23:43.292 --> 00:23:44.518\nfor a specific computer.\n\n445\n00:23:44.518 --> 00:23:48.637\nSo, if I would, in fact, I don't\nremember what that computer's name is.\n\n446\n00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:52.308\nSo, I'm going to show you the other way,\nreal quick, too, that you can do this.\n\n447\n00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:57.504\nAll right so we generate the report,\nand it gives me my clients down here.\n\n448\n00:23:57.504 --> 00:24:03.790\nAnd, there's a couple of different ways\nthat you can do that, I better say.\n\n449\n00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.170\nBut I want to find out what's\ngoing on with Win10Client03 here.\n\n450\n00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.110\nIt's noncompliant, it's non-exempt.\n\n451\n00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.730\nLet me go ahead and\njust click on that, and\n\n452\n00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.860\nyou're gonna see something\nkinda interesting here.\n\n453\n00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.940\nThis is essentially doing the same thing\nthat we were just, what we were just\n\n454\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.080\nabout to run but I didn't have to\nknow the computer's name, right.\n\n455\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.850\nSo I can see, well,\nI can see the domain name.\n\n456\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.880\n>> So a lot of these things are clickable,\nthey have a hyperlink to some other page.\n\n457\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.460\n>> Makes it so much easier, absolutely.\n\n458\n00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.390\nAnd even, we could expand out.\n\n459\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.870\nI wanna kinda go through this information.\n\n460\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.500\nRemember that we did have the ability,\nif we wanted to,\n\n461\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.940\nwe could set a higher level\nof encryption strength.\n\n462\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.100\nWell we could do that if we needed to.\n\n463\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.500\nBut we can see what the current\nencryption strength is.\n\n464\n00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.670\nWe can see what the protector is.\n\n465\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:53.090\nNow, if you know behind the scenes in the\ncommand prompt, it doesn't say protector,\n\n466\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.170\nbut the encryption required,\nand it's password protected.\n\n467\n00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.270\nIt's interesting, you can even see maybe\nhow you've set up some of your policies\n\n468\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.390\nand the fact that we didn't require\nencryption on other drive types.\n\n469\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.290\nI can also see the users that at one\npoint have logged into this machine.\n\n470\n00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.210\nI can see that it was the njo\nAdministrator that logged in maybe to\n\n471\n00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.380\nset up the client.\n\n472\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.720\nAnd then my account later logged\ninto this machine as well.\n\n473\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.830\nAnd we can see the reflection of that too.\n\n474\n00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.060\nSo I can also see the people\nthat have been logging in and\n\n475\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.962\nusing this machine too.\n\n476\n00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:27.300\nAnd then you can see manufacturer as well,\nand\n\n477\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.040\nyou can see that we're running\na virtual machine on this one.\n\n478\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.090\nNow we can go even farther, all right.\n\n479\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.170\nSo it tells me what's required, right.\n\n480\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:42.950\nBut it's not telling me at least\nright here why this isn't complying.\n\n481\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.670\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n482\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.152\nIf we expand this out here,\nI'm gonna get a little more information.\n\n483\n00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:54.925\nAll right, I'm gonna see the drive\nletter that's in question,\n\n484\n00:25:54.925 --> 00:25:59.300\ncuz remember, we only enforce\nthis on operating system drives.\n\n485\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.520\nI'm gonna see the password, and I'm\ngonna see why it isn't compliant, right?\n\n486\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.050\nLook at the encryption statement.\n\n487\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.970\nIt says encrypting, so it's in\nthe process of doing the encryption.\n\n488\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.320\nNow if I seen one that said postponed,\nright.\n\n489\n00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.300\nWe've got a policy that says within four\ndays you're gonna have to encrypt your\n\n490\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:18.810\ndrive.\n\n491\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.190\nWell I can see here that the user\npostponed the encryption so\n\n492\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.590\nwe can see that as well,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n493\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.250\nNow compliance status details.\n\n494\n00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.270\nWe haven't run any errors, so we know\nthis is just a computer that hasn't\n\n495\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.750\nfinished its encryption process.\n\n496\n00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.680\nNow let me go ahead real quick and\n\n497\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.360\nI'm gonna copy this cuz I really\nwanna show you guys the individual.\n\n498\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.000\nI go back to ENUS there.\n\n499\n00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.090\nAnd we'll get back to our main page and\ndo a computer compliance report.\n\n500\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.860\nAll right, I'm gonna change this up a bit.\n\n501\n00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:56.480\nI know I did 03,\nlet's do 02 there, Win10Client02.\n\n502\n00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.989\nAnd let's see about\nrunning a report on 02.\n\n503\n00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.560\nAnd this will generate our\ncomputer compliance report.\n\n504\n00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.869\nWait for it.\n\n505\n00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:09.840\n[LAUGH] And there again.\n\n506\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.230\nSo here's another machine, all right,\nand I can see that it's non-compliant.\n\n507\n00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.110\nI could see all the information\nwe just looked at,\n\n508\n00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.096\nbut I wanna know exactly\nwhy it's non-compliant.\n\n509\n00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:24.460\nAll right, we'll let it go ahead and\nexpand that information out.\n\n510\n00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.010\nAnd you can see, I can see right here\nthe same thing that says the encryptions\n\n511\n00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.920\nstate, that these devices are in the\nprocess of still encrypting their drives.\n\n512\n00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.570\nThey haven't been postponed, but\nthe encryption process isn't finished.\n\n513\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.830\nOnce the encryption process is finished,\nthey will report back and\n\n514\n00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.285\nyou will see that their compliance\nstatus is going to change.\n\n515\n00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:54.205\nNow that is a lot,\npretty much about the report side.\n\n516\n00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:56.045\nYou can also do a Recovery Audit Report.\n\n517\n00:27:56.045 --> 00:27:59.195\nWe haven't done a recovery, so\nthere's really nothing to report yet.\n\n518\n00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:01.205\nBut if we wanted to, we can do that.\n\n519\n00:28:02.395 --> 00:28:05.475\nNow the next thing that we can do,\nhow about this?\n\n520\n00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:10.429\nHow about we have a machine\nthat is locked out?\n\n521\n00:28:10.429 --> 00:28:12.067\nIn fact give me a second here guys,\n\n522\n00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.393\nI'm gonna go ahead kinda\ngo off the beaten path.\n\n523\n00:28:14.393 --> 00:28:16.798\nI know I do have a machine\nthat is encrypted,\n\n524\n00:28:16.798 --> 00:28:20.640\nit's finishing its encryption process but\nthe end user experience.\n\n525\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.684\nWhat is the end user experience?\n\n526\n00:28:21.684 --> 00:28:25.770\nThey get here and\nthen they don't know their password.\n\n527\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.160\nSo like you would see in the decentralized\nmodel that Dan was talking about earlier.\n\n528\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.800\nDan receives a phone call and says,\n\n529\n00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.490\nokay, let's figure out where we've\nsaved the BitLocker recovery key.\n\n530\n00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.180\nWell, I don't have my recovery key.\n\n531\n00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.499\nSo I enter into BitLocker recovery,\n\n532\n00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:48.219\nand the problem is it says\nenter in the recovery key.\n\n533\n00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:51.432\nWell I'm sorry the recovery keys were\nstored on a server whose hard drive is\n\n534\n00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:54.560\ncompletely corrupted and\nwe can't gain access to it.\n\n535\n00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.740\nWell in that decentralized model,\nit's time to format the drive,\n\n536\n00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.820\nunfortunately, you don't\nhave a way around it.\n\n537\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.890\nBut if you have MBAM,\nyou can do key recovery, and\n\n538\n00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.170\nthat's what we wanna do here.\n\n539\n00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.270\nLet me just double check.\n\n540\n00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.000\nSee, remember what the Advanced Helpdesk\nrole, what they had to do, right?\n\n541\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.190\nThey had to take the first,\nsee if we can get into here so\n\n542\n00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.380\nyou guys can see it, all right.\n\n543\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.490\nThat key ID,\n\n544\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:22.840\nthose first eight digits of that key ID is\nwhat the Advanced Helpdesk group needs.\n\n545\n00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.030\nThat's what somebody's gonna call.\n\n546\n00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.431\nThey're gonna call up Dan,\nthey're gonna say, hey, here's the eight.\n\n547\n00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.484\nOr Dan's gonna probably call them up and\nsay, hey,\n\n548\n00:29:28.484 --> 00:29:31.722\nwhat's the first eight digits that\nyou see on your machine right now?\n\n549\n00:29:31.722 --> 00:29:36.280\nWe're gonna take that information,\nwe're gonna bump up over here to our\n\n550\n00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.000\nDrive Recovery section, and\nI might say, user's domain is NJO.\n\n551\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.300\nThe user ID, I'm not gonna put\nin any user ID cuz, again,\n\n552\n00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.910\nwe don't have to in\nthe Advanced Helpdesk group.\n\n553\n00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.720\nGo ahead and type these digits in here.\n\n554\n00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.440\nThat's six, it looks like it's\nsaving it too, which is good.\n\n555\n00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.016\nAnd it's saving my errors,\nwhich is even more fun.\n\n556\n00:29:57.016 --> 00:30:02.650\n[LAUGH] It saves how many\ntimes I typed it in wrong.\n\n557\n00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.840\nNow, we might ask what was the reason\nwe're going for the recovery?\n\n558\n00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.900\nYou wanna pick one of these, Dan?\n\n559\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.810\nCan you see these out here?\n\n560\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.682\nWhich one?\nWhat do you think might be?\n\n561\n00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:18.130\n>> Let's see here, I'm gonna go with\nsomething about the password, I'm sure.\n\n562\n00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.700\n>> Okay, so we'll say a Lost Startup Key,\nall right, and then we'll choose Submit.\n\n563\n00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.590\nIt's gonna contact the database,\nall right, and\n\n564\n00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.910\nwe'll give it a second here cuz\nremember that a, we're gonna,\n\n565\n00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.420\nbasically, here's your 48\ndigit recovery key, right?\n\n566\n00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:40.310\nI can save the whole, remember how we set\nup Active Directory, key package and all.\n\n567\n00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.640\nSave the package, if I need to.\n\n568\n00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.140\nSo I can copy this information now.\n\n569\n00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.320\nLet me go ahead and allow access here.\n\n570\n00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.516\nI can copy this information and\ncome back here to our machine.\n\n571\n00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:55.197\nAnd there's no way, I'll tell you what.\n\n572\n00:30:55.197 --> 00:30:58.811\nI don't know if I want to copy this down,\nit'll take awhile, but\n\n573\n00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:01.742\nI could turn around and\nI could take that drive here.\n\n574\n00:31:01.742 --> 00:31:05.812\nLet me tell you what, I'm gonna go ahead\nand I'm gonna write this down here.\n\n575\n00:31:05.812 --> 00:31:09.425\nAnd we can take that information and\nturn around,\n\n576\n00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:14.767\neither give it to the person that we\nwant to implement it into the machine.\n\n577\n00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:17.044\nOr maybe you've got a policy that says,\nyou know what,\n\n578\n00:31:17.044 --> 00:31:20.372\nyeah we're not gonna give this information\nto somebody who's already lost it.\n\n579\n00:31:20.372 --> 00:31:24.740\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe will put this information in ourselves.\n\n580\n00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:31.490\nAll right and we've saved you the burden\nof watching me type a 48 digit password,\n\n581\n00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.980\nyou can see that I had a problem\nwith eight digit passwords.\n\n582\n00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.484\nAnd we take a look at the administration\nand monitoring side here remember that's\n\n583\n00:31:37.484 --> 00:31:40.598\nthat drive recovery key, that's\nthe 48 digit key that we would need.\n\n584\n00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:44.075\nAnd we've gone ahead and\nwe've entered it into our machine here and\n\n585\n00:31:44.075 --> 00:31:48.528\nwe're gonna go ahead and hit Enter, and as\nyou can see we've now recovered the drive,\n\n586\n00:31:48.528 --> 00:31:49.641\nwe've unlocked it.\n\n587\n00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:52.833\nAnd hopefully we'll be\nable to log in here so\n\n588\n00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:58.030\nBitLocker recovery through MBAM once\nit's set up as relatively easy.\n\n589\n00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.010\nNow I do have to make mention, I gotta\ngive Dan some props here in the background\n\n590\n00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.920\nwe were talking about how would I get\nthis information over to an end user.\n\n591\n00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.160\nDan, you mentioned, how would you do it?\n\n592\n00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.100\nIn encrypted email?\n\n593\n00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.630\n>> Well, yeah,\nsometimes we could do that, just use\n\n594\n00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.540\nlike a PGP system to actually encrypt\nthe file and then email it to them.\n\n595\n00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.502\nThat way you know it's secure until it\ngets to them, and they can unencrypt it.\n\n596\n00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:20.963\nOf course, you wouldn't send it\nto their email, because well,\n\n597\n00:32:20.963 --> 00:32:22.590\nthey're not able to access that.\n\n598\n00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.380\nYou could send it to\nsomebody else in the office.\n\n599\n00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.820\nWe send it to web mail accounts.\n\n600\n00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.580\nA lot of people have a personal\naccount and a business account, so\n\n601\n00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.550\nwe would use that system\nthat's already put in place.\n\n602\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.880\nIt's just the easy way to do it.\n\n603\n00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.010\nOtherwise you're just\nreading it over the phone and\n\n604\n00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.775\nit's highly unlikely\nsomebody's wire tapped you.\n\n605\n00:32:37.775 --> 00:32:40.030\n[LAUGH] That is,\nthere's another recovery key.\n\n606\n00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.750\nLet's snatch that out of the air.\n\n607\n00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.200\nSo we would just read it and have them\nwrite it down so they could type it in.\n\n608\n00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.210\nChances are they'll probably\nhave to type it in again,\n\n609\n00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:51.600\nat least that was in my experience a lot\nof times the condition that caused\n\n610\n00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.260\nthe bitlocker system to engage.\n\n611\n00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.260\nUsually still had some remnants around, so\n\n612\n00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.820\nif they restarted their computer\nthey would have to type it in again.\n\n613\n00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.180\nSo I would say, listen, write this\ndown because you're gonna have to do\n\n614\n00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.980\nit again and\nI'm just gonna have to read it.\n\n615\n00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.720\nAnd as we've seen, it's quite lengthy.\n\n616\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.280\nSo just be prepared with that.\n\n617\n00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.320\nIt's probably the most difficult portion\nof working with M Band is actually\n\n618\n00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.970\ngiving the user the key itself and\nhaving them type it in correctly.\n\n619\n00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.590\nAnd them not being tech savvy and\ngetting passed that.\n\n620\n00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.240\nBut once they do, you're back in\naction and you're off to the races.\n\n621\n00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.540\nSo this is definitely a great function for\nyour help desk.\n\n622\n00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.518\nIf you can enable your help\ndesk to be able to do this,\n\n623\n00:33:31.518 --> 00:33:34.839\nkeeps your upper level text\nthat are working on servers and\n\n624\n00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:38.455\nwhatnot busy doing that, and\nnot finding MBAM recovery keys.\n\n625\n00:33:38.455 --> 00:33:42.300\n>> Definitely, so keep that in mind,\nimportant information and if Dan said it,\n\n626\n00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.352\nif they've tapping your phones,\nMBAM's not gonna help up.\n\n627\n00:33:45.352 --> 00:33:46.323\n>> Yeah, you've got bigger fish to fry.\n\n628\n00:33:46.323 --> 00:33:48.572\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you've gotta do some security\n\n629\n00:33:48.572 --> 00:33:52.992\nvulnerability assessment here, but\nif we take a look at our machine here,\n\n630\n00:33:52.992 --> 00:33:57.120\nyou can see our Win10 client, client one\n>> We're back in, we're up and\n\n631\n00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.870\nrunning now and hopefully we've got\na little bit more productivity.\n\n632\n00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.660\nAnd your end users out there can go\nback to playing their Minesweeper and\n\n633\n00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.000\ntheir Solitaire and\nget to doing their job.\n\n634\n00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.750\nYou can see it's a handy platform and\n\n635\n00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.252\nonce it's setup I really think\nthat it can come in handy.\n\n636\n00:34:12.252 --> 00:34:13.260\n>> All right well Wes,\n\n637\n00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.490\nthanks so much for showing us\nhow to actually use this system.\n\n638\n00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.140\nWe've gone through quite a few stages,\ninstallation, pre-installation, and\n\n639\n00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.660\nnow we're actually implementing it and\n\n640\n00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.360\nseeing how it can benefit us in\nour real-world environments.\n\n641\n00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.250\nSo we do appreciate you for\nstopping by and doing out for us.\n\n642\n00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.520\n>> Absolutely.\n>> We thank you guys for\n\n643\n00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.790\nwatching this as well.\n\n644\n00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.430\n>> Hopefully you enjoyed this episode.\n\n645\n00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.900\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n646\n00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.430\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n647\n00:34:36.430 -->

TV,\n\n3\n00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:20.143\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and on\ntoday's episode we are continuing on our\n\n4\n00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:23.090\nseries on\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n5\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.840\nJoining us to help us out with a little\nbit of that today, coming back for\n\n6\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.310\na little more of that MDOP action,\nis our good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.090\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.640\n>> It's going great as always, Dan.\n\n9\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.940\nGood to be here in the studios with\nITPRO TV and that's right, and\n\n10\n00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.330\ntoday we're coming at\nyou with a tool that is,\n\n11\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.240\nactually it's a suite of tools that\nare really cool when it comes to\n\n12\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.790\nmaintaining the availability\nof your systems.\n\n13\n00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.670\nAnd we're talking about something\nknown as the diagnostic and\n\n14\n00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.050\nrecovery tool set that is\npart of the MDOP series.\n\n15\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.620\nAnd if you haven't seen this utility,\nand again,\n\n16\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.700\nI say utility with a suite of utilities,\nit really is a good thing\n\n17\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.890\nto understand, especially if you're in\nsome kind of certification endeavor.\n\n18\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.010\nAnd they ask you questions, and I'm not\nsure if they will, you'll be prepared.\n\n19\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.720\nSo, let's go ahead and dive right into,\n\n20\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500\nlook at some of the prerequisites, talk\na little bit about what the diagnostic and\n\n21\n00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.750\nrecovery toolkit is and\nthen showing you how to set it up.\n\n22\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.210\nWell the diagnostic and recovery toolkit\nis series of utilities that if you\n\n23\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.710\nhave a computer that isn't working or\nwon't start up, well what do you do?\n\n24\n00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.600\nA lot of times, you try to fix it for\nabout what, five, ten minutes and\n\n25\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.150\nthen it's time to re-image it.\n\n26\n00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.090\nBut what happens if you\nhappen to have data on that\n\n27\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.980\nhard drive that's on that machine and\nit won't boot up?\n\n28\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.380\nWill you be able to get access to it?\n\n29\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.760\nWill you be able to get\nthat information off of it?\n\n30\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.790\nWhat if it's a computer and\nit's got sensitive information on it,\n\n31\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.550\nmaybe you don't wanna\nretrieve the information.\n\n32\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.760\nYou certainly don't want anybody\nelse retrieving the information.\n\n33\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.860\nWould you have the ability\nto wipe that information?\n\n34\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.730\nAnd that's some of the things\nwe can do inside of MDOP.\n\n35\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.190\nLet's go ahead, I've got a couple of\nwebsites here, we gotta talk about some\n\n36\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.030\nsupported configurations, so some of\nthe prerequisites to getting started with\n\n37\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.760\nthe diagnostic and recovery tool kit,\nor tool set, excuse me.\n\n38\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.890\nA couple of the things that\nyou really have to know and\n\n39\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.900\nhave available is the Windows ADK.\n\n40\n00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.355\nThat's the assessment and\ndeployment toolkit.\n\n41\n00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:25.235\nWith this one, it replaced, some of you\nmaybe come from the Windows 7 days,\n\n42\n00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:30.235\nand maybe unfortunately from the Windows\nVista days too, when their deployment kits\n\n43\n00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:33.525\nwere called WAIK,\nthe Windows Automated Installation Kit.\n\n44\n00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:36.370\nWell the ADK is the replacement,\n\n45\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.400\nit's the successor to that and\nyou're gonna need that.\n\n46\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.540\nNow I will say something to keep in mind\nis that the current version of the ADK\n\n47\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.930\nthat's out, the one specifically that\nsupports the Windows 10 build or\n\n48\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.610\nversion if you will, 1511, it does\nhave some problems with it right now.\n\n49\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.756\nSo be careful,\nI would not download that one.\n\n50\n00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:04.630\nLet me be a little bit more specific\non the version number of that one,\n\n51\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.600\nthat's Windows ADK 10.1.10586.\n\n52\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.994\nAnd again that one was released for this\nnewest 1511 build that they have out and\n\n53\n00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:14.520\nit's causing problems.\n\n54\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.880\nSo I do have some places that\nyou can go and get the stand\n\n55\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.200\nalone previous version, really straight\nfrom the Microsoft download center.\n\n56\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.610\nTech net doesn't really have a lot of\ndocumentation at all on this error.\n\n57\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.330\nIn fact you'll see some people\nposting errors with no solutions.\n\n58\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.950\nOne of the things that you can do, I've\nactually got a website here that they talk\n\n59\n00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.110\nabout somethings that you should\nconsider when deploying the DaRT image,\n\n60\n00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.700\nif you're using something like\nsystem center configuration manager,\n\n61\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.840\nin this instance but it does give us\nthe ability to directly download.\n\n62\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.560\nLike I said you can also go to\nthe Microsoft download center.\n\n63\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.410\nOne of the things too that\nI would also keep in mind,\n\n64\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.390\nlet's see does it have it here?\n\n65\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.820\nThey even have in their Tech Net social\nblog, let me go ahead and pull up this\n\n66\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.500\nnext website here and show you that\nthey mention time stamps on these.\n\n67\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.700\nGet down to that other link there\nreal quick, issues, there we go.\n\n68\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.010\nAnd this is on Tech Net's website.\n\n69\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.390\nNow, understand, this is from a system\ncenter configuration manager team,\n\n70\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.020\nthey're talking about deployment\nin system center, but\n\n71\n00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.970\nI still have seen standalone deployments,\nhas nothing to do with system center.\n\n72\n00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.500\nWhen you start to try to create what's\nknown as a recovery image, the CAB file,\n\n73\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.480\nthere's an error, it says it's not\napplicable, I can't even say that.\n\n74\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.770\nIt doesn't apply to this image and\nit stops.\n\n75\n00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.100\nSo they tell you which ones right here,\n\n76\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.760\nhere's those version numbers\nI was telling you about.\n\n77\n00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.735\nThis is the RTM, the release to market,\nthis is the version number that you want,\n\n78\n00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.685\nmake sure that you\ninstall the Windows ADK.\n\n79\n00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:56.325\nDo not install that 10.1.10586 at least\nat this point at the time of the taping\n\n80\n00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.355\nof this episode, because there are some\nbugs in it and it won't allow you to do\n\n81\n00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:04.905\nsome of the things that we're about to\ndo today in this series or this episode.\n\n82\n00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.220\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n83\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.210\nAll right now, next thing that were we\nwill look at here are again is some\n\n84\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.535\nof the other things that your\ngonna need for your DaRT image and\n\n85\n00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:19.297\na diagnostics and a recovery tool set.\n\n86\n00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:24.068\nYou’re gonna need the SDK,\nthe Software Development Kit.\n\n87\n00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:29.250\nNow with the software and\ndevelopment kit one of the things\n\n88\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.007\nI want you to remember about that,\nif you plan on using\n\n89\n00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:38.998\nthe Crash Analyzer,\nit requires the debugging tools.\n\n90\n00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:42.126\nThe debugging tools allow it\nto analyze dump files, so\n\n91\n00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:46.478\nif you are gonna use the Crash Analyzer,\nwhich we definitely want to show you\n\n92\n00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:51.400\nin this episode so you're aware of what\nit does, it's a really cool utility.\n\n93\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.780\nMake sure that you download the SDK and\nhave those debugging tools in there.\n\n94\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.040\nNow the other thing that you're going to\nneed, if you were going to be deploying\n\n95\n00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.740\nsomething known as a recovery image\nyou're gonna need your Windows 10 ISO.\n\n96\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.990\nIt needs a valid install whim\nin order to make this image.\n\n97\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.740\nIt takes the boot.whim file out there,\nthe Windows PE if you will,\n\n98\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.350\nthe pre-installation environment and\nall of it's tools and\n\n99\n00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.480\nthat's how it makes it's bootable\nmedia that you'll see coming up.\n\n100\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.850\nSo keep in mind those three\nthings are definitely needed.\n\n101\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.658\nThe Windows ADK, pay attention\nto which edition you're getting.\n\n102\n00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:36.611\nAs a recap, remember,\nyou want to be downloading 10.0.26624.\n\n103\n00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:37.656\nI know that's a lot of numbers there.\n\n104\n00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:43.258\nAnd the time, the digital timestamp on it,\nshould be Saturday, July 11th, 2015,\n\n105\n00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:48.210\nthat might help you find that one a little\nbit more, save you a lot of headache.\n\n106\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.200\nSome of the other documentation\nthat's out there,\n\n107\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.820\ngetting started, you know some\nof the things that you need to\n\n108\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.510\nknow about how to get started with\nthe diagnostic and recovery tool kit.\n\n109\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.430\nA lot of good information out there.\n\n110\n00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.040\nGives you an overview of some of\nthe utilities that we're gonna look at so\n\n111\n00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.570\nthat you can be aware of what's in it.\n\n112\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.230\nNow when you're making your image, there\nare a couple, let's switch over to our\n\n113\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.770\nmachines, there are a couple of things\nthat you do have to keep in mind.\n\n114\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.110\nIf you are going to make a 64-bit image,\n\n115\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.320\nrecovery image, then you are going to need\nto make sure that the operating system\n\n116\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.550\nthat you're working with is a 64-bit\noperating system when creating the image.\n\n117\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.940\nIf you are making a 32-bit\nISO recovery image,\n\n118\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.080\nthen you have to make sure\nthat you have the 32-bit.\n\n119\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.060\nNow, with the 32-bit additions, you as\nfar as Windows goes, a couple more facts\n\n120\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.870\nI'd like to, specifications that you need,\nI'd like to throw at you here.\n\n121\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.566\nYou need at least one gig of RAM and\nthat's really just for\n\n122\n00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:51.109\nthe operating system, it uses about\n500 megs of RAM to run DaRT, so\n\n123\n00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:56.364\nall in all, bare minimum you need 1.5\ngigabytes of RAM on a 32-bit system.\n\n124\n00:07:56.364 --> 00:08:00.271\nDoes bump up a little bit there for\nthe 64-bit systems,\n\n125\n00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.074\nyou will need 2.5 gigs of RAM, again.\n\n126\n00:08:03.074 --> 00:08:05.373\nGuard itself as running in about 500 Megs.\n\n127\n00:08:05.373 --> 00:08:12.120\nSo the two gigs baseline, that is\ngoing to be for your operating system.\n\n128\n00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.370\nNow depending on how you want to deploy\nyour dart image is going to dictate\n\n129\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.170\nwhat kinda media you put it on will\n\n130\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.860\ndictate some of the other\noptions that are required.\n\n131\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.850\nFor instance, if you're gonna be deploying\nthis, let's say with an optical disk,\n\n132\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.594\nthrough a DVD, then that means\nyour machine obviously will have\n\n133\n00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.973\nan optical drive in it and support that.\n\n134\n00:08:33.973 --> 00:08:36.922\nIf you are using a USB thumb drive,\n\n135\n00:08:36.922 --> 00:08:41.617\nthen your BIOS is gonna need\nto support booting to USB.\n\n136\n00:08:41.617 --> 00:08:46.470\nA lot of your systems today by now\nsupport booting to an optical drive.\n\n137\n00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.649\nThat's kind of a thing that we've\nbeen doing for a long time now.\n\n138\n00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:53.404\nMost of them today should\nsupport booting to USB, but\n\n139\n00:08:53.404 --> 00:08:57.333\nyou do have to make sure that\nthe BIOS does support that.\n\n140\n00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:02.524\nSo Dan, a lot of the prerequisite stuff, I\nknow it's a lot of information there, but\n\n141\n00:09:02.524 --> 00:09:07.425\nyou have to know what the specifications\nare before you get started so that dart,\n\n142\n00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:11.710\nwhen you do decide to deploy it,\nyou don't have any issues with that.\n\n143\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.620\nSo what do you say we go ahead and\nwe start working with some dart here.\n\n144\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.770\n>> Yeah, sounds like a good idea.\n\n145\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.220\nYou know, it's a good thing that we do\nmake sure because these things happen.\n\n146\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.441\nI know I've done it a million times.\n\n147\n00:09:20.441 --> 00:09:22.020\nYou guys probably done it as well.\n\n148\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.750\nYou're just, I'm gonna download this\nlovely tool that Microsoft gives to me.\n\n149\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.610\nI'll double click that.\n\n150\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.738\nWhat's going on here?\n\n151\n00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:31.410\nAnd then the stumbling stones start\ngetting in your way, and you're, okay,\n\n152\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.068\nwell I'll jump that hurdle,\nand I'll jump that hurdle.\n\n153\n00:09:34.068 --> 00:09:36.300\nThe next thing you know, you're five\nhurdles down the road and you're,\n\n154\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.420\nI just gave up on this.\n\n155\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.698\nSo we do thank Mr. West for\nshowing us hey, lets go ahead and\n\n156\n00:09:40.698 --> 00:09:44.910\nclear those hurdles out of the way so\nwe can more easily do the installation.\n\n157\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.432\nBut when it comes to the installation,\nonce we have that kind of pre-staged\n\n158\n00:09:48.432 --> 00:09:50.643\nenvironment going on,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n159\n00:09:50.643 --> 00:09:52.118\nJust a standard wizard type installation?\n\n160\n00:09:52.118 --> 00:09:54.010\n>> It really is, Dan.\n\n161\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.740\nSo kind of zooming in here to our computer\nhere you can see that I've got our Windows\n\n162\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.090\nassessment and\ndeployment kit already installed.\n\n163\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.220\nYou guys don't need to wait for\nus to install that.\n\n164\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.910\nNormal install you're gonna need\nthe pre-installation environment and\n\n165\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.830\nthe deployment tools.\n\n166\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.690\nSo you don't need the entire 80K.\n\n167\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.500\nSave yourself a 6.5 gigabyte install.\n\n168\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.420\nYou can back that down\nto about three gigs.\n\n169\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.400\nThat's the overall pre-installation.\n\n170\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.870\nIn fact the pre-installation\nenvironment's only about 200 megs, but\n\n171\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.341\nthe deployment tools that help you\nput that pre-installation environment\n\n172\n00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:28.907\nare considerably larger, so\nabout three gig install.\n\n173\n00:10:28.907 --> 00:10:33.007\nAnd the software development kit, don't\nworry about a versioning number on that.\n\n174\n00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.339\nAs long as you get the SDK for\nWindows 10, you're okay.\n\n175\n00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:37.760\nI haven't seen any problems with that.\n\n176\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.970\nYou can see that version number here, and\n\n177\n00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.680\nif you guys want, pause the video for\na second so you can write that down.\n\n178\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.438\nYou can see that that's\nthe version that I have.\n\n179\n00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:51.701\nThat isn't the current version\nthat's out there, however they do\n\n180\n00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:56.108\nhave a few things that they need to\nkind of work out, some of the bugs and\n\n181\n00:10:56.108 --> 00:11:00.630\nkinks that are in the software to make\nit a viable solution for us today.\n\n182\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.930\nOnce we have that software\ninstalled like we do here,\n\n183\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.798\nthe next thing that we're gonna\nneed to do is go ahead and\n\n184\n00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:15.751\nextract from the Mdop ISO,\nthe dart folder.\n\n185\n00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:16.787\nAnd you'll probably,\n\n186\n00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:20.064\nhopefully you've been watching some\nof the earlier episodes that we had.\n\n187\n00:11:20.064 --> 00:11:21.144\nWe showed you how to do that.\n\n188\n00:11:21.144 --> 00:11:23.407\nIt’s not very difficult here.\n\n189\n00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:28.102\nWe've got MDOP, and\nthen inside of MDOP just remember you have\n\n190\n00:11:28.102 --> 00:11:32.011\nall of your different files and\nfolders if you will.\n\n191\n00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:35.304\nWhat I did, is I just extracted\nthe DaRT folder out of there,\n\n192\n00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:38.726\nkind of like we did in the MBAM\nseries where we just pulled MBAM to\n\n193\n00:11:38.726 --> 00:11:42.108\nthe desktop and inside of that\nfolder it has your installers.\n\n194\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:43.260\nWell, this is no different.\n\n195\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.730\nYou can see down here, and\nI should mention this too.\n\n196\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.770\nMaybe you're not,\n\n197\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:53.300\ncuz we're note really focused on\nreally any specific operating system.\n\n198\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.830\nWe just happen to be\nusing Windows 10 here.\n\n199\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.107\nWell because it's you know,\nit's the newest latest and greatest that\n\n200\n00:11:58.107 --> 00:12:01.890\nWindows Microsoft has to offer for\nWindows so that's why we're doing Dart 10.\n\n201\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.877\nHowever I will tell you the numbers\nin there you have Dart 8.1,\n\n202\n00:12:05.877 --> 00:12:09.007\nyou have Dart 8 and\nI'm not sure about Windows 7.\n\n203\n00:12:09.007 --> 00:12:13.660\nThere are some things Dart does support\nWindows 7 but just check on some of\n\n204\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.500\nthe specifications, because I know\nWindows 7 is still really popular.\n\n205\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.460\nIt's a great operating system honestly and\nI know it's really popular out there.\n\n206\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.412\nSo if you are just do your research on\nthe Windows 7 DaRT recovery images.\n\n207\n00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:31.008\nAll right so once we have that,\nwe'll look in here.\n\n208\n00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:36.620\nNow I will tell you this is a kernel dump,\nthat is not in the original folder.\n\n209\n00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.155\nThat's something that I put there cuz\nwe're gonna be showing you the magic\n\n210\n00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:42.578\nthat is known as Crash Analyzer\na little bit later.\n\n211\n00:12:42.578 --> 00:12:45.220\nSo I needed a memory dump to do that.\n\n212\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.576\nBut what we want,\ndocumentation is great, right.\n\n213\n00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:52.132\nYou have your read documentation which is\nreally cool and all of these folders for\n\n214\n00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:55.080\nthe entire m dot collection\nhave the read me files and\n\n215\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.698\nthey basically point you out to\nsome of the locations that we've\n\n216\n00:12:58.698 --> 00:13:01.850\nalready showed you throughout\nthis series to Tech Net.\n\n217\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.835\nThen we're going to go\ninto the installers now.\n\n218\n00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:07.246\nIt’s interesting, notice that in\nthe installers here, we're looking for\n\n219\n00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:08.880\na language right, a language pack.\n\n220\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.490\nAnd depending on where you are, I know\nwe have viewers all around the world.\n\n221\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.759\nSo whatever the language is to your native\ncountry or your native tongue, what you're\n\n222\n00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.743\nsupporting inside of your enterprise will\nbe the language that you choose here.\n\n223\n00:13:20.743 --> 00:13:23.750\nHere in the states, we're using the en-us.\n\n224\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.920\nAnd then it comes up to architecture.\n\n225\n00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.157\nAll right, be careful with the\narchitecture, because just like you know,\n\n226\n00:13:29.157 --> 00:13:32.496\nanything that we talk about in computing\nright, I can't take and say hey Dan,\n\n227\n00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:33.980\nI've got a 64 bit application.\n\n228\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.360\nI'd like you to put that\non your 32 bit machine.\n\n229\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.627\nDan will look at me and say you've\ngot two heads, it's not gonna work.\n\n230\n00:13:39.627 --> 00:13:42.126\nWell, here this is no different right.\n\n231\n00:13:42.126 --> 00:13:44.420\nSo I'm on a 64 bit platform.\n\n232\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.893\nChances are I'm gonna choose\nthe 64 bit folder here.\n\n233\n00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:50.091\nAll right this is just\na typical MSI file and\n\n234\n00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:52.240\nwe're just gonna drag it to the desk top.\n\n235\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.628\nCould I launch it from here?\n\n236\n00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:57.640\nYes I could but you know the icon a little\nbit easier for you guys to see out there.\n\n237\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.196\nI could if I wanted to.\n\n238\n00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:04.070\nWe could launch up a command prompt.\n\n239\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:10.900\nAnd we could use the good old MSI Exe if\nwe wanted with the forward slash I switch.\n\n240\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.290\nAnd then any of the options for\nwhat we're actually going to install which\n\n241\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.030\nutilities are we gonna install and\nhave ready and available for dark.\n\n242\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.304\nHowever, we can put\nthat in the show notes.\n\n243\n00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:24.620\nI do have that written down here.\n\n244\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.434\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nI'm going to go the lazy route here Dan.\n\n245\n00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.670\nI'm going to use graphical interface.\n\n246\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.304\n>> The way most everybody does it.\n\n247\n00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:32.810\n>> That's right.\n\n248\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.409\nI know your command line guru too.\n\n249\n00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.813\nThat's why I say the lazy man's way.\n\n250\n00:14:38.813 --> 00:14:43.372\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nsetup, not too bad, right?\n\n251\n00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:46.367\nI mean, it is a point and\nclick wizard, very easy.\n\n252\n00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:48.689\nIt tells you, EULA.\n\n253\n00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:52.033\nWe've gone through a lot\nof those in this series, so\n\n254\n00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:55.008\ndefinitely agree to your end-user license.\n\n255\n00:14:55.008 --> 00:14:57.779\nAll right first couple of things.\n\n256\n00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:00.225\nTypically, like all these other\ninstallers that we're looking at,\n\n257\n00:15:00.225 --> 00:15:01.517\nit's going to be Microsoft Update.\n\n258\n00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:05.549\nA lot of times it's going to be the\ncustomer experience improvement program\n\n259\n00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:06.560\nthere, the CEIP.\n\n260\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.995\nI'm just gonna say,\nno I don't want to use Microsoft Update.\n\n261\n00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:13.480\nHowever, I would tell you it\nis a good idea to use that.\n\n262\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.648\nWhere is it going to be installed?\n\n263\n00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.850\nYou can browse if you want.\n\n264\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.993\nYou can also look at the disk\nspace that you have,\n\n265\n00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:21.781\njust depending if you have\nmultiple disks within your system.\n\n266\n00:15:21.781 --> 00:15:25.130\nWe're just gonna go ahead and\nkeep the defaults.\n\n267\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.690\nNow here's where you have to\nmake a choice as to what do\n\n268\n00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.150\nyou want to install on the machine.\n\n269\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.472\nNotice that we have three options here.\n\n270\n00:15:34.472 --> 00:15:38.377\nAnd if you guys have seen some of these\ntypical Windows installer packages,\n\n271\n00:15:38.377 --> 00:15:41.240\nit's no different than\nlike an Office install.\n\n272\n00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.512\nIf you right click on it,\n\n273\n00:15:42.512 --> 00:15:45.435\nthe entire feature will be\ninstalled on the local drive.\n\n274\n00:15:45.435 --> 00:15:50.252\nHowever, you do want to make, just stop\nfor a second on the crash analyzer,\n\n275\n00:15:50.252 --> 00:15:54.016\nand keep in mind that if you want\nto use the crash analyzer and\n\n276\n00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:58.310\nyou don't have the ADK and\nyou don't have the software development\n\n277\n00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.128\nkit A crash analyzer is\ngonna do you no good.\n\n278\n00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:05.316\nSo that's one of the reasons we went ahead\nand let you know beforehand to install\n\n279\n00:16:05.316 --> 00:16:09.740\nthose and that we already have\ninstalled those, so it'll be available.\n\n280\n00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.950\nThe DaRT Recovery Image,\nthis is what we're going to deploy out.\n\n281\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.670\nMaybe we have a WDS server on our network,\nright.\n\n282\n00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.490\nWe're deploying images,\noperating systems out.\n\n283\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.700\nWell, one of the great things is,\nas you'll see when we get to it here,\n\n284\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.930\nwhen we create a recovery image,\nit gives us three outputs.\n\n285\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:32.060\nIt gives us a standard ISO format, which\nis, you guys have seen those ISO formats.\n\n286\n00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.870\nIt's how we're using a lot of\nour software here in our shows.\n\n287\n00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.010\nBut it also gives you a WIM file,\nwhich is really good.\n\n288\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.750\nIf you don't know what a WIM file is,\nthat's the Windows Image Format.\n\n289\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.370\nIt's a container and it contains the DaRT\nimage, which really is a boot.wim.\n\n290\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.030\nMaybe some of you guys out there\nare familiar with the Windows Deployment\n\n291\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.825\nService, and you have to boot your machine\nto be able to pick an operating system.\n\n292\n00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:57.910\nWell one of the good things about this\nis you can put the DaRT boot image,\n\n293\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.150\nup there, just next to your normal boot\nimages to start your deployment process.\n\n294\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.470\nAnd instead of picking\nan operating system,\n\n295\n00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.610\nthey can pull down the DaRT image and\nyou can pull it right down to a hard drive\n\n296\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.575\nthat already has an operating\nsystem on it and\n\n297\n00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:13.895\nyou can use it in the field without\never having to have any media on you.\n\n298\n00:17:13.895 --> 00:17:17.285\nYou just do your PXE boot, you pick\nthe DaRT boot image, it comes down,\n\n299\n00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:18.355\nit loads into RAM.\n\n300\n00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:22.707\nAnd now, you have all of the DaRT\nutilities available on your system without\n\n301\n00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:25.299\nhaving to worry about\nwhere did I put the ISO?\n\n302\n00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:26.901\nDo I have a USB thumb drive?\n\n303\n00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:30.050\nSo really good at an enterprise\nlevel environment.\n\n304\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.720\nAnd this is a really cool feature, this\nis the DaRT Remote Connection Viewer, and\n\n305\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.050\nwe're gonna actually demonstrate this too.\n\n306\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.560\nThis allows the ability,\ncan you imagine booting to a machine,\n\n307\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.220\nyou schedule a deployment to a DaRT\nmachine, right, but now what can you do?\n\n308\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.034\nDan's in a different location,\nhe scheduled the deployment,\n\n309\n00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:52.152\nthe machine that's in\ntrouble is booted up to DaRT.\n\n310\n00:17:52.152 --> 00:17:55.250\nBut what can we do with it if\nhe's not in the same location?\n\n311\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.870\nWell one of the things that he can do is\nhave somebody click on the DaRT image,\n\n312\n00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.900\nthat is now on the local machine,\nand fire up a remote connection, and\n\n313\n00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.240\nDan can remotely connect\nto the DaRT utility.\n\n314\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.890\nEven though it's running in RAM,\nand that's real cool,\n\n315\n00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.200\nwe're gonna show you that too.\n\n316\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.430\nI really like this program.\n\n317\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.076\nI've actually deployed it in\nanother company that we work for,\n\n318\n00:18:15.076 --> 00:18:17.528\nit was Windows 8 but\nthe principle's still the same here.\n\n319\n00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:19.290\nAll right.\n\n320\n00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.350\nAnd we'll finish the install,\nas always with a lot of these utilities\n\n321\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.770\nit does require administrative\nlevel privileges.\n\n322\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.987\nAnd it really didn't look like much,\nright, the install?\n\n323\n00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:30.485\n>> Pretty straight forward.\n\n324\n00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.415\n>> Yeah, you know,\n\n325\n00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:35.450\nonce you have the software ready to go\nthat's really the hard part behind it.\n\n326\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.570\nAnd as you guys probably know that's\nreally the hard part around a lot of these\n\n327\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.630\nutilities that we use.\n\n328\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.730\nSo, what do we have?\n\n329\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.100\nI mean, well,\ndoesn't look like much, right.\n\n330\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.200\nSo we're go gonna down\nto our All Apps menu and\n\n331\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.340\nif we scroll down a little bit here,\nyou're gonna see in the list\n\n332\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.050\nthat we now have our Microsoft DaRT\n10 there, all right.\n\n333\n00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.240\nWe have our Crash Analyzer,\nwe have our Recovery Image and\n\n334\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.770\nwe have our Remote Connection.\n\n335\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.619\nNow let's go ahead, and let's show you\na little about the DaRT Recovery Image,\n\n336\n00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:08.919\nbecause that's gonna be important.\n\n337\n00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:12.682\nNow, all I did there, guys,\nis just click on that DaRT Recovery Image,\n\n338\n00:19:12.682 --> 00:19:16.570\nand it's gonna bring up, imagine this,\nanother point and click wizard,\n\n339\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.160\na very straightforward process.\n\n340\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.920\nDepends on what you're doing\nat the time and, in fact,\n\n341\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.620\nI can kind of show you ahead of\ntime where this is gonna go.\n\n342\n00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.829\nWhat we want to do is we want to create,\nessentially, these three items, right.\n\n343\n00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:36.090\nThis will be the end result here\nour DaRT ISO is created here,\n\n344\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.690\nour boot.wim, if we're gonna deploy it,\n\n345\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.590\nand then the third one that I didn't\nmention was a power shell script too.\n\n346\n00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.890\nSo if you're using, it gives the ability\ninstantly to integrate that into a power\n\n347\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.940\nshell script, if you need to,\nand you'll have that available.\n\n348\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.749\n>> Really quickly, Wes.\n\n349\n00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:53.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> On the DaRT 10 image itself,\n\n350\n00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.980\nI mean, obviously we're seeing that,\nwhen I'm thinking of,\n\n351\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.120\nI'm booting to an image, usually it's\ngot an operating system on it, and\n\n352\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.130\nmaybe I've taken like a snapshot or\nan image of a machine itself.\n\n353\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.010\nIs that what we're talking about here?\n\n354\n00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.830\nJust to try to be clear, is it,\nam I taking an image of this machine so\n\n355\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.670\nthat I can redeploying it later and\nsmoke this away,\n\n356\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.240\nor is it like its own set\nof tools that I'm loading?\n\n357\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.780\n>> That is a great question.\n\n358\n00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.870\nIt is taking, when we're making an image,\nwhat it's doing is it's gonna look.\n\n359\n00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.340\nIn fact, let me show you.\n\n360\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.640\nThat's a great question.\n\n361\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.240\nAnd let me see if I can\nbe very specific on this.\n\n362\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.100\nAnd let me kinda,\nI'm just kinda clicking around here and\n\n363\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.480\nassuming you guys know what I'm doing.\n\n364\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.330\nSorry about that guys.\n\n365\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:36.965\nLet's go ahead.\n\n366\n00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.902\nI've actually got the Windows 10 ISO,\nit's mounted, so\n\n367\n00:20:39.902 --> 00:20:41.986\nthat's what I'm looking out right here.\n\n368\n00:20:41.986 --> 00:20:46.724\nLet me just let you guys know, I've got\nmy Windows 10 installation media, and\n\n369\n00:20:46.724 --> 00:20:50.903\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna look\ndown into sources here and it is,\n\n370\n00:20:50.903 --> 00:20:55.290\nlet me get that out of the way there,\nwhat it's gonna do is it's looking for\n\n371\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.958\nin your, because it's gonna use some\nof your architecture, it's looking for\n\n372\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.310\nthis right here, this install.wim.\n\n373\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.580\nYou already got an image\nin an installation media.\n\n374\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.120\nAnd that's what it uses to\nput on to the hard drive.\n\n375\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.990\nSo what's it gonna do then is it's gonna\ntake the, actually, it's looking for\n\n376\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.850\narchitecture, but\nthis is your WIM PE disc right here.\n\n377\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.194\nSo, it's going to look at that.\n\n378\n00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:21.130\nIt's gonna take the components that\nit needs out of the preinstallation\n\n379\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.410\nenvironment and some of the information\nbased on your ISO, your Windows 10 ISO,\n\n380\n00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:30.030\nand it's gonna combine\nthat into about 500 or so\n\n381\n00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.380\nand change megabyte\npreinstallation environment.\n\n382\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.681\nWhich includes the DaRT Recovery Tools.\n\n383\n00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.440\nA typical preinstallation environment,\nif you've ever deployed one,\n\n384\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.680\none of the things you'll\nsee it's only about 200 and\n\n385\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.870\nsomething mega, right around there,\n200 megs or so.\n\n386\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.610\nIt's gonna boost it up a little bit.\n\n387\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.200\nIt's gonna boost it just beyond 500\nmegs so you can see it does add\n\n388\n00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.310\nextra utilities and it looks at\nthe architecture and stuff there too.\n\n389\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.920\nSo that's what's going on, but ultimately,\n\n390\n00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.950\nit is what you say it's just\na very ultra-concentrated image.\n\n391\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.684\nIt's not a full blow operating system as\nyou can see the size of this WIM itself is\n\n392\n00:22:04.684 --> 00:22:05.610\n3 gigs right?\n\n393\n00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.487\nSo it isn't going to be 3 gigs,\nit's gonna be more like 500 megs,\n\n394\n00:22:09.487 --> 00:22:14.070\nwhich is another thing to consider when\nyou are deploying DaRT on your WDS server.\n\n395\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.870\nIt could take a little bit longer\nto deploy that image down than\n\n396\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.420\nit typically does the base\npreinstallation environment.\n\n397\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.960\nSo hopefully that answered the question\nand it didn't sidestep it.\n\n398\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.088\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, no, it is, very good point.\n\n399\n00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:27.710\n>> I was gonna say,\nof course this is election time,\n\n400\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.940\nthere's a lot of sidestepping\ngoing on right here.\n\n401\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.280\n[LAUGH] All right, so this is, again,\nthe DaRT Recovery Image Wizard.\n\n402\n00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.160\nIt makes it fairly easy.\n\n403\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.420\nNow it is gonna ask a couple of things.\n\n404\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.320\nI tell you what.\n\n405\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.870\nI could show you exactly\nwhat it's looking for.\n\n406\n00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:42.710\nLet me put a D:.\n\n407\n00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:48.140\nAnd let me sure that that\noptical drive is the D drive.\n\n408\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.730\nYep, okay.\n\n409\n00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.440\nGotta make sure that you point it to\nthe right media or this won't work.\n\n410\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.140\nBut let's say we're gonna point it to,\nI don't know, peanut butter.\n\n411\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.860\nAll right, and we're gonna choose Next.\n\n412\n00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.830\nThe source folder wasn't found, so\nit knows exactly what it's looking for,\n\n413\n00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.300\nwhich is great,\nbecause this is a type of wizard.\n\n414\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.430\nYou can't really get it wrong.\n\n415\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.590\nWell you can get it wrong, but it's not\ngonna let you move forward, so you don't\n\n416\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.940\ncorrupt your image in trying to make it\nand maybe point it to the wrong image.\n\n417\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.280\nSo and that was peanut a butter.\n\n418\n00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.740\nApparently, it's French or\nsomething I don't know.\n\n419\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.322\n>> It's still not correct [LAUGH].\n\n420\n00:23:19.322 --> 00:23:21.110\n>> It's still not correct, that's right.\n\n421\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:27.140\nSo If I chose Sources,\nlet me make sure that I spell that right.\n\n422\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.570\nIt's Sources, yeah, not Source.\n\n423\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.380\nAnd I could choose Sources and\nI choose, Next.,\n\n424\n00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:39.540\none of the things that it says,\nMust Contain a Valid WIM File.\n\n425\n00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.779\nYou say boot.wim so\nI'm just gonna leave it at D and\n\n426\n00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:47.380\nwe will see, does it know where to look?\n\n427\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.690\nSo you can see the boot.wim\nthat it's looking for.\n\n428\n00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.956\nRemember, that's your preinstallation\nenvironment, and it's going to\n\n429\n00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:56.130\nbundle the DaRT utilities inside of\nthat preinstallation environment.\n\n430\n00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.212\nSo now, not only will you have\nthe typical things like System Restore,\n\n431\n00:24:00.212 --> 00:24:03.013\nImage Restoration,\nreset and refresh your PC.\n\n432\n00:24:03.013 --> 00:24:06.402\nMaybe you seen in Windows 8,\n8.1 and Windows 10 recovery images.\n\n433\n00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:11.755\nNow it's going to have, well,\nall of these cool items.\n\n434\n00:24:11.755 --> 00:24:15.660\nAll right, so a lot of cool different\nitems that we can put in there.\n\n435\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.118\nWe can use computer management.\n\n436\n00:24:17.118 --> 00:24:19.880\nYou say, well why would I want\nto use computer management\n\n437\n00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.200\non a machine that won't boot?\n\n438\n00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.430\nWell, there's things like resetting\nshares, there's things like looking at\n\n439\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.120\nthe services that were turned on at\na time that maybe you got a blue screen.\n\n440\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.500\nYou got a blue screen,\nmaybe you need to turn that service off.\n\n441\n00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.740\nIf you think about task scheduling,\ncreating things like that,\n\n442\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.890\nso a lot of good things that you\ncan do with Computer Management,\n\n443\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.440\nyou can see some of\nthe other options here.\n\n444\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.040\nWe got Crash Analyzer,\nwhich we've got to demonstrate.\n\n445\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.010\nThat one's a really cool utility.\n\n446\n00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.540\nAnd you can see again, some of the other\nones, Disk Commander, Disk Wipe.\n\n447\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.500\nNow with Disk Commander, this is\none where you're repairing volumes.\n\n448\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.720\nWe'll show you this coming up.\n\n449\n00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.120\nDisk Wipe, eradicating data,\nExplorer, you can see,\n\n450\n00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.980\nagain, some of the other ones in here.\n\n451\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.770\nAnd we'll look more at some of\nthe specifics on these individual\n\n452\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.700\nutilities coming up.\n\n453\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.580\nAll right, so I'm gonna say let's go for\nit all, let's throw everyone in there,\n\n454\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.860\nwe're not gonna leave anything out.\n\n455\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.440\nNow here's another thing that's really\ngreat, now I told you that it uses\n\n456\n00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.680\nthe remote connection tool right, lets\nadministrators connect to you remotely.\n\n457\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.330\nIt uses RDP, okay.\n\n458\n00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.200\nBut I want you to notice\nsomething that it's not,\n\n459\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.320\nit isn't using the typical REP port.\n\n460\n00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.770\nSo it says, specify a portal.\n\n461\n00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.460\nLet Windows choose an open port number.\n\n462\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.149\nNow I've actually got an open remote\nconnection request already created on\n\n463\n00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:36.328\nanother machine.\n\n464\n00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:39.914\nNot a virtual machine that's running\nhere on these, the virtual machines that\n\n465\n00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:43.337\nwe run on our Macs here, but a physical\nmachine sitting over there next to one\n\n466\n00:25:43.337 --> 00:25:46.601\nof other hosts, Ronnie, and\nit's actually booted in the dart image and\n\n467\n00:25:46.601 --> 00:25:49.839\nI've got a service ticket open and\ngive me an example of what port it is.\n\n468\n00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:55.460\nIt's port 49,415 so keep that in mind.\n\n469\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.288\nYou can choose these ports,\nyou can let Windows choose your own port.\n\n470\n00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:03.770\nBut if you've got any firewall issues that\nyou might need to consider before hand,\n\n471\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.240\nyou can specify your own port.\n\n472\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.430\nBut make sure that it's not conflicting\nwith another service that's running within\n\n473\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:13.930\nyour network because two addresses on the\nsame street tends to cause some conflict.\n\n474\n00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.700\nSo, I'm just gonna leave it.\n\n475\n00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.530\nI'm gonna allow the remote connections,\nbut\n\n476\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.250\nI'm gonna let Windows choose\nthe port number for me.\n\n477\n00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.959\nWhatever's relative to your environment,\nyou go ahead and use that.\n\n478\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.930\nNow here's another thing\nthat really really cool.\n\n479\n00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.390\nIf you know that for\ninstance you’re doing wds, right?\n\n480\n00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.275\nWindows deployment service, you know\nyou've got a series of machines that\n\n481\n00:26:34.275 --> 00:26:38.920\nobviously have drivers that they need to\ndeploy their operating systems, right?\n\n482\n00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.770\nWell I want you to understand something.\n\n483\n00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:46.260\nYou can take those driver packages and put\nthem inside of your dart operating system\n\n484\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.620\nso if you've got a network\nadapter that is not recognized\n\n485\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.930\nin the early boot process, the driver will\nbe included in dart, it'll load it up and\n\n486\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.670\nyou can communicate with the network,\nI can give you an example.\n\n487\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.480\nOn that computer that I've got\nwaiting with a remote connection,\n\n488\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.030\nthe WiFi adapter is not recognized\nin the pre-installation phase, so\n\n489\n00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.370\nI have to put in a physical network\nadapter in order to do that.\n\n490\n00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.990\nIf I would put the driver inside of Dart,\nDart would have it available,\n\n491\n00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.840\ncould load and say okay now we\ncan communicate with the network.\n\n492\n00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.340\nSo pay attention to the drivers\nthat you might need.\n\n493\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.490\nIf you need additional options\ninside of your WinPE you can\n\n494\n00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.260\nchoose additional options for WinPE.\n\n495\n00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.690\nThe other one is crash analyzer.\n\n496\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:33.190\nNow crash analyzer, there's a couple\nof things you can do, all right.\n\n497\n00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.460\nRemember we said it needs\nthe debugging tools?\n\n498\n00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.640\nYou can say, let me go ahead and\n\n499\n00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.740\nwhatever machine I'm running this on\nwill have the debugging tools there.\n\n500\n00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:50.920\nOr if you already have the debugging tools\navailable like we do here you can point\n\n501\n00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.860\nthe crash analyzer and you can just\nbundle that into your dart image as well.\n\n502\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.950\nSo we'll go ahead and choose browse and\n\n503\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.610\nit's good to know where these files are\nbecause you're gonna need to know where\n\n504\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.610\nthese files are even if you\nare on a machine that you say,\n\n505\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:12.000\nwell you know what, I've already\ngot those files on that machine.\n\n506\n00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.810\nKnow where they are.\n\n507\n00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:19.659\nWe're down in local disk c, we're gonna\nbe in program files x86, Windows kits.\n\n508\n00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.910\nAnd then you'll see debuggers.\n\n509\n00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.270\nBe careful,\ndon't just leave it to debuggers.\n\n510\n00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.510\nI've already had an issue where I went to\nchoose that folder and it doesn't work.\n\n511\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.930\nRemember architecture.\n\n512\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.310\nNotice that, and\nI notice that's a little hard to see,\n\n513\n00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.270\nlet me kinda zoom in on it a little bit.\n\n514\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.120\nNotice that we picked the XP 64 because\n\n515\n00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.450\neverything is architectural\ndependent here.\n\n516\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.350\nAll right, so let me just double check and\nmake sure that I did select that 64.\n\n517\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:52.780\nThere we go, and\nwe will move on in the wizard.\n\n518\n00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:57.890\nAll right, now when it comes to creating\nthese images, these last files,\n\n519\n00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.952\nyou can specify which\nones you want to create.\n\n520\n00:29:00.952 --> 00:29:04.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and have us create\nall three of them just like you've seen,\n\n521\n00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.550\nwhat the end result would be.\n\n522\n00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.450\nAnd we've got our WIM file, remember\nyou need your Windows Imaging Format\n\n523\n00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.940\nif you wanna deploy this through something\nlike your Windows Deployment Service.\n\n524\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.580\nIt could be a good diagnostic that runs\nright with your deployment of operating\n\n525\n00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.570\nsystems.\n\n526\n00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:25.610\nYour ISO, and then that's what we can\nuse to create like a bootable USB thumb\n\n527\n00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.300\ndrive which is in that other computer\nthat I'm telling you about right now.\n\n528\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.950\nHow about a PowerShell script.\n\n529\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.080\nAll right,\nwhatever selections we just made,\n\n530\n00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.830\nimagine being able to just script it out.\n\n531\n00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.410\nAnd the dart image is created for you and\nyou don't even see this Wizard at all.\n\n532\n00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.530\nSo you also have one of the PS1 files,\n\n533\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.480\nor the PowerShell script files\nthat it will create too.\n\n534\n00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.750\nNow, if you need to post editing,\nall right, you need to add or\n\n535\n00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.990\nmodify files in DaRT, the DaRT image.\n\n536\n00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.600\nYou can also edit the image.\n\n537\n00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.933\nWe're not gonna do any editing and\nwe're gonna choose create.\n\n538\n00:29:57.933 --> 00:30:02.830\nNow, it's again,\na fairly straightforward process,\n\n539\n00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.100\nit's progress bar, as you can see.\n\n540\n00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.300\nWhat it does first, is it mounts the image\nthat we were pointing it to, right?\n\n541\n00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.030\nWe were pointing it to that boot image\nthat was on the installation media.\n\n542\n00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.976\nWhat it's gonna do is it's\ngonna mount that image.\n\n543\n00:30:14.976 --> 00:30:18.617\nNow, once it mounts the image,\nnow we can edit it,\n\n544\n00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:23.365\nit's gonna take those tools from\nthe DaRT recovery wizard here and\n\n545\n00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:27.036\nit's gonna slip stream\nthem right into the image.\n\n546\n00:30:27.036 --> 00:30:31.411\nIt's gonna commit the changes to\nthe image and then after it's done,\n\n547\n00:30:31.411 --> 00:30:33.635\nit's gonna unmount the image, and\n\n548\n00:30:33.635 --> 00:30:38.253\nthen what we should see here is a folder\non the desktop that says DaRT 10.\n\n549\n00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:42.096\nAnd it lets me know that hey,\nthat's where my files are gonna be, and\n\n550\n00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:46.020\nwe should be ready to start using\nthe recovery image after that.\n\n551\n00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.460\n>> Awesome stuff Wes, well we thank\nyou for taking us at least this far,\n\n552\n00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.230\nbut we've got a little more to do,\n\n553\n00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.060\nwe've done some installation but we\nalso wanna see this thing rock and roll.\n\n554\n00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.270\nSo looks like we got\na part two in our future,\n\n555\n00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:01.450\nI know you're enjoying that, I know I\nwill as well, hopefully you will also.\n\n556\n00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:05.036\nBut for this episode, looks like we're\ngonna go ahead and have to call it a day.\n\n557\n00:31:05.036 --> 00:31:08.420\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Larry.\n\n558\n00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.310\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n559\n00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.123\n>> See you next time.\n\n560\n00:31:11.123 --> 00:31:18.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.850\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.690\nwe are continuing on with our series on\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimation Pack.\n\n6\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.770\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again today for\n\n7\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.900\na part two, On the Dart system is\nour good friend Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n8\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.970\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.490\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.310\n>> It's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.880\nThat's right.\n\n12\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.800\nWe're back with a diagnostic\nrecovery tool set.\n\n13\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.200\nAnd in part 1 we showed you some of the\nprerequisites that you needed to know in\n\n14\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.580\norder to get Dart up and running.\n\n15\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.290\nRemember that the other thing that\nwe did is we actually started to\n\n16\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.260\ncreate a diagnostic and\nrecovery tool set image.\n\n17\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.120\nOne of the things that we did when we left\noff was the actual creation of the image.\n\n18\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.610\nThere is one more thing,\nbut wait there's more.\n\n19\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.910\nWe've got one more little step\nthat we wanna show you, so\n\n20\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.580\nthat you have seen creating the recovery\nimage from start to finish.\n\n21\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.130\nLet's go ahead and\njump right to my PC here.\n\n22\n00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.160\nYou can see that our DaRT image\nwas Successfully created.\n\n23\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.460\nI do have up on my,\nlet's see which one it is.\n\n24\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.740\nThat's it right there.\n\n25\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.560\nWe do have our folder on our desktop and\n\n26\n00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.878\nif I look in there I can see X64,\nremember the architecture that we chose.\n\n27\n00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:30.380\nWe chose 64-bit here earlier and\nwe do have\n\n28\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.590\nour boot dot wim right and\nlet me see if got that right?\n\n29\n00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.870\nI wasn't quite right.\n\n30\n00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.450\nI told you guys it was about 500 megs I\nwas a little wrong there it's actually\n\n31\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780\nonly 300 but it's about 111 megs.\n\n32\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.460\nLarger than a normal PE image would be.\n\n33\n00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.800\nYou can see your DaRT10 iso image and\n\n34\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.530\nyou can see your PowerShell script and\nif we edit this.\n\n35\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.490\nWe're not really gonna do any editing.\n\n36\n00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.760\nI just wanna kinda show you what this\nscript looks like and you can see\n\n37\n00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.340\nit'll go through and it'll automate\nthe process of creating that image.\n\n38\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.440\nAnd you don't have to know the PowerShell.\n\n39\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.650\nYou don't even have to know the script.\n\n40\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.280\nIt modified and made the script.\n\n41\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.520\nIt comments the stuff out to kinda\ngive you a little bit of information\n\n42\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.260\non what's going on.\n\n43\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.210\nSo if you do pass this over to\nsomebody that is doing the scripting,\n\n44\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.180\nthey'll be a little bit more familiar.\n\n45\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.650\nBut the last step, which is kind of cool\nthat they will allow you to do this.\n\n46\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.790\nNow you can do a couple of\ndifferent things, right?\n\n47\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.250\nThe last step is creating bootable media.\n\n48\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.750\nAll right now,\nthe media you choose really is up to you.\n\n49\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.495\nYou can do this to DVD, you really\n\n50\n00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:43.655\ndon't need a DVD cuz it's not really\nthat large and you can put it on a CD.\n\n51\n00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:44.245\nIt'll fit.\n\n52\n00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:48.695\nSo optical media or\nyou could put this to a USB device.\n\n53\n00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.385\nAnd what's great is you\ndon't have to go out and\n\n54\n00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:55.225\nget a third party software that takes\nan ISO and makes a USB bootable, but\n\n55\n00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:59.775\nI will tell you those will work as well\nif you get something like ISO to USB.\n\n56\n00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:02.470\nIt works just fine, so, but\n\n57\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.550\none of the great things is it's all\nbuilt into the interface as well.\n\n58\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.380\nYou don't have to go to a third party.\n\n59\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.790\nNow we're not going to create\n\n60\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.610\na bootable media here because I've\nalready got a bootable media created.\n\n61\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.460\nAnd I've got another machine that\nis waiting on me to help it.\n\n62\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.500\nRight now as we speak.\n\n63\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.530\nSo let's show you one of the other\nutilities that you have in here and this\n\n64\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.750\nis, if I scroll down here in all apps,\nremember We have our Microsoft DaRT 10.\n\n65\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.050\nAnd the one that we're really\ngonna look at first and\n\n66\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.060\nDan I'm kinda going off\nthe beaten path here.\n\n67\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.520\nI know I said I'd talk about\nthis a little bit later, but\n\n68\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.430\nI'm gonna set this one ahead of the pack\nbecause it'll give us a demonstration.\n\n69\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.370\nRather than just running\nit on a virtual machine,\n\n70\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.070\nI'd like to show you guys\nhow you would connect.\n\n71\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.870\nTo another machine if you\nwere in a help desk role and\n\n72\n00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.080\nyou were having to support somebody using\nthe DaRT image that you just created.\n\n73\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.120\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll launch that software.\n\n74\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.240\nNow please do understand that\neven though this is RDP,\n\n75\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.180\nwe can't just fire an RDP session up and\n\n76\n00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.790\nconnect to it with your traditional\nremote desktop connection software.\n\n77\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.400\nNotice that this does have its own\nspecial little information here.\n\n78\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.360\nI've already written this\ninformation down and what you'll see\n\n79\n00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.690\nas far as the end user experience is,\nand we'll see it when we connect to it,\n\n80\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.780\nis that when you choose one of the tools\nin your recovery media that says\n\n81\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.090\nRemote Connection, it'll ask you\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n82\n00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.210\nAnd then it pops up a dialogue box\nthat gives you this information.\n\n83\n00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.260\nAnd I'll talk about it as we type it here.\n\n84\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.120\nIt'll give you a ticket number\nthat has to be entered in here.\n\n85\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.560\nAnd for case in point, let's say Dan's\ngoing to help me, Dan would have to say,\n\n86\n00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.320\nwell Wes what's the information you\nsee on your screen, I could relay that\n\n87\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.810\ninformation and he could pipe that right\nin here and connect to the machine.\n\n88\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.970\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n89\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.930\nWe're going to connect to an SPX\nthat is sitting out there,\n\n90\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.420\nin next to our cubicles here.\n\n91\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.900\nGet that screen to wake back up there.\n\n92\n00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.250\nAnd remember if you don't\nset the ports yourself,\n\n93\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.520\nit is going to randomized the ports.\n\n94\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.120\nIt is going to be in that 49,052 and\nabove range.\n\n95\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.760\nYou know the private ports and\nwe'll go ahead and choose connect.\n\n96\n00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.440\nNow, one of the cool things is, it really.\n\n97\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.010\nThis is the software that we have.\n\n98\n00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.730\nAnd what's interesting is.\n\n99\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.180\nRemember I told you,\nwhen you click the remote connection.\n\n100\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.690\nWell, this is what your\nend user is seeing.\n\n101\n00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.860\nSo you get to see the end\nuser's experience.\n\n102\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.990\nAnd what's kind of interesting about this.\n\n103\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.160\nIn some of our other classes,\nother courses, right?\n\n104\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.140\nWe explained what Remote Desktop is.\n\n105\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.550\nIt's taking control over the desktop.\n\n106\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.340\nI'm gonna take control.\n\n107\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.470\nI'm not sharing anything.\n\n108\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.070\nIt's funny, this does the same thing.\n\n109\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.560\nSo you will be in control.\n\n110\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.400\nIn fact, the end user out there, Dan,\nI was showing you this yesterday, or\n\n111\n00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.230\nbefore we started the episode, where I\ncould bang on the keyboard all I wanted.\n\n112\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.940\nI could try to touch the touch interface.\n\n113\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.690\nIt's a touch interface laptop.\n\n114\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.690\nAnd it doesn't do anything.\n\n115\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.460\nIt blocks the end-user out so\nthey're going to be able to watch,\n\n116\n00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.520\nthey're not going to do anything.\n\n117\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.840\nAnd by the way you really don't\nwant to close this window down,\n\n118\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.200\nthat's your connection window.\n\n119\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.140\nSo we'll go ahead and get that out of\nthe way here and let's just kind of talk\n\n120\n00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.650\nabout some of these different,\nyou know utilities that we have right?\n\n121\n00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.630\nI know it's a little hard to see.\n\n122\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.530\nSee if we can zoom in a little bit there.\n\n123\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.130\nWell, we've got the good\nold registry editor.\n\n124\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.460\nMaybe somebody made a registry\nmodification that you know how to fix, and\n\n125\n00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.430\nunfortunately they didn't know\nwhat they were doing, and\n\n126\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.460\nnow their machine won't boot.\n\n127\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.570\nWell, guess what?\n\n128\n00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.090\nI've got the ability to launch\nthe registry editor, and\n\n129\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.490\nif I come in here, Sure enough,\nI can see the five subtrees or\n\n130\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.600\nthe hives if you will that\nwe have in the registry.\n\n131\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.860\nAnd if I get down in here to\nhkey local machine, scroll down,\n\n132\n00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.030\nyou can see there's software.\n\n133\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.270\nLet's see if I've got policies in here.\n\n134\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.360\nWell, I know I've got policies in here,\nbut let's see.\n\n135\n00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:08.410\nAnd there's a Microsoft one there.\n\n136\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.360\nAnd look.\n\n137\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.910\nHere's our FBV folder.\n\n138\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.530\nThat's for our BitLocker encryption.\n\n139\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:22.280\nSo I can see that at one point,\nlet me be specific on this,\n\n140\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.310\nif your machine's encrypted with\nbitlocker, you're not gonna see anything.\n\n141\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.430\nThat is a very important\npoint to keep in mind.\n\n142\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.900\nDart doesn't have the ability to see\nthrough the bitlocker encryption wall so.\n\n143\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.680\nIf your machine is\na BitLocker encrypted and\n\n144\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.040\nit shuts down,\nyou won't be able to use Dart.\n\n145\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.100\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n146\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.330\nYou're not gonna be able to see\nthe information because it is encrypted.\n\n147\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.100\nBut I can see that I could come in here,\nand if I wanted to or if I needed to,\n\n148\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.850\nI could make modification to the registry.\n\n149\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.650\nI could see that there's the XPS cypress\nkeyboard track pad drivers there.\n\n150\n00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.909\nSo I could tell it's my XPS So\nyou got, again,\n\n151\n00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:03.580\naccess to the registry editor if you need.\n\n152\n00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.060\nNow, another really cool program\nthat I like too is the Locksmith.\n\n153\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.810\nHow many times, and rhetorically speaking,\nI'm sure you probably had to deal with\n\n154\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.850\nthis once or twice, Dan, and I know\nyou worked in an enterprise industry.\n\n155\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.270\nCan you even guess how many times you've\nhad to reset somebody's password,\n\n156\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.490\ncuz they've locked themselves out?\n\n157\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.180\n>> Countless times, that's basically\nstandard issue of your job.\n\n158\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.260\nThat you're going to be resetting and\nunlocking accounts.\n\n159\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.320\n>> Yeah, now imagine if that account\nisn't stored in Active Directory.\n\n160\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.860\n>> I have had to do that and it gets\na little fun because then you have to rely\n\n161\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.020\non the expertise of the person at\nthe other end of the phone and\n\n162\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.660\nthat is shaky at best.\n\n163\n00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.970\nThat's no detriment to them\nto be honest with you.\n\n164\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.480\nThey're not IT people.\n\n165\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.690\nBut, and a lot of times, you're kind\nof at their mercy because you're not,\n\n166\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.290\nphysically, in front of the computer.\n\n167\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.500\n>> That's right, and\nthat's a very PC way to put it.\n\n168\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.420\nAll pun intended.\n\n169\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.100\nSo one of the things that\nwe do have the ability to\n\n170\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.520\nhere is something called Locksmith.\n\n171\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.890\nAnd if we check this out,\nthis is really cool,\n\n172\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.840\nnotice reset local account passwords.\n\n173\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840\nWell what are we talking about?\n\n174\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.285\nAre we just talking\nabout one local account?\n\n175\n00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.740\nNow, let's go ahead and click it.\n\n176\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.900\nAll right, and what I really like is,\nyou can see, this is really snappy.\n\n177\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.300\nRunning and ramming everything, and\nboy, they're just really quick.\n\n178\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.860\nAnd again, I really like this software.\n\n179\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.680\nThis one's a cool utility, and\n\n180\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.180\nI've actually used this to help people\nbefore, that weren't in an Enterprise.\n\n181\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.940\nThey say,\nI don't remember what my password was.\n\n182\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.090\nSo throw in Dart,\nboot it up and guess what?\n\n183\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.880\nIt will see all your accounts.\n\n184\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.870\nThere's my son's account that I let him,\nonce in awhile,\n\n185\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.360\ndo some Power Point presentations\nin Super Mario Brothers.\n\n186\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.470\nAnd I can see my account here too.\n\n187\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.534\nAnd if I wanted, I could turn around and\nI could set the password.\n\n188\n00:09:57.818 --> 00:09:59.730\nTo something that even I will remember.\n\n189\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.020\nAnd notice that it says\nCompleting the Locksmith Wizard.\n\n190\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.150\nYou have successfully completed it,\n\n191\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.070\nthe account password will be changed\nwhen you restart your password.\n\n192\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.520\n>> Wes, does this work for a domain\njoined computer, on a domain account?\n\n193\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.840\n>> Niche.\nIt certainly does.\n\n194\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.470\nNow, let me be careful on that one.\n\n195\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.400\nNo it does not.\n\n196\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.320\nIt does and it doesn't.\n\n197\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.930\nIt's not gonna unlock\nyour domain accounts.\n\n198\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.190\nIt's gonna unlock local accounts.\n\n199\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.190\n>> Okay.\n>> So that is a great question.\n\n200\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.130\nYou still do your reset\nthrough active directory.\n\n201\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.170\nThat'll get you back into any computer\nthat's joined to your domain.\n\n202\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.070\nHere what we're talking about is\nwhat is sitting on the hard drive.\n\n203\n00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.960\nWhat passwords are sitting\non the hard drive.\n\n204\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.480\nAnd depending on your password policy and\nactive directory, a lot of times they're\n\n205\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.050\ncached, but they're not really stored on\nthe local machine per se, if you will.\n\n206\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.070\n>> Now lest you think that's some sort of,\n\n207\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.655\nwell it was just those local accounts,\nin a domain environment,\n\n208\n00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:54.725\nyou're still gonna log in with\na local account from time to time.\n\n209\n00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:58.305\nIt just happens because things happen\nlike you lose the domain trust and\n\n210\n00:10:58.305 --> 00:10:59.555\nit's a remote computer.\n\n211\n00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:01.145\nI can't login to it at all.\n\n212\n00:11:01.145 --> 00:11:04.460\nI can't use any of the normal\ntools to get into this thing.\n\n213\n00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.140\nBut if I can use this, if they can at\nleast log in with a local account,\n\n214\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.500\nwell then we can unjoin it and rejoin\nit to the domain, regain that trust.\n\n215\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.600\nThat's how these kind of things come\nin real handy in a domain environment.\n\n216\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.180\n>> You are absolutely right, Dan, and\n\n217\n00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.540\nthat is one of the enterprise-level\nuses for this.\n\n218\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.610\nHow many times have you gone to\nlog in to a machine and it says,\n\n219\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.370\nthis computers lost its trust\nrelationship with the domain, and\n\n220\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.630\nyou don't know what the local\nadministrative password is because\n\n221\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.880\nthat thing has had that same image\non it for the last two years, right?\n\n222\n00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.450\nOr maybe you're the new administrator and\nyou don't have good documentation.\n\n223\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.550\nSo that's one of the great things,\nvery well said.\n\n224\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.060\nThat's exactly one of the good\nEnterprise uses for this.\n\n225\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.620\nNow I'm gonna kinda, go ahead.\n\n226\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.720\n>> Yeah, we just have a great\ncomment from our chat room,\n\n227\n00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.600\nit says that, if they're unable to\nlog in at all, then it's gonna be\n\n228\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.170\nhard to get them to guide them\nthrough this process, right Wes?\n\n229\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.450\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n230\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.290\nThat's exactly right.\n\n231\n00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.380\n>> And so what do we do in that case?\n\n232\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.805\n>> Well if they can't log in, one of the\ngreat things is this is running in RAM.\n\n233\n00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:03.530\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> All right,\n\n234\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.190\nso we're not logged in per\nse at all to this machine.\n\n235\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.080\nThis hard drive is technically turned off.\n\n236\n00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.920\nSo what we're doing is we're looking,\n\n237\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.700\nDart knows how to look right to\nthe files where it needs to look.\n\n238\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.360\nSo I'm not logged into\nthe other machine at all,\n\n239\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.070\nit's a pre-installation environment.\n\n240\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.560\nIt's running in RAM, so\n\n241\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.250\nthe local hard drive initializes it\nenough that we can work with it.\n\n242\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.800\nbut I'm not directly logged\ninto the machine itself.\n\n243\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.550\n>> So we get access to this through\nsome sort of, like you said before,\n\n244\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.390\na PXE boot environment or something.\n\n245\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.020\n>> Yeah, so let's go ahead and say,\nI'm an end user and I need some help.\n\n246\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.280\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n247\n00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.890\nWell, provided you don't\nhave a BIOS password,\n\n248\n00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.910\nif you got a BIOS password that's lost,\nall bets are off.\n\n249\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.900\nWhat do they do?\n\n250\n00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.590\nThey plug the thumb drive\ninto the machine, all right,\n\n251\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.010\nor you have them PXE boot if\nyou got it set up in WDS and\n\n252\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.570\nit deploys the operating\nsystem to the machine.\n\n253\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.940\nEither way, when they boot the machine up,\nthey never log in.\n\n254\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.530\nAnd that's why Bit Locker, this won't work\nwith Bit Locker, cuz if you don't know\n\n255\n00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.840\nthe Bit Locker password,\nyou're not gonna get into the boot screen.\n\n256\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.330\nSo one of the things to\nkeep in mind is that they\n\n257\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.650\nthrow the USB thumb drive in, they boot\nthe machine, and this is what they see.\n\n258\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.000\nThere hasn't been a login yet.\n\n259\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.780\nSo hopefully that answers the question.\n\n260\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.890\nNo login is necessary on this one and\nthat's where The Locksmith comes in\n\n261\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.740\nbecause, if it is truly a local login\nthat we can't deal, we don't need to.\n\n262\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.740\nWe'll reset the password,\nwe'll reboot the machine, password set.\n\n263\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.560\nNow, they can login to the machine.\n\n264\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.180\nThey have access to it again.\n\n265\n00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.720\nMoving a step farther,\nbuilding on what Dan said,\n\n266\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.120\nif I need to unjoin this computer from\nthe domain and join it back to the domain,\n\n267\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.410\nwell, now we've got our trust relationship\nand everything is managed back through.\n\n268\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.650\nActive directory again.\n\n269\n00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.680\nFile restore, recover deleted files.\n\n270\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.840\nThe ability of this to work.\n\n271\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.310\nI've seen it work sometimes.\n\n272\n00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.010\nI've seen it not work sometimes.\n\n273\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.030\n>> Just like a poor man's version\nof like Shadow Copy or something?\n\n274\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.430\n>> Something like that or like\nDisc Digger or something like that, yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.620\nLike I said, the ability for\nthis to work is\n\n276\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.770\nI don't know how much I would rely on this\none, but it is there, it is available.\n\n277\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.020\nI wish I had a demonstration on\nit working, but unfortunately,\n\n278\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.280\nI don't, but disc commander,\nthis is really cool.\n\n279\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.160\nHave you ever got into a situation?\n\n280\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.100\nMaybe you're a Help Desk person and\n\n281\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.640\nyour computer isn't booting because\nthe master boot record is corrupted.\n\n282\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.430\nOr your GPT.\n\n283\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.890\nNow GPT, let's be fair here,\nGUID Partion Table has some redundancy\n\n284\n00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.840\nfeatures built in, but\nWho knows, all right.\n\n285\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.570\nSo you've got boot records\nthat are now corrupted and\n\n286\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.030\nyou can't even boot the machine.\n\n287\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.280\nWell remember we're not\nbooting from the hard drive,\n\n288\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.470\nthe hard drive isn't the operating\nsystem that's being loaded,\n\n289\n00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.580\nit is loaded in a pre-installation\nenvironment in RAM so if I want,\n\n290\n00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.250\nI can go to disk commander here,\nwe can choose next.\n\n291\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.500\nAnd notice what we can do.\n\n292\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.420\nWe can restore the Master Boot Record or\n\n293\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.480\nthe header of the GUID Partition Table,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.090\nAnd like I said, in fairness to GPT,\nit's got redundant headers there.\n\n295\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.250\nSo you shouldn't have that problem but\nyou never say never.\n\n296\n00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.000\nHow about if you've got a lost volume,\none or more?\n\n297\n00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.460\nNot just a single volume but maybe you've\ngot multiple volumes that you've lost.\n\n298\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.530\nWell, you can try to\nrecover those volumes.\n\n299\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.620\nBut here's another thing\nthat's really cool too.\n\n300\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:26.920\nNotice it says restore the partition\ntables from a disk commander backup.\n\n301\n00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.470\nAll right,\n\n302\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.930\nwell if we're gonna restore partition\ntables from a disk, Command or backup.\n\n303\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.720\nChances are we probably want to\nsave a partition before then.\n\n304\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.020\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose save a partition.\n\n305\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.540\nI'll show you how we can do this.\n\n306\n00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.630\nNotice that it gives me the option.\n\n307\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.730\nIt sees the disks that\nare in the system already.\n\n308\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.845\nNow this little 14 gigger here,\nit's actually 16 gigs and\n\n309\n00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:52.559\nchange minus Some of the software\nthat I've got on it.\n\n310\n00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:56.518\nThis is actually our recovery disk,\nright now, that we're running.\n\n311\n00:15:56.518 --> 00:15:58.242\nI could choose next And\n\n312\n00:15:58.242 --> 00:16:03.540\nI can choose the partition table\nbackup file location, all right.\n\n313\n00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:10.140\nAnd let's see here,\nlet me make sure that we are in this.\n\n314\n00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.376\nYep, there we go,\nwe wanna make sure that we're in boot And\n\n315\n00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:17.680\nlet me just make sure that I'm\nin the right removable disk.\n\n316\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.620\nI want the, and\n\n317\n00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.330\nthis is and you can see I already have\nsome partition tables backed up here.\n\n318\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.875\nBut let's go ahead we'll call\nthis partition table backup 2.\n\n319\n00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.570\nAll right, and I can save that and\nchoose Next and\n\n320\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.570\nwhat it does is it copies\nthe state of the partition tables.\n\n321\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.970\nNow, let's say they aren't corrupt and\nI can put it on that recovery,\n\n322\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.650\nin this case on that removable media.\n\n323\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.110\nAnd then I can hold on to it and\nif i need to recover it,\n\n324\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.960\nplug it back in, we rerun Disk Commander.\n\n325\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.460\nand we tell it all right,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.410\ninstead of this time making a backup,\nright?\n\n327\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.700\nWe're gonna do restore.\n\n328\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.810\nIt's gonna ask us,\nwhich ones do you want to repair?\n\n329\n00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.900\nThis 230gig is the operating system drive.\n\n330\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.740\nI could choose Next, and then what I could\ndo is do I wanna backup the partition\n\n331\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.840\ntable currently, the one that's already\nhere, before I do the restoration?\n\n332\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.580\nSo it's probably a good idea to do.\n\n333\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.990\nRemember, take a backup before\nyou restore from a backup.\n\n334\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.500\nAnd then from here I could choose Browse.\n\n335\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.360\nAnd I could go down to my partition\ntables that we've created as far\n\n336\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.070\nas backups beforehand.\n\n337\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:31.690\nAnd we could move forward in the wizard\nand we could complete the backup.\n\n338\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:37.310\nAll right,\nnow a couple of the other things Dan,\n\n339\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.310\nI don't know about you but\nI really like these utilities.\n\n340\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:46.335\nAnd I've debated whether to do this on\nstage, on camera, was disk eradication.\n\n341\n00:17:46.335 --> 00:17:49.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, that's fun.\n\n342\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.160\n>> That's always fun.\n\n343\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.713\n>> Well this is the Microsoft\nhacker tool kit.\n\n344\n00:17:51.713 --> 00:17:54.388\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n345\n00:17:54.388 --> 00:17:59.140\nImagine a scenario where maybe you\njust want to cleanly erase a machine.\n\n346\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.370\nMaybe you're provisioning it for\n\n347\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.330\na new user that's coming in but\nyou're not sitting locally at the machine.\n\n348\n00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:09.460\nWell, you could do that and\nas you can see, it does follow the DOD,\n\n349\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.630\nand I guess four passes is\nthe DOD standard there,\n\n350\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.080\nsecurity standard, and\nit's gonna do the overwriting.\n\n351\n00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.550\nThis is disk wipe,\nthis is a disk scrubber.\n\n352\n00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.780\nIt's going to overwrite it four times,\nso it could take awhile or\n\n353\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.580\nyou could do a single pass.\n\n354\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.270\nNow we're not gonna do\na disk eradication or\n\n355\n00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.042\nthis episode is going to come to an end\na lot shorter than what we want.\n\n356\n00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:33.296\n[LAUGH] So I'll go ahead and cancel that.\n\n357\n00:18:33.296 --> 00:18:36.960\nBut, again, it really is good to see and\nknow these utilities.\n\n358\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.700\nComputer Management,\nhere's one that we were talking about.\n\n359\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.980\nYou can see, this ones, imagine being able\nto see your system information, right?\n\n360\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.315\nTypically, we have to have\nthe machine fired up to run our\n\n361\n00:18:49.315 --> 00:18:54.320\nms32info.exe to expand out\nall of that information.\n\n362\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.680\nImagine a computer that's not even on,\nand I can tell what the system model is,\n\n363\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.490\nthe manufacturer,\neven the service tag for warranty calls.\n\n364\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.270\nAll right, do you know if that machine\nnow that you're connecting to is\n\n365\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.790\nstill under warranty?\n\n366\n00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.510\nI don't know let's take the service\ntag in this case it's Dell,\n\n367\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.630\nlet's go out to Dell's support staff and\nput in that service tag and\n\n368\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.470\nsome find out if it's still under\nwarranty or not, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.520\nThings like is the BIOS out of date?\n\n370\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.576\nRight, well guess what?\n\n371\n00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.090\nI can find out.\n\n372\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.110\nProcessor type, architecture and\n\n373\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.160\neven with the revision of the BIOS is,\nall from a computer that won't start.\n\n374\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.230\nIt's a lot of good information there,\nDisk Management,\n\n375\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.700\nit we wanted to perform\nDisk Management we could as well.\n\n376\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.040\nServices and Drivers,\nlet me go ahead and expand that out.\n\n377\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.500\nAnd we'll take a second here,\nwe'll double-click on that.\n\n378\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.570\nNotice the ability to disable or change\nthe start-up types to your services.\n\n379\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.410\nThat is a really good\nthing as well to have too.\n\n380\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:20:00.900\nAll right, so that is a little bit about\nthe computer management software here.\n\n381\n00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.070\nThe next one that we need to look at,\nI talked a little about the file restore\n\n382\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.690\nagain, but\nthe next one we'll look at is file search.\n\n383\n00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.530\nOkay, with file search, and\nlet me search for file search.\n\n384\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.710\nWhere is it in the list?\n\n385\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.140\nWhy don't I see File Search?\n\n386\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.272\nSorry, it's just called Search, sorry.\n\n387\n00:20:19.272 --> 00:20:21.830\n[LAUGH] It's not File Search.\n\n388\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.540\nThere are a couple of different\nutilities that you can use, all right.\n\n389\n00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.890\nAnd there's File Search,\nand then there's Explorer.\n\n390\n00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.280\nAnd I keep calling it File Search,\nit's just called Search, and\n\n391\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.300\nExplorer, all right.\n\n392\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.640\nWell, what is the difference?\n\n393\n00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.900\nWell, Explorer you can use If you\nknow where the file's located.\n\n394\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.210\nRight, if I already know that I\nneed to get down in to like E here,\n\n395\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.780\nwhich by the way, happens to be c colon,\n\n396\n00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.870\nI've got a document down in here\nthat I need to gain access to, well,\n\n397\n00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:52.450\nI can get in there, I can extract this\nfile off, saved on that media, and\n\n398\n00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.060\nthen blow the machine away and\nnot have to worry about losing the file.\n\n399\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.940\nBut, what if you don't know\nwhere the file's located?\n\n400\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.610\nYou know the name of the file,\nbut you don't know where it is.\n\n401\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.530\nYou just don't know where it is.\n\n402\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.920\nWell, imagine the ability to go ahead and\nactually search.\n\n403\n00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.650\nNow, this isn't file restore, right?\n\n404\n00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.210\nThis is isn't recovery and deleted file,\n\n405\n00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.310\nthis is a file we know that is on the\nmachine, we just don't know where it is.\n\n406\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.120\nWe could also do that.\n\n407\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.650\nSo file search is when you\ndon't know where the file is.\n\n408\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.780\nHave you ever installed a hot fix?\n\n409\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.940\nHot fix you install it, causes a problem\nwith the machine, causes a reboot,\n\n410\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.190\nsomething goes wrong, will it match it?\n\n411\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.392\n>> Kind of the opposite\nof what they want right?\n\n412\n00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:32.060\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly,\nit's the opposite.\n\n413\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.300\n>> This thing will fix it.\n\n414\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:33.920\n>> That's a cold fix.\n\n415\n00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.730\n>> And it just broke everything.\n\n416\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.830\n>> Would that be a cold fix?\n\n417\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n418\n00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.370\n[LAUGH] A hot break.\n\n419\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.010\n>> A hot break.\n\n420\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:38.990\nThere we go.\n\n421\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:43.250\nSo, if we wanted to, we could come in\nhere and we could look for hot fixes and,\n\n422\n00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.580\nagain, it knows where to look\nwithin the operating system.\n\n423\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.860\nSo it'll show you What hot fixes\ndo you currently have installed?\n\n424\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.170\nAnd if you currently have them installed,\nif you've got your knowledge base open,\n\n425\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.600\nyou know which ones that you've deployed.\n\n426\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.150\nMaybe you've got WSUS and maybe your patch\nmanagement crew didn't do too good and\n\n427\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.640\nthey shouldn't have deployed that hot fix.\n\n428\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.680\nWell, we can also take care of that.\n\n429\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.070\nAnd you can see right here it finds them,\nright?\n\n430\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:12.050\nYou can see it finds where\nall of these hot fixes are.\n\n431\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.410\nThe knowledge base numbers,\nthe time that it was installed.\n\n432\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.650\nSo maybe it's a specific one.\n\n433\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.690\nDan says, you know what?\n\n434\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:21.990\nWe deployed an update last night at 12:30,\noff hours to our machines.\n\n435\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.190\nTwo of our machines crashed.\n\n436\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.590\nWes, I need you to get over there.\n\n437\n00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.650\nFind that hot fix and\nI need you to remove it.\n\n438\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.850\nIt caused a problem.\n\n439\n00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.530\nWell guess what?\n\n440\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.050\nI've got a time signature on here.\n\n441\n00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.130\nI could say, Dan, that one at 12 midnight.\n\n442\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.650\nDo I have one?\n\n443\n00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.390\nMaybe not, that's PM.\n\n444\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.570\nI was hoping I had one at 12 midnight.\n\n445\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.300\nI could find it and I could say,\nokay we're gonna uninstall That hot fix.\n\n446\n00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.740\nNow, I'm not gonna install that,\nwho knows what that would cause.\n\n447\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.800\nBut I can also get,\nlets see, details here.\n\n448\n00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.230\nYou can get additional\ninformation on it as well.\n\n449\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:55.200\nAnd it does,\nit tells you what we got going on here.\n\n450\n00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.510\nAll right, so\na lot of good information on that one.\n\n451\n00:22:58.938 --> 00:23:04.490\nThe hot fix uninstaller is really good,\nwe'll go ahead and close that down.\n\n452\n00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:10.057\nSo we've talked about Locksmith already,\nwe've talked about the registry editor.\n\n453\n00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:12.030\nThere's another one, the Solutions Wizard.\n\n454\n00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.478\nHave you ever run into a problem where\nmaybe the troubleshooter comes up and\n\n455\n00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:18.103\nit sometimes figures out,\nthis was the problem here,\n\n456\n00:23:18.103 --> 00:23:20.421\nthis was the problem there,\nhere's what you do.\n\n457\n00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:23.504\nWell you can run the Solution Wizard and\n\n458\n00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:29.210\nit can help you to automate the process\nby asking you a few questions.\n\n459\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.300\nThe system won't start,\nData on the system needs to be salvaged.\n\n460\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.610\nRemember, while we were using\nFile Search for or Explorer.\n\n461\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.140\nCan't log on because of a lost password.\n\n462\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:46.031\nCan you maybe think which utility here\nin the dark it's gonna recommend?\n\n463\n00:23:46.031 --> 00:23:46.941\nLet's go ahead and-\n>> File Explorer.\n\n464\n00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.447\n[LAUGH] File explorer, perfect!\n\n465\n00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:53.662\nAnd you can see right there, it says why\ndon't you try and run Locksmith on it?\n\n466\n00:23:53.662 --> 00:23:58.066\nSo it gives you an idea of,\nbased on what your problem is On what\n\n467\n00:23:58.066 --> 00:24:02.579\nutilities inside of DART might\nhelp you resolve the solution.\n\n468\n00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:04.400\nHow about this, too?\n\n469\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.650\nConfiguration of your network adapter.\n\n470\n00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:11.370\nI've got it set up to DHCP right now,\nbut maybe that's not what we want.\n\n471\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.910\nMaybe we want a static configuration.\n\n472\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:19.030\nFor whatever reason, you might wanna\nconfigure IPv6, because that's always fun.\n\n473\n00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:23.730\nYou could do that as well, so\nwe do have TCP/IP configuration,\n\n474\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:29.960\nlot of good things here that we\nhave access to that pretty much,\n\n475\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.460\nlet me make sure it didnt take,\nthat we took care of all of them.\n\n476\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.150\nWell the last one that I'll mention and\nthis is good to know is SFC, right?\n\n477\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.710\nYou can run the System File Checker\ninside of a command prompt with\n\n478\n00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.780\na Scan Now option.\n\n479\n00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.830\nBut, well, you can't get to\nthe command prompt, right?\n\n480\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.520\nUnfortunately your\ncomputer isn't starting.\n\n481\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.100\nWell run the SFC.\n\n482\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.880\nIt might be a system\nfile that's corrupted.\n\n483\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.430\nAnd what it can do is it can find it and\nrepair it, hopefully, for you.\n\n484\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:57.120\nThere again further automating\nthe process so that you find a solution.\n\n485\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.460\nAll right, well we'll cancel this wizard\nDan, and that really takes care of just\n\n486\n00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:09.210\nabout all of the utilities\nwe have except for one.\n\n487\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:13.530\nAnd this one is one that I really like,\nso let me go ahead and\n\n488\n00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.440\nI'm going to get disconnected.\n\n489\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.470\nAnd you know one of the things\nthat I didn't show you guys,\n\n490\n00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.000\nthe recovery environment.\n\n491\n00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.960\nThis is the same thing as WinRE right.\n\n492\n00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.250\nIf I troubleshoot my PC notice I get the\nadvanced options just if I was booting in.\n\n493\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.970\nThat's what it's doing,\nthat's why it needed that boot.win,\n\n494\n00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.990\nit needed to combine what you\nsee here in the diagnostic and\n\n495\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.510\nrecovery tool kit inside of\nthe windows recovery environment.\n\n496\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.730\nBuy I know, WINPE, WINRE, DART,\nall kinds of acronyms guys.\n\n497\n00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.836\n>> CDEFG.\n[LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:43.450\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n499\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.370\nSo let me go ahead and I'm gonna\nget back to our DART recovery tool.\n\n500\n00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.520\nAnd I think I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclose this dow.\n\n501\n00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.860\nAlright and it's going to ask are you\nsure you want to close this session down?\n\n502\n00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.320\nWe're gonna go ahead and close the session\ndown cause Dan's letting me know here,\n\n503\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.500\nwe're coming to the end of the episode,\nwe gotta show you a crash analyzer.\n\n504\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.030\nIt's a really cool utility.\n\n505\n00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.340\nIt's one of the best utilities,\nI think, next to Locksmith.\n\n506\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.290\nLocksmith is really cool.\n\n507\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.040\n>> Yeah, you gotta love it.\n\n508\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:07.910\n>> It does help a lot.\n\n509\n00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.900\nSo let me show you what this is about.\n\n510\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.450\nIf we go into our all apps again,\nwe scroll down.\n\n511\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.490\nWe're going to see dart\ndiagnostic recovery tool kit.\n\n512\n00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.680\nAnd then you should see\nthe crash analyzer here.\n\n513\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.600\nWell, we can run the crash analyzer.\n\n514\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.610\nAnd again, as you can see,\n\n515\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.690\nwe need administrative level\nprivileges in order to do that.\n\n516\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.650\nAnd it says welcome to the crash analyzer.\n\n517\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.380\nNow keep in mind that the prerequisites\nlike we talked about for this is going to\n\n518\n00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.750\nbe that you have to have the software\ndevelopment kit with the debugging tools\n\n519\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:40.830\navailable because it does need those\ndebugging tools to read dump files.\n\n520\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.660\nNow what is a dump file?\n\n521\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.340\nGuys keep in mind a dump file when\nyou have a blue screen, what happens?\n\n522\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.280\nIt takes everything that's in RAM\ndepending on how you have this setup and\n\n523\n00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.700\nit dump it into a file.\n\n524\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.680\nAll right well I've got a dump file\nhere Dan and I believe I do, I say that,\n\n525\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.887\nI know I do have one here And if not,\nwe can certainly create one real quick.\n\n526\n00:26:59.887 --> 00:27:00.559\n>> A foul liar.\n\n527\n00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:01.893\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:27:01.893 --> 00:27:02.460\n>> All right, so\n\n529\n00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.880\nI've got a MEMORY.DUMP file here and\nit's about 760 megs here.\n\n530\n00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.440\nDan, I'm gonna need you, if you will,\nto interpret this dump file for me.\n\n531\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.300\nLet's go ahead and open it up in Notepad.\n\n532\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:15.800\n>> I'm ready.\n\n533\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.650\n>> Ready?\n>> Let's do it.\n\n534\n00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.190\n>> We're gonna do it.\n\n535\n00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.650\nAccess is denied!\n\n536\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.260\nSo did you get that?\n\n537\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.715\n>> Your access is denied,\nthat's the problem.\n\n538\n00:27:23.715 --> 00:27:25.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n539\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.520\nSo let's go ahead and what we're gonna do\nis we're actually going to copy this and\n\n540\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.370\nyou need administrative level\nprivileges for what I'm doing here.\n\n541\n00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.250\nYou can actually view it if you\ncopy it to a different location.\n\n542\n00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.100\nYou just need administrative\nprivileges to do it.\n\n543\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.200\nAnd, now we'll open that up.\n\n544\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.430\nAlright, now, Dan's going to tell me what\ncaused this blue screen in about a half\n\n545\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:54.630\nhour, when about 768 MB of information\nget loaded into a single text document.\n\n546\n00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.250\nSee the dump files, one of the problems\nwith the dump files are they're really for\n\n547\n00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.090\ndevelopers, right?\n\n548\n00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.550\nThey don't really mean much to us.\n\n549\n00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.620\nSo Dan, can you tell me what caused.\n\n550\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.860\n>> Yeah, obviously there was a section\nof RAM that wasn't able to write,\n\n551\n00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.421\nand that was the problem, or-\n>> Or [CROSSTALK].\n\n552\n00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:15.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was just going to say that's pretty\n\n553\n00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.449\ngood, maybe that was the cost.\n\n554\n00:28:17.449 --> 00:28:20.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Notice that the gun files do absolutely\n\n555\n00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.490\nnothing for us, in fact,\nthey never really render.\n\n556\n00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.690\nWe've got a few letters in there.\n\n557\n00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.750\nI think I'd like to buy a vowel\npat somewhere around that.\n\n558\n00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.080\nPage, page, page, page.\n\n559\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.182\nSo, apparently it's a page fault.\n\n560\n00:28:29.182 --> 00:28:30.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n561\n00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.200\n>> Trudge through this.\n\n562\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:32.800\n>> Right?\nSo\n\n563\n00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.170\nthat's one fo the reasons why\nyou need the debugger tools and\n\n564\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.670\nyou also need something called symbols.\n\n565\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:42.020\nNow remember, I've, and show you where\nthe path is guys, just so you remember.\n\n566\n00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.430\nIt's in your Windows 10 kits.\n\n567\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.790\n10 in this fact because we're using\nthe Windows 10 dart image and\n\n568\n00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:52.200\nthen 64 bit because that's what\nthe image is and the machine.\n\n569\n00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.310\nNow downloading the symbols one of the\nthings that you gotta keep in mind is that\n\n570\n00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.620\nyou have to access to the symbol files\nbecause the symbol files are what\n\n571\n00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.780\nrender this into something\nthat we can read right.\n\n572\n00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.630\nNow if you do this on a machine that has\ninternet connection like this one does,\n\n573\n00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.420\nI can download the symbols on the fly,\nright?\n\n574\n00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.080\nIt just downloads them for me and\nI don't have to worry about them.\n\n575\n00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.340\nHowever, if you've connected before,\nyou can,\n\n576\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.280\nand I believe that is just in C: here.\n\n577\n00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.360\nWhere I I've actually put\nthese there by the way guys.\n\n578\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.620\nAnd in the C drive you can see\nthat I've got the symbols folder.\n\n579\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.380\nAll right, now let me tell you what you\nwould have to do if this happens to\n\n580\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.835\na machine in which you don't\nhave access to the simple files.\n\n581\n00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:39.645\nYou can take and\n\n582\n00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:42.925\nscrape the dump file off it with\nfile search that we just showed you.\n\n583\n00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:46.165\nYou put it on a USB drive and take it to\nyour administration machine, like this\n\n584\n00:29:46.165 --> 00:29:50.755\nmachine here, and I could load up the dump\nfile and find out what's going on.\n\n585\n00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:54.505\nIf you include it like we did,\nyou bake it into your image,\n\n586\n00:29:54.505 --> 00:29:58.805\nyour dart recovery image, then it\nknows where to look locally for these.\n\n587\n00:29:58.805 --> 00:30:02.050\nAll right, so,\nif you don't have internet connectivity,\n\n588\n00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.850\nkeep in mind that that's\nalso an option as well.\n\n589\n00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.120\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nI'm not gonna download them again.\n\n590\n00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.630\nI'm gonna point them right\nto where they need to go.\n\n591\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.920\nAnd it's gonna ask me, well,\nwhat do you wanna do this for.\n\n592\n00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.340\nAll right, we're gonna do the dump file.\n\n593\n00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.670\nWe're going to choose nest and you can\nsee that what it's doing is launching\n\n594\n00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:23.150\nthe analysis, it's loading the symbols\nup and now it's trying to find what\n\n595\n00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:27.060\nthe problem was and what's interesting\nis it tells me what the problem is,\n\n596\n00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.170\nit tells me the driver,\nthe system file that caused the issue.\n\n597\n00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.290\nNow understand this is sys internals\n\n598\n00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.710\ntechnology called it's not my fault that\nsimulates different types of blue screens.\n\n599\n00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.310\nDoes the same thing, in fact,\none of the errors that.\n\n600\n00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.100\nIn fact let me see here,\nI've got a different crash file,\n\n601\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.170\nI'll show you a couple here guys.\n\n602\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.590\nI know that we're running\nshort on time here.\n\n603\n00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.290\nBut it tells you all the drivers that\nwere loaded at the time of the crash,\n\n604\n00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.890\nwhich is really cool,\nit tells you the load or wear in RAM,\n\n605\n00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:02.280\nthe exception was handled and happened,\nwe could go advanced if we want.\n\n606\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.440\nAnd if you really wanna get crazy you can\nsee that it took all of that information\n\n607\n00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.410\nthat I was just picking on Dan\nsaying hey did you get that and\n\n608\n00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.290\nit actually makes it to where there's\nat least semi-legible, I don't know.\n\n609\n00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.100\nMaybe not so much, but\nit tells you all the memory information.\n\n610\n00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.660\nAnd if somebody was debugging, let's\nsay software, maybe you're in software\n\n611\n00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.330\ndevelopment, you're supporting\nsomebody and it crashes the computer.\n\n612\n00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.650\nYou give this to your software\ndevelopers and they could do debugging.\n\n613\n00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.172\nSo really cool thing, now one of the great\nthings that it also does is when you\n\n614\n00:31:30.172 --> 00:31:33.805\nchoose next, the last thing it says,\nmake sure you have the current version of\n\n615\n00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:36.417\nany drivers that are installed\nthat cause the problem.\n\n616\n00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:41.067\nSo it's the KB, the knowledge base and\nthen disable the driver alright,\n\n617\n00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:44.292\nyou can use this driver manager or\ndevice manager,\n\n618\n00:31:44.292 --> 00:31:48.810\nI can say that disable the driver,\nthe system can function without it.\n\n619\n00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.587\nWe gotta choose finish And\nwasn't that great?\n\n620\n00:31:51.587 --> 00:31:55.580\nBut I've got one more dump file.\n\n621\n00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.096\nBecause beforehand I tried to create\na couple of these different types of\n\n622\n00:32:00.096 --> 00:32:05.290\nblue-screen so you can see that you don't\nalways get the same information twice.\n\n623\n00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.160\nIn fact, depending on how you have\nthis set up, and let me go ahead and\n\n624\n00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.400\nspecify this real quick.\n\n625\n00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.340\nIn your advanced system Settings.\n\n626\n00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.720\nIf you go to advanced system and\nthen you go to startup and\n\n627\n00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.080\nrecovery, how well and\nhow much information you will have and\n\n628\n00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.935\nhave available is all in how\nyou have this setup right here.\n\n629\n00:32:25.935 --> 00:32:27.545\nHow much kernel dump are you doing?\n\n630\n00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.435\nAre you just taking a little smidgen\nof that and throwing it to a file?\n\n631\n00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:33.325\nYou taking the whole entire operating\nsystem, which you've gotta be careful\n\n632\n00:32:33.325 --> 00:32:37.225\nbecause that could be, two, two and a half\ngigs I've seen is what one file was.\n\n633\n00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:42.845\nSo what you see is really relative to how\nmuch information is in the dump file.\n\n634\n00:32:42.845 --> 00:32:46.410\nLet's do one more here Dan,\n\n635\n00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.640\nI got that one on,\nactually I got that one on the desktop.\n\n636\n00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.118\nYeah.\nLet's browse, and I believe.\n\n637\n00:32:58.271 --> 00:33:05.040\nI do have one here on the desktop\nin my dart tent, no that's not it.\n\n638\n00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.510\nThere we go.\nI got a small kernel dump,\n\n639\n00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.600\nand I want to show you guys that one.\n\n640\n00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.730\nSo this is a completely\ndifferent dump file.\n\n641\n00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.680\nCompletely separate instance here.\n\n642\n00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.880\nAnd it's going to load that up.\n\n643\n00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.720\nAnd notice that it's analyzing everything.\n\n644\n00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.500\nAnd when it's done looking\nat the system files,\n\n645\n00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.040\nnotice that it says pretty\nmuch the same driver.\n\n646\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.590\nAll right?\n\n647\n00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.610\nI can get some details on this, as well.\n\n648\n00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.740\nAdvanced information.\n\n649\n00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:35.010\nAnd I can see pretty much the information\nrelated to that dump file in something\n\n650\n00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.690\nthat's a little bit more legible,\nsomething that we can actually read.\n\n651\n00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.541\nSo now because of crash analyzer\ninside of the diagnostic and\n\n652\n00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:46.449\nrecovery tool set, dump files can\nactually mean something to us technicians\n\n653\n00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:50.319\nthat don't really know much\nabout coding and development.\n\n654\n00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:54.110\nAnd hopefully it'll help us out to find\nthe driver that caused the problem.\n\n655\n00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.400\nAnd we can uninstall it.\n\n656\n00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.960\nWe can update the driver,\nreinstall it, whatever we have to do.\n\n657\n00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.300\nSo really cool technology, Dan.\n\n658\n00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.550\nAnd we wouldn't be doing you justice if\nwe didn't show you the Crash Analyzer.\n\n659\n00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.450\nThat Locksmith are two of my\nfavorites inside of Dart.\n\n660\n00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.550\n>> Wow, Dart is actually a really cool\ntool that Microsoft has given to us.\n\n661\n00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:15.290\nIt's basically all the things that we,\nas technicians, do on a normal basis.\n\n662\n00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.297\nThey said, you know what, let's all throw\nit into one environment that we can give\n\n663\n00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:23.270\nto a user, or they can boot to it, and\nthen allow a technician to have access.\n\n664\n00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.060\nOr you carry one around in your toolkit,\n\n665\n00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.570\nnever know when you need\nto just jump on that.\n\n666\n00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.837\nUse those tools that are in sungsa,\n\n667\n00:34:28.837 --> 00:34:32.590\na very handy environment in\nwhich to have at the ready.\n\n668\n00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.390\nThank you Wes for explaining that\nthis is a thing and we can use it.\n\n669\n00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.285\nThat's always helpful.\n\n670\n00:34:37.285 --> 00:34:40.170\n[LAUGH] If we don't know that it exists,\nit's kind of hard to use.\n\n671\n00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.825\n>> That's right.\n>> [LAUGH] We thank you guys for watching.\n\n672\n00:34:42.825 --> 00:34:44.449\nHopefully you get a lot\nout of this episode and\n\n673\n00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.980\nmaybe even learned a little bit.\n\n674\n00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.120\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n675\n00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.580\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n676\n00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.380\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n677\n00:34:50.380 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.210\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.940\nMicrosoft Desktop\nOptimization Pack Series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.260\nJoining us back in the studio again to\nlend his expertise on that very topic is\n\n6\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.470\nour good friend and mentor, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.050\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nhow is it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.140\n>> It's going great and as always good to\nbe here with ITProTV and that's right we\n\n9\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.240\nare continuing along with MDOP and today\nwe're gonna be looking at Virtualized\n\n10\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.510\napplications, or more correctly,\nApp V, application virtualization.\n\n11\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.990\nNow, we had talked about\nin other series about\n\n12\n00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.870\nvirtualizing operating systems, and\nI would definitely take a look at those.\n\n13\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.630\nBut we're gonna look at something a little\nbit different today when it comes to\n\n14\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.420\nvirtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.395\nA lot of us think about the whole\nentire platform, right.\n\n16\n00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.103\nWe think about maybe something\nlike Microsoft Hyper-V\n\n17\n00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:05.586\nif you're running any\nclient software out there.\n\n18\n00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.278\nMaybe you're thinking of VirtualBox,\nright.\n\n19\n00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:12.062\nAlmost the same concept but\nslightly different.\n\n20\n00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:17.319\nSo, let's go ahead and talk a little bit\nabout what scenario would make us even\n\n21\n00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.990\nconsider application virtualization at\nthe same time, we'll explain what it is.\n\n22\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.910\nNow of the, of being a part of the\nMicrosoft Desktop Optimization Pack allows\n\n23\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.350\nyou to achieve something first and\nforemost is Application co-exist.\n\n24\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.210\nJust imagine the ability to virtualize or\n\n25\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.120\nsandbox an application so that it doesn't\ninterfere with other applications.\n\n26\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.740\nNow, you might say well,\nwhat is the benefit of that?\n\n27\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.440\nWell, I want you to think about it\nmaybe having a hardware platform that\n\n28\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.940\nan application doesn't natively run on.\n\n29\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.010\nMaybe, it doesn't have for instance\nyou're running another application.\n\n30\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.869\nMaybe you are in a test environment.\n\n31\n00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.594\nWell., what could you do to get\nan application running, right?\n\n32\n00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:00.790\nWhat we could install Hyper-V, right.\n\n33\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.930\nWe could virtualize\nthe entire operating system.\n\n34\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.650\nWe could slip stream into that VHD,\nthe application itself.\n\n35\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.410\nBut I want you to consider what we\nare doing, when we do that with hyperV.\n\n36\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.430\nWe're taking the entire\noperating system and\n\n37\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.730\nvirtualizing it to\nsupport one application.\n\n38\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.929\nOther thing to keep in mind is that your\nhardware is very restrictive when it comes\n\n39\n00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.042\nto the ability to run Hyper-V, right?\n\n40\n00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:27.840\nYou need a 64 bit operating system.\n\n41\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.185\nYour CPU has to support either\nIntel's VT technology or\n\n42\n00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:37.190\nAMDV so\nI have to have a CPU that supports it.\n\n43\n00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.910\nThen, we've got things like resources,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.090\nIf I wanna virtualize\nan application inside of Hyper-V,\n\n45\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.000\nI have to have 2 gigs of RAM for the host\nmachine, I have to have enough RAM for\n\n46\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.640\nthe guest operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.650\nAnd it doesn't stop there,\n\n48\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.010\nthen I have to have enough resources\nto run the application itself.\n\n49\n00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.280\nSo, there's a lot that we have to do.\n\n50\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.490\nNow, could you do this?\n\n51\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.990\nAbsolutely, that's what it's there for,\nthat's why we have Hyper-V.\n\n52\n00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.760\nBut it does come with some specifications\nthat your machines have to meet.\n\n53\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.840\nNow, image the ability to virtualize\nthe application itself and\n\n54\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.910\nrun it on a machine that\ndoesn't support a hypervisor.\n\n55\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.650\nThat's 32 bit.\n\n56\n00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.390\nThat doesn't have the resources to\nsupport a guest operating system and\n\n57\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.150\nthen the software that runs on it,\nas well.\n\n58\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.290\nWell, you might be saying,\nwell, Wes, you know what?\n\n59\n00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.270\nHow about we use remote app in Azure?\n\n60\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.310\nYou can certainly do that.\n\n61\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.600\nIn fact, that's where the trend is going\nto be using something like Azure as\n\n62\n00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.160\nremote app.\n\n63\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.770\nCuz it doesn't matter what the application\nis, it certainly doesn't matter what\n\n64\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.740\nthe platform is, because it's running on\na server across the Internet in the cloud.\n\n65\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.780\nBut what if you're in\na managed environment?\n\n66\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.850\nWhat if you're in an environment where\nyou have to do testing on products that,\n\n67\n00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.700\nwell, don't allow you to\nconnect to the Internet?\n\n68\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.690\nWell, now we've got an option here.\n\n69\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.510\nSure, if we wanna use something like\nremote app, we have to have all the server\n\n70\n00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.990\ninfrastructure in place, set everything up\njust to be able to test the application.\n\n71\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.820\nSo there are some limitations\nto what you can do sometimes and\n\n72\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.010\nthat's where App-V comes into play for us.\n\n73\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.140\nDan, for instance, when you don't have the\nresources on a machine to support Hyper-V.\n\n74\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.670\nAgain, for security purposes you need\nto isolate the testing platform and\n\n75\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.590\nyou can't connect outbound\nto the Internet, well,\n\n76\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.520\nthat kind of negates being\nable to use remote apps.\n\n77\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.220\nSo, Dan I would say that virtualization\nin App-V does have its place and\n\n78\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.450\nthat's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n79\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.680\n>> Yeah, it's a very pointed tool, but\nit is another tool in our tool kit for\n\n80\n00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.390\nthose very purposes of when\nwe're going to need it.\n\n81\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.460\nAnd maybe that's few and far between.\n\n82\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.360\nMaybe that's your daily environment.\n\n83\n00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.990\nWho knows?\nWe just wanna give you guys resources that\n\n84\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.490\nare available for Microsoft that you\ncan use and whenever you do need them.\n\n85\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.270\nAnd now that you've sold us on it,\nWes, and\n\n86\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.510\nobviously it's the greatest thing\nsince sliced bread, obviously.\n\n87\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.830\nAnd something we want,\nwhat do we need to do to prepare for this?\n\n88\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.460\n>> Very good, so as we've been\ntalking about, and we're not gonna\n\n89\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.160\nshow you this again guys, cuz we've\ndefinitely show you this over and over.\n\n90\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.550\nYou're gonna need to MDOP ISO, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.790\nAnd like we've seen, maybe you\nhaven't seen us in past episodes,\n\n92\n00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.352\nso you're gonna mount the ISO.\n\n93\n00:04:57.352 --> 00:04:59.540\nYou're gonna see that the folders\nare gonna be there, and\n\n94\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.140\nyou're gonna extract the folder\nright to your desktop.\n\n95\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.850\nAnd we've gone ahead and\ndone that already.\n\n96\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.900\nBut, before we do that,\n\n97\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.725\nlet me show you another scenario\nthat might get you into a problem,\n\n98\n00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:13.265\nwhen do you need to use multiple\napplications on the same platform?\n\n99\n00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:17.045\nSo, if we take a look at my machine right\nhere, you're gonna see that I have,\n\n100\n00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:18.605\nwell I have two installers.\n\n101\n00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:25.191\nFor our purposes today,\nwe are using the Notepad++ here.\n\n102\n00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.045\nGo ahead and run that really quick.\n\n103\n00:05:27.045 --> 00:05:28.050\nThere we go.\n\n104\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.583\nZoom in here, so you guys can see it.\n\n105\n00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:34.170\nAnd we've got 6.8.4 and we've got 6.9.1.\n\n106\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.540\nWell, some of you guys probably recognize\nthat if you're running an older\n\n107\n00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.790\npiece of software, you can see that I've\ngot installed on this machine already.\n\n108\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.200\nNotice that I have Notepad and\nwe'll kind of zoom over to the side here.\n\n109\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.840\nI've got Notepad++ already and\nit is 6.8.4.\n\n110\n00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.328\nAll right, now what happens if I go to,\nI wanna test this new application.\n\n111\n00:05:57.328 --> 00:06:00.560\nBut I wanna see how it runs side by\nside with my current application,\n\n112\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.930\nbecause my company needs to determine,\nis it really worth their investment,\n\n113\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.980\nmaybe licensing cost,\nto go the new application?\n\n114\n00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.050\nWell, if I click my 6.9.1 installer and\nwe run through the installation wizard.\n\n115\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.460\nNothing big here.\n\n116\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.690\nEvery one of you have probably run through\none of these installation wizards.\n\n117\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.950\nOne point or another,\nyou run through the wizard, and\n\n118\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.790\nnow we're gonna test these\napplications side by side.\n\n119\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.480\nWell, here's the problem with that.\n\n120\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.635\nUsually when you install newer software,\nover older software, what happens?\n\n121\n00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:35.265\nThe newer software typically\noverwrites the old, I mean,\n\n122\n00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:37.115\nthat's just the way software works.\n\n123\n00:06:37.115 --> 00:06:40.225\nOr, I know Office does this, right.\n\n124\n00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:42.345\nOffice cuz we detected an older\ninstallation of Office,\n\n125\n00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:44.405\nplease uninstall those\ncomponents first and\n\n126\n00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:47.545\nthen come back to the installer and\nstart with a clean slate.\n\n127\n00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:51.445\nWell, the problem with that is, it doesn't\ngive you the ability to do side by side\n\n128\n00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:54.930\ntesting and we can even go a little\nbit further than that right.\n\n129\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.630\nWe can go down here and we can look and\nsee what we have for Notepad++ again.\n\n130\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.650\nWell now, I still have Notepad++, but\nwhen I zoom a little bit over here to\n\n131\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.629\nthe right,\nyou're gonna notice that it's, what?\n\n132\n00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:07.635\n6.9.1.\n\n133\n00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:12.325\nAnd so I've essentially overwritten\nthe old application and now my\n\n134\n00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:16.635\nteam really doesn't have the ability to\naccurately test side by side, are there\n\n135\n00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:20.685\nnew features that aren't in the older one\nthat might be beneficial to our company.\n\n136\n00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:24.640\nOr even worse maybe unbeneficial to\nour company, it breaks our machines.\n\n137\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.150\nSo, it does lend, and\nthat's where App-V kinda comes in.\n\n138\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.540\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nask where kinda talking about this.\n\n139\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.640\nWe'll go ahead and\nthen just shut this down.\n\n140\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.610\nAnd we're gonna reinstall\nthe older addition in here.\n\n141\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.890\nWe'll get started with App-V and\nshow you where the benefit comes in.\n\n142\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.960\nNow, there's a couple of components that\nyou have to do in order to use App-V,\n\n143\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.700\nand a couple of different procedures.\n\n144\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.357\nOne of the first procedures that we\nneed to look at is what is known\n\n145\n00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:52.070\nas application sequencing.\n\n146\n00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.234\nAll right, with application sequencing,\n\n147\n00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:57.515\nit does require you to prepare\nthe technician's computer first.\n\n148\n00:07:57.515 --> 00:08:00.858\nAgain, keep in mind,\nyou download the MDOT software.\n\n149\n00:08:00.858 --> 00:08:04.720\nYou mount the ISO and you copy that\nfolder right out to the desktop.\n\n150\n00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.510\nSo we've done that right here.\n\n151\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.100\nI've got App-V.\n\n152\n00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.980\nThe App-V folder right here.\n\n153\n00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.860\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n154\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.460\nLet's dig into that folder and\nwe got a couple of options here.\n\n155\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.150\nWe got a couple of other folders.\n\n156\n00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.440\nNow like we've see in the MDOT series,\nit does follow a pretty good consistency,\n\n157\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.827\nyou can see that we've got\na series of folders here.\n\n158\n00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:27.735\nKeep in mind in some of the other\nones you'll just have Installer, and\n\n159\n00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:30.170\nthen you have the architecture\nthat you're installing.\n\n160\n00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.420\nThis is a little bit different.\n\n161\n00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.900\nBecause it's gonna come in two parts.\n\n162\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.500\nRight?\n\n163\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.790\nYou'll have,\n\n164\n00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.970\nwhat we're gonna do here first to\nprepare the technician's computers.\n\n165\n00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.090\nYou use the sequencer, and\nthen the client will get into.\n\n166\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.160\nThe client's what allows your machines\nthat are gonna use virtualized\n\n167\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.910\napplications to well, do that very thing.\n\n168\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.160\nTo use the applications.\n\n169\n00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.310\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's start with the App-V Sequencer, and\n\n170\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.260\nagain I'm just going\ninto the App-V folder.\n\n171\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.780\nI'm gonna go ahead and just copy that\nright to the desktop, the Sequencer app,\n\n172\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.059\nand we're gonna go ahead and launch it.\n\n173\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.030\nNow, there are some things\nto know before you begin.\n\n174\n00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.590\nSome of the things you\nhave to be prepared for.\n\n175\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.570\nWe're gonna show you pretty much all of\nthose as we go through the installation.\n\n176\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.240\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose install here and you'll see, yep\n\n177\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.840\nonce we click install we'd better erelay\nand boy I think I probably signed up for\n\n178\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.961\na lot of giveaways at some point if that's\nin the erelays cuz I don't read them.\n\n179\n00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:24.356\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n180\n00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:28.540\nNow again, the CEI or\nCEIE, I can't even say it.\n\n181\n00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.710\nThe CEI program, the Customer\nExperience Improvement Program.\n\n182\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.070\nI'm gonna go ahead and opt out of that.\n\n183\n00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.070\nIt's interesting.\n\n184\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.840\nSome of the acronyms I'll ace them and\nthen other ones like three letters,\n\n185\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.400\nI can't even\n>> You need to use a remote\n\n186\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.860\n>> I'll butcher, I'll just massacre them.\n\n187\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.230\nSo it's going through\nthe installation process.\n\n188\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.440\nYou see that it completed successfully.\n\n189\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.740\nIf you do get any kind of MSI failure,\nI have seen that a couple of\n\n190\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.250\ntimes when you're extracting these folders\nout when you're downloading the folders.\n\n191\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.770\nOne of the things to keep in mind,\npretty much with any software so\n\n192\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.070\nI guess this would be relative\nto any software you download.\n\n193\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.720\nThey usually have checksums and\nyou can find the checksum.\n\n194\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.290\nWhat it's supposed to be, and then you\ncan run that hashing algorithm over it,\n\n195\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.710\njust to make sure that they match up so\n\n196\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.020\nthat the SMI files you know contained\ninside of the ISO aren't corrupt.\n\n197\n00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.690\nSo, if you do get that right there\nwhere it says MSI installation failed,\n\n198\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.550\njust check the ISO.\n\n199\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.730\nYou might have to redownload it, and\n\n200\n00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.030\nyou just might have\na corrupted MSI file in there.\n\n201\n00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.960\nRedownload it and try the installation\nover, and if it works,\n\n202\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.280\nyou'll know that that's what's going on.\n\n203\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.870\nSo buy, that was an absolute\ndifficult installation.\n\n204\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.610\nI'm glad you guys joined us for that one.\n\n205\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.710\nYou can see it's pretty easy,\n\n206\n00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.270\nright as far as installing the software\nreally doesn't give us too hard of a time.\n\n207\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.800\nNow the next thing that we're gonna do is\nactually start the sequencing process.\n\n208\n00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.260\nNow, with the sequencing process,\n\n209\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.730\nhere's some of the things to understand\nthat you have to have ahead of time.\n\n210\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.600\nFirst of all you have to\nhave the application itself.\n\n211\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.290\nAll right?\nNow I've showed you that we've had\n\n212\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.960\nthe application here on the desktop.\n\n213\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.126\nRemember we have, and\njust to verify that so\n\n214\n00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:03.929\nyou guys can see that we don't have\nany tricks up our sleeves here.\n\n215\n00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:10.083\nThat we are showing you that we have\nNotepad++ and we're back to that 6.8.4.\n\n216\n00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:13.347\nAnd that's gonna be important here\nbecause we wanna show you that this truly\n\n217\n00:11:13.347 --> 00:11:15.897\nare gonna, once we get on seat\nwhat's in the application,\n\n218\n00:11:15.897 --> 00:11:17.530\nthat they're gonna run side by side.\n\n219\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.155\nSo that puts the software\ndown in our start menu.\n\n220\n00:11:21.155 --> 00:11:25.047\nNow all right and\nif we scroll down, you'll have this\n\n221\n00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:30.165\nMicrosoft Application Virtualization\nright here on the start menu.\n\n222\n00:11:30.165 --> 00:11:31.980\nAnd we're gonna get down into this and\n\n223\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.840\nit's interesting it's\na door in front of a door.\n\n224\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.810\nYou'll see that it launches\nthe application virtualization sequencer.\n\n225\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.430\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and pin this to\nthe task bar so I can find it again.\n\n226\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.370\nMakes it a little easier for me.\n\n227\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.560\nNow, we'll talk about\nthe second option here.\n\n228\n00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.110\nYou'll see a couple of options here.\n\n229\n00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.170\nYou'll see creating a new\nvirtual application package and\n\n230\n00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.487\nmodifying an existing\nvirtualization application package.\n\n231\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.040\nWe're gonna take care of the second\none coming up a little bit\n\n232\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.150\nlater within our\nvirtualization episode here.\n\n233\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.053\nWe're gonna start by\ncreating a new package.\n\n234\n00:12:08.053 --> 00:12:12.625\nNow when we do this,\nit gives us a couple of options.\n\n235\n00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:15.065\nWe're gonna use the default b.\n\n236\n00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:17.475\nCreate a package using\na package accelerator.\n\n237\n00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:21.535\nThese are for very complex applications\nthat maybe don't like to be sequenced, and\n\n238\n00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:23.215\nhave a lot of intricacies in there.\n\n239\n00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:25.505\nWhat you can do,\nis use an existing package and\n\n240\n00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:29.475\ncreate a package accelerator, and it helps\nto automate some of this process for you.\n\n241\n00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:34.370\nBut we really don't want the automation\nside of it because that would pretty much\n\n242\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.780\ntake the fun out of seeing\nwhat we're doing here.\n\n243\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.230\nSo we're gonna live dangerously and\nwe're gonna do the default choose next.\n\n244\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.790\nAll right.\n\n245\n00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.780\nNow, this is something that\nis important to keep in mind.\n\n246\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.260\nNotice that you have to\nprepare the computer, right?\n\n247\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.620\nThat's part of preparing\nthe technician's computer.\n\n248\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.640\nSo, we have a whole bunch of\nstuff that we need to do.\n\n249\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.260\nNotice that the first thing it\nsays is there a pending restart\n\n250\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.360\noperation detected?\n\n251\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.000\nSo, before we do anything else,\nwe're gonna go ahead and restart.\n\n252\n00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.620\nNow, I left this in so\nyou could see that it's required.\n\n253\n00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.110\nThis is part of the preparation.\n\n254\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.817\nWhat can happen Dan, is if it sees\na pending application, if you will,\n\n255\n00:13:11.817 --> 00:13:16.446\nif it sees a pending reboot,\nthen it could have information that maybe\n\n256\n00:13:16.446 --> 00:13:20.772\nan installer package is gonna\ndelete part of the reboot process.\n\n257\n00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:24.540\nAnd it could put unnecessary\ninformation inside of your package.\n\n258\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.210\nOr it could negate some things\nthat need to be in there.\n\n259\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.240\nBased on that pending restart.\n\n260\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.920\nNow some of the other things that we can\nsee there too is we have a couple of\n\n261\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.920\nservices that we need to start or\nwe need to get stopped as well.\n\n262\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.330\nAnd why is that?\n\n263\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.110\nWell, some of these\nservices specifically like\n\n264\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.720\nyou'll see the search functionality\nin Windows could really,\n\n265\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.820\nreally corrupt the virtualization package,\nthe anti-virus.\n\n266\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.740\nSee if I could type this password again.\n\n267\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.695\nI should have changed it to something\neasier, like 123456 [LAUGH].\n\n268\n00:13:55.695 --> 00:13:58.675\nAnd so, some of the services that\ncould cause problems is as well.\n\n269\n00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.155\nAgain, antivirus software.\n\n270\n00:14:00.155 --> 00:14:04.835\nRemember, as this is\nan administrative level program,\n\n271\n00:14:04.835 --> 00:14:08.295\nyour antivirus software might flag it,\nmight cause problems.\n\n272\n00:14:08.295 --> 00:14:10.715\nSo, any time that those search\nfunctionalities are going on in\n\n273\n00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:11.315\nthe background,\n\n274\n00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:16.980\nI would definitely take care of before\nyou start your package sequencing.\n\n275\n00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.180\nAll right, so we're gonna go back to this.\n\n276\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.430\nYou might see that we\nare here a couple of times.\n\n277\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.130\nNow, I'm gonna wait a second here.\n\n278\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.180\nYou might notice right here,\nit says Windows Defender is active and\n\n279\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.480\nanother application is running.\n\n280\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.620\nSometimes, you might get\nanother application is running,\n\n281\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.150\nand there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n282\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.760\nAnd let me show you what I mean by that.\n\n283\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.560\nIf we look, the only application other\nthan task manager that I just opened up\n\n284\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.078\nthat's running is\napplication virtualization.\n\n285\n00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:43.898\nSo if that happens,\nsometimes you just can't help that.\n\n286\n00:14:43.898 --> 00:14:47.695\n>> So Wes, are these like non-starters.\n\n287\n00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:50.781\nIf we see this list of those things\nin there do we have to stop,\n\n288\n00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:54.550\ntake care of them and then we can\nproceed or they are basically like?\n\n289\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.610\nYou might not get the greatest experience,\nif you see, because of these items.\n\n290\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.260\n>> That is a good question Dan.\n\n291\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.510\nWith the majority of the ones that we were\ndoing, I would recommend taking care of\n\n292\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.120\nthem before you even start\nyour package sequencing.\n\n293\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.560\nNow, again when you have\nthe other applications in here,\n\n294\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.150\nsometimes there isn't anything\nyou can do about that.\n\n295\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.680\nOne of the ones that isn't showing up that\nwould show up too, and I'm gonna show you\n\n296\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.660\nwhere to disable it even though it's\nnot showing up right now on our list.\n\n297\n00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.300\nIn fact, if this ever happens and\nthe refresh isn't working,\n\n298\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.470\nyou're gonna notice I'm closing it\ndown and I'm just restarting it over.\n\n299\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.900\nIf that happens and\nyou know you've closed down a service,\n\n300\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.370\nthen you can always start\nthe application sequencer over again.\n\n301\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.430\nNow, so, we're gonna turn\noff Windows Defender, right.\n\n302\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.710\nSo we'll go over to our\naction center here.\n\n303\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.400\nWe'll go to all settings,\nwe're gonna go to update and security.\n\n304\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.450\nAnd we're gonna go to Windows Defender.\n\n305\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.480\nNow keep in mind that you don't wanna\nbe doing this on a production machine\n\n306\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.110\nconnected to your network right,\ncuz what am I gonna do?\n\n307\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.722\nI'm gonna turn off real\ntime protection right?\n\n308\n00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:55.868\nThe anti virus software and the real\ntime protection can get in the way.\n\n309\n00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:58.330\nSo now what we wanna do is\nwe wanna refresh this right?\n\n310\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.023\nNotice that our application is gone.\n\n311\n00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:04.880\nAnd that's why I said sometimes\nyou just gotta take a second.\n\n312\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.730\nAnd Dan, I believe you hit into it as\nwell, sometimes your startup applications,\n\n313\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.870\nif you got an application that's\nconfigured in Task Manager\n\n314\n00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:17.350\nto start up by default here\nnotice I've got a few of them.\n\n315\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.870\nMoat of them are disabled,\nI'd almost be willing to bet,\n\n316\n00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.420\nthat that was that Real Tech HD\nAudio Manager that it was catching.\n\n317\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.870\nBut I turned off Defender, right?\n\n318\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.570\nAnd unfortunately,\nthere's the window surge,\n\n319\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.870\nthat's the one that I wanted to show you.\n\n320\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.660\nSo, I've done this enough now that I've\nnoticed to be a little bit patient,\n\n321\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.830\nwhile these services turn on and\nyou find out that they're here.\n\n322\n00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.350\nI can almost guarantee the Windows search\nis gonna come up even if doesn't show up\n\n323\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.460\nat first.\n\n324\n00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.520\nIndexing and all of that,\nfinding your files faster,\n\n325\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.890\nsometimes it doesn't start right away.\n\n326\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.280\nIt's actually set to an automatic delayed\nstart which says keep it out of my boot\n\n327\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.020\ntime but once boot's done go ahead and\nstart the service.\n\n328\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.520\nThe other place that we can stop a service\nis going to our typical services console.\n\n329\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.150\nAnd I know that this really isn't\na Windows 10 how to stop and\n\n330\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.440\nstart services but these are services\nthat will corrupt your virtualization\n\n331\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.170\npackage so, apparently I don't\nknow how to spell services, and\n\n332\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:16.720\nyou really do need to turn them off,\nthere's just no getting around it.\n\n333\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.160\nAlright so, we'll go ahead we're gonna go\ndown to, let's find Windows search and\n\n334\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.930\nyou can see that it says,\nactually I said it was automatic delayed,\n\n335\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.410\nI believe it's automatic delayed, this is\nactually set to automatic, either way,\n\n336\n00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.720\nit is on I'm gonna go ahead and\ndisable it and\n\n337\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.790\nstop it because I don't want it\nto just manually start again.\n\n338\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.660\nIf I click on File Explorer for\n\n339\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.810\nany reason, it's gonna trigger\nthe service to come back on.\n\n340\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.370\nSo we're gonna make sure that it's\nnot part of our sequencing app, or\n\n341\n00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.600\ninterfering I should say.\n\n342\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.660\nThen if we look in here\nWhat are we gonna find?\n\n343\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.520\nWe're gonna find Windows Defender, right?\n\n344\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.550\nUnfortunately we have a problem, Dan.\n\n345\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.420\nCan you tell me,\nhow would I shut this down?\n\n346\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.070\nIt's all grayed out.\n\n347\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.170\nI mean this is all great out,\nthere's nothing I can do.\n\n348\n00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.020\n>> Is it in startups?\n\n349\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:05.600\n>> That's right.\n\n350\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.290\n>> Startup options?\n\n351\n00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.970\n>> So one of the things to keep in mind is\nthat with Windows 10 they don't allow you\n\n352\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.420\nto turn off the Windows Defender service,\nso how do you sequence your app?\n\n353\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.570\nThat's okay,\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n354\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.850\nWe're going to show you\nhow to turn this off.\n\n355\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.420\nIf I type gpedit.msc there,\nI got a couple of these admx\n\n356\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.699\nfiles that aren't being found from other\nthings that I was doing on my machine.\n\n357\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.580\nAnd we get down in here to administrative\ntemplates and Windows components.\n\n358\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.400\nSo let me kinda zoom in so\nyou guys can see that out there.\n\n359\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.100\nI know that's kinda hard to see, but\n\n360\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.770\nthis is under the computer configuration,\nright?\n\n361\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.950\nWe're under computer config,\nadministrative template Windows component,\n\n362\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.020\nand then we're gonna scroll all\nthe way down to the bottom here.\n\n363\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.480\nWhen we get in to the W's there, and\nwe're gonna see Windows Defender.\n\n364\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.090\nNotice right here we've\ngot Windows Defender.\n\n365\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.860\nThat's the one you wanna select on.\n\n366\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.300\nKeep in mind I didn't expand it out.\n\n367\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.370\nThat's important,\n\n368\n00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.520\nbecause right over here we have a policy\nthat says turn off Windows Defender.\n\n369\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.880\nSo if you're running this on Windows 10,\nhint, hint.\n\n370\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.760\nYou're gonna disable it\nthrough the gpedit, all right?\n\n371\n00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.450\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to enable this.\n\n372\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.800\nNow be careful because you\ngotta love group policies.\n\n373\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.190\nEnabling it disables it?\n\n374\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.190\nSo yes it does.\n\n375\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.720\nI know it sounds confusing, but\nnotice what the setting says.\n\n376\n00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.740\nTurn off Window's Defender, enabled.\n\n377\n00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.960\nI know that's a little confusing there,\nand\n\n378\n00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.120\nthat always gets me about group policy,\nturning it on actually turns it off.\n\n379\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.970\nNow if I refresh my system,\nall of a sudden, what does it tell me?\n\n380\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.970\nYour system is ready to\ncreate a virtual package.\n\n381\n00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.330\nWe've taken care of what it\nsays is causing the problem.\n\n382\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:53.730\nNow, there's another thing that I will\ncome back to, I'd like to show you.\n\n383\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:59.600\nIf you get a, if you've already\nused your sequencer before,\n\n384\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.540\nyou might get this revert to\na clean state, and this is for\n\n385\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.180\nyou guys that are using\nit in a test environment.\n\n386\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.440\nI'll come back and show you that.\n\n387\n00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.965\nThere is a little registry\nmodification that you can make\n\n388\n00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:15.545\nto revert your machine to a clean state so\nyou can come back and run your package,\n\n389\n00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:18.495\nvirtualization package and\nthat's good for your testing environment.\n\n390\n00:20:18.495 --> 00:20:22.295\nI don't think it's really too necessary\nfor your production environment but\n\n391\n00:20:22.295 --> 00:20:24.990\ndefinitely if you're\ntesting this all right, so\n\n392\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.660\nthe next thing we're gonna do is we choose\nwhat type of installation do we want.\n\n393\n00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.030\nNow if we're running something\nlike applications like Excel and\n\n394\n00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.740\nwe need to have a plugin,\nwe can always add a plugin.\n\n395\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.540\nIf we have some kinda middle ware that's\nmanaging the communication between a web\n\n396\n00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.810\napplication and its database,\nwe can always do Middle ware, but\n\n397\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.300\nwhat I'm gonna do I'm gonna\nchoose the default here and\n\n398\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.650\nthat's just the standard application\ninstallation and we'll choose next.\n\n399\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.410\nAll right so far so good right?\n\n400\n00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.840\nNot too difficult yet.\n\n401\n00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.140\nAgain just as long as you know where\nto put these things you'll be fine.\n\n402\n00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.700\nSo now it's saying select\nthe installer for the application.\n\n403\n00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.350\nNow if you really,\nreally want to get customized to this,\n\n404\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.230\nyou could do this manually.\n\n405\n00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.510\nHowever I would just recommend if it comes\nwith an MSI or an installer package,\n\n406\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.410\nuse the installer package.\n\n407\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.680\nNow I'm going to go ahead and\nbrowse to this.\n\n408\n00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.780\nKeep in mind out of our desktop we've\ngot our newer version of our application\n\n409\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.460\nrunning, right.\n\n410\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.070\nWe are going to go ahead and\npoint to that.\n\n411\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.600\nNow virtualization application package\nname, what do you want to name it,\n\n412\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.970\nthe name to you is arbitrary\nas long as you can find it.\n\n413\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.280\nRemember in some of the other episodes\nwe've talked about naming convention and,\n\n414\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.780\nyou want to make sure that it's easily\nidentifiable, so I might call this\n\n415\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:53.200\nnotepad plus plus test, right?\n\n416\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.950\nBecause I want to distinguish\nit from the other notepad\n\n417\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.550\nplus plus that's running\nnatively on this machine.\n\n418\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.810\nNow, the next thing is the primary,\nand again,\n\n419\n00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.920\nI know these are hard to see out there,\nguys, hopefully that helps out.\n\n420\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.590\nThe next thing is the primary\nvirtual application directory.\n\n421\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.960\nThis is where by default if you\nwere installing this normally\n\n422\n00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.390\nwithout any application virtualization\nwhere would you point it to.\n\n423\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.940\nSo we've got to point it\nto that same location and\n\n424\n00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.850\nthat's what we're gonna do if\nwe browse we're in local disk\n\n425\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.560\nc I'm gonna scroll down to the program\nx 86 folder directory cuz that's where\n\n426\n00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.190\nnotepad plus plus gets installed by\ndefault we're gonna select that, and\n\n427\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.920\nyou should see that I already have\na notepad plus plus directory.\n\n428\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.230\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose that, and select this folder.\n\n429\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.280\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna move along.\n\n430\n00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.630\nAll right now what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna start a monitoring service that's\n\n431\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.370\ngonna monitor the installation.\n\n432\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.220\nAnd I do wanna just make mention\nyou might get where the service\n\n433\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.940\nfails to start one time where it says\nmonitoring service failed to start.\n\n434\n00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.350\nAgain guys that's okay it's a little\nglitch, close the sequencer down you can\n\n435\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.890\nback up a couple of steps and\nthen just repeat the process.\n\n436\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.730\nAnd then the monitor service initiates.\n\n437\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:10.160\nSo if that happens, and you guys can\ncounter that, you'll be prepared for it.\n\n438\n00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.700\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose okay, and Dan,\n\n439\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.640\nto kinda tell you what's going on in\nthe background for you guys out there,\n\n440\n00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.490\nwe've got a monitoring service that\nis looking at the registry and\n\n441\n00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.360\nall the locations and the packages\ncontained within this MSI installer file.\n\n442\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.860\nAnd it-\n>> Its monitoring service comes from the-\n\n443\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.340\n>> The sequencer itself.\n\n444\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.180\n>> Yeah, the sequencer itself, yes.\n\n445\n00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.770\n>> That's right, yeah absolutely.\n\n446\n00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.240\nAnd that's good because it's built in.\n\n447\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.510\nYou don't have to install another package.\n\n448\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.410\nNow, keep in mind, if you're going to\nbe trying to test your application\n\n449\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.670\non the same machine, there's a couple of\nthings that you have to go through here.\n\n450\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.490\nAll right, so we've run Notepad 6.9.1.\n\n451\n00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.368\nAll right.\n\n452\n00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:52.866\nSo, there's a couple of other\nthings that we're gonna do again,\n\n453\n00:23:52.866 --> 00:23:57.241\nall in preparing our technician's computer\nand that's because, if you notice,\n\n454\n00:23:57.241 --> 00:24:01.258\nI've got Notepad ++ here But if I look\nover here, it did a normal install.\n\n455\n00:24:01.258 --> 00:24:03.817\nSo what did it do,\nit set us up just like we did,\n\n456\n00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:06.860\nthe problem that we initially began with,\nall right?\n\n457\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.980\nAnd that is important to understand, but\n\n458\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.340\nkeep in mind you're on the you're\non the technician's computer.\n\n459\n00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340\nBig thing for\n\n460\n00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:19.060\nus here though is to remember I'm finished\ninstalling, you've done monitoring.\n\n461\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.940\nYou don't have to monitor anymore and\nchoose next.\n\n462\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.640\nAnd now what it's doing is that monitoring\nservice is scrapping together all of those\n\n463\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.110\nsystem's changes and that's gonna put\nit in basically XML configuration file.\n\n464\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.830\nSo that when the application\nis virtualized, and\n\n465\n00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.820\nyou go to run the virtualized msi file, it\nlooks at that XML setting, and says, okay,\n\n466\n00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.270\nhere's the configurations, and\n\n467\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.690\nhere's where you need to set stuff,\nas part of your installation.\n\n468\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.700\nNow, if I wanted to, if I wanted to\ndo additional changes to this, right,\n\n469\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.380\nif I had, maybe, I don't want the end\nusers to see the menu bar at the top,\n\n470\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.910\nmaybe I wanna change the icons and\nmake them larger.\n\n471\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.210\nGoing out the gate,\nwhen the first time they run these,\n\n472\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.740\nwell I could do some\nadditional configurations.\n\n473\n00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.070\nAnd then the monitor service would\ncollect that additional information and\n\n474\n00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.160\nthrow that in the XML files to say,\nhere's part of the post installation\n\n475\n00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.600\nprocess that you need to configure\nbefore you even launch the application.\n\n476\n00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.180\nSo really good how you can\ndeploy an application, and\n\n477\n00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.780\neven some of the post installation\nconfigurations are done,\n\n478\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.810\ngives you consistency across all of your\ndeployment, which consistency is nice.\n\n479\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.900\nAnd transparency at the end user\ntypically means a better experience for\n\n480\n00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.750\nthe end user as well.\n\n481\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.360\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose next, it's gonna collect any\n\n482\n00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:36.310\nadditional changes, we didn't run any\nadditional changes so we should be good.\n\n483\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.670\nWe've gone through that's the configure\nsoftware side allows your administrator to\n\n484\n00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:45.030\ndo post configurations,\nany post installations you wanna do\n\n485\n00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.950\ncan also be done if you wanna\nfurther customize this application.\n\n486\n00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.190\nAgain, if you want to\noptimize this package,\n\n487\n00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:56.520\nif it has to be streamed from\na publishing server over a slow network,\n\n488\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.600\nyou can optimize it for deployment\nacross the slow network as well.\n\n489\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.170\nHowever, we're going to go ahead and\nsay no, stop now and\n\n490\n00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.970\njust create the basic application package.\n\n491\n00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.240\nNow this is going to say,\n\n492\n00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.130\nthis is going to let us know where\nto we want to save this information.\n\n493\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:17.050\nI am going to put this is my description\n\n494\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:21.190\nbecause that is going to always\nbe helpful to the end user.\n\n495\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.710\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ncreate the virtual application.\n\n496\n00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.390\nAnd it does let me know that some of\nthe files were excluded from the package.\n\n497\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.740\nSo it does say just verify the package\nfunctionality, and we'll close that down.\n\n498\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.890\nAll right.\nLet's make sure we uninstall this because,\n\n499\n00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.170\nwell, if we don't then we're\nnot going to get coexistence,\n\n500\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.620\nbecause we already got\n6.9.1 running on here.\n\n501\n00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.180\nSo we'll go ahead and choose close.\n\n502\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.140\nAnd we're just going to\nreinstall the old application.\n\n503\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.800\nAnd we'll just run through\nthis installer real quick.\n\n504\n00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.030\nAgain we definitely want to show you\nthat these are running side by side.\n\n505\n00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.220\nAnd that we are going to verify too\non camera that we've got 6.8.4.\n\n506\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.590\nNow, I went ahead and\n\n507\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.480\nleft this without clicking it because\nthis might be another scenario.\n\n508\n00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.990\nNotice we're talking about your\ncompany is testing software.\n\n509\n00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.720\nWell, I can tell you as experience with\nthis application, it's reaching out right\n\n510\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.150\nnow, saying, wait, there's a 6.9.1,\ndo you want to update the package?\n\n511\n00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.910\nWell I don't know, do we?\n\n512\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.660\nIs it going to break our computers, is it\ngoing to break our production environment?\n\n513\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.340\nI'm not sure.\n\n514\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.190\nSo I'm going to say no to that, or\nthe episode's going to be over,\n\n515\n00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.980\ncuz we'll be upgraded anyways, and\nthen the next thing that we're going to do\n\n516\n00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.840\nis we are going to go ahead and\nrun our file here.\n\n517\n00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.800\nLet me go ahead and\nget down into where that file was put.\n\n518\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.810\nAll right, Program Files.\n\n519\n00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.450\n>> See if Wes can remember\nwhere he saved it.\n\n520\n00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.010\n>> Yeah, see if I can remember.\n\n521\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.610\nAnd I say that, and where is it?\n\n522\n00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.360\nShould be on the list.\n\n523\n00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.920\nThere it is, Notepad++, and\nyou can see that this is new.\n\n524\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.000\nAnd hopefully it'll run,\nthat's what we want.\n\n525\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.190\nWait, you know what?\n\n526\n00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.110\n[LAUGH] How about we\ninstall the MSI file first?\n\n527\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.050\n>> That could be helpful.\n\n528\n00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.900\n>> That could be.\nAnd it gives me a chance too to\n\n529\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.790\ntell you guys a little bit\nabout these files here.\n\n530\n00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.140\nGotta install the right ones,\nsee all this application installation,\n\n531\n00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.220\nI forgot which one we were.\n\n532\n00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.170\nYou're on the wrong side of the river.\n\n533\n00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.080\nLet's talk a little bit about these files\nhere before we actually go ahead and\n\n534\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.100\ndo the installation.\n\n535\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.485\nWe've got the very first one,\nNotePad++, and then you see the .appv.\n\n536\n00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:29.230\nThat appv is the virtualized\napplication file.\n\n537\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.740\nThe msi file is the installer\npackage that we can use with\n\n538\n00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:38.440\ntraditional deployment methods\nby putting it in, for instance,\n\n539\n00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.510\ngroup policy, and\npublishing it out to computers.\n\n540\n00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:46.540\nNow I have an MSI installer file, provided\nI've got the application client running.\n\n541\n00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.130\nSo that takes me to the next\nthing that we have to do Dan,\n\n542\n00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.600\nbut I do see that we are kind\nof running out of time.\n\n543\n00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.490\nI think I talked a little\nbit too much on this one.\n\n544\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.470\nSo we do have to still install\nthe client on the machine.\n\n545\n00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.080\nAnd that's called the application\nvirtualization client for\n\n546\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.330\nit to be able to run that application,\nbut that's gonna take a little bit.\n\n547\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.580\nSo I'm not sure if we'll have\nenough time in this one.\n\n548\n00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.420\n>> Well you know what?\n\n549\n00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:08.970\nNot a big deal.\n\n550\n00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.250\nWe can always come back and\ndo part two for that.\n\n551\n00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.010\nAnd I don't know about you guys, but\nI kinda wanna see how this ends.\n\n552\n00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.940\nI wanna see the finished product.\n\n553\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.110\n>> That's right.\n\n554\n00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.110\n>> So that we can things.\n\n555\n00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.900\nSo that's what we'll do.\n\n556\n00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.060\nWe'll do a part two.\n\n557\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.000\nWe do thank you for\nexplaining up to this point thus far.\n\n558\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.300\nWe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n559\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.330\nAnd hopefully we'll see you there as well.\n\n560\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.330\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n561\n00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.100\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n562\n00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.905\nWe'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:20.939\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.512\nour Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:28.416\nJoining us back in the studio again today,\nshould I say, for a little part two\n\n6\n00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:32.815\non application virtualization is\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:33.977\nWes, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:38.049\n>> It's going great, Dan, thanks and\nas always good to be here with ITProTV and\n\n9\n00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:41.400\nright part two of our\napplication virtualization.\n\n10\n00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.110\nIn the first part,\n\n11\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.690\none of the things that we took care\nof was sequencing an application,\n\n12\n00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.740\nwell, really preparing a technician's\ncomputer to even sequence and application.\n\n13\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.050\nWe made sure that some of\nthe prerequisites were taken care of,\n\n14\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.320\nremember some of the services that needed\nto be disabled, any pending restarts,\n\n15\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.720\nto get our technician computer where it\nneeds to be so that when the application\n\n16\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.500\nis sequenced, well,\nthe sequencing happens the way it should.\n\n17\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.140\nSo now we're into part two, and\nwhat's the other side of the tracks?\n\n18\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.690\nWell, that is running the application\nvirtualization client.\n\n19\n00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.010\nNow, the client has to be\nrun on any target computer,\n\n20\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.560\nthat's gonna run a virtualized app.\n\n21\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.086\nAnd that application virtualization\nclient is what really sandboxes and\n\n22\n00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:25.247\nvirtualizes this instance of this\napplication through things like\n\n23\n00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:30.290\nvirtualized application packages,\neven its own virtualized registry system.\n\n24\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.063\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:33.063 --> 00:01:37.379\nRemember that you have to have your\nApp-V files out of the MDOP ISO,\n\n26\n00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:42.528\nremember we have mounted that MDOP ISO,\nand we extracted the App-V folder out,\n\n27\n00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:45.805\nand we used the sequencer\nin the first part of this.\n\n28\n00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:49.530\nBut now what we're gonna do is we're\nactually gonna look at the client folder.\n\n29\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.050\nKeep in mind that you do have\nthe documentation there if you\n\n30\n00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.010\nneed to read it.\n\n31\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.300\nIt comes in a few different languages and\n\n32\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.570\nreally just gives you\na link out to TechNet.\n\n33\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.410\nSo I'd recommend it.\n\n34\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.110\nIf this is the first time you've seen\nthis, definitely watch the videos, but\n\n35\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.950\ndefinitely use those URLs\nin the documentation.\n\n36\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.860\nThey are very helpful.\n\n37\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.850\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.890\nI'm just gonna pull the application\nclient executable here to the desktop.\n\n39\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.110\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna run this.\n\n40\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.770\nNotice that, well,\nit's the same installer that we've seen.\n\n41\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.534\nThe difference is, well,\nthis is the client and not the sequencer.\n\n42\n00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:22.771\nWe'll go ahead and choose Install,\n\n43\n00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.910\nwe've got another EULA here that we've got\nto accept and we're gonna choose next.\n\n44\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.430\nRemember with the Customer Experience\nImprovement Program you can opt in or\n\n45\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.190\nopt out as you choose.\n\n46\n00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.060\nAnd we're gonna choose Install.\n\n47\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.170\nNow, one of the things that you might\nnotice is that you have to be a local\n\n48\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.060\nadministrator on the machine\nto install the client,\n\n49\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.110\nthat is very important\nstandard users can not,\n\n50\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.810\nso have this provision on your machines\nprior to deploying an application so\n\n51\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.219\nthat the end user experience\nreally isn't hindered at all.\n\n52\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.400\nAnd as it goes to the installation process\nyou'll see that the next thing that we're\n\n53\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.910\ngonna do is we're going to\nthe virtualize package that we ran,\n\n54\n00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.940\nwe're gonna actually go ahead and\nrun that MSI file.\n\n55\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.610\nSo we extract it, when we ran\nour sequencer we went ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.990\nput our virtualized application\nhere on the desktop,\n\n57\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.500\nwe'll see we have our MSI file here.\n\n58\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.100\nAnd keep in mind that, remember, we\nare running the 6.8.4 in the background.\n\n59\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.940\nWe'll go ahead and\ninstall our virtualized app here.\n\n60\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.590\nAnd, well, Dan,\nit doesn't look like it did much there.\n\n61\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.030\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna hope that it runs.\n\n62\n00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.780\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll get down into our Start menu.\n\n63\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.960\nNotice there's a Recently added.\n\n64\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.950\nI'll go ahead and look down.\n\n65\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.960\nYou can see the folder down here for\nNotepad++.\n\n66\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.700\nWe're gonna launch that and\nwe've got a 6.9.1.\n\n67\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.926\nNow, I do want to take a second here,\nwhile we've got all these screens open and\n\n68\n00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:52.144\ngo ahead and open another screen,\n[LAUGH] and we wanna look and\n\n69\n00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:53.869\nsee that we're still running.\n\n70\n00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:58.628\nYou'll see it over here, the 6.8.4 there,\n\n71\n00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:03.274\nand that is actually\nrunning in the background,\n\n72\n00:04:03.274 --> 00:04:06.830\nside by side, with our 6.8.4.\n\n73\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.750\nSo we get that side-by-side\napplication coexistence.\n\n74\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.200\nWe can test this product out, the 6.9.1,\ndetermine if we want to use it.\n\n75\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.460\nAt the same time,\n\n76\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.360\nit's not interfering with the earlier\naddition of this software.\n\n77\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.730\nSo really cool technology then,\nto be able to test these\n\n78\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.100\napplications side-by-side, but there are\nsome things that you also have to look at.\n\n79\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.164\nSo I'd like to just take a second here and\n\n80\n00:04:33.164 --> 00:04:37.070\ntalk a little bit about some of the\ntroubleshooting that you might run into.\n\n81\n00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.602\nFor instance, if you are troubleshooting,\n\n82\n00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:43.815\nlet me show you an Event Viewer\nwhere you can go real quick.\n\n83\n00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:47.765\nIf we get down to Event Viewer, this\nis gonna be, in some of the logs you've\n\n84\n00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:51.990\nprobably seen before, this is in the\nApplications and Services log over here.\n\n85\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.870\nAnd we can expand that out,\nexpand out Microsoft,\n\n86\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.000\nand right here at the top, you'll see that\nwe have two different categories here.\n\n87\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.570\nWe've got client and sequencer.\n\n88\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.070\nIf we want,\nwe can get operational logs, find out.\n\n89\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.940\nIn admin logs, for instance,\nI'm gonna see a handful of errors.\n\n90\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.520\nWe're moving packages and stuff.\n\n91\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.690\nSo if you are, for\n\n92\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.630\ninstance, troubleshooting App-V,\nyou can look at the administration side.\n\n93\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.110\nThe virtualized applications,\ntoo, you can see that note.\n\n94\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.401\nAs far as the sequencer goes,\nyou also have administration options here.\n\n95\n00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.531\nAnd we can look down\nthrough those differend,\n\n96\n00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.490\nit looks like we've got a whole\nbunch of warnings going on here.\n\n97\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.410\nAnd then, obviously,\nwe also have the operational log.\n\n98\n00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.050\nSo that's one place, remember\nthe App-V event logs that you can go,\n\n99\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.760\nif you are troubleshooting some\nof the other things, like for\n\n100\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.360\ninstance the sequencer itself,\n\n101\n00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.180\nkeep in mind when you're creating\na new application package,\n\n102\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.010\ndo you have things like for\ninstance is WIndows Defender active?\n\n103\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.270\nKeep in mind,\nif it is you do have to diable to service.\n\n104\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.032\nRemember you don't really wanna\ndo this on a production machine,\n\n105\n00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:00.316\nbecause you're obviously\ndisabling the anti virus.\n\n106\n00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:04.241\nAntivirus, if you have a standalone\nantivirus software that you're running,\n\n107\n00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:08.940\nthat would hinder the overall package\ncreation, again, could corrupt it.\n\n108\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.820\nRemember how all the installation files\nbeing copied to the sequencing computer.\n\n109\n00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.780\nIf you have additional application files,\nand\n\n110\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.330\nthey do give you spot\nduring the sequencing.\n\n111\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.730\nThat if you do have an additional files\nthat you need to include the package,\n\n112\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.860\nwhich I guess you just have to have\nthem on the machine before you start\n\n113\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.670\nthe sequencing process.\n\n114\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.630\nNow, as far as the misconfiguration\nof packages go,\n\n115\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.710\nthere are some things that\nyou have to worry about that.\n\n116\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.060\nMost often you're gonna do just\nthe standard package creation.\n\n117\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.280\nIf you're using plug-ins,\n\n118\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.649\nyou have virtualized plug-ins\nthat talk to applications and\n\n119\n00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:47.279\nthey talk to a communication\npathway called a connection group.\n\n120\n00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.618\nSo if you are doing the add-ins and\nplug-ins,\n\n121\n00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:52.905\nmake sure you have your connection\ngroups configured correctly.\n\n122\n00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:55.730\nThe other thing is\nthe MSI file themselves.\n\n123\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.980\nIf you do get a bad sequence stuff, if for\n\n124\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.720\nsome reason it doesn't run, you could be\nlooking at your original installer file.\n\n125\n00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.840\nAnd I'm not talking about what the app\nsequence or produces that MSI file,\n\n126\n00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.260\nI'm talking the installation file of\nthe application if you were gonna\n\n127\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.700\ninstall it locally.\n\n128\n00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.423\nIf that file is corrupted, then the\nsequencing isn't gonna happen correctly.\n\n129\n00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:23.772\nMake sure that the application\nitself has finished its sequencing\n\n130\n00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:29.789\nas part of the normal installation if\nyou have to do post configurations and\n\n131\n00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:33.629\nyou forget those that\ncould cause the problem.\n\n132\n00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:35.680\nAgain, we've already talked\nabout the additional files.\n\n133\n00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.773\nOptimizing the package, if you\nare streaming this over an unreliable or\n\n134\n00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:44.485\nslow network, keep in mind that you can\noptimize it for a slow network connection.\n\n135\n00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:49.406\nAnd then, what happens if, for instance,\nyou decide, well, I'm restricting certain\n\n136\n00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:53.164\noperating systems, or if you\nare restricting operating systems and\n\n137\n00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:56.789\nyou only want it to run on a certain\nversion of an operating system,\n\n138\n00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.140\nmaybe you configured that wrong,\nand let me show you.\n\n139\n00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.240\nSo Dan, now that we've got our\napplication package virtualized,\n\n140\n00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.620\nwhat if we've made some mistakes?\n\n141\n00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.520\nI might have to edit\nthat application file.\n\n142\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440\nNow, there's a couple different\nways that you could do this.\n\n143\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.580\nLet me show you one way and\nthen I'll show you the easy way.\n\n144\n00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.438\nIf we go to our application\nvirtualization,\n\n145\n00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:22.570\nyou'll notice that there was an option\nhere that we kinda looked at, and\n\n146\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.220\nthat was this, the other option\nto modify an existing package.\n\n147\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.650\nNow, I could use this route.\n\n148\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.980\nAnd what it's gonna do is, it's gonna ask\nme to do this update an existing package,\n\n149\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.340\ndo I wanna edit or add a new application.\n\n150\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.157\nAnd notice the screen\nthat it takes you to.\n\n151\n00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:43.701\nLet me show something that's kinda easier\nif you have the sequencer installed which\n\n152\n00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:48.120\nyou should in your sequencing machine\nin your administrator machine.\n\n153\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.014\nNotice that virtualized file.\n\n154\n00:08:50.014 --> 00:08:55.604\nWell, if you look at that virtualized\nfile the one with the .appv extension,\n\n155\n00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:58.330\nall I have to do is click on that.\n\n156\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.540\nAnd notice that it's gonna start that\napplication sequencer process again.\n\n157\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.160\nAnd it takes me right to the screen.\n\n158\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.220\nAnd you skip all that process.\n\n159\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.471\nI know it's only a couple of clicks,\nbut if you've got the App-V file and\n\n160\n00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:12.148\nit is is located on the same\ncomputer that your sequencer is,\n\n161\n00:09:12.148 --> 00:09:13.947\nwhich it needs to be to modify it anyway.\n\n162\n00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:17.514\nIt's gonna know right away that, hey,\nthis is already an existing package, so\n\n163\n00:09:17.514 --> 00:09:19.360\nI don't need to ask you those questions.\n\n164\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.290\nLet's go ahead and open it up and\ntake you right to what you need to do.\n\n165\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.974\nAgain, I can update it,\nI can edit the package, or\n\n166\n00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:27.791\nadd a new application if I need to.\n\n167\n00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.560\nLet's go ahead and look real quick,\njust plan that real quick,\n\n168\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.710\njust briefly that's editing the package\nand some things you can do with this.\n\n169\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:41.020\nNow, it's asking me to point it to\nthe application itself, the package.\n\n170\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.340\nAnd this is why I like\nclicking on the file itself,\n\n171\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.080\nI don't have to type this crazy long\npath out as part of the Wizard.\n\n172\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.700\nIt already knew, it says, well,\nI already know where that application is,\n\n173\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.260\nyou clicked on it so it's gotta be\nin the location that you clicked on,\n\n174\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.790\nand that makes it a lot easier for\nWes there [LAUGH].\n\n175\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.920\nNow, when the editor comes up,\n\n176\n00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.070\nyou get a few series of tabs and\noptions that you can use.\n\n177\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.428\nProperties, you can see GUID.\n\n178\n00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:09.383\nEvery piece of software has a GUID,\n\n179\n00:10:09.383 --> 00:10:13.830\nthat string of numbers globally unique\nthat identifies the software, itself.\n\n180\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.550\nAnd then,\nthe packaged version of the GUID.\n\n181\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.420\nNow, here's where we're\ntalking about deployment.\n\n182\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.850\nLet's say notice that the architecture\nsays Any Operating System here.\n\n183\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.020\nWell, what if I wanted to restrict this or\nmaybe I have restricted it to only certain\n\n184\n00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.840\neditions of Windows and then certain\nplatforms, architecture specifically.\n\n185\n00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.680\nWell, again, if I've configured this\nwrong, maybe for instance I put Windows 7\n\n186\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.590\n32 bit, notice that it's\ngiven me an error right here.\n\n187\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.248\nIt says, hey, you should sequence this\nwith the earliest version in the operating\n\n188\n00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:48.562\nsystem in your environment.\n\n189\n00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:52.553\nBut if I take this and\nlet's take Windows 7 out, and\n\n190\n00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:55.386\nagain we put Windows 8.1 in here.\n\n191\n00:10:55.386 --> 00:11:00.350\nNotice it didn't give me a hard time about\nthat because this sequencer says, yeah,\n\n192\n00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.720\nI know Windows 8.1.\n\n193\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.390\nI'm as close to that as\nyou pretty much come.\n\n194\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.970\nSo there's no problem.\n\n195\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.360\nThat could be something that causes\na problem in your deployment or\n\n196\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.810\nyour virtualized applications.\n\n197\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.850\nI'm just gonna leave it to any\noperating system here, and\n\n198\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.920\nit makes it a little easier for me.\n\n199\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.970\nBut keep that in mind.\n\n200\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.040\nYou can see that some of the things\nthat come up, as part of that process.\n\n201\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.240\nNow, what if Dan wants to\naudit the change history?\n\n202\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.020\nWhat if I have made a couple of changes,\nand something isn't going right?\n\n203\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.427\nAnd Dan wants not to point the finger,\nbut for audit purposes?\n\n204\n00:11:28.427 --> 00:11:29.385\n>> Not for pointing the finger [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:31.788\n>> Not for pointing the finger,\nonly for pointing the finger.\n\n206\n00:11:31.788 --> 00:11:33.448\n[LAUGH] Well,\nwe could go to the change history.\n\n207\n00:11:33.448 --> 00:11:37.740\nAnd what's kinda cool about this, is it\nsays, hey, Wes was the one that did it.\n\n208\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.060\nI can't turn around and\nsay non-repediation.\n\n209\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.301\nI can turn around and say Dan,\nI don't know what you're talking about,\n\n210\n00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:43.277\nit wasn't me that changed it.\n\n211\n00:11:43.277 --> 00:11:46.758\nAnd he can say, well, Dan,\nthere's the information here, so\n\n212\n00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:49.091\nif anybody misconfigured it, it was you.\n\n213\n00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:53.938\n[LAUGH] And you can see the operating\nsystem version that it was sequenced\n\n214\n00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:57.250\non and that's a good information to know.\n\n215\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:03.460\nThe Windows version, here you can\nsee what processor family it was,\n\n216\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.570\nterminal services, and the .NET framework.\n\n217\n00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.110\nSo basically it gets the metadata\nabout the change history.\n\n218\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.942\nVirtual registry, now this is really cool.\n\n219\n00:12:11.942 --> 00:12:15.500\nThis is kinda shows you under the hood\nwhat's going on with application\n\n220\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.230\nvirtualization.\n\n221\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.310\nIt's creating this virtualized registry,\nand that's how it kinda sandboxes it.\n\n222\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.740\nBut when I look in here,\n\n223\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.150\nif I choose to, notice that what\nI'm seeing here is nothing more\n\n224\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.230\nthan any other registry hibe that you\nwould see down there in the registry.\n\n225\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.300\nWhich is a good thing that you\ncould see that information.\n\n226\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.700\nAnd you could see some of the settings\nif you needed to, down here.\n\n227\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.030\nPackage files.\n\n228\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.651\nAny of the files that are included inside\nof this package if you have to use this\n\n229\n00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:44.880\nfor many troubleshooting or\ndebugging you can see that.\n\n230\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.600\nThere aren't any of virtualized services.\n\n231\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.090\nAnd if you do want to,\nbe careful with this one.\n\n232\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.580\nIf you do wanna allow it to\ncommunicate with the host,\n\n233\n00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.520\nyou do have the option to allow the named\nobjects to interact with the local system.\n\n234\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.530\nBut do keep in mind that now you're\nbreaking the benefits of why you would\n\n235\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.180\neven be using application\nvirtualization in the first place.\n\n236\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.940\nSo I could make my edits to that,\nI could do all my changes, and\n\n237\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.050\nthen close it down and we are good.\n\n238\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.400\nSo it gives you the ability\nto modify the package.\n\n239\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.085\nI think, Dan, one of the last things I\nwould mention are some of the benefits,\n\n240\n00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:23.290\nkinda sum it up, why would we use this.\n\n241\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.299\nKeep in mind one of the biggest benefits\nis isolation from the operating system.\n\n242\n00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:34.520\nAll right, less resource consumption than\na full virtualized machine, a full VM.\n\n243\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.580\nI don't have to virtualized the whole\nentire operating system, and\n\n244\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.290\nthen the application co-existence.\n\n245\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.530\nSo now keep in mind, with any benefit\nthere's gonna be a little bit of a cost.\n\n246\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.130\nThe cost is that it does run locally,\nit does consume local resources.\n\n247\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.120\nUnlike some other\ntechnologies that we have.\n\n248\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.360\nLike for instance, Cloud based\nsolution where you connect out to\n\n249\n00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.810\nthe Internet there and they're running\nthem out in handy dandy clown, keep in\n\n250\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.340\nmind there's a running on servers that\nare hosted on somebody's else network so\n\n251\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.130\nit doesn't run on the local resources.\n\n252\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.142\nSo that's something to keep in mind that\nif you are gonna deploy your application\n\n253\n00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:09.741\nto local machines rather than using\nsome kinda software as the service,\n\n254\n00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:13.163\nyour machines are gonna have to\nsupport the application because they\n\n255\n00:14:13.163 --> 00:14:16.762\nwill be running locally even though\nthey are isolated from one another.\n\n256\n00:14:16.762 --> 00:14:21.643\nAnd that gives you a good idea of why you\nmight use application virtualization over\n\n257\n00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:24.684\nsomething like Hyper-V or\neven Azure Remote App,\n\n258\n00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:29.633\nespecially with the Azure Remote App is\nthat you can't connect to the Internet, so\n\n259\n00:14:29.633 --> 00:14:31.510\nI have no access to that.\n\n260\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.880\nThis gives you an alternative and\n\n261\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.250\na managed environment that doesn't\nrequire an Internet connection.\n\n262\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.680\nSo cost and benefits, weigh the pros and\n\n263\n00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.960\nthe cons and hopefully,\nthis will help you out in deploying and\n\n264\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.160\nunderstanding a little bit more about\nthe application virtualization software.\n\n265\n00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.310\n>> Well, Wes, you've definitely\ntaken us through the gamut of things\n\n266\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.200\nthat we'll need to know.\n\n267\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.470\nIt wasn't just a, well, you install\nthis and you make a package and\n\n268\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.750\nthen you run it and it's great!\n\n269\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.680\nYeah, we did do that, as well.\n\n270\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.130\nThat's always a good part.\n\n271\n00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.350\nBut you did a great job of showing us some\nof the pitfalls that we might come across,\n\n272\n00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.070\nsome of the stumbling blocks that\nwould make this difficult for\n\n273\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.850\nus, you kinda did all the cool,\nthe hard leg work should I say, for us so\n\n274\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.170\nthat we don't have to trudge\nthrough that ourselves.\n\n275\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.730\nAnd that, we appreciate you for.\n\n276\n00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.670\nThank you so much, and we thank you for\ndropping by and explaining App-V for us,\n\n277\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.130\nmaybe it's something we wanna deploy\nin our environment if we want to,\n\n278\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.810\nnow we actually can.\n\n279\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.790\nBut looking at the clock it's time for\nus to sign off.\n\n280\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.550\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n281\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.340\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n282\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.639\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n283\n00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:40.257\n[SOUND]\n\n",

of\n\n3\n00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.341\nIT Pro TV I'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.630\nwith our Microsoft Desktop\nOptimization Pack series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.920\nAnd, wow I almost ran out of breath\nsaying that because it's such a long\n\n6\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.830\nintroduction.\n\n7\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.280\nBut, it is the MDOP for short.\n\n8\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.320\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to lend his expertise\n\n9\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.260\non that very topic is our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryant.\n\n10\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.140\nWes, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going sir?\n\n11\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.090\n>> It's going great man.\n\n12\n00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.632\nI have to tell you that is\nthe beauty of acronyms,\n\n13\n00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:43.988\nit does make it a little bit easier for\nus to talk about our topic.\n\n14\n00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:47.044\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm just going to abbreviate it and\n\n15\n00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:49.000\nsay we're going to be talking about UEV.\n\n16\n00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.570\nWhat is UEV?\n\n17\n00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.410\nWell, UEV is the User Experience\nVirtualization technology, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.580\nyou might be asking yourself, well,\nwhat is it and why would we need it.\n\n19\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.830\nWell, we hope to show you that\nvery thing here in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.640\nI want to go ahead and kinda set\nthe stage for other technologies that we\n\n21\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.550\nhave that already do some of the same\nthings that UEV does for us.\n\n22\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.770\nAnd, understanding that can explain why\nwe would even use UEV in the first place.\n\n23\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.130\nNow, one of the things that UEV does\nis it helps us to synchronize certain\n\n24\n00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.105\napplication settings across multiple\ndevices inside of a domain environment.\n\n25\n00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.255\nNow, some of you that have been around\nthe domain environment for a little bit\n\n26\n00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:28.235\nprobably recognize a traditional\ntechnique called roaming profiles.\n\n27\n00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:28.895\nIn fact, Dan and\n\n28\n00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.242\nI were just talking about this prior\nto the episode even starting, right?\n\n29\n00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:35.152\nWith roaming profiles you don't\nreally get to pick and choose, right.\n\n30\n00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:38.972\nIf I want settings to be synchronized\nacross all of the different client\n\n31\n00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:43.302\nmachines that are end user suited\nthen roam the entire profile.\n\n32\n00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:48.035\nAnd, that includes not just certain\nsettings, but all of your settings, right?\n\n33\n00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.310\nAnd, also includes things\nlike your data as well.\n\n34\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.900\nWell, the problem with roaming profiles\nis it can chew up a lot of space.\n\n35\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.830\nIf you've got a bunch of end users that\nare going to use roaming profiles,\n\n36\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.600\nwell you can start chewing up hard\ndrive space on your file server,\n\n37\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.220\nwherever it is that you keep\nthese roaming profiles.\n\n38\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.004\nThe thing about roaming profiles as well,\n\n39\n00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.910\nis the fact that you don't synchronize\nsettings until the user logs off.\n\n40\n00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.650\nOnce the user logs off, then those\nsettings will be synchronized up to their\n\n41\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.000\nlocation there, up to that file server,\nthat intermediate store.\n\n42\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.580\nHere's another thing with roaming profiles\nthat can sometimes cause a problem.\n\n43\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.060\nIf the person doesn't log out of\nthe machine before they roam or\n\n44\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.960\nmove to the next machine, and they log in,\nthe settings aren't synchronized.\n\n45\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.470\nSo, there are some limitations to\nwhat roaming profiles allow us.\n\n46\n00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.200\nRoaming profiles, we don't get to pick and\nchoose what settings.\n\n47\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.590\nIt's all or nothing.\n\n48\n00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.020\nThe other thing too is if we\nhave network problems, right.\n\n49\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.425\nWe have network bandwidth issues\nit could take a little bit for\n\n50\n00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:48.815\nthose settings to synchronize\nback down to a machine.\n\n51\n00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.215\nSo, what are some other\nthings that we can do?\n\n52\n00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.545\nWell, we can implement folder redirection,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:57.025\nBut, the problem is,\nfolder redirection only redirects data,\n\n54\n00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:59.405\nit does very little to settings.\n\n55\n00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:01.705\nAll right, so\nwith that setting the stage there.\n\n56\n00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:07.110\nThat's where UEV helps us to try and\nGet the best of\n\n57\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.290\nboth technologies without severely\ndegrading our network performance.\n\n58\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.910\nAnd, really when it comes down to it,\nthe user experience that is sitting\n\n59\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.400\ndown at that computer expecting\nthose settings to be present.\n\n60\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.600\nNow, no pun intended.\n\n61\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.650\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.489\nlet's kind of dive into some of the\ncomponents that you can see here in, and\n\n63\n00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.705\nthat you'll need to implement the user\nexperience virtualization technology.\n\n64\n00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.790\nS, I've got a little\ndiagram pulled up here, and\n\n65\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.140\nthese are the major\ncomponents that you need.\n\n66\n00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.440\nYou need a domain controller, right?\n\n67\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.180\nYou need a valid Windows domain.\n\n68\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.980\nThis does work on group policy settings,\nwhich we'll look at coming up.\n\n69\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.980\nThe other thing that you\nneed is a file server.\n\n70\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.560\nNow, the file server is\njust a traditional server.\n\n71\n00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.630\nNothing special about it.\n\n72\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.450\nYou need a centralized location to store\nthe settings within these applications.\n\n73\n00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.870\nNow, the other thing that we have\nhere is a management workstation.\n\n74\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.750\nNow, I'll tell you that the management\nworkstation is kind of optional,\n\n75\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.900\nand what I mean by that is\nnot that you don't need one.\n\n76\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.866\nIt doesn't have to a dedicated machine\nbecause the Management Workstation is\n\n77\n00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.630\nwhere you're going to create and\n\n78\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.010\ncustomize what are known as\nsettings location templates.\n\n79\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.420\nNow, it is an optional component to\nhave this, so you don't need it.\n\n80\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.710\nIf you have an administrative workstation\nthat you sit at, it's perfectly fine.\n\n81\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.330\nYou can use it as your\nManagement Workstation.\n\n82\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.530\nBecause really, when it comes down to it,\nyou're not managing the entire UEV Suite.\n\n83\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.210\nWhat you're managing really is just\ncustomized settings location templates.\n\n84\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.130\nAnd, we'll dive in, we'll clarify\nwhat that means here in a second.\n\n85\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.590\n>> Now, Wes, really quickly, it seems\nlike, just from what you've said so far,\n\n86\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.640\nmaybe we just haven't gotten this far,\nbut it seems like this is a domain\n\n87\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.370\nonly function that this must be\nbeing done inside of a domain.\n\n88\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.490\nIs that the truth or\n\n89\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.400\ncan we do it inside a workstation or-\n>> That's a very good\n\n90\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.071\n>> Workspace as well?\n\n91\n00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.200\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.440\n>> No, that's a very good point.\n\n93\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.370\nIt has to be a domain, because\nthe way you deploy these settings and\n\n94\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.070\nthe way you control UEV.\n\n95\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.140\nEven though we say the Management\nWorkstation, this is really going to\n\n96\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.700\nbe controlled through\nthe Domain Controller itself, right?\n\n97\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.710\nYou got to your DC, you implement\nyour group policy objects, and\n\n98\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.090\nthen you push out your settings\nto all these computers.\n\n99\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.730\nWhich, to Dan's question there is\nwhy we need domain joined clients,\n\n100\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.530\nkeep that in mind.\n\n101\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.666\nSo, we do need a domain here.\n\n102\n00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.210\nNow, let's kind of look\nat what the different\n\n103\n00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.990\nroles are that are performed\nby each one of these devices.\n\n104\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.822\nSo, we can just dive a little bit farther.\n\n105\n00:05:24.822 --> 00:05:28.680\nKind of understand what the components\nare, the platform behind the scenes.\n\n106\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.960\nNow, the first one is\nthe domain controller, right?\n\n107\n00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.070\nIf you're familiar with\nan Active Directory Domain,\n\n108\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.820\nyou know what the domain controller does.\n\n109\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.650\nBut, as it relates to the user\nexperience virtualization technology,\n\n110\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.070\nremember UEV, answering\na question does require a domain.\n\n111\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.620\nActive Directory User and Computers.\n\n112\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.560\nNow, you might say, well why do we need\nactive directory users in computers?\n\n113\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.200\nWell, you're going to have to create\ngroups in order to push out the settings.\n\n114\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.710\nYou don't really have to, but\nit is a good thing to have.\n\n115\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.160\nCertain groups, remember role-based access\ncontrol, and so that you can manage that.\n\n116\n00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.200\nThe other thing that is we have the GPMC,\nthe group policy management console, and\n\n117\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.580\nthat's where you're going to\nconfigure the group policy settings.\n\n118\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.220\nNow, that being said, you can't\ncontrol the group policy settings if\n\n119\n00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.990\nyou don't have the group\npolicy templates in place.\n\n120\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.440\nAnd like we've shown you in\nthe some of the past for instance,\n\n121\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.480\nthe Microsoft Bit Locker Administration\nand Monitoring episode that we did, right?\n\n122\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.990\nWe had to take the MDOP active\ndirectory templates for\n\n123\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.560\nthe technology that we're looking at, and\n\n124\n00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.470\nwe had to import them into the active\ndirectory policies and definitions store.\n\n125\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.070\nAnd, that's something that we're\ngoing to show you as well.\n\n126\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.000\nGetting that setup.\n\n127\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.900\nWe'll show you how to prepare your active\ndirectory domain in order to deploy this.\n\n128\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.890\nNow the file server, where your store is,\n\n129\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.310\nthere's not really too much flashy here,\nDan.\n\n130\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.080\nThere's not a lot of flare in this.\n\n131\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.870\nWhen it comes to the file server,\n\n132\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.720\nthis is where the settings\nlocation storage path, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.010\nWhere are we going to store\nsomething called settings packages?\n\n134\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.970\nAnd, we'll talk a little more\nabout those coming up too.\n\n135\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.220\nAnd then, another thing something known\nas the settings template catalog.\n\n136\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.420\nThis is an optional component, and\n\n137\n00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.260\none of the things I want you to understand\nas we go ahead and dive into this.\n\n138\n00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.980\nThe reason it's optional is the,\nas far as settings location templates,\n\n139\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.280\nif you're going to use the default\nMicrosoft Office calculator,\n\n140\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.910\ncalendar, even Windows apps,\ncertain Windows apps from the store.\n\n141\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.290\nThen you really don't need\na template catalog all right.\n\n142\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.960\nThat's where all these settings locations\ntemplates are going to be stored here.\n\n143\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.940\nBut, if you're going to customize,\nwell now you need a place to point.\n\n144\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.140\nWe'll talk about in a bit coming\nup our UEV agent to that location.\n\n145\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.770\nAll right, management workstation,\n\n146\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.620\nlike we said,\ndoesn't need to be a dedicated machine.\n\n147\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.880\nThis is where you're gonna\nrun the UEV generator.\n\n148\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.430\nIf I decide that I'm not going with just\nthe standard Microsoft applications,\n\n149\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.525\nmaybe I'm running my own application.\n\n150\n00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:58.470\nRight, and I want to make sure that\nuser experience virtualization monitors\n\n151\n00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.657\nthe settings that are being changed and\ncreates packages based on those changes so\n\n152\n00:08:02.657 --> 00:08:06.480\nthat when I go to another computer those\nPackage that will be pulled down and\n\n153\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.076\nthe settings will be applied.\n\n154\n00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:12.927\nWell, if it's a customized application,\nthat's where we're gonna go ahead,\n\n155\n00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:17.429\nwe're gonna run the UEB generator and\nwe're gonna create a custom settings\n\n156\n00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.950\nlocation template So these are some of\nthe components that we have in there.\n\n157\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.820\nI want to talk really quick about\nsettings-location templates.\n\n158\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.850\nWhen the user experience, or UEV, and\nI'm not going to try this one i'll mess\n\n159\n00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.380\nthat one up a lot, so\nwe'll just use the acronym.\n\n160\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.380\nThe UEV agent runs on a client\nworkstation, these managed workstations.\n\n161\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.730\nWhat is does is it looks to that path\nthat's setting storage location and\n\n162\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.670\nit says Do I have any settings based on\nthis application that I need to apply to\n\n163\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.192\nthe machine.\n\n164\n00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:52.180\nSo that I can synchronize and\nit's consistent across multiple devices.\n\n165\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.720\nWell, if it finds one of those\nsettings packages then what it does is\n\n166\n00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.900\npulls it down.\n\n167\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.250\nAnd the user experience virtualization\nagent looks to the registry and\n\n168\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.090\nthe different file locations\nof that application.\n\n169\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.430\nAnd it applies the configuration\npackage to those locations.\n\n170\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.960\nAnd that is what provides the consistency\namong the different clients, right?\n\n171\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.350\nIf I open an application on client 1,\nclient 01 if you will, I open notepad and\n\n172\n00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.900\nI change the font and I change maybe I add\nword graph and I close that application\n\n173\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.810\ndown Well what happened was the UE-V\nagent was looking at all the locations\n\n174\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.610\nthat are modified when you change\nthe settings within the basic Notepad app.\n\n175\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.250\nAnd if it finds changes,\nthen it collects those changes together.\n\n176\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.920\nAnd it creates what's known\nas a settings package.\n\n177\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.990\nThat settings package only contains\nthe changes that you've made and\n\n178\n00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.690\nmodified in your settings.\n\n179\n00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.400\nThen it stores it up in the settings\nstorage location that we were telling you\n\n180\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.130\nIs basically where the file server is,\nright.\n\n181\n00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.820\nNow if you log into another machine and\nyou fire up notepad its gonna look\n\n182\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.020\nback at this setting storage location,\nits gonna say do I find any notepad?\n\n183\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.360\nWe'll give the example in notepad here.\n\n184\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.900\nDo I find an notepad setting?\n\n185\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.520\nPackages more specifically,\nright, those bundle up changes.\n\n186\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.390\nWe looked at the settings storage location\nand if I find those packages the first\n\n187\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.470\nthing I'm going to do upon you\nopening that application is I'm\n\n188\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.330\ngoing to go ahead and I'm going to\napply it to the registry locations and\n\n189\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.100\nthe file locations and the purpose being,\nthe goal being, is that the settings you\n\n190\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.580\nchange on one machine will replicate over\nto the next machine that you log into.\n\n191\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.730\nNow you might have said Wes,\n\n192\n00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.590\ndidn't you tell us we could do that all\nwith roaming profiles, and yes, you can.\n\n193\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.140\nBut, I don't get to pick and choose.\n\n194\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.060\nThe other thing is,\nroaming profiles falls short,\n\n195\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.490\njust short of the fact that I have\nto log out for those settings to\n\n196\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.270\nreplicate up to whatever the file share is\nthat your storing your roaming profiles.\n\n197\n00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.160\nThen, I log into the next machine,\nand then they get pulled down.\n\n198\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.350\nWith UEV on certain applications,\nguess what?\n\n199\n00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.690\nI open it up on one machine, I make my\nchanges, I close the application down.\n\n200\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.670\nI didn't say log out.\n\n201\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.110\nClose the application down and\n\n202\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.500\nthe application, through UEV, the agent\nsets those packages in the right location.\n\n203\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.170\nNow on that next machine, notice I\nhaven't logged out on the first machine,\n\n204\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.450\nnext machine I could log in and\nfire out notepad and\n\n205\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.810\nwithout logging out other than just\nshutting the application down the settings\n\n206\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.430\nhave already have been roamed so it is- or\nsynchronized be careful on that one.\n\n207\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.180\nBut the will be synchronized with\njust closing the application down.\n\n208\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.510\nAnd that's one of the good things when\nit comes to comparison there, Dan.\n\n209\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.770\nBetween the profiles themselves and\n\n210\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.460\nusing something like user\nexperience virtualization.\n\n211\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.490\n>> All right, Wes, now that we have\na good idea of what's actually going on,\n\n212\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.060\nwhat UEV does, how it works, What do we\nhave to do to prepare for this thing?\n\n213\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.050\nHow do we get it running?\n\n214\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.740\n>> That's right.\n\n215\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.520\nThere are a few things\nthat we're going to do, so\n\n216\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.210\nwe've got to jump on over to our server.\n\n217\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.680\nRemember that the first place that we're\ngoing to be working is in our domain\n\n218\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.330\ncontroller.\n\n219\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:55.450\nI want you guys to know that even though\nwe have shown a couple of servers,\n\n220\n00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.180\nmy DC is going to be a single.\n\n221\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.410\nThis is a single server environment, and\nthis is how we're going to implement this.\n\n222\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.840\nPlease understand that this is just for\ntest and production purposes.\n\n223\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.200\nI am sure if I ask Dan,\n\n224\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.980\nhey Dan do you mind sharing a folder\nout on your domain controller?\n\n225\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.590\nDan would look at me and\nsay no it is not going to happen.\n\n226\n00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.860\nSo keep in mind it is not in\na production environment.\n\n227\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.230\nWhat we are going to do is take the file\nserver where those settings are located,\n\n228\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.480\nand a domain controller, and we are going\nto blend those roles together just for\n\n229\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.700\nthe purpose of testing it.\n\n230\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.830\nSo the first thing that we have to\ndo is we got to create a group.\n\n231\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.300\nAlright.\nRemember this is going to be\n\n232\n00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.500\nrole based management control in your\ndomains you could have thousands,\n\n233\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.610\nif not thousands upon thousands of users.\n\n234\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.030\nSo any user that you want to use UEV,\nit's a good idea to go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.410\ncreate a group.\n\n236\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.430\nYou can put those\nidentities in that group.\n\n237\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.820\nAnd then you can attach and\nmanage just through that group.\n\n238\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.089\nSo that's what we're going to do first.\n\n239\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.510\nAlright, so let me go ahead and\n\n240\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.700\nget logged into my domain controller,\nit fooled me there.\n\n241\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.580\n>> It does that every time.\n\n242\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.040\n>> It does doesn't?\n\n243\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.470\nSo we're going to go ahead and kind of\neasy guys, if you're not familiar with\n\n244\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.580\nactive director we've got many courses\nthat go from the basic active directory\n\n245\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.750\nright down into some very nitty gritty\nwhen it comes to active directory and\n\n246\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.460\nif you don't understand those\ndefinitely go over and watch those.\n\n247\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.090\nBut all we're gonna do here is we're gonna\nright click on our users container and\n\n248\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.880\nwe're gonna choose new and\nwe're gonna choose group.\n\n249\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.410\nNow understand that I'm just\ngoing to call these UEV clients.\n\n250\n00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.360\n>> And it is a, the group scope here\nis going to be the global group.\n\n251\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.840\nAnd it's going to be\na security group right?\n\n252\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.920\nWe want to attach permissions to it.\n\n253\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.230\nAnd, let me make sure I put a v in there,\nso I can spell UEV right.\n\n254\n00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.370\nApparently the acronym is challenging.\n\n255\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.040\nAll right.\nSo now I've got my group, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.640\nNow, if I want,\nI can end up putting the identity.\n\n257\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.820\nSo I'm gonna add somebody to this group.\n\n258\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.700\nIn fact, I've got my account here.\n\n259\n00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.590\nSo I'll just go ahead and I'll add myself\nto that group that we just created.\n\n260\n00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.090\nUEV, check names and\nthere it goes, shows up.\n\n261\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.510\nSo, how you put the users in the group,\nwhat users you put in the group,\n\n262\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.190\nthat's really gonna be up to you.\n\n263\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.240\nAll right, now the next thing that\nwe have to have is we have to have\n\n264\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.920\na couple of shares, right?\n\n265\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.880\nWe have a place that if you remember, I\nsaid we had the settings storage location,\n\n266\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.340\nand if you are using and, optionally,\nalso the settings template catalog path.\n\n267\n00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.250\nAnd that's where that's gonna be,\nall those templates are gonna be stored,\n\n268\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.090\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna create both, all right.\n\n269\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.690\nNow, where you do this,\nagain, is gonna be up to you.\n\n270\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.470\nKeep in mind that, for\ntesting purposes, this will suffice.\n\n271\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.520\nI certainly wouldn't recommend doing\nthis on your domain controller.\n\n272\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.210\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna right click and we're gonna,\n\n273\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.240\nlet me try that again.\n\n274\n00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.880\nRight click and choose new.\n\n275\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.805\nThat right click it's\na tricky thing I tell you.\n\n276\n00:14:44.805 --> 00:14:47.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we're gonna call this UEV Settings.\n\n277\n00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.130\nAll right, so I'll create that one and\n\n278\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.840\nthen we'll set the permissions after\nwe create both of these folders.\n\n279\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.820\nThen I'll go ahead and right click\nagain and I'm gonna choose new.\n\n280\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.800\nAnd I'm gonna create another folder.\n\n281\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.660\nNow this one, again, I'm gonna name it\njust so I know exactly what it is, guys.\n\n282\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.970\nHow you name it's gonna be up to you.\n\n283\n00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.940\nI'm just gonna call this\nUEVTemplatesCatalog.\n\n284\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.730\nI know that's a long word and some of you\nguys might not want a folder name that\n\n285\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.140\nlong or certainly maybe not\na share name that long.\n\n286\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.370\nSo I'll leave that up to you.\n\n287\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.560\nAll right, now we're gonna set\na couple of permissions here,\n\n288\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.910\nthat's the next thing that we have to do.\n\n289\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:30.260\nSo we're gonna modify the permissions\nfirst, on the UEV settings, or\n\n290\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.040\nUEV data folder, if you will.\n\n291\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.580\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nshare this out.\n\n292\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.480\nAnd they tell you that you can you don't\nhave to put everyone in this if you want.\n\n293\n00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.210\nI'm gonna go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna do a find people\n\n294\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.310\nall right and then I'm gonna do uev and\nwe'll see if we can't find uev clients\n\n295\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.080\nthere all right and we'll add uev clients\nAnd we're going to give them full control,\n\n296\n00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.270\nso we'll essentially give them read,\nwrite there and we'll choose share.\n\n297\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.148\nNow, pay attention to the UEV\nsetting UNC path, right?\n\n298\n00:16:05.148 --> 00:16:09.353\nThat's going to come in handy when we\ndecide that it's time to define where that\n\n299\n00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:13.305\npath is once we get to the point where\nwe've imported our templates over and\n\n300\n00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:16.842\nwe're configuring our group policy\nsettings inside of the GPMC.\n\n301\n00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:20.872\nWe're gonna need this setting here in\norder to point all of the clients within\n\n302\n00:16:20.872 --> 00:16:23.610\nyour entire infrastructure\nto the right location.\n\n303\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.120\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngive you a quick troubleshooting tip.\n\n304\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.020\nIf you're watching this right now for\nthe purpose of troubleshooting, and\n\n305\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.560\nyour settings aren't synchronizing,\npay attention to the UNC path.\n\n306\n00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.570\nI don't know how many times I've typed\nthat wrong before only to find out that\n\n307\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.790\nwhen I launched the company settings\nportal which we're gonna show,\n\n308\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.260\nit says not synchronizing please\ncontact your administrator.\n\n309\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.260\nThat a lot of times can\nbe the problem here.\n\n310\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.860\nNow that has our share permissions\nset up What else do we have to do?\n\n311\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.600\nWell, remember, we set share permissions.\n\n312\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.620\nThat allows me to connect\nover the network, but\n\n313\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.660\nwhat that doesn't allow me to do is\nconnect locally, NTFS permission.\n\n314\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.320\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just\ndouble check our NTFS permissions, and\n\n315\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.500\nif I notice right there,\nI can see UEV clients.\n\n316\n00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.350\nThey have been added to this list and\nthat they do have the full control.\n\n317\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:25.380\nSo that gets the UEV settings setup\nfolder, excuse me, folder setup.\n\n318\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.030\nWe got one more that we\nneed to take care of, and\n\n319\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.680\nthat's where the catalog is going to be.\n\n320\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.770\nAnd we'll go ahead, and\nwe're gonna share this out, and\n\n321\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.640\nwe're gonna do the same thing.\n\n322\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.229\nWe're gonna do UEV clients.\n\n323\n00:17:37.796 --> 00:17:41.882\nAnd in fact, let me just do\nthe find people we're gonna find\n\n324\n00:17:41.882 --> 00:17:46.010\npeople this is the you\nare here sign all right.\n\n325\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.010\nI have found myself and\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:53.069\nget them read write on that same or\nthe different folder there.\n\n327\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.506\nAnd now you gonna see again, pay\nattention to that UNC path because if you\n\n328\n00:17:58.506 --> 00:18:01.613\nare customizing,\nuse customize settings templates.\n\n329\n00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:04.390\nYou're gonna need to put that\nin your GPO settings, too, so\n\n330\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.360\nwe'll come back to that when we get ready.\n\n331\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.916\nAnd then Security,\nwe're just gonna double-check\n\n332\n00:18:09.916 --> 00:18:14.507\nthat our UEV Clients are there and\nthat they do have the full control.\n\n333\n00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:18.794\nAll right, and that has,\n\n334\n00:18:18.794 --> 00:18:23.980\nwell that has preparing the users and\nthe sharers set up.\n\n335\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.470\nThe next thing that's gonna happen, Dan,\n\n336\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.190\nhere is we gotta start getting\nour Active Directory prepared.\n\n337\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.490\n>> So Wes when you say that we have to\nget our Active Directory more prepared,\n\n338\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.450\nis that maybe another user or group.\n\n339\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.190\nI bet it's group policy.\n\n340\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.849\n>> It's always gonna be group policy,\nright?\n\n341\n00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:41.646\nBut one thing that we used\nto control all the settings.\n\n342\n00:18:41.646 --> 00:18:45.000\nWe have the majority of the settings\ninside of our domain environment and Dan.\n\n343\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.760\nI can tell you what, you've been with\nme enough on MDOP series where that\n\n344\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.050\nActive Directory in those\ntemplates always come in handy.\n\n345\n00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.045\nAnd into play, and that's exactly\nwhere we're going, so let's go ahead.\n\n346\n00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:57.747\nThe next thing that we have to do\nis make sure that the settings for\n\n347\n00:18:57.747 --> 00:19:00.356\nuser experience\nvirtualization are going to\n\n348\n00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:04.140\nbe present when we open up our\ngroup policy management console.\n\n349\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.633\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n350\n00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:07.178\nNow, I'll go ahead and\n\n351\n00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:10.710\nminimize that window,\nactually want the File Explorer here.\n\n352\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:16.209\nNow to do this understand that we\ncan just mount the MDOP folder\n\n353\n00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:21.724\nif you want ISO is really what it is and\nthen it's inside a UEV.\n\n354\n00:19:21.724 --> 00:19:25.917\nBut I've gone ahead and\nalready extracted those files out and\n\n355\n00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:30.525\nwhat we're looking for more than\nanything is the and you know what.\n\n356\n00:19:30.525 --> 00:19:34.585\nI say that I've done that let me\nmake sure that I have done that and\n\n357\n00:19:34.585 --> 00:19:36.760\nyou know what, I have not done that.\n\n358\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.540\nSo we can go ahead and\ngrab those real quick.\n\n359\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.375\nGo ahead and do some Documents here,\nand inside of MDOP,\n\n360\n00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:46.006\nthere's our MDOP templates.\n\n361\n00:19:46.006 --> 00:19:49.950\nKeep in mind that you, it's not the ISO,\nforgive me there guys,\n\n362\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.580\nthat's actually your MDOP\ntemplate download here.\n\n363\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.380\nAnd if I scroll down here, you'll see that\nthere's the user experience virtualization\n\n364\n00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.360\nfolder down here.\n\n365\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.202\nPay attention to\nthe version that you have.\n\n366\n00:20:01.202 --> 00:20:07.720\nUs, we're using the current version in\n2015 UE-V, version 2.1 service pack 1.\n\n367\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.351\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n368\n00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:14.890\nwe will pull the user experience\nvirtualization admx file out of there.\n\n369\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.528\nIt's always fun saying X file.\n\n370\n00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:18.282\nI just love it.\n\n371\n00:20:18.282 --> 00:20:19.484\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n372\n00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:22.137\nwe're gonna just drag that right\nto the desktop for now and\n\n373\n00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:24.370\nremember you need\nthe language that you're in.\n\n374\n00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:29.860\nAnd I know we have people watching from\nall around the world internationally,\n\n375\n00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.340\nso pay attention to what ever\nlanguage is native to your tongue.\n\n376\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.620\nThat's the one that you want to grab or\n\n377\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.660\nmaybe not native to your tongue but\nnative to your environment.\n\n378\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.766\nAnd that's out .adml files,\nremember that's the language files.\n\n379\n00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:45.515\nThe first one the .admx files that's\nyour settings and then the second\n\n380\n00:20:45.515 --> 00:20:50.276\none is the language there that those\nsettings are gonna be rendered in.\n\n381\n00:20:50.276 --> 00:20:51.110\nAll right, so\n\n382\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:56.115\nto do this to provision Active Directory\nwe're gonna go to Windows, C: if you will,\n\n383\n00:20:56.115 --> 00:21:00.650\nWindows and you'll see there's a policies\nand definitions folder in here.\n\n384\n00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.200\nThat's where we wanna be and\n\n385\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.450\nthe ADMX files, you just drop the ADMX\nfiles right in there and we'll be good.\n\n386\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.590\nMake sure I got the right one there,\nwe'll just drop those there.\n\n387\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:15.884\nYour ADML files,\nsearch by type there If I could find,\n\n388\n00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:19.231\nit should be all the way at the top.\n\n389\n00:21:19.231 --> 00:21:23.921\nEUN or ENUS, remember the same thing, same\nfolder that we pulled the ADML files out\n\n390\n00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:26.670\nas part of the MDOP Active Directory\ntemplates.\n\n391\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.064\nNow, that is fairly easy, that's really\nall it is to provisioning the group\n\n392\n00:21:31.064 --> 00:21:34.183\npolicy templates,\nis just knowing where to put them.\n\n393\n00:21:34.183 --> 00:21:38.431\nIf you've implemented a central store in\nyour Active Directory domain, than you'd\n\n394\n00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:42.730\nput them there, rather than putting them\nhere on the local domain controller.\n\n395\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.640\nKeep in mind that we're in\na test environment here, so\n\n396\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.920\nthat's why we did that this way.\n\n397\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.971\nNow what I'm gonna go ahead and do,\nwe're not really gonna configure any of\n\n398\n00:21:50.971 --> 00:21:55.341\nthe settings right yet, but I wanna verify\nthat group policy management does have\n\n399\n00:21:55.341 --> 00:21:58.211\nuser experience virtualization\nsettings present.\n\n400\n00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:01.700\nAnd that we can read them, for me,\nI can read them in English, all right.\n\n401\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.326\nSo we're gonna go up to tools,\n\n402\n00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:06.835\nwe're gonna scroll down to the group\npolicy management console.\n\n403\n00:22:06.835 --> 00:22:12.710\nAnd this is your GPNC here and,\nI'm gonna expand out Group Policy Objects.\n\n404\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.790\nNow I just have the two default policies\nthere, the domain controller policy and\n\n405\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.860\nthe default domain policy.\n\n406\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.110\nAnd we're just gonna right click and\nwe're gonna choose New, all right.\n\n407\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.670\nAnd we'll just go ahead and\ngive this a name.\n\n408\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.590\nWe're gonna come back and we're gonna\nmodify it later on in the show here.\n\n409\n00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:34.914\nAnd I'm just going to call it\nUEV Management, all right.\n\n410\n00:22:34.914 --> 00:22:38.570\nCuz that's just unfortunately\nhow creative I am,\n\n411\n00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.490\nlet's see if I can wake\nthat mouse back up.\n\n412\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.387\nThere we go, we'll choose OK.\n\n413\n00:22:43.387 --> 00:22:47.266\nAll right, now next thing we're\ngonna do is just edit it and\n\n414\n00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:51.781\nkeep in mind that the only purpose for\nthis is to find those settings.\n\n415\n00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:55.635\nNow, if you are in a certification\nendeavor I would definitely\n\n416\n00:22:55.635 --> 00:23:00.230\nremember where these settings are,\nif you are wanting to set this up.\n\n417\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.137\nAgain, documentation out there,\nit can show you where these settings are,\n\n418\n00:23:03.137 --> 00:23:05.206\nmake it easier for\nyou under computer configuration.\n\n419\n00:23:05.206 --> 00:23:09.873\nYou have the policies administrator\ntemplates under their windows components\n\n420\n00:23:09.873 --> 00:23:14.049\nand there is one, you might it would\nbe all the way down to the letter U but\n\n421\n00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:17.020\nit actually starts with Microsoft here.\n\n422\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.810\nSo we can see that yes those\npolicies settings are present and\n\n423\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.570\nif we look we can see that for us,\nfor our language, that we're here,\n\n424\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.350\nwe're in the English edition of Windows we\ncan see that those settings are available.\n\n425\n00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.950\nSo at this point Dan, what we have done is\nkind of as a recap remember we've looked\n\n426\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.980\nat some of the components\nthat we've needed.\n\n427\n00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.190\nWe prepared for the deployment,\nwe created the group for\n\n428\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:48.170\nour end users, then we turned around and\nwe created the shares.\n\n429\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.650\nThe share's most likely are gonna\nbe created on a file server, guys,\n\n430\n00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.900\nnot on the domain controller, but\neither way we created the two shares.\n\n431\n00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.540\nOne for the template catalog to\nstore any customized templates.\n\n432\n00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.270\nThe other one, keep in mind is the,\nyou can call it UEV data,\n\n433\n00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.390\nI just happen to call it UEV Settings.\n\n434\n00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.329\n>> Just do something descriptive.\n\n435\n00:24:04.329 --> 00:24:07.370\n>> Yeah, yeah exactly, make sure\nthat your naming convention's right.\n\n436\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.853\nAnd then setting your permissions make\nthat your users have access to that\n\n437\n00:24:11.853 --> 00:24:16.916\nlocation and their computers by the way,\nbecause if that doesn't happen then what\n\n438\n00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:21.859\nwill happen is the computer is gonna try\nand write the settings to that location.\n\n439\n00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:25.879\nIt's not gonna happen and most likely\nyou'll see, and we'll kind of simulate\n\n440\n00:24:25.879 --> 00:24:30.270\nthat later on in this episode, is an error\nwhen the synchronization doesn't happen.\n\n441\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.298\nSo these setting have to\nbe in place In order for\n\n442\n00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:34.970\nyou to deploy your user\nexperience virtualization.\n\n443\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:35.530\n>> All right, Wes.\n\n444\n00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.120\nI know that you're trying to wrap\neverything up that we've done\n\n445\n00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.010\nbecause of looking at our clock and\nit's a little bit expired for us.\n\n446\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.410\nSo, that means we got a part\ntwo in our future in this.\n\n447\n00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.510\nHopefully, you do as well.\n\n448\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.400\nWe'll see you there.\n\n449\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.790\nWes, we do appreciate you for\n\n450\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.220\nstopping by and lending your\nexpertise on this and helping us.\n\n451\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.004\nGet prepared for our exam and\nto use the UEV as well.\n\n452\n00:24:55.004 --> 00:24:57.569\nNow said we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n453\n00:24:57.569 --> 00:24:59.205\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n454\n00:24:59.205 --> 00:25:00.284\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n455\n00:25:00.284 --> 00:25:01.595\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n456\n00:25:01.595 --> 00:25:10.390\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.809\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.420\nMicrosoft desktop\noptimization pack series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.260\nJoining us back in\nthe studio again today for\n\n6\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.900\na little more UEV is our good friend Mr.\nWes Bren.\n\n7\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.460\nWes, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.440\nWe're excited to have you back.\n\n9\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.020\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.130\n>> It's going great, and\nas always, good to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.150\nThat's right, we're jumping back in and\n\n12\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.160\nwe're moving forward in the deployment\nof our user experience virtualization.\n\n13\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.420\nNow in this episode what\nwe're gonna be doing is,\n\n14\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.680\nwe're gonna actually be working with\nsomething known as the UEV generator.\n\n15\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550\nIn the past episode, the first part of\nthis series, this mini-series that we're\n\n16\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.100\nrunning here, one of the things that we\ndid is we looked at the components and\n\n17\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.640\nwe got our active directory, our server\ninfrastructure essentially set up and\n\n18\n00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.380\nready to go to recognize\nthe UEV infrastructure.\n\n19\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.360\nHere what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nstart talking a little bit more about\n\n20\n00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.610\nthe settings location templates,\nand how you can customize and\n\n21\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.430\ncreate your own settings\nlocation templates.\n\n22\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.590\nSo let's go ahead and do this.\n\n23\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390\nI've got our management work station up\nhere, keep in mind that your management\n\n24\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.520\nworkstation doesn't have\nto be a dedicated station.\n\n25\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.180\nReally the only management you're going\nto be doing is what you're going to\n\n26\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.520\nsee right here and now.\n\n27\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.260\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nnavigate down into the UEV folder,\n\n28\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.310\nkeep in mind,\nthis is after mounting the MDOP folder and\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.110\nextracting the version of\nUEV that you want out.\n\n30\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.870\nKeep in mind that we've done that in\nthe first part of this episode and\n\n31\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.740\nwe've done that quite a lot throughout\nthis series with the other technologies\n\n32\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.840\nthat we've looked at.\n\n33\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.220\nWe're gonna navigate into the UEV folder\nand we're gonna go into installers.\n\n34\n00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020\nNow you have to pay attention to\nwhich architecture you're gonna use,\n\n35\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.940\n64 bit or the 32 bit, so x64, x86 here.\n\n36\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.180\nOr you can make it really convenient.\n\n37\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.700\nI like this one it says any CPU.\n\n38\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.630\nIn fact that's going to be the one\nthat we're going to chose.\n\n39\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.930\nAnd there's a couple of them in\nhere a couple of different things.\n\n40\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.550\nThe agent, we'll see the agent when\nwe move into managing the client,\n\n41\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.305\nthe management part of this.\n\n42\n00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:15.005\nBut right now what we want\nis this tool setup here.\n\n43\n00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:20.015\nWe're going to go ahead and click this and\nyou'll see it's going to start the setup\n\n44\n00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:24.465\nto the Microsoft user experience\nvirtualization generator.\n\n45\n00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:27.120\nThe UEV generator like we've seen.\n\n46\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.370\nOr been saying.\n\n47\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.580\nWe're gonna choose next in the wizard.\n\n48\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.180\nWe're gonna sign our\nlife away to Microsoft.\n\n49\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.820\nWe'll be testing again at the end\nof this episode on what this\n\n50\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.650\nclause is all the way down here,\nprobably Santa Claus.\n\n51\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.800\nAnd we'll choose next.\n\n52\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.240\nNow when it comes to the next\ncouple of screens here, guys.\n\n53\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.400\nYou guys have seen these in\nsome of the other technologies.\n\n54\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.260\nFirst one is Microsoft update.\n\n55\n00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170\nDo you wanna be a part of\nthat production environment?\n\n56\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.290\nI would recommend it here on the show.\n\n57\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.250\nWe're just gonna say do not\nuse the Microsoft update.\n\n58\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.890\nNext thing is gonna be the customer\nexperience improvement program, CIP.\n\n59\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.250\nYou can opt into that.\n\n60\n00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.380\nThey say recommended.\n\n61\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.430\nThat's up to you as well.\n\n62\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.710\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust opt out of it here for our purposes.\n\n63\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.220\nNot too bad, right, not too difficult.\n\n64\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.540\nWe're gonna choose Install, and\n\n65\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.680\nit's gonna go through\nthe process of the installation.\n\n66\n00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.350\nNow keep in mind, you have to be the local\nadministrator on the machine, not only to\n\n67\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.240\ninstall it, cuz it's an application,\nbut also to run it, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.910\nAnd that's something to keep in mind here,\nand let me tell you why.\n\n69\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.590\nWhen you see this application run,\n\n70\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.730\nit's gonna do something\ntypically administrators.\n\n71\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.940\nAnd not typically,\nonly administrators can do.\n\n72\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.550\nWhat is that?\n\n73\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.220\nIt's gonna monitor registry settings.\n\n74\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.440\nSo keep in mind even to\nrun this application\n\n75\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.880\nyou have to be a local administrator.\n\n76\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.170\nSo if it doesn't run from you or\nit gives you some permissions error or\n\n77\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.310\nit says you don't have\nthe administrative right.\n\n78\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.260\nMake sure you're logged in as\nan administrative account.\n\n79\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.690\nSave yourself a little bit of trouble.\n\n80\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.490\n>> Now Wes, only some sort of admin\nshould be running the management console\n\n81\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.180\nanyway, correct?\n\n82\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.670\nSo we're basically looking at domain\nadmins logging in to the machine, but\n\n83\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.660\nnot necessarily locally.\n\n84\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.570\nJust making the domain admin, well I\nguess they are a local admin as well.\n\n85\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.280\n>> That's right, does it have to\nbe an admin to run the software?\n\n86\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.010\nYes it does.\n\n87\n00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.830\nRestrictive, we talk about\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n88\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.320\nYou might have an R and D team,\nresearch and development team that maybe\n\n89\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.270\nis working with these templates\nthat you might be delegating.\n\n90\n00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.140\nBut even if you're\ndelegating administration,\n\n91\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.530\nit really does boil back to what Dan said,\nit's gonna be an administrator.\n\n92\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.450\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n93\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.230\nYou got to be an administrator\nto monitor the registry files.\n\n94\n00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.650\nSo what are we talking about when\nwe say monitor registry files?\n\n95\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.200\nWe're going to go down to\nour Windows icon there.\n\n96\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.140\nWe're going to choose all apps.\n\n97\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.160\nAnd if we scroll in here,\n\n98\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.000\nwe should see that we have a Microsoft\nUser Experience Virtualization folder.\n\n99\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.560\nAnd we just wanna go ahead and\nlaunch that.\n\n100\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.570\nAnd that's gonna launch the User\nExperience Virtualization generator,\n\n101\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.650\nthe UEV generator.\n\n102\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.220\nAll right, now we've got a couple of\noptions that we can use in here, and\n\n103\n00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.380\nwe're gonna show you how to edit,\nbasically what a blank settings\n\n104\n00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.560\nlocation template looks like compared\nto what we're going to create here.\n\n105\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.700\nSo we will come back to that one in a bit.\n\n106\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.280\nBut we are going to go ahead and choose\ncreate a settings location template.\n\n107\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.110\nDo keep in mind that if you are not\ncustomizing or creating custom\n\n108\n00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.010\nsettings location templates then you don't\nreally need to use this generator because\n\n109\n00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.250\nthe UEV agent that we're gonna install in\nall the managed clients has built in low\n\n110\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.460\ntemplates that it looks and it knows\nbeforehand where to look if you've already\n\n111\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.650\nusing some of the most common\nMicrosoft Office Suite and the built in\n\n112\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.950\nutilities like Calculator and Calendar and\nWord Pad inside of Windows natively.\n\n113\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.470\n>> But Wes,\nare we stuck with Microsoft products, or\n\n114\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.320\ncan we use third parties as well?\n\n115\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.080\n>> You can use third parties,\nand that's a good point.\n\n116\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.070\nBecause when we deploy the GPO,\n\n117\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.750\nyou can say don't use the default\nMicrosoft templates, right?\n\n118\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.540\nWe can use both.\n\n119\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.410\nWe can say okay, well we've got now\na customized one in here, but go ahead and\n\n120\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.110\nuse what you've been using.\n\n121\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.160\nOr I could actually say override on all\nthe default Microsoft templates and\n\n122\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.730\nwe're only gonna use like\nthe question that Dan says,\n\n123\n00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.950\njust our third party templates\nthat we're creating here.\n\n124\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.860\nActually the templates aren't third party\nwe're creating templates based on third\n\n125\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.600\nparty software.\n\n126\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.480\nSo the answer is yes you\ncan do that if you want.\n\n127\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.419\nAlright, so we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose browse.\n\n128\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.890\nNow you'll have to know where\nthe application that you're using installs\n\n129\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.260\nitself.\n\n130\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.950\nMost likely, or most often,\n\n131\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.090\nas some of you probably know it's\ngoing to be in program files here.\n\n132\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.418\nKeep in mind that,\nbased on the architecture that you chose,\n\n133\n00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:30.468\n64 bit versus the 32 bit, right?\n\n134\n00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:31.750\nOr x86 folder.\n\n135\n00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.540\nAnd that just happens to be where the\nsoftware is that we're going to be using.\n\n136\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.600\nI'm going to using an open source software\nthat we've been using throughout this\n\n137\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.730\nseries called NotePad plus plus.\n\n138\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.780\nAnd it installs itself by\ndefault here in the programs x86\n\n139\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.770\nFolder 32 bit application.\n\n140\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.630\nAnd all we're doing really is just\npointing it to the executable.\n\n141\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.720\nAll right, we choose Next.\n\n142\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.730\nNow upon installation,\n\n143\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.640\nif I have any additional command line\narguments that I wanna add, I could add\n\n144\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.470\nthese in here, you can see that\nthey're optional, or a working folder.\n\n145\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.500\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nleave that to the default.\n\n146\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.050\nI do want to just take a second because\nthis is gonna come in handy when we show\n\n147\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.730\nyou the process of just loading\na template that's already been created\n\n148\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.780\ninto this generator so that if you\nwanted to do post editing you can.\n\n149\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.130\nBut notice it says when you click next,\n\n150\n00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.850\nif I have this check mark it talks\nabout the discover locations\n\n151\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.280\nIt's one of the reasons that this does\nneed administrative level privileges.\n\n152\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.220\nWhen it says discovers locations, again,\nit's capturing the areas in the registry\n\n153\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.970\nand the files that are being modified in\norder to make them part of this template.\n\n154\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.440\nIf you uncheck this then\nwhat you're saying is\n\n155\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.230\njust make me a blank template not based\non anything, all right and you'll see\n\n156\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.622\nwhen we do that a little bit later you'll\nsee that a lot of these settings go away.\n\n157\n00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:51.030\nAll right, we'll go ahead and\nchoose next on this.\n\n158\n00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.490\nAnd notice that right now,\nlet me see if I can get in here, and\n\n159\n00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.961\nit says discovering locations,\nthis is kind of important.\n\n160\n00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:57.140\nSo right now.\n\n161\n00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.554\nIt's monitoring the locations\nin the registry and\n\n162\n00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:01.471\nany files that are going to be modified.\n\n163\n00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:04.948\nSo, at this point what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to modify some settings here.\n\n164\n00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:08.960\nAll right, now you'll have to kind of drag\nthis off to the side because it's on top.\n\n165\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.740\nAnd, it isn't going to go away.\n\n166\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.000\nAll right,\nnow I'm going to come in here and\n\n167\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.120\njust make some minor\nmodifications to this.\n\n168\n00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.878\nSo, I'm going to choose big icons.\n\n169\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:21.390\nWe're going to go ahead and you'll see\nover here we'll show the document list and\n\n170\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.970\nmaybe take the name from\nthe horizontal to the vertical.\n\n171\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.870\nRight, making some minor\nmodifications here, choosing close.\n\n172\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.460\n>> These are program settings that you're\nchanging inside notepad plus plus plus.\n\n173\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.860\n>> That's right, that's right, and\nyou're going to see the configurations\n\n174\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.250\ndocuments here in a second,\nonce I close this out.\n\n175\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.940\nNow, there we go.\n\n176\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.560\nI don't know if I caught that quite close\nenough, but it said discovering locations,\n\n177\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.250\nand then it changed to location\ndiscovery is complete, click next.\n\n178\n00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.350\nAll right, now when we click next,\nit's interesting.\n\n179\n00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.208\nYou'll notice that not every program,\nright?\n\n180\n00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:02.780\nNot every program makes\nmodifications to registry keys.\n\n181\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.880\nAnd we can see that right here that\nthere's Standard Registry keys.\n\n182\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.735\nAnd, be careful with this,\n\n183\n00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:10.340\nbecause it doesn't look like a clickable\nfield when you first see this,\n\n184\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.310\nit's grayed out.\n\n185\n00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.240\nWell, anytime I see a grayed out field,\nthat to me means that it's not configured,\n\n186\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.970\nyou can't do anything with it, but\nthat's unfortunately not the case.\n\n187\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.800\nWhen you hover over this you could\nhave non standard registry keys.\n\n188\n00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.860\nBut, what we're, for this application,\n\n189\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.400\nwhat it did collect here\nis notice the file tab.\n\n190\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.750\nAgain be careful with this,\n\n191\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.640\nthey're grayed out I don't know why\nthe color scheming was chose this way.\n\n192\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.660\nBecause again that to me doesn't look\nlike a clickable field until we do\n\n193\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.490\na little hover and discover and\nsay, there is something there.\n\n194\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.940\nAlright and then these are the fields,\nand notice what Dan was asking earlier so\n\n195\n00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.730\nit's checking right now the\nconfigurations, the user configurations.\n\n196\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.330\nThat's right all of these XML files here,\nXML a sensible markup language,\n\n197\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.970\nit's how a lot of the configurations\nhappen inside of Windows today, all right?\n\n198\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.350\nNow, it also has some\nnon-standard locations.\n\n199\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:03.140\nYou can see that there is some AppData\nthere in a hidden location by default.\n\n200\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.970\nAnd then, also we've got some information\nrelated to OneDrive, all right.\n\n201\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.520\nNow, the next thing that we can we do is\nwe can make some modifications if we want\n\n202\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.440\nto the template itself.\n\n203\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.290\nAlright, we can choose next.\n\n204\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.820\nI can choose the application name here,\nalright.\n\n205\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.940\nAnd, what I'm going to do is we'll\njust call this notepad plus plus.\n\n206\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.575\nA program name, version name, all of\nthat I'm going to leave the same here.\n\n207\n00:10:27.575 --> 00:10:31.295\nLet me see if I can wake up my mouse.\n\n208\n00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:32.455\nThere we go.\n\n209\n00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:36.845\nTemplate author, we'll just go ahead and\nput my name, Wes Bryan and\n\n210\n00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:41.332\nmy email address should they\nneed to get ahold of me.\n\n211\n00:10:41.332 --> 00:10:45.032\nAll right, now I can also kind of,\nas a little summary here,\n\n212\n00:10:45.032 --> 00:10:48.512\nI can go in and,remember there\nweren't any registry files, but\n\n213\n00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:52.042\nI can also see the files here,\nkind of like a summary pane too.\n\n214\n00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.850\nAll right, and we could choose create.\n\n215\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.310\nNow, when we create this, be careful\nwith this file because this file\n\n216\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.650\nis your template that's going\nto have to be, if it's deployed,\n\n217\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.330\nloaded in to the settings\ntemplate catalog.\n\n218\n00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.390\nAll right.\nNow I'm going to for\n\n219\n00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.030\npurposes of this demonstration, I'm going\nto put this right on the desktop so\n\n220\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.270\nwe kind of see what's going on here.\n\n221\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.130\nNow, notice it says you should test\nthis template before you do deploy it on\n\n222\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.530\ncomputers.\n\n223\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.100\nWell, how do I test the template?\n\n224\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.130\nWell, let me show you.\n\n225\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.960\nThat's the other part of the user\nexperience virtualization generator is\n\n226\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.300\nthe validation of the settings\nwithin the template.\n\n227\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.540\nIs that template valid?\n\n228\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.910\nWell, that's okay,\n\n229\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:34.220\nwe've got an option right here that\nallows us to validate the settings.\n\n230\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.990\nAlright, so we'll go ahead and just.\n\n231\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.260\nThere's my template that we just created.\n\n232\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.420\nAnd, we're going to choose validate.\n\n233\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.030\nAnd, notice here, Dan,\nit says right on top,\n\n234\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.350\nit says this template is valid, all right.\n\n235\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.170\nSo, that we know now that\nour settings are good.\n\n236\n00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.320\nWe've looked at the locations.\n\n237\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.190\nWe, it came to the edit screen,\nwe modified the properties,\n\n238\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.280\nthe app name itself,\nprogram name, product version.\n\n239\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.930\nAll right, now what happens if we want to\ncome back and we want to edit a template?\n\n240\n00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.490\nI'll tell you what.\n\n241\n00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.490\nBefore we get there,\nI am kind of getting ahead of myself here.\n\n242\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.560\nWe did validate it,\nwe know that template is good.\n\n243\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.248\nI kind of want to just open\nup this template, Dan,\n\n244\n00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:16.330\nso you guys can kind of see\nwhat is actually going on here.\n\n245\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.700\nAnd, you can see it is just XML data.\n\n246\n00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:24.350\nXML data that's telling the UEV\nagent hey this is where you look.\n\n247\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.080\nYou look here to configure this, you look\nto this path, this environment variable,\n\n248\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.760\nthis is put right here,\nthis setting is configured here.\n\n249\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.138\nAnd, you could see its,\nyou can really see it now [LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:38.700\nYou can just see that it's just\nbasic XML notation, but for our\n\n251\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.260\ndemonstration purposes, I just want you\nto see how much information is in here.\n\n252\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.380\nThere's a lot of XML in here.\n\n253\n00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.170\nAll right, however, what happens?\n\n254\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.890\nWe're going to run through\na real quick process here.\n\n255\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:55.560\nI'm going to create another one\nbased on the same exact application,\n\n256\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.650\nbut I'm going to modify it\njust a little bit this time.\n\n257\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.360\nGuys, I'm doing all the same steps, right?\n\n258\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.870\nWe'll choose, this time, to uncheck that.\n\n259\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:05.820\nRemember, we kept it checked.\n\n260\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.080\nWe said, run the discover locations\nportion of this software.\n\n261\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.960\nNow, notice what happens.\n\n262\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.870\nWe get a lot less here on the side.\n\n263\n00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.310\nWe get three options versus\nputting a check mark in here.\n\n264\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.360\nDiscover locations gone.\n\n265\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.200\nSo, what's happening here is that it's\nsaying, okay, well maybe you just want to\n\n266\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.490\ncreate a template now that you can modify\nlater and adjust settings if you want to.\n\n267\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.150\nOr, maybe you just want\nto modify the metadata.\n\n268\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.650\nSo, we'll just do that.\n\n269\n00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:37.368\nWe'll create this and what I just want\nto do for identification purposes,\n\n270\n00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:43.920\nI'll just put Notepad, we'll do Notepad\nplus plus and we'll just call this blank.\n\n271\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.920\nAll right, and the reason I say that,\njust easily identifiable, and\n\n272\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.120\nI'll choose Create.\n\n273\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.040\nI'm going to also put this\non the desktop one time.\n\n274\n00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.090\nAnd, you know what?\n\n275\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.500\nLet's make sure we name it\nsomething unique, Blank.\n\n276\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.650\nThere we go.\n\n277\n00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.580\nSave, all right.\n\n278\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.350\nSo, now we have two of our\ntemplates sitting over here.\n\n279\n00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.250\nSo, if I want to edit the settings,\nall right?\n\n280\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.300\nI can do that, but now here's\nwhere it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n281\n00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.030\nWhen I choose edit location, or\nsettings location template, alright.\n\n282\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.600\nYou'll see that it gives me the option\nwhich one am I going to choose, all right.\n\n283\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.800\nI'm going to choose the one that says\nblank, it makes it easier to find here.\n\n284\n00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.360\nBut, here's where you,\nhere's something that you don't get when\n\n285\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.160\nyou go back and edit it.\n\n286\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.389\nIt's why the generator is really,\nreally nice.\n\n287\n00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.960\nIf you don't know where the settings are,\nor if you're not running the discover\n\n288\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.990\nlocation, you have to\nmanually enter everything.\n\n289\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.210\nAlright, so, that's why I could\nrecommend using the generator.\n\n290\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.450\nThe generator's smart enough,\nit knows where to look.\n\n291\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.930\nSame thing with files.\n\n292\n00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.600\nYou don't have to tell it to file pass\nversus all the ones that we've already\n\n293\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.460\nseen there.\n\n294\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.750\nSo, that's a little bit about how\nif you were going to do the editing\n\n295\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.976\nyou could edit the template itself.\n\n296\n00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:07.670\nKeep in mind that that's the beauty of\nhaving the generator in and of itself.\n\n297\n00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.410\nAlright Dan, so\nthat's got a customized location.\n\n298\n00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.920\nKeep in mind that with this XML file,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n299\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.310\nget rid of this blank one so\nI know what's going on with that.\n\n300\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.940\nNow, what we would have to do is\nwe would have to make sure that we\n\n301\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.200\nimport this template\ninto the catalog itself.\n\n302\n00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.890\nSo, let's go ahead real quick and let's\ndo that, let's show you how that's done..\n\n303\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.180\nI'm just going to browse to\nmy server's hard drive here.\n\n304\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.350\nNotice that we have, we created in\nthe first part of this little series here.\n\n305\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.840\nDan, you remember we created that\nUEV Template Catalog, right?\n\n306\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.440\nWell, that's where we're actually going\nto place, and not that difficult, right?\n\n307\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.000\n>> No, it's pretty simple.\n\n308\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.080\n>> Yeah, it's pretty simple.\n\n309\n00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.070\nIt has to be there.\n\n310\n00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.600\nNow, Dan did ask a great question.\n\n311\n00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.918\nSays do we have to use\nthe Microsoft default templates?\n\n312\n00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:58.840\nNo, you do not, but you can use both.\n\n313\n00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.395\nSo that's going to be up to you All right.\n\n314\n00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:05.846\nAnd really one of the things that\nI think we should look at now is\n\n315\n00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:09.614\nthe actual GPO configuration\nin order to compare our\n\n316\n00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:13.890\nclients to have these\nclients pushed out them.\n\n317\n00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.940\nAll right.\nSo\n\n318\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.840\nwe're gonna jump on over\nto our domain controller.\n\n319\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.950\nWhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nlaunch up our server manager.\n\n320\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.440\nRemember the ultimate goal\nhere is to get to computer, or\n\n321\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.200\nthe group policy management console.\n\n322\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.320\nWe're going to go ahead and choose tools\nand we'll launch group policy management.\n\n323\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.530\nNow, in the first part of this series,\n\n324\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.180\nremember we went ahead and\nwe already created our group policy.\n\n325\n00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.540\nWe verified the settings were there and\nwe are going to go ahead and\n\n326\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.180\nright- click on this.\n\n327\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.550\nAnd we're going to edit some settings.\n\n328\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.800\nKeep in mind where these are located,\n\n329\n00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.410\nthey're going to be under\ncomputer configuration, policies.\n\n330\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:51.270\nIt's going to be administrative templates,\nWindows components, and\n\n331\n00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:56.100\nthen yes, if you scroll down here\nabout halfway or so, you'll see this\n\n332\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.030\nMicrosoft User Experience Virtualization\nnode and if we expand that out\n\n333\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.270\nWe'll see a couple of different locations,\nright, applications and Windows apps.\n\n334\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.140\nI want to go ahead and take a second\nhere and talk about setting up\n\n335\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.010\nMicrosoft User Experience Virtualization\nmore, then we're gonna talk about peek and\n\n336\n00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.830\ntweaking and fine tuning, if you will,\nsome of the individual settings.\n\n337\n00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.370\nAll right, so one of the very first ones,\n\n338\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.400\nselecting that Microsoft User\nExperience Virtualization note,\n\n339\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.880\nthere's a couple of settings that\nare very very important to us over here.\n\n340\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.120\nAnd if we kind of zoom in here you'll\nsee these two settings right here,\n\n341\n00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.440\nthe settings storage path.\n\n342\n00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.700\nKeep in mind that the settings storage\npath is when the UEV agent is running on\n\n343\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.170\na computer and you've determined that, or\nit's determined that it's gonna monitor\n\n344\n00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.210\nthe settings that change, when settings\ndo change it creates a settings package.\n\n345\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.480\nThat settings package is\nthen put in this location.\n\n346\n00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.950\nAnd for UEV to synchronize settings right,\nyou have to have this setting right.\n\n347\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we'll click\nthat and we're gonna zoom out here.\n\n348\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.450\nAnd what it's doing is it's,\nyou'll see it's looking for a UNC path.\n\n349\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.600\nThis is why we say you put\nthis on a file server,\n\n350\n00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.190\nwe just happen to put it in our domain\ncontroller here for the testing purposes.\n\n351\n00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.820\nAnd remember what we did here, kind of\nconnect the dots here in the background.\n\n352\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.510\nIf I go to local disk c, right?\n\n353\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.180\nI can see UEV settings and\n\n354\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.160\nif I right-click on that,\nI can see that the sharing settings here.\n\n355\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.280\nHey, looks like it isn't shared.\n\n356\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.420\nSo, let's go ahead real quick.\n\n357\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.310\nThat's interesting.\n\n358\n00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.150\n>> Remedy that situation.\n\n359\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.660\n>> Remedy that situation real quick.\n\n360\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.880\nAnd I don't want to just\nput everybody in here.\n\n361\n00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.660\nI do wanna make sure that I do UEV and\n\n362\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.280\nif we zoom on out here and\ndo a check names you'll see UEV's\n\n363\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.100\nclients there and we'll go ahead and\nput them back there, read, write.\n\n364\n00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.900\nWe're just gonna double check and\nmake sure all these settings because\n\n365\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.315\nI need this UNC path If I don't\nhave this UNC path well guess what?\n\n366\n00:18:44.315 --> 00:18:47.615\nThis is not gonna work and\nit's gonna be a very short episode.\n\n367\n00:18:47.615 --> 00:18:48.655\nAll right?\nSo we'll go ahead and\n\n368\n00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:51.005\nchoose done to that and\nI do just want to take a second,\n\n369\n00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:53.655\nit's all good things because\nyou need to troubleshoot this\n\n370\n00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:56.215\nin your own deployment\nif something goes wrong.\n\n371\n00:18:56.215 --> 00:19:00.955\nAnd I can see the UEB clients are also\nin the NTFS local permissions and\n\n372\n00:19:00.955 --> 00:19:05.860\nthey do have full control so now we\nshould be doing a little bit better.\n\n373\n00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.280\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna enable this.\n\n374\n00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.010\nAnd we're gonna put our UNC path\n//DC01/ and that'll be UEB Settings.\n\n375\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:18.620\nKeep in mind, that'll be the UNC path\nbased on the folder that you use.\n\n376\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.770\nAll right, and we're gonna set that,\nwe apply that.\n\n377\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.270\nNow, the next one that we have is\nthe settings template catalogue path.\n\n378\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.860\nAll right?\nSo let's go ahead and since we do have\n\n379\n00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:35.630\na customized settings location template\nwe're gonna go ahead and use this.\n\n380\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.940\nNow, I want to kind of come back\nto a question Dan asked earlier.\n\n381\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.660\nWe're gonna use, by the way,\nthat UNC leading\n\n382\n00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.680\nto the other folder that\nwe created on our server,\n\n383\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.650\nif you remember right that\nwas UEVTemplatesCatalog.\n\n384\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.800\nAnd if these should not synchronize,\n\n385\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.640\nshouldn't synchronize,\njust pay attention to your typing.\n\n386\n00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.440\nYou guys have seen my\nlovely typing skills.\n\n387\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.380\nNow Dan asked a great question earlier.\n\n388\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.170\nHe says well do we have to use\nthe default Microsoft templates?\n\n389\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.590\nNo you do not and\nthis is where you would set that.\n\n390\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.260\nIf I have only customized templates\nbased on third party software,\n\n391\n00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.395\nI just put a check mark in there and\nsay you know,\n\n392\n00:20:17.395 --> 00:20:21.010\nUE-V agent turn a blind eye there to\neverything that you have stored locally.\n\n393\n00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.160\nAnd just look here and\npull these down, and\n\n394\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.680\nthen I believe it's once or twice a day It\nwill check this catalog to see if there\n\n395\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.480\nare any updates to additional software\nthat it might need to be monitoring.\n\n396\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.080\nNow, if you do not check this,\nokay, then it is going to use both.\n\n397\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.680\nIt will use the defaults if\nwe have default software, and\n\n398\n00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.620\nwe will show you how to peek and\ntweak that too.\n\n399\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.080\nBut it will also use that template that we\nedited, we created, customized and put in\n\n400\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.410\nthe template catalog path or share that we\ncreated in the beginning of this episode.\n\n401\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.060\n>> Wes, what would be the reasoning\nof not wanting to use both.\n\n402\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.900\nIt would seem like I want more\noptions rather than less.\n\n403\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.410\n>> I don't know other than maybe,\nmaybe, and maybe, bandwidth.\n\n404\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.030\nOther than that, I don't know\nbecause this happens really fast.\n\n405\n00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.770\nAnd that's one of the benefits.\n\n406\n00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.660\nOf going, you know,\nthis route rather than roaming\n\n407\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.890\nprofiles is the fact that this is very,\nvery expedient, I guess I could say.\n\n408\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:20.560\nYou know, it really is highly optimized so\nI don't have a good answer on that one.\n\n409\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.050\nlet's go and choose OK to this.\n\n410\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.600\nNow there are a couple other things\nthat I want to mention while Here,\n\n411\n00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.980\nDan's looking at me, I know we've kind\nof running close on time on this one.\n\n412\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.250\nA couple of cool things though that I want\nyou to see is that synchronised settings.\n\n413\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.960\nNow let's go ahead and make sure that\nthere's no smoke and mirrors here, and\n\n414\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.450\nmagic tricks,\nit synchronizes these settings by default.\n\n415\n00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.320\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.170\nBut one of the things that I want you\nto remember is in roaming profiles.\n\n417\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.580\nRemember how we said that you don't\nget the ability to pick and choose?\n\n418\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.600\nIf we don't show you this setting,\n\n419\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.880\nthen you really don't know what is\none of the major benefits of UED.\n\n420\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.190\nSo I can come in here and\nI can say Enabled.\n\n421\n00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.830\nAnd I can control.\n\n422\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:01.770\nI can control what's individually\nis going to be synchronized or\n\n423\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.380\nwhat's not going to be\nsynchronized as well.\n\n424\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.970\nAll right.\nThe big ones though that I want you to\n\n425\n00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.090\nreally know about is that settings storage\npath and settings template catalog.\n\n426\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.620\nAll right, and, I also want to look\na little bit at the applications,\n\n427\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.140\nif I can say that, all right.\n\n428\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.840\nWe can see, and we will see this, when we\ndeploy the user experience virtualization\n\n429\n00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.910\nagent, but look at all the defaults,\nall of these\n\n430\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.080\ndefaults pieces of software is what\nmonitors without a simple template.\n\n431\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.000\nNow you might say, well what a second Wes,\nwhy would I want to come in here.\n\n432\n00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.890\nWell, maybe you don't have all of these.\n\n433\n00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.770\nMaybe you have two different versions of\na piece of software you're running and\n\n434\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.600\non some machines you're running 2010 and\n\n435\n00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.600\nsome machines you're running 2013 and\neven on some your running 2016.\n\n436\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.940\nWell if I come in here and\nI say you know what Microsoft,\n\n437\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.240\nI'm just gonna pick one randomly.\n\n438\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.440\nGonna shoot at the dart board,\nsee what number it lands.\n\n439\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.080\nSharePoint Designer 2013.\n\n440\n00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.000\nIf I choose enable then what that's gonna\ndo is it's gonna continue to synchronize\n\n441\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.290\nit or I can choose disable.\n\n442\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.040\nAnd that's the one we\nreally want to look at.\n\n443\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.950\nIf I don't want to\nsynchronize the settings,\n\n444\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.440\nI can get very granular on even\nthe default templates themselves.\n\n445\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.430\nI could say no,\ndon't synchronize these settings.\n\n446\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:18.160\nSo, that's a really good thing to have to,\nand then very basically Windows apps.\n\n447\n00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.150\nWe talked about some of\nthose modern UI apps,\n\n448\n00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.530\nas they called it back in the days,\nthe Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n449\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.670\nIn fact, you can see that's\none of the requirements,\n\n450\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.250\nyou have to have at least Windows 8 or\n8.1 for these cuz keep in mind,\n\n451\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.010\nthose are those full-blown\ntile-based type windows, RTAPIs.\n\n452\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.790\nAnd you can control what\ngets synchronized there.\n\n453\n00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.950\n>> Even if it did work with Windows 7 or\nprior,\n\n454\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.596\nit wouldn't do you a whole lot of good.\n\n455\n00:23:42.596 --> 00:23:43.114\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n456\n00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:45.290\n[LAUGH] So if you've got\nWindows7 machines, good point,\n\n457\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.670\nif you've got Windows7 machines Your\nclient side extensions are gonna look at\n\n458\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.480\nthis policy and say, what?\n\n459\n00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.303\nSo you don't have to worry about that.\n\n460\n00:23:52.303 --> 00:23:53.135\n>> This operating system.\n\n461\n00:23:53.135 --> 00:23:53.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n462\n00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.800\nwhat are these tiles you speak of?\n\n463\n00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.590\nSo Dan, that's really got our\nsettings ready to deploy out.\n\n464\n00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:05.320\nNow it's just a matter of getting the UEV\nagent installed on the managed client.\n\n465\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.900\nAnd then the test to see if the settings\nif they're actually working for us.\n\n466\n00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.010\n>> Well this is gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n467\n00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.370\nI'm enjoying this so far.\n\n468\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.820\nVery cool little system that\nMicrosoft has deployed for us.\n\n469\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.460\nSo if you don't want the full\nblown roaming profile.\n\n470\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.980\nOr something like folder redirection\nyou want the best of both worlds.\n\n471\n00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.100\nYou can run to.\n\n472\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.136\nI'm looking forward to see\nthis thing actually run.\n\n473\n00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:29.970\nTry to key and hit the gas, see what\nshe'll do, that being said, thank you so\n\n474\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.730\nmuch for explaining this things to us.\n\n475\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.580\nWe thank you guys for watching and\nwant to go ahead and sign off.\n\n476\n00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.780\nHopefully see you in part three for IT Pro\nTV, I've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n477\n00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.932\n>> And I'm Wes Bryant,\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n478\n00:24:41.932 --> 00:24:48.454\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:20.926\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:23.759\nour Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.037\nJoining us back in the studio again for\nyet another part to the UEV series,\n\n6\n00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:31.901\nour little miniseries inside of\nour series, I guess I should say,\n\n7\n00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.909\nis our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.042\nWes, welcome back sir,\nand how is it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:36.720\n>> Well it's going great,\n\n10\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.736\nI am getting experience in what\nit must be like to write a novel.\n\n11\n00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:40.683\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:44.700\n[LAUGH] We are coming back with the third\nand final part of this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.520\nSo far what we've been looking at is how\nto get the server infrastructure prepared\n\n14\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.350\nin order to use the user\nexperience virtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.070\nWe've talked about some of the components.\n\n16\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.340\nAnd then, getting things like\nyour settings, template,\n\n17\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.650\nlocation, pass, set up as well.\n\n18\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.760\nBut last portion of this series,\nI guess we're going to say,\n\n19\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.250\nis gonna be actually deploying\nthe software to the client.\n\n20\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.030\nSo let's go ahead and jump right in and we\nwon't waste any time here with this one.\n\n21\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.459\nOne of the things that you have to do in\norder to make sure that you can use UEV,\n\n22\n00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.637\nis well, we've been talking about\nthe tools like the UEV generator.\n\n23\n00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:18.580\nBut we haven't mentioned is\nthis little tool right here.\n\n24\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.700\nWe're going to go in the same folder\nwhere I already extracted it out and\n\n25\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.370\nI'm gonna go back to the same\narchitecture, just any CPU.\n\n26\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.410\nRemember when we installed the UEV\ngenerator, that was the tools set up.\n\n27\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.188\nBut what we want this time is,\nwe actually want the AgentSetup and\n\n28\n00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:34.766\nthat's what we're gonna run here.\n\n29\n00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:39.370\nSo let's go ahead, we'll run the user\nexperience virtualization agent.\n\n30\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.390\nAnd we'll go ahead and chose Next,\nwe'll accept the ULA, and like\n\n31\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.568\nthe generator here, we'll have a couple\nof things that we have to check off here.\n\n32\n00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:50.940\nWe're not gonna use the Microsoft Update,\nand\n\n33\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.980\nwe're not gonna opt in\nto the CEIP program.\n\n34\n00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.900\nAnd we'll chose Next.\n\n35\n00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.860\nAll right,\nnow here's where we get a little specific.\n\n36\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.280\nSomething that I haven't talked about yet\nis the synchronization method.\n\n37\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.770\nI wanted to wait until\nwe get to the client so\n\n38\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.390\nyou can actually see what it\nis that we're talking about.\n\n39\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.360\nIf you have another sync provider,\nyou can use an external sync provider,\n\n40\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.960\nsync method.\n\n41\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.046\nIf you have a machine that is always\nconnected to the setting storage\n\n42\n00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:20.924\nlocation then you can\nchoose sync method None.\n\n43\n00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.759\nAnd what that means is the moment settings\nare written, they're gonna write their way\n\n44\n00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.890\nto the catalog, or not the catalog, excuse\nme, but the settings storage location.\n\n45\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.750\nThe default here is the SyncProvider.\n\n46\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.290\nAnd what that means is, let that agent\nitself run the SyncProvider within it and\n\n47\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.440\nit'll manage synchronizing the settings\nbetween the agent itself or the client,\n\n48\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.510\nI should say, and the applications and\nthen in setting storage locations.\n\n49\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.370\nSo we're just gonna\nleave the default here.\n\n50\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.700\nAnd here's where we get to enter\nthat UNC path from earlier.\n\n51\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.940\nRemember that we shared out\nthe UEV settings folder, well,\n\n52\n00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.010\nthat's the path that we're\ngonna be putting in here.\n\n53\n00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.135\nIt is the same identical\nUNC path that you had\n\n54\n00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:02.805\nput in the GPOs when you\nconfigured the group policy.\n\n55\n00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:05.375\nSo keep in mind those have to match or\nwell,\n\n56\n00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:07.965\nwe aren't gonna get any\nsynchronization here.\n\n57\n00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:12.415\nSo we'll go ahead and\ntype that out, DC01 and\n\n58\n00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:16.765\nthen it's gonna be the UEVSettings folder.\n\n59\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.400\nAnd make sure I've got that spelled right.\n\n60\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.700\nNow, the next one is this is optional.\n\n61\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.610\nAll right, I want to go ahead and\nshow how you set it all up, right?\n\n62\n00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.080\nIf I am using customized\nsettings template location or,\n\n63\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.580\nexcuse me, settings location templates,\nI'm always getting that one backwards.\n\n64\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.910\nThe settings location templates,\n\n65\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.850\nif we've customized,\nwe have to use the catalog path as well.\n\n66\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.930\nAnd since we have done that,\nwe're gonna go ahead and set this up.\n\n67\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.927\nNow I will tell you that we're not\ngonna be pulling anything out of\n\n68\n00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:53.197\nthe customize setting, but we'll go\nahead and just set it up anyways so\n\n69\n00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:54.580\nyou guys can see the process.\n\n70\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.970\n>> And\napparently you need a valid UNC Path.\n\n71\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.970\n>> You do, you need a valid,\nyeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.960\nYou put question mark,\nquestion mark dash question mark,\n\n73\n00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.430\nit's gonna look at you with\na question mark as well.\n\n74\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.910\nTemplates catalog here I believe\nis what we named that UNC path and\n\n75\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.010\nwe'll go ahead we'll leave that\nwhere it is and we'll choose Next.\n\n76\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.547\nAll right, so\nfairly straight forward process.\n\n77\n00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:20.640\nWe're gonna go ahead and let it install\nand let me talk a little bit more while\n\n78\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.900\nthe installation is running here\nbecause it will require a restart.\n\n79\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.069\nRemember what the agent does,\nremember when the UEV agent runs and\n\n80\n00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.856\nyou open an application,\nthat it has a template built in.\n\n81\n00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:36.030\nWe're gonna go ahead, when we click Finish\nhere it should opt us into a restart.\n\n82\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.330\nAnd while I'm explaining this I'm gonna\nswitch over to our other controller,\n\n83\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.220\nour domain controller so we can see.\n\n84\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.940\nWe have to set up the UEV\nagent on two computers or\n\n85\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.320\nwe're not synchronizing\napplications between computers.\n\n86\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.776\nSo any computer that you're gonna run\nthe UEV on has to have the agent set up.\n\n87\n00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:54.938\nAnd we'll go ahead and do this as we give\nyou a little bit more of an explanation\n\n88\n00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:56.870\nof what this UEV agent is doing here.\n\n89\n00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.880\nWe'll go ahead and choose Next to this.\n\n90\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.670\nNow, when we, and\nsame setup here guys as well.\n\n91\n00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.572\nNow, when the UEV agent comes online,\nagain, the first thing that\n\n92\n00:05:07.572 --> 00:05:12.483\nit's gonna do is it's gonna check\nthe settings storage location.\n\n93\n00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:16.594\nAnd what it's looking for is,\ndo I have any settings packages\n\n94\n00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:20.319\nup there that I need to apply\ncurrently to this machine?\n\n95\n00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.403\nIf it finds those,\nthen what it does is exactly that,\n\n96\n00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:27.880\nit pulls down those settings and\nit applies it to your local machine.\n\n97\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.130\nNow, let's say that we're on\nthe machine that we're making changes.\n\n98\n00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.090\nWell, if we're on the machine that\nwe're making changes, then what's gonna\n\n99\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.880\nhappen here is, it will monitor those\nareas cuz that's what the UEV agent does.\n\n100\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.580\nIt monitors those areas for\nchanges as well.\n\n101\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.610\nAnd if it does see those\nchanges are present, again,\n\n102\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.860\nit gathers and bundles them up.\n\n103\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.530\nIt creates a settings package and\nthen it turns around and\n\n104\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.820\nit places that settings package back\nin that setting storage location.\n\n105\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.150\nAnd then the process just repeats itself\nanytime you open an application on a new\n\n106\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.290\nmachine, you move to another machine,\nyou log into it for the first time and\n\n107\n00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.640\nfire up the application,\nit's also gonna be checking there.\n\n108\n00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.400\nChecking that setting storage location as\nwell, ensuring that nothing has changed.\n\n109\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.840\nYou can see that we'll do the same\nthing here on this machine.\n\n110\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.150\nWe'll finish it and\nwe'll let it go ahead and restart.\n\n111\n00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.120\nNow once it restarts,\nwe'll go ahead and get logged back in.\n\n112\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.760\nNow, how you implement this inside\nof Active Directory is up to you.\n\n113\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.360\nI went ahead and the way I set it up is so\nthat pretty much anybody that logs\n\n114\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.090\non this machine is gonna get a UEV agent\nthat's gonna start running for them, and\n\n115\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.520\nit's gonna start\ncollecting their settings.\n\n116\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.990\nNow, it is important to make sure\nwhen you're troubleshooting,\n\n117\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.720\nif you happen to have,\n\n118\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.110\nlike I have an administrative user account\nand I have a standard user account, right?\n\n119\n00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.430\nThe problem is if I log in with a standard\nuser account and then turn around and\n\n120\n00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.940\nlog in with the administrative\naccount on the other computer,\n\n121\n00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.530\nthose are different accounts, right?\n\n122\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.540\nIt is a user by user basis.\n\n123\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.940\nJust because you have multiple accounts,\n\n124\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.980\nremember the machine doesn't\nreally have any idea of that.\n\n125\n00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.830\nSo while that other machine is\nrebooting here, let's go ahead and\n\n126\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.828\nlog back in and\nkind of look at what this just did for us.\n\n127\n00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:17.013\nCuz we haven't talked about another major\npiece here that's on the client, right?\n\n128\n00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:20.890\nAnd that's called, something called\nthe company settings portal.\n\n129\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.040\nThis is where you can look to find\nout are things synchronizing?\n\n130\n00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.270\nIt looks like, I'll tell you what,\n\n131\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.460\nwe'll go ahead and get logged back\ninto this one real quick too.\n\n132\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.236\nThere we go.\n\n133\n00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:34.021\nAll right, now,\nhead's kinda covering it up here but\n\n134\n00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:39.219\nyou should be able to see in the lower\nright hand corner here, it gives it a.\n\n135\n00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.642\nThere it goes, takes a second to\ncome up into that notification area,\n\n136\n00:07:42.642 --> 00:07:44.220\nlittle icon right here.\n\n137\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.682\nThat is your UEV icon and if we\nright-click on that, we can choose Open.\n\n138\n00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:53.680\nAll right, and this is is a good\nthing Dan, I can tell you.\n\n139\n00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.820\nThis is a really good thing,\nthis means so far everything looks okay.\n\n140\n00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.670\nNotice it say Sync settings are enabled.\n\n141\n00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.241\nIt says your administrator has enabled\na new feature and then it tells you it\n\n142\n00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:07.224\nsynchronizes your windows and application\nsettings between your work computer.\n\n143\n00:08:07.224 --> 00:08:10.770\nSo that's a good thing but\nthat's not the end, unfortunately.\n\n144\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.940\nWe also have to find out if\nthe synchronization capabilities\n\n145\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.920\nare truly working.\n\n146\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.540\nSo we'll go ahead and\nclose out of this, so\n\n147\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.620\njust a little heads up menu lets your\nusers know that big brother is watching.\n\n148\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.220\nAnd fairly straightforward, right?\n\n149\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.840\nThis is the Company Settings Center.\n\n150\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.813\nYou can see that the synchronization\nis On, all right?\n\n151\n00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.935\nOne of the ways that you can test this\nright away in the back end, to see if you\n\n152\n00:08:32.935 --> 00:08:38.180\nas an administrator have configured this\ncorrectly, is to implement a manual sync.\n\n153\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.827\nSee this little button right here,\nit says Sync Now?\n\n154\n00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:43.549\nWhen you click it, if you get a blue\nbar after the synchronization process,\n\n155\n00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.950\nthen that means it found\nwhat it was looking for.\n\n156\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.610\nI can give you troubleshooting\nadvice right away,\n\n157\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.420\nif you get a red bar\nacross the top of this,\n\n158\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.450\nyou'll typically get a pop-up that kind\nof looks like the one that first started.\n\n159\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.800\nBut it will be an error message and\n\n160\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.140\nit will say, sometimes it will\nhave information in there,\n\n161\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.590\nand sometimes it will just say\ncontact your systems administrator.\n\n162\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.360\nThe fact that we didn't get\nthat message lets us know, so\n\n163\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.660\nfar, that everything is\nrunning appropriately.\n\n164\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.260\n>> And like you said,\n\n165\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.150\neven though we have a dedicated management\nstation, that you're using for this.\n\n166\n00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.120\nThis can be really any computer that we\nnormally use as administrators, correct?\n\n167\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.735\n>> Absolutely, in fact, remember, the only\nreason you need the administrative\n\n168\n00:09:21.735 --> 00:09:23.970\ncomputeriIs for the UEV generator.\n\n169\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.460\nThat's all you need it for.\n\n170\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.560\nAnd Dan's right, because, administrators,\n\n171\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.660\nyou have to be an administrator\nto run the UEV generator.\n\n172\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.828\nSo it is a good idea to go ahead and\nput that on an administrative workstation.\n\n173\n00:09:33.828 --> 00:09:37.600\nIf you aren't making templates, then\nyou don't need a dedicated workstation,\n\n174\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.900\nthis is your workstation.\n\n175\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.650\nYour user's workstation,\nif you will, past that.\n\n176\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.850\nNow look at some of the Windows\nsettings that we see.\n\n177\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.990\nWe seen in the last part of this\nmini-series that we're running here.\n\n178\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.730\nWe seen some of these settings and you\nremember, I didn't check off the roaming\n\n179\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.560\ncredentials, so these are identical\nto what we seen in the group policy.\n\n180\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.916\nAll right,\nnothing is grayed out here, right?\n\n181\n00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:04.600\nAnd that means we're giving\nthe end user their choice.\n\n182\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.240\nYou can enforce this with group policy.\n\n183\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.112\nYou can say, you know what?\n\n184\n00:10:07.112 --> 00:10:09.760\nI don't want your ease of\naccess settings going over.\n\n185\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.470\nI don't want your network printers going\nout cuz we've got GPO's that put them and\n\n186\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.430\ntheir preferences they push them out.\n\n187\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.690\nI don't need any of that.\n\n188\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.930\nRight, but\nmaybe I do want the desktop setting or\n\n189\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.910\nmaybe I want the theme settings, and\nagain, that's gonna be up to you.\n\n190\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.640\nNow what I'm really impressed about, Dan,\nis this laundry list of applications.\n\n191\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.510\nAnd I always freak out a little\nbit when I first see it cuz\n\n192\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.640\nit takes a little bit to render.\n\n193\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.920\nThe UEV agent's looking,\nit says what do I see locally?\n\n194\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.520\nThese are all of the applications\nthat have templates\n\n195\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.310\nbuilt into the user experience\nvirtualization agent.\n\n196\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.120\nWithout any customization via\nthe UEV generator at all.\n\n197\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.700\nSo you do have the ability\nto just use what's built in.\n\n198\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.530\nIf you wanna use the third\nparty applications and\n\n199\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.730\ncreate your own customized template,\nyou can.\n\n200\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.542\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe've already run the Sync Now.\n\n201\n00:10:57.542 --> 00:11:01.294\nI'm gonna go ahead and bump on over to\nthe other server here, and we're gonna,\n\n202\n00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.580\nyou can see that the sync\nis now enabled here.\n\n203\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.866\nAnd if I right-click.\n\n204\n00:11:08.024 --> 00:11:09.477\n>> Your head's kinda covering that.\n\n205\n00:11:09.477 --> 00:11:10.190\n>> Is it covering up?\n\n206\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.740\nYeah, so there we go.\n\n207\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.860\nAnd you can see same thing on the server\nicon, just a slightly different, but\n\n208\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.120\nit does say that\nthe settings sync enabled.\n\n209\n00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.925\nLike I said, if this wasn't synchronizing,\nyou'll get an error right here, and\n\n210\n00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:27.630\nit would be an error message that would\nsay contact your systems administrator.\n\n211\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.330\nWe'll go ahead and choose Close,\nwe will choose Sync Now.\n\n212\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.345\nAnd it says it's syncing, and yes,\n\n213\n00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:35.990\nwe can see that we have at least\nsome kind of information syncing.\n\n214\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.510\nLet's see if we can take this for\na test drive and\n\n215\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.350\nsee what it's actually gonna do\nnow that it has been deployed.\n\n216\n00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.609\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nlet`s close all this down.\n\n217\n00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.900\nWe'll get us a fairly clean desktop,\nexcept for\n\n218\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.630\nthe littering that I've done\nto it during this episode.\n\n219\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:55.510\nAnd what are we gonna run, let`s try the\ntrusty old notepad, the built in notepad.\n\n220\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.090\nAll right, so if I go ahead and\nI run this, maybe there are some things\n\n221\n00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.530\nthat I want to customize as far\nas my user settings, right?\n\n222\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.920\nSo the font, I don't need it on\nsatellite point font, all right?\n\n223\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.800\nI need it on something I can actually see,\nso I bump up the font size.\n\n224\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.763\nLet's say 22, maybe I make it bold,\nmaybe I don't like Consolas,\n\n225\n00:12:15.763 --> 00:12:17.989\nmaybe I like something like what is it?\n\n226\n00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:20.598\nNew Times Roman I think,\nis one that I think is in there.\n\n227\n00:12:20.598 --> 00:12:22.084\nLet me see if we can find that.\n\n228\n00:12:22.084 --> 00:12:24.931\nNew, or is it-\n>> Times New Roman.\n\n229\n00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:25.580\n>> That's it.\n\n230\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.700\nThat other one always catches me up, yep.\n\n231\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.729\nOkay, so now we've got it, right?\n\n232\n00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:34.679\nIf I choose OK to this and then I close\nthe application down it looks, well,\n\n233\n00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:35.820\nwhat did it do for me?\n\n234\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:41.530\nWell, it really doesn't look like it did\nmuch for me, but if we get down to our,\n\n235\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.240\nlet me switch over there there we go.\n\n236\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.820\nIt's interesting how it messed\nup my desktop there, and\n\n237\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.280\nit looks like a Windows\ndesktop on a server.\n\n238\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.720\nLet's go ahead and go into the local disk\nC here, and I want to drive down into\n\n239\n00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.520\nthe UEVSettings, the settings storage\nlocation, that we were looking at earlier.\n\n240\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.465\nAll right, so if we open this up, wow,\ndoesn't that look absolutely amazing?\n\n241\n00:13:07.465 --> 00:13:09.262\n>> A whole lot of nothing.\n>> Yeah, a whole lot of nothing.\n\n242\n00:13:09.262 --> 00:13:11.980\nWell, let's make sure that\nthere isn't any hidden folders.\n\n243\n00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.620\nOr there aren't any\nhidden folders in there.\n\n244\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.990\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nshow these and choose OK.\n\n245\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.440\nAnd there we are,\nwe have some settings packages.\n\n246\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.800\nRemember the packages that I told you.\n\n247\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.739\nBut we still don't know if\nthe information's in there yet.\n\n248\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.880\nWell maybe there are some\nsettings in here.\n\n249\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.662\nIn fact, I can see DesktopSettings,\n\n250\n00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:32.230\nEaseOfAccessSettings, a lot of those\nthings that we looked at, right?\n\n251\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.112\nAnd look right here,\nI've got Notepad6, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:39.846\nThis is the internal version number\nthat UEV recognizes Notepad as.\n\n253\n00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:41.380\nAll right, so that's great.\n\n254\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.350\nNow, let's switch back over to\nour other machine here, and\n\n255\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.310\nlet's launch up Notepad from here.\n\n256\n00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.160\nAll right, so let's see,\ndid I get any bigger format?\n\n257\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.520\nNot really sure here yet.\n\n258\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.270\nWe'll find out.\n\n259\n00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.230\nWe're gonna choose Font, and\nlook, nothing happened at all.\n\n260\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.680\nWell, why not?\n\n261\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.050\nRemember our SyncProvider?\n\n262\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.090\nRight, we're using\nthe default SyncProvider.\n\n263\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:13.210\nLet's go ahead, close this back down, go\nback down to our Company Settings Portal,\n\n264\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.400\nand trigger a manual synchronization.\n\n265\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.820\nNow, I've had to do this a couple of\ntimes where you didn't want to wait for\n\n266\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.570\nit to synchronize and communicate.\n\n267\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.020\nSo we'll find out if that worked for us.\n\n268\n00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.050\nAnd if not, sometimes you have to go\nback over to the other machine and\n\n269\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.910\nrun the same.\n\n270\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.443\nWell it does look like my\nfont's a little bit bigger and\n\n271\n00:14:34.443 --> 00:14:35.830\nit looks like it has changed.\n\n272\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.060\nSo, let's find out what our\nformat is now and there it is.\n\n273\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.430\nWe've got Times New Roman,\nwe've got Bold, and\n\n274\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.210\nwe've got it off of the satellite view.\n\n275\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.680\nWe've got a font, that, well,\nwe can actually see and\n\n276\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.050\nwe can confirm that yes,\nit is saving our settings.\n\n277\n00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.810\nNow I wanna go just a little\nbit farther here and\n\n278\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.410\nI wanna kinda drill into\nsome of these locations.\n\n279\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.950\nNotice that it has the package.\n\n280\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.020\nRemember, we set a settings package.\n\n281\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.340\nWell, there you can see it right there.\n\n282\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.470\nThat is the settings package that the UEV\nagent looked on the first machine,\n\n283\n00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.770\nlooks down at the registry and the file\nsettings and says, what is changing?\n\n284\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.450\nOkay, I've seen something change,\n\n285\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.670\nbased on that changing the font type,\nchanging the size of the type, right?\n\n286\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.570\nDid it go to bold for my italics?\n\n287\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.330\nI see all of that information,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n288\n00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.440\nbundle that up into this package.\n\n289\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.020\nAnd I'm gonna put it in\nthe setting storage location, and\n\n290\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.730\nthen the next time we run this on,\nin this case it was the client.\n\n291\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.880\nThe client when we did\nthe synchronization,\n\n292\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.800\nnotice that it didn't come into\nplay with us right away, right?\n\n293\n00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.770\nWe opened it the first time it wasn't\nthere, but when I synchronized it,\n\n294\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.510\nthe agent says, wait a second,\nmy radar's going off.\n\n295\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.710\nI gotta go back up to your file store.\n\n296\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.129\nLook for that settings package,\nif it exists, and\n\n297\n00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:50.559\nif it does I need to pull it down and\napply it to these registry settings and\n\n298\n00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:52.950\nit did it transparently in the background.\n\n299\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.380\nAnd now we get the convenience\nof being able to pick and\n\n300\n00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.710\nchoose what settings roam.\n\n301\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.180\nOr in this case, synchronizes the\nverbiages essentially it's the same thing.\n\n302\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.240\nAnd what settings don't synchronize and\nwe're not left out with\n\n303\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.110\na lot of extra information that's\nstored up on that file server.\n\n304\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.480\nIt happens a lot faster.\n\n305\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.560\nYou've seen how relatively\nfast it happened here.\n\n306\n00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.400\nAnd you get a little\nbit better performance.\n\n307\n00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.610\nAnd you get a consistent user experience.\n\n308\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.480\nHence the term,\nuser experience virtualization.\n\n309\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.160\n>> Well Wes, this is definitely\none of the more practical things\n\n310\n00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.150\nthat Microsoft has developed for\nus as the end user.\n\n311\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.110\nCuz I'll tell ya what,\nworking in this business for\n\n312\n00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.490\nas many years as I have,\none of the things that people just get so\n\n313\n00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.210\nannoyed with is the fact that\nthey sit down at this computer.\n\n314\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.320\nThey get all the tweaks,\nthe bells and whistles,\n\n315\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.900\nthe knobs turned, just like they like.\n\n316\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.700\nAnd then I send them a new computer,\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.810\nBecause that computer got malware or\nsomething happened,\n\n318\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.930\nwe're upgrading, we're moving\nthe operating system, something.\n\n319\n00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.990\nAnd now they've gotta go\nthrough all that again.\n\n320\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.380\nIt's nice for us to just be able to\nload the software and have them log in,\n\n321\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.035\nuse these templates to already, when\nthey sit down, turn the key and use it.\n\n322\n00:16:58.035 --> 00:17:00.400\nIt's already back to the way\nthat the're familiar with and\n\n323\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.685\nthey're just gonna love this.\n\n324\n00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:04.617\n>> I wanna build on that,\nthat's a great point,\n\n325\n00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:07.333\ncoupled with something like WDS, right?\n\n326\n00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:09.990\nLike Dan saying,\nwhat am I giving him a new computer?\n\n327\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.219\nWell, maybe it is a physical computer,\n\n328\n00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:15.710\ncould be as simple as deploying\n50 images on Friday, right?\n\n329\n00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.870\nWe're cleaning up the systems, a little\nspring cleaning, they come back on Monday,\n\n330\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.520\nand like Dan says,\nhe's got a hundred calls.\n\n331\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.960\nIt's this where did this go?\n\n332\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.120\nHow do I tweak this?\n\n333\n00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.320\nHow do I define this setting?\n\n334\n00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.812\nWe don't even have to worry about that.\n\n335\n00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:29.934\nThe moment the user logs in, provided\nyou have your Active Directory users and\n\n336\n00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:33.618\ncomputers group set up right,\nthe moment they log into the computer,\n\n337\n00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:35.770\nit says, wait a second here.\n\n338\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.260\nI'm a part of the group policy.\n\n339\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.180\nLet me reach out to the setting\nstorage location and I'll go ahead and\n\n340\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.740\nI'll apply those right now.\n\n341\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.550\nNot only do we have to still\nkeep a generic image where we\n\n342\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.450\ndon't have to modify and\n\n343\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.580\npeek and tweak everything in the Office\nSuite just to suit the end user's needs.\n\n344\n00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.400\nNow those settings stay persistent\neven if the machine is re-imaged.\n\n345\n00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.130\nThe moment they log back into it with\na fresh image, their settings come back.\n\n346\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:03.120\nSo really, really convenient way to\nmaintain consistency in an environment\n\n347\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.150\nwhere sometimes consistency is\nthe furthest thing from the truth.\n\n348\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.581\n>> That's right, they say happy wife,\nhappy life, but happy users,\n\n349\n00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:10.595\nhappy life as well.\n\n350\n00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:14.570\nAnd this is one of the things we're\ngonna use to keep them happy.\n\n351\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.170\nThat being said, Wes,\nlooks like we've finished\n\n352\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.360\nthis little mini-series that\nwe've been playing around with.\n\n353\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.220\nVery cool stuff.\n\n354\n00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.500\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed this.\n\n355\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.020\nMaybe learned a little bit of something.\n\n356\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.270\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n357\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.350\nWes, thanks for dropping by.\n\n358\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.308\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n359\n00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.840\nI have been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n360\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.931\n>> I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n361\n00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:33.137\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n362\n00:18:33.137 --> 00:18:40.919\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
