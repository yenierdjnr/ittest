Well, this is an interesting tech\nskill, because one of the things you might\n\n8\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.100\nfind out there is, there is plenty of, I\nwould say, textual information about MDOP.\n\n9\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.560\nBut one of the things it's lacking,\nis more video content, and\n\n10\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.380\nit is something that,\nit does rear its head from time to time.\n\n11\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.190\nSo this going to be focused on anybody\nthat wants a little bit better of\n\n12\n00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.590\nan understanding of Microsoft's Enterprise\nsuite of technologies,\n\n13\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710\nknown as\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n14\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.370\nIt helps you to manage things\nlike the user experience.\n\n15\n00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.930\nFor instance, desktop applications, things\nlike virtualization, as well as managing\n\n16\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.820\na lot of the features that you'll find\ninside of your Windows environments.\n\n17\n00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790\nKeep in mind that the viewer\nis gonna be introduced to,\n\n18\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.220\nnot just a single technology.\n\n19\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.680\nI know we call this\nMicrosoft Desktop Optimization Pack,\n\n20\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.470\nbut keep in mind it could\nalso be renamed a toolkit,\n\n21\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.260\nbecause it has many different applications\nor products, all bundled into one.\n\n22\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.020\nFor instance, user experience\nvirtualization is gonna be one of those\n\n23\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.290\nthings that we'll be looking at,\nsometimes called UEV.\n\n24\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.640\nIt's a way that I can take settings,\nand I can virtualize them, and\n\n25\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.950\nhave those settings follow me\nwhen I go to different computers.\n\n26\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.330\nIt's a real handy tool.\n\n27\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.203\nThings like AppV.\n\n28\n00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:31.230\nMaybe you've heard of this.\n\n29\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.100\nThis is the Application Virtualization.\n\n30\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.510\nI need to virtualize an application,\nbut maybe I don't want to put it into\n\n31\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.200\na hypervisor, and, you know, virtualize\nthe whole entire operating system.\n\n32\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.990\nSo this is a good way that you could take\napplications, and in a more modular sense,\n\n33\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.660\nyou can virtualise each\nindividual one if you need to.\n\n34\n00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.533\nSome of the other topics that\nwe'll be looking at, is MBAM.\n\n35\n00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.641\nThat is, the Microsoft BitLocker,\nan administration and\n\n36\n00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.141\nmonitoring kit you can use.\n\n37\n00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:59.467\nIt's, maybe you've heard of BitLocker\ninside of the Windows operating system,\n\n38\n00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:03.975\nwell, BitLocker, unless you're in group\npolicy, is kind of a decentralized type of\n\n39\n00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:07.770\nmanagement system, and it's usually\non a computer to computer basis.\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.740\nBut what this does, the MBAM Software,\nis it allows you to scale up to\n\n41\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.170\nlarge enterprises, and\ncentrally manage BitLocker keys and\n\n42\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890\nBitLocker encryptions that are in\nyour Enterprise level environment.\n\n43\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.570\nWe'll look at another tool, that,\none of my personal favorites in the MDOP\n\n44\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.930\nplatform, is something known as\nthe Diagnostic and Recovery Toolkit.\n\n45\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.120\nAnd this is a great way that,\nlike it says,\n\n46\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.470\nyou can diagnose different problems that\nhappen inside of the Windows environment.\n\n47\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.230\nSo, we've got more than just that,\nbut keep in mind\n\n48\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.240\nthat some of the topics that you can see\ninside of the MDOP series coming up.\n\n49\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, is there any particular\nexam that's associated with this?\n\n50\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.700\nOr are we just really talking\nabout learning the skills itself?\n\n51\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.920\n&gt;&gt; I would say the latter's probably gonna\nbe true, we're gonna be looking more at\n\n52\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040\nthe skills that you need, and\njust kind of looking at the technology,\n\n53\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.660\nnot really exam-centric on this one,\nbut I will throw a word of caution.\n\n54\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080\nOne of the things that I've seen, and\nif you've taken previous Windows client\n\n55\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.260\ncertifications, MDOP sometimes\ndoes rear it's head on the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.000\nSo, while this isn't specific to any\ncertification, keep in mind any time\n\n57\n00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.910\nyou're managing a Windows 10 client\noperating system, if you're studying for\n\n58\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.260\nthat very certification,\nthis can help to expand your knowledge.\n\n59\n00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.955\nSo, if that's something you wanna\nknow a little bit more about,\n\n60\n00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:20.405\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack,\nstick around,\n\n61\n00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.589\ncuz we got a lot more to come.\n\n",
