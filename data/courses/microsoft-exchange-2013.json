2013.\n\n3\n00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:14.872\nWe've had a lot of request from viewers\nout there from people implementing their\n\n4\n00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.400\nown email systems and\nthey're choosing Microsoft Exchange.\n\n5\n00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.410\nThey want some help to be able to do that.\n\n6\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.640\nSo that's what this series\nis kinda built around.\n\n7\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.030\nNow we're using the exam objectives for\nthe 70-341 exam to\n\n8\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.410\nbuild this episode series, just to\nmake sure we cover all that content.\n\n9\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.140\nBecause it really is a great way\nto get introduced to the product,\n\n10\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140\nas well as to get it implemented\nquickly and reliably.\n\n11\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.140\nNow that means that we're gonna cover a\nlot of great stuff to get you exam ready,\n\n12\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.690\nbut from a practical sense\nwhat are we gonna cover?\n\n13\n00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.910\nWell, in this series we're going to take a\nlook at how to select the right edition of\n\n14\n00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050\nMicrosoft Exchange, how to get Exchange\ninstalled and have the right amount of\n\n15\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.060\nservers for your environment, get that\nnetwork design properly put in place.\n\n16\n00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.944\nHow to implement mailbox services, which\nis probably the most important part of\n\n17\n00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:58.890\nan email server is to\nbe able to send email.\n\n18\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.140\nBut also take a look\nat the calendaring and\n\n19\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.460\nother functionality that's\nbuilt inside of Exchange.\n\n20\n00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.660\nThere is a ton of power under\nthe hood of Exchange that makes it\n\n21\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.560\nfar more than an email server.\n\n22\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.660\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat all of that, right.\n\n23\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.790\nLet's take a look at the exam\nobjectives to get a look at some of\n\n24\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.080\nthe things we're gonna cover.\n\n25\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.690\nI said we were gonna build this\naround the 70-341 exam and\n\n26\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.610\nyou'll see that it breaks\nthings up into four categories.\n\n27\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.380\nInstalling and\nconfiguring the mailbox role, right.\n\n28\n00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.880\nThat's the email portion, right.\n\n29\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.610\nGetting email set up.\n\n30\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.246\nInstalling and\nconfiguring the client access role.\n\n31\n00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:35.770\nThat's getting POP3, IMAP4, the Outlook\nWeb App, getting those things configured,\n\n32\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.140\nas well as the full Microsoft Outlook\nclient and some of the advanced\n\n33\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.950\nfunctionality we get with it, seeing how\nto get those implemented and put in place.\n\n34\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.751\nThen we're going to move into\ninstalling and configuring transport.\n\n35\n00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.277\nNow, by transport we mean what\nhappens to our email while it moves\n\n36\n00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.440\nacross the network.\n\n37\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.879\nAnd that might sound pretty boring, but\nthis is where we do things like anti-spam,\n\n38\n00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.700\nanti-virus.\n\n39\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.270\nWe can do compliance or\n\n40\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.370\nregulatory compliance type rules where you\ndo email retention or redirecting email.\n\n41\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.470\nThere's a lot of stuff you can do\nto email while it's in transit.\n\n42\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.590\nIt might be really complex things or\nreally simple,\n\n43\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250\nlike sticking a footer on the bottom\nthat says, this is a private email,\n\n44\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.500\nplease do not disclose it,\nor something of that nature.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.880\nThere's a lot we can do there.\n\n46\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.880\nWe'll see how to manage our\nmessage queues, and so on.\n\n47\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.120\nAnd then we've got designing and\nmanaging an Exchange infrastructure.\n\n48\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.560\nWhen you start to build this out,\nyou'll find that small environments\n\n49\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.320\nhave very different needs\nfrom large environments.\n\n50\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.940\nIf you just have one Exchange\nadministrator and 20 mailboxes,\n\n51\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.900\nyou can have a really straightforward and\nsimple Exchange deployment.\n\n52\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.910\nBut if you have 50,000 users and\n\n53\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.080\nten Exchange administrators, well, now\nthings get a lot more complex and so we'll\n\n54\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.040\nlook at some of the functionality that's\nbuilt into Exchange that supports that.\n\n55\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.970\nSo, all in all,\n\n56\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.980\nit's gonna be a really good series\ncovering all the information you need.\n\n57\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.400\nIf you wanna get certified, great.\n\n58\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.240\nWe're gonna cover all the objectives.\n\n59\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.412\nIf you're not interested in getting\ncertified, that's fine too.\n\n60\n00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:56.980\nWe're gonna show you what you\nneed to know about Exchange to\n\n61\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.750\nget it deployed in your environment,\nand to be able to take\n\n62\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.990\nadvantage of the really cool features\nthat are new in Exchange 2013.\n\n63\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.960\nSo, if that sounds interesting to you,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n64\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.456\nStay tuned, we've got\nMicrosoft Exchange 2013 coming up next.\n\n65\n00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:17.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
